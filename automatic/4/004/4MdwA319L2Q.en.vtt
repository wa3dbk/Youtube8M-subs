00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
abstract thinking is a really wonderful

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.430 
abstract thinking is a really wonderful
art<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.529> be<00:00:04.650> able<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.040> learn<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.990> the<00:00:06.990> ability

to do abstract thinking us one of the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.620 
to do abstract thinking us one of the
things<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.260> separates<00:00:10.889> us<00:00:11.160> from<00:00:11.219> lower<00:00:12.000> art

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
things that separates us from lower art

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.849 
things that separates us from lower art
forms<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:14.009> if<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.670> look<00:00:15.000> at<00:00:15.240> art<00:00:15.619> if<00:00:16.619> you're

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
forms and if you look at art if you're

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.160 
forms and if you look at art if you're
an<00:00:17.010> artist<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:18.060> ability<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.539> think<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.080> an

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
an artist the ability to think in an

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.849 
an artist the ability to think in an
abstract<00:00:19.500> way<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.090> picture<00:00:21.170> something<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
abstract way to picture something like a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.839 
abstract way to picture something like a
scene<00:00:23.630> a<00:00:24.740> beautiful<00:00:25.740> lake<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.340> something<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
scene a beautiful lake or something and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.689 
scene a beautiful lake or something and
then<00:00:27.349> be<00:00:28.349> able<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> come<00:00:28.769> up<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:29.039> an<00:00:29.160> abstract

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
then be able to come up with an abstract

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.370 
then be able to come up with an abstract
painting<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.149> creative<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.020> very

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
painting of that is so creative and very

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.280 
painting of that is so creative and very
artistic<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.329> then<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.540> different<00:00:37.110> ways

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
artistic and then in different ways

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.600 
artistic and then in different ways
we're<00:00:37.620> able<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.190> use<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.420> abstract<00:00:40.020> thinking

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
we're able to use that abstract thinking

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.979 
we're able to use that abstract thinking
in<00:00:41.610> technology<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:44.180> creating<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> things

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
in technology in creating all the things

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.729 
in technology in creating all the things
that<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.620> around<00:00:46.890> us<00:00:47.750> all<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> creativity

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that we see around us all of creativity

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.520 
that we see around us all of creativity
seems<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.820> based<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.390> abstract<00:00:51.930> thinking

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
seems to be based on abstract thinking

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.770 
seems to be based on abstract thinking
the<00:00:52.620> ability<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> look<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.520> something<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.180> say

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the ability to look at something and say

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.939 
the ability to look at something and say
hmmm<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:57.239> bird<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.199> fly<00:00:58.230> through<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> air

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
hmmm if a bird can fly through the air

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.490 
hmmm if a bird can fly through the air
why<00:00:59.850> can't<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.390> man's<00:01:00.660> life<00:01:00.960> through<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> air

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
why can't a man's life through the air

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.959 
why can't a man's life through the air
and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> start<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> think

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and then as you start to think

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.329 
and then as you start to think
abstractly<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.199> look<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
abstractly and you look and you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
abstractly and you look and you
extrapolate<00:01:05.850> from<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.950> different

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
extrapolate from that different

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520 
extrapolate from that different
methodologies<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.450> come<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.170> wonderful

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
methodologies you come up with wonderful

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.700 
methodologies you come up with wonderful
inventions<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.780> problem<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> abstract

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
inventions the problem with the abstract

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
inventions the problem with the abstract
thinking<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> tends<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> take<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.570> of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
thinking as it tends to take you out of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.890 
thinking as it tends to take you out of
the<00:01:15.780> present<00:01:16.229> moment<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:18.030> guess<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the present moment and I guess in the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.160 
the present moment and I guess in the
awakening<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.900> today<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
awakening that's going on today of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.570 
awakening that's going on today of
course<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.530> been<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> long

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
course it's been going on for a long

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.210 
course it's been going on for a long
time<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.290> probably<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> media

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
time but probably because of the media

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.280 
time but probably because of the media
and<00:01:26.430> even<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> ability<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.840> things<00:01:28.049> like

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and even the ability to do things like

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.090 
and even the ability to do things like
this<00:01:28.590> we're<00:01:29.460> able<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.180> share<00:01:31.100> experiences

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
this we're able to share experiences

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.270 
this we're able to share experiences
more<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:32.909> about<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:34.020> living<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.189> the

more and more about how living in the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
more and more about how living in the
present<00:01:35.700> moment<00:01:35.729> being<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> present

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
present moment being in the present

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.090 
present moment being in the present
moment<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.470> add<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.420> your<00:01:39.509> life<00:01:40.100> well

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
how did it get taken away well it got

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120 
how did it get taken away well it got
taken<00:01:42.689> away<00:01:42.930> through<00:01:43.229> abstract<00:01:43.740> thinking

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
taken away through abstract thinking

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.550 
taken away through abstract thinking
unfortunately<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> problem

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
unfortunately and that's the problem

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.460 
unfortunately and that's the problem
with<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.579> art<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.030> abstract<00:01:48.570> thinking<00:01:48.990> we

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
with the art of abstract thinking we

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.280 
with the art of abstract thinking we
take<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> too<00:01:49.950> far<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:51.840> having<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
take it too far so if I'm having a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
take it too far so if I'm having a
problem<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:52.829> wife<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.490> she<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.820> are

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
problem with my wife and she and I are

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.330 
problem with my wife and she and I are
having<00:01:54.060> an<00:01:54.240> argument<00:01:54.860> instead<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.100> being

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
having an argument instead of just being

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.300 
having an argument instead of just being
present<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.600> feeling<00:01:58.530> what's<00:01:58.890> going<00:01:59.159> on

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
present and feeling what's going on

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.569 
present and feeling what's going on
inside<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.729> me<00:01:59.869> feeling<00:02:00.869> my<00:02:01.380> heart<00:02:01.710> racing<00:02:02.219> and

inside of me feeling my heart racing and
the<00:02:03.000> stories<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.780> around<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.170> my

and all that sort of thing when I'm

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.290 
and all that sort of thing when I'm
reacting<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:07.380> her<00:02:07.650> this<00:02:08.250> whole<00:02:08.550> virtual

reacting to her this whole virtual

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.500 
reacting to her this whole virtual
reality<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.229> kicking<00:02:10.680> off<00:02:10.830> inside<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.550> me<00:02:11.730> very

abstract<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:14.640> know<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> whole<00:02:15.000> concept<00:02:15.210> of

abstract you know the whole concept of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.520 
abstract you know the whole concept of
abstract<00:02:16.770> means<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:18.000> we're<00:02:18.150> taking<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:19.320> is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
abstract means that we're taking what is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.370 
abstract means that we're taking what is
and<00:02:19.950> we're<00:02:20.660> abstracting<00:02:21.660> some<00:02:22.020> kind<00:02:22.260> of

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
and we're abstracting some kind of

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.130 
and we're abstracting some kind of
meaning<00:02:22.830> from<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.150> derivative<00:02:24.480> and

in<00:02:25.980> derivative<00:02:26.820> thinking<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.570> takes<00:02:27.780> us<00:02:27.930> away

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
in derivative thinking it takes us away

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
abstractions in my abstract thinking I

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.870 
abstractions in my abstract thinking I
look<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.680> what<00:03:13.830> she<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.010> said<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.519> me<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.820> I

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
look at what she just said to me and I

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.850 
look at what she just said to me and I
say<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.300> can't<00:03:15.540> say<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.050> me<00:03:16.200> say<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.739> in

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
say we can't say that to me say this in

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.670 
say we can't say that to me say this in
my<00:03:16.890> life<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.519> react<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.420> her<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.170> jump<00:03:19.620> back

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
my life I react to her and I jump back

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.340 
my life I react to her and I jump back
with<00:03:20.160> some<00:03:20.570> retort<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.690> pushes<00:03:22.200> her<00:03:22.320> buttons

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
with some retort that pushes her buttons

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.110 
with some retort that pushes her buttons
and<00:03:22.860> now<00:03:22.950> we're<00:03:23.130> both<00:03:23.250> pushing<00:03:23.580> each<00:03:23.820> other's

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and now we're both pushing each other's

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.090 
and now we're both pushing each other's
buttons<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.690> where<00:03:24.840> do<00:03:24.930> we<00:03:25.019> go<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:25.890> you've

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
buttons and where do we go if you've

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.620 
buttons and where do we go if you've
ever<00:03:26.250> gotten<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.640> one<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.910> those<00:03:27.000> arguments

I'm<00:05:08.200> abstracting<00:05:09.200> maybe<00:05:09.410> that<00:05:09.710> she's<00:05:10.160> acting

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
I'm abstracting maybe that she's acting

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.550 
I'm abstracting maybe that she's acting

about how at the inference layer of

abstraction we create stories and those

abstraction we create stories and those

stories are what carry us into a world

being<00:05:36.590> present<00:05:37.100> we<00:05:37.220> get<00:05:37.370> swept<00:05:37.970> away<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:39.040> of

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
being present we get swept away and of

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.920 
being present we get swept away and of
course<00:05:40.280> the<00:05:40.400> ego<00:05:40.669> just<00:05:40.850> loves<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.270> be<00:05:41.390> swept

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
course the ego just loves to be swept

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.600 
course the ego just loves to be swept
away<00:05:42.110> because<00:05:42.590> it<00:05:42.740> feels<00:05:43.010> like<00:05:43.130> it's<00:05:43.400> in

away because it feels like it's in

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.190 
away because it feels like it's in
control<00:05:44.060> and<00:05:44.240> it's<00:05:44.360> getting<00:05:44.630> what<00:05:44.780> it<00:05:44.870> wants

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
control and it's getting what it wants

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.380 
control and it's getting what it wants
and<00:05:45.290> actually<00:05:45.680> what<00:05:45.800> it's<00:05:45.919> doing<00:05:46.130> and

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
and actually what it's doing and

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.780 
and actually what it's doing and
sabotaging<00:05:47.390> my<00:05:47.540> life<00:05:47.870> I<00:05:48.400> tend<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.460> look<00:05:49.580> at<00:05:49.700> the

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
sabotaging my life I tend to look at the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
sabotaging my life I tend to look at the
ego<00:05:50.150> as<00:05:50.360> as<00:05:51.070> sort<00:05:52.070> of<00:05:52.130> this<00:05:52.880> made-up<00:05:53.240> being

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
ego as as sort of this made-up being

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.470 
ego as as sort of this made-up being
that<00:05:54.230> I<00:05:54.350> tend<00:05:54.590> to<00:05:54.650> call<00:05:54.860> me<00:05:55.100> but<00:05:55.730> it<00:05:56.120> doesn't

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
that I tend to call me but it doesn't

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.120 
that I tend to call me but it doesn't
really<00:05:56.600> represent<00:05:56.840> me<00:05:57.290> very<00:05:57.560> well<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.040> it

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
really represent me very well and it

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.060 
really represent me very well and it
often<00:05:58.540> sabotages<00:05:59.540> my<00:05:59.720> life<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:00.320> I<00:06:00.530> have<00:06:00.800> to<00:06:00.950> be

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
often sabotages my life so I have to be

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.220 
often sabotages my life so I have to be
present<00:06:01.640> in<00:06:01.790> order<00:06:02.060> to<00:06:02.180> see<00:06:02.540> this<00:06:02.720> happening

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
present in order to see this happening

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.830 
present in order to see this happening
in<00:06:03.380> real<00:06:03.560> time<00:06:03.760> otherwise<00:06:04.760> it'll<00:06:05.390> carry<00:06:05.660> me

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
in real time otherwise it'll carry me

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.630 
in real time otherwise it'll carry me
away<00:06:05.930> into<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.470> world<00:06:06.650> of<00:06:06.740> abstraction<00:06:07.250> and

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
away into the world of abstraction and

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.990 
away into the world of abstraction and
so<00:06:08.330> Peter<00:06:08.990> Sangay<00:06:09.560> who<00:06:10.100> wrote<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:10.730> book<00:06:10.880> the

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
so Peter Sangay who wrote the book the

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.350 
so Peter Sangay who wrote the book the
fifth<00:06:11.210> discipline<00:06:12.040> took<00:06:13.040> the<00:06:13.520> concepts<00:06:14.120> from

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
fifth discipline took the concepts from

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.360 
fifth discipline took the concepts from
core<00:06:14.810> zips<00:06:15.080> key<00:06:15.290> a<00:06:15.320> little<00:06:15.650> further<00:06:15.890> and<00:06:16.250> he

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
core zips key a little further and he

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.640 
core zips key a little further and he
created<00:06:16.760> what<00:06:17.030> he<00:06:17.060> calls<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.660> ladder<00:06:17.930> of

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
created what he calls the ladder of

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.400 
created what he calls the ladder of
abstraction<00:06:19.030> and<00:06:20.030> it's<00:06:20.600> like<00:06:20.780> we<00:06:20.960> go<00:06:21.110> up<00:06:21.290> a

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
abstraction and it's like we go up a

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.959 
abstraction and it's like we go up a
ladder<00:06:21.560> as<00:06:21.890> we<00:06:22.100> as<00:06:22.580> our<00:06:22.970> thinking<00:06:23.450> races

out<00:06:25.360> of<00:06:25.569> the<00:06:25.629> present<00:06:26.049> moment<00:06:26.199> into<00:06:27.129> these

frameworks we take little bits of
information<00:06:32.619> about<00:06:32.979> what's<00:06:33.309> going<00:06:33.579> on<00:06:33.729> but<00:06:33.909> we

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:34.029 
information about what's going on but we

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:36.179 
information about what's going on but we
make<00:06:34.239> ups<00:06:34.419> we<00:06:35.139> make<00:06:35.319> assumptions<00:06:35.679> we<00:06:36.009> make

inferences and each inference we make

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:40.850 
inferences and each inference we make
carries<00:06:39.309> us<00:06:39.459> further<00:06:39.699> up<00:06:39.939> the<00:06:40.089> ladder

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
carries us further up the ladder

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.409 
carries us further up the ladder
well<00:06:41.860> that<00:06:42.339> further<00:06:42.639> up<00:06:42.819> the<00:06:42.909> ladder<00:06:43.059> is

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
well that further up the ladder is

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.929 
well that further up the ladder is
further<00:06:43.779> away<00:06:44.049> from<00:06:44.079> the<00:06:44.319> present<00:06:44.709> moment<00:06:45.069> and

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:45.939 
further away from the present moment and

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.959 
further away from the present moment and
so<00:06:46.449> we<00:06:46.809> find<00:06:47.139> ourselves<00:06:47.349> in<00:06:48.039> a<00:06:48.579> virtual

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:48.969 
so we find ourselves in a virtual

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.059 
so we find ourselves in a virtual
reality<00:06:49.029> world<00:06:49.509> that<00:06:49.929> has<00:06:50.110> very<00:06:50.409> little<00:06:50.499> to<00:06:50.860> do

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069 
reality world that has very little to do

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:52.379 
reality world that has very little to do
with<00:06:51.099> this<00:06:51.429> one<00:06:51.639> now<00:06:51.789> if<00:06:52.149> you're

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389 
with this one now if you're

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.169 
with this one now if you're
schizophrenic<00:06:52.919> you<00:06:53.919> realize<00:06:54.339> you've<00:06:54.639> really

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:55.179 
schizophrenic you realize you've really

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:57.209 
schizophrenic you realize you've really
gone<00:06:55.329> up<00:06:55.569> the<00:06:55.689> ladder<00:06:55.719> of<00:06:56.169> abstraction<00:06:56.289> a<00:06:57.009> long

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
gone up the ladder of abstraction a long

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:59.609 
gone up the ladder of abstraction a long
way<00:06:57.489> because<00:06:58.449> every<00:06:59.110> little<00:06:59.289> thing<00:06:59.589> that

00:06:59.609 --> 00:06:59.619 
way because every little thing that

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.729 
way because every little thing that
happens<00:07:00.249> you<00:07:01.029> look<00:07:01.360> at<00:07:01.539> it<00:07:01.719> and<00:07:01.929> you<00:07:02.049> interpret

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:02.739 
happens you look at it and you interpret

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:04.259 
happens you look at it and you interpret
it<00:07:02.860> as<00:07:03.099> smooth<00:07:03.429> well<00:07:03.669> that<00:07:03.789> could<00:07:03.939> be<00:07:04.059> true

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:04.269 
it as smooth well that could be true

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:05.609 
it as smooth well that could be true
well<00:07:04.479> if<00:07:04.569> this<00:07:04.689> is<00:07:04.869> true<00:07:04.899> that<00:07:05.199> could<00:07:05.349> be<00:07:05.409> true

00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:05.619 
well if this is true that could be true

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:07.079 
well if this is true that could be true
so<00:07:05.829> now<00:07:05.979> people<00:07:06.189> are<00:07:06.369> talking<00:07:06.729> to<00:07:06.789> me<00:07:06.939> out<00:07:07.059> of

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:07.089 
so now people are talking to me out of

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.529 
so now people are talking to me out of
the<00:07:07.209> TV<00:07:07.449> and<00:07:07.959> there's<00:07:08.829> plots<00:07:09.819> and<00:07:10.269> things

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:10.539 
the TV and there's plots and things

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:14.579 
the TV and there's plots and things
going<00:07:10.749> on<00:07:10.959> and<00:07:11.739> these<00:07:12.449> abstractions<00:07:13.449> I<00:07:13.959> have

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:14.589 
going on and these abstractions I have

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:17.939 
going on and these abstractions I have
no<00:07:15.039> ability<00:07:15.549> to<00:07:16.419> discern<00:07:16.929> whether<00:07:17.679> they're

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949 
no ability to discern whether they're

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.129 
no ability to discern whether they're
true<00:07:18.189> or<00:07:18.219> not<00:07:18.519> I<00:07:18.789> just<00:07:18.879> assume<00:07:19.809> that<00:07:19.959> they're

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139 
true or not I just assume that they're

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.809 
true or not I just assume that they're
true<00:07:20.469> and<00:07:20.739> we<00:07:21.099> would<00:07:21.249> call<00:07:21.459> this<00:07:21.579> person

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:21.819 
true and we would call this person

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.489 
true and we would call this person
schizophrenic<00:07:22.569> and<00:07:22.779> maybe<00:07:22.989> we<00:07:23.169> would<00:07:23.319> lock

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:23.499 
schizophrenic and maybe we would lock

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.579 
schizophrenic and maybe we would lock
them<00:07:23.739> up<00:07:23.860> but<00:07:24.099> unfortunately<00:07:24.959> the<00:07:25.959> same<00:07:26.259> thing

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:26.589 
them up but unfortunately the same thing

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:28.379 
them up but unfortunately the same thing
happens<00:07:26.979> to<00:07:27.039> all<00:07:27.279> of<00:07:27.309> us<00:07:27.549> and<00:07:27.759> were<00:07:27.849> not<00:07:28.059> locked

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:28.389 
happens to all of us and were not locked

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.149 
happens to all of us and were not locked
up<00:07:28.629> and<00:07:28.899> we're<00:07:29.019> not<00:07:29.050> schizophrenic<00:07:29.889> we're

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:30.159 
up and we're not schizophrenic we're

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.869 
up and we're not schizophrenic we're
quote<00:07:30.459> normal<00:07:30.989> but<00:07:31.989> normal<00:07:32.409> people<00:07:32.919> live<00:07:33.429> in

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:48.389 
animals are unable to do has gotten us
into<00:07:45.639> the<00:07:45.879> fix<00:07:46.149> that<00:07:46.449> were<00:07:46.629> in<00:07:46.899> that<00:07:47.229> keeps<00:07:48.129> us

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:48.399 
into the fix that were in that keeps us

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.669 
into the fix that were in that keeps us
from<00:07:48.429> really<00:07:49.059> enjoying<00:07:49.509> life<00:07:49.839> in<00:07:50.110> the<00:07:50.229> present

from really enjoying life in the present

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:53.909 
from really enjoying life in the present
moment<00:07:51.059> because<00:07:52.059> we<00:07:52.209> don't<00:07:52.419> even<00:07:52.569> have<00:07:53.079> the

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:59.939 
ability to sense the present moment
anymore<00:07:57.789> the<00:07:58.209> abstraction<00:07:58.719> has<00:07:59.439> more<00:07:59.799> of<00:07:59.889> a

00:07:59.939 --> 00:07:59.949 
anymore the abstraction has more of a

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:03.669 
concrete feeling to us then the present

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:05.789 
concrete feeling to us then the present
moment<00:08:03.909> does<00:08:04.449> and<00:08:04.749> what's<00:08:04.899> really<00:08:05.110> happening

00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:05.799 
moment does and what's really happening

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:08.249 
moment does and what's really happening
and<00:08:06.249> so<00:08:06.669> as<00:08:06.939> it<00:08:07.360> becomes<00:08:07.749> more<00:08:08.049> and<00:08:08.169> more

00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:08.259 
and so as it becomes more and more

and so as it becomes more and more
concrete<00:08:09.009> and<00:08:09.369> becomes<00:08:09.939> the<00:08:10.209> reality<00:08:10.360> of<00:08:10.839> our
