 that layer recites with only 24 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.010
 centimeters high by 3 centimeters 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.319

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.280

 that our computer works at 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.810
 perfection let's see the next 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.680
 configuration the configuration that I have 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.010
 me in my hp here we can see the de nador 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.850
 I have a monitor connected dvi and the other 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.850
 it was hdmi 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.650
 already working with windows 8 there is a 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.759
 alpha version works 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.759
 to perfection 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.310
 as we can see here 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.190
 I work among my monitors 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:53.290
 this helps me increase 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.290
 radically productivity 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.130
 As I tell you, there are simply 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:03.039
 connect the usb port of the dynamo to 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.069
 I have connected my iphone and a 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:11.190
 bluetooth on the opposite side with 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:14.150
 USB 3.0 ports but it is not necessary 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.360
 obviously it is compatible with 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.710
 with all the devices that are two 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.890
 points this is my review 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.900
 and placed it as an excellent product 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:30.960
 highly recommended there is no type of the 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.800
 between monitors everything works 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.800
 perfectly 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.500
 can see here 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.669
 all my applications 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.669
 games 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.500
 This monitor is connected via usb as 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.750
 can see 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.940
 because the game starts so that 20 does not 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.740
 there is not a type d 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.740
 relay like that 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.300
 If I leave you I have 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.280
 a software installed for windows 7 with 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.980
 many more functions for this type of 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.200
 Sometimes we have more than one monitor 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.150
 if they come to occupy me they ask me to 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.040
 pass it display fusion 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.680
 if they come to occupy it, I will review the 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.080
 from the same system you hope that you 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.030
 I liked it 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.590
 Any questions or leave your comments 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.590
 in the aic and its clients 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.380
 compatible with windows 8 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:15.110
 and good this was the review of dayna 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:17.570
 toshiba 3.0 dock the best option if 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.030
 you want to connect a second and even 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.710
 a third monitor using usb in the 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.470
 description I will leave the link of the 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:27.490
