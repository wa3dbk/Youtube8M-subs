00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
like I guess her dad was also in a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.649 
like I guess her dad was also in a
company<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.640> that's<00:02:02.790> how<00:02:03.000> she<00:02:03.060> got<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> phone

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.419 
company and that's how she got the phone
or<00:02:03.990> some<00:02:04.140> shit<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:06.409> son<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.590> history<00:02:08.009> so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
or some shit and the son like history so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.690 
or some shit and the son like history so
apparently<00:02:08.970> um<00:02:09.560> Shogo<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.950> Canole<00:02:11.370> were

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
apparently um Shogo and Canole were

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.610 
apparently um Shogo and Canole were
actually<00:02:12.239> childhood<00:02:12.599> friends<00:02:12.989> there

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
actually childhood friends there

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.180 
actually childhood friends there
dad's<00:02:14.010> were<00:02:14.310> friends<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.090> they<00:02:15.300> hung<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.629> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
dad's were friends so they hung out and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.330 
dad's were friends so they hung out and
that<00:02:17.190> she<00:02:17.870> she<00:02:18.870> was<00:02:18.989> she<00:02:19.470> pretty<00:02:19.650> much<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
that she she was she pretty much was the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.030 
that she she was she pretty much was the
reason<00:02:20.849> or<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> think<00:02:21.629> maybe<00:02:21.900> because<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.860> guess

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
reason or I think maybe because I guess

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.830 
reason or I think maybe because I guess
it's<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:23.519> 100%<00:02:23.849> but<00:02:24.180> he<00:02:24.360> probably<00:02:24.540> got<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
it's not 100% but he probably got the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.290 
it's not 100% but he probably got the
scar<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.560> her<00:02:25.709> cuz<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> past<00:02:26.970> like

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
scar because of her cuz in the past like

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.869 
scar because of her cuz in the past like
history<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.349> guess<00:02:28.920> when<00:02:29.040> she<00:02:29.160> got<00:02:29.459> hit<00:02:29.700> by<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
history I guess when she got hit by the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.339 
history I guess when she got hit by the
car<00:02:30.060> almost<00:02:30.330> got<00:02:30.569> hit<00:02:30.720> by<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> truck<00:02:31.170> before

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
car almost got hit by the truck before

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.140 
car almost got hit by the truck before
that<00:02:31.980> was<00:02:32.069> just<00:02:32.250> history<00:02:32.519> repeating<00:02:33.060> itself

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
that was just history repeating itself

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.400 
that was just history repeating itself
cuz<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:36.019> previously<00:02:37.019> when<00:02:37.230> they<00:02:37.349> were

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
cuz like previously when they were

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.410 
cuz like previously when they were
little<00:02:37.739> she<00:02:38.069> almost<00:02:38.670> got<00:02:38.910> hit<00:02:39.090> by<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.269> car

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
little she almost got hit by this car

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.750 
little she almost got hit by this car

push her out of the way because well
Shogo<00:02:53.519> I<00:02:53.549> guess<00:02:53.819> has<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.450> power<00:02:54.690> even<00:02:54.959> at

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
Shogo I guess has that power even at

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.759 
Shogo I guess has that power even at
youth<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.880> then<00:02:57.480> he<00:02:57.630> hit<00:02:57.780> his<00:02:57.900> head<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.349> then

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
youth and then he hit his head and then

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.699 
youth and then he hit his head and then
I<00:02:59.040> guess<00:02:59.190> he<00:02:59.340> has<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.670> scar<00:02:59.879> now<00:03:00.590> which<00:03:01.590> is

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
I guess he has that scar now which is

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.780 
I guess he has that scar now which is
still<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> little<00:03:02.040> odd<00:03:02.220> for<00:03:02.250> me<00:03:02.549> because<00:03:02.700> I

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
still a little odd for me because I

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.880 
still a little odd for me because I
thought<00:03:02.970> maybe<00:03:03.299> he<00:03:03.510> had<00:03:03.629> something<00:03:03.840> sharp<00:03:04.200> if

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
thought maybe he had something sharp if

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.830 
thought maybe he had something sharp if
he<00:03:05.099> hit<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.459> flat<00:03:05.700> concrete<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.299> guess<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.690> gave

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
he hit the flat concrete I guess it gave

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.220 
he hit the flat concrete I guess it gave
him<00:03:07.019> like<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.940> slash<00:03:08.940> scar<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.930> Harry

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
him like a slash scar like a Harry

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.330

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.990 
they knew his parents or his dad but
they<00:04:52.500> didn't<00:04:52.950> grow<00:04:53.190> into<00:04:53.430> friends<00:04:53.880> or

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000

anything<00:04:54.210> nothing<00:04:54.570> like<00:04:54.870> important<00:04:55.500> so<00:04:56.010> she

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
anything nothing like important so she

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.740 
anything nothing like important so she
didn't<00:04:56.670> even<00:04:56.820> know<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.270> day<00:04:57.390> of<00:04:57.510> his<00:04:57.570> funeral

well whatever shit but other than that
like<00:05:04.710> I<00:05:05.100> guess<00:05:05.400> another<00:05:05.670> idea<00:05:06.000> is<00:05:06.060> that<00:05:06.210> Shogo

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
like I guess another idea is that Shogo

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.280 
like I guess another idea is that Shogo
might<00:05:07.650> have<00:05:07.860> met<00:05:08.130> more<00:05:08.370> people<00:05:08.400> or<00:05:09.050> maybe<00:05:10.050> he's

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
might have met more people or maybe he's

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.540 
might have met more people or maybe he's
just<00:05:10.350> forgetting<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.890> lot<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.130> shit<00:05:11.340> either
