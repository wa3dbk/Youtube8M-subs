isometric view that I'm looking for I
want<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> click<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.719> button<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.379> which

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
want to click on this button here which

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.900 
want to click on this button here which
is<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.890> change<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.460> view<00:00:47.670> orientation<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
is to change the view orientation and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.270 
is to change the view orientation and
once<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:54.289> from<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:56.039> kind

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
once I do that from in here I can kind

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.779 
once I do that from in here I can kind
of<00:00:56.399> rotate<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.000> close<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.719> what<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.699> want<00:00:59.699> and

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
of rotate it close to what I want and

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.590 
of rotate it close to what I want and
then<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.629> cube<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.199> top<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
then I can use the cube up top here and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
then I can use the cube up top here and
get<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> correct<00:01:06.930> isometric<00:01:07.799> view<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.070> once

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
get the correct isometric view and once

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
get the correct isometric view and once
I<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> hit<00:01:09.479> finish<00:01:09.750> custom

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
I have it I'm going to hit finish custom

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.289 
I have it I'm going to hit finish custom
view<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> shows<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.850> there

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

this<00:01:48.920> entire<00:01:49.810> drawing<00:01:50.810> today<00:01:51.640> but<00:01:52.640> once<00:01:52.820> we

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
this entire drawing today but once we

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.970 
this entire drawing today but once we
have<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.330> view<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:54.620> can<00:01:54.710> go<00:01:54.800> over<00:01:54.950> to

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
have the view in we can go over to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.890 
have the view in we can go over to
annotate<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:56.470> then<00:01:57.470> parts<00:01:58.070> list<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.720> we<00:01:59.720> need

annotate and then parts list and we need

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.660 
annotate and then parts list and we need
to<00:02:00.020> select<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.740> have<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:01.100> had<00:02:01.250> our<00:02:01.400> view

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
to select and have we had our view

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.969 
to select and have we had our view
selected<00:02:02.210> here<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.650> correct

bottom<00:02:29.209> left<00:02:29.240> okay<00:02:29.780> wherever<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.230> fits<00:02:30.470> best

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
bottom left okay wherever it fits best

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.000 
bottom left okay wherever it fits best
with<00:02:30.920> your<00:02:31.190> particular<00:02:31.760> model<00:02:32.410> alright<00:02:33.410> so

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
with your particular model alright so

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.949 
with your particular model alright so
that<00:02:34.160> was<00:02:34.190> easy<00:02:34.459> enough<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.330> got<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.690> part

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
that was easy enough so it got the part

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.840 
that was easy enough so it got the part
number<00:02:36.430> from<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.470> name<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.370> named<00:02:40.640> your

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
number from the name that you named your

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.690 
number from the name that you named your
part<00:02:41.180> when<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:41.900> created<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:43.100> quantity<00:02:43.580> in

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
part when you created it the quantity in

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.729 
part when you created it the quantity in
the<00:02:43.850> assembly<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.480> then<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.230> assigned<00:02:45.560> an

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
the assembly and then it assigned an

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.220 
the assembly and then it assigned an
item<00:02:46.190> number<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:47.180> last<00:02:47.480> column<00:02:47.780> I'm<00:02:48.110> going

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
item number this last column I'm going

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.790 
item number this last column I'm going
to<00:02:48.320> change<00:02:48.709> in<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.190> your<00:02:49.370> notebooks<00:02:50.800> it's

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
to change in in your notebooks it's

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.449 
to change in in your notebooks it's
looking<00:02:52.160> for<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.400> material<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.360> overall

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
looking for the material and the overall

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.400 
looking for the material and the overall
size<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.760> those<00:02:55.850> materials<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:57.110> I'm<00:02:57.200> going<00:02:57.350> to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
size of those materials so I'm going to

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.080 
size of those materials so I'm going to
right<00:02:57.590> click<00:02:57.850> on<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.150> title<00:02:59.330> block<00:02:59.660> and<00:03:01.090> edit

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
the parts list okay then we get this

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.000 
the parts list okay then we get this
window<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.820> come<00:03:05.090> up<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.690> we<00:03:06.350> can<00:03:06.470> change<00:03:06.709> just

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
window to come up and we can change just

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.590 
window to come up and we can change just
about<00:03:07.280> everything<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:08.239> now<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.420> one

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
about everything in here now the one

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.259 
about everything in here now the one
thing<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.930> want<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.200> note<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.730> we<00:03:10.730> have<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.940> sub

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
thing I want to note is we have a sub

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.860 
thing I want to note is we have a sub
assembly<00:03:12.130> which<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:14.030> wheel<00:03:14.269> so<00:03:14.600> if<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.750> hit

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
assembly which is the wheel so if I hit

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.410 
assembly which is the wheel so if I hit
the<00:03:14.959> little<00:03:15.110> plus<00:03:15.230> sign<00:03:15.769> there<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:17.090> shows<00:03:17.360> that

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
the little plus sign there it shows that

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.509 
the little plus sign there it shows that
that<00:03:17.780> sub<00:03:18.110> assembly<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.769> made<00:03:19.010> up<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
that sub assembly is made up of the

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.670 
that sub assembly is made up of the
wheel<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.180> tire<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:20.870> my<00:03:20.989> parts<00:03:21.320> list<00:03:21.560> I

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
wheel and the tire so in my parts list I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.979 
wheel and the tire so in my parts list I
would<00:03:21.860> want<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.130> show<00:03:22.310> both<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.910> those<00:03:23.090> because

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
would want to show both of those because

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.449 
would want to show both of those because
anyone<00:03:24.350> else<00:03:24.500> looking<00:03:24.830> at<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.160> wouldn't

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
anyone else looking at this wouldn't

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.729 
anyone else looking at this wouldn't
really<00:03:25.580> know<00:03:26.080> whether<00:03:27.080> that's<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.500> sub

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
really know whether that's a sub

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.680 
really know whether that's a sub
assembly<00:03:28.220> or<00:03:28.370> not<00:03:28.549> they<00:03:28.760> might<00:03:28.910> think<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.299> it

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
assembly or not they might think that it

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.230 
assembly or not they might think that it
is<00:03:29.870> just<00:03:30.080> one<00:03:30.200> part<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.540> when<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:32.930> do<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.470> can

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
is just one part so when I do that I can

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.620 
is just one part so when I do that I can
turn<00:03:35.240> off<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.540> visibility<00:03:35.930> for<00:03:36.740> it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
turn off the visibility for it

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.930 
turn off the visibility for it
and<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:39.610> need<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.940> change<00:03:40.240> my<00:03:41.310> item<00:03:42.310> numbers<00:03:42.700> now

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
and I need to change my item numbers now

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.880 
and I need to change my item numbers now
to<00:03:43.000> match<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:47.050> I'm<00:03:47.110> just<00:03:47.290> going<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:47.650> down

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
to match so I'm just going to go down

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.700 
to match so I'm just going to go down
through<00:03:48.220> here<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:51.630> change<00:03:52.630> them<00:03:52.960> okay<00:03:53.650> so

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
through here and change them okay so

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.950 
through here and change them okay so
that<00:03:54.010> they're<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.790> numerical<00:03:55.330> order<00:03:55.450> remember

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
that they're in numerical order remember

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.510 
that they're in numerical order remember
this<00:03:56.080> one<00:03:56.290> won't<00:03:56.530> be<00:03:56.620> seen<00:03:57.010> that's<00:03:57.310> why

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
this one won't be seen that's why

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.030 
this one won't be seen that's why
there's<00:03:57.730> two<00:03:57.970> number<00:03:58.270> 10s<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.680> now<00:03:59.830> that

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
there's two number 10s so now that

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.580 
there's two number 10s so now that
that's<00:04:00.190> done<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.520> can<00:04:00.730> hit<00:04:00.880> apply<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.590> and

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
that's done I can hit apply and and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.650 
that's done I can hit apply and and
check<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.160> out<00:04:03.280> okay<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:03.940> should<00:04:03.970> have<00:04:04.150> 15

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
check it out okay so you should have 15

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.070 
check it out okay so you should have 15
total<00:04:04.930> parts<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:07.030> change<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.540> title<00:04:07.780> of

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
total parts and to change the title of

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.880 
total parts and to change the title of
the<00:04:08.200> description<00:04:09.690> we<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.870> format<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.470> column

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
the description we can format the column

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.370 
the description we can format the column
and<00:04:12.070> then<00:04:12.940> in<00:04:13.270> here<00:04:13.600> we<00:04:13.630> can<00:04:13.930> change<00:04:14.140> the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
and then in here we can change the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.560 
and then in here we can change the
heading<00:04:14.710> for<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.970> would<00:04:16.180> like<00:04:16.390> to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
heading for it and I would like to

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:26.460 
heading for it and I would like to
change<00:04:16.840> it<00:04:17.080> to<00:04:17.550> material<00:04:19.890> width<00:04:21.480> x<00:04:22.480> height<00:04:25.470> x

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
change it to material width x height x

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.830 
change it to material width x height x
depth<00:04:28.830> alright<00:04:29.830> so<00:04:30.450> we're<00:04:31.450> going<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.630> have<00:04:31.720> to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
depth alright so we're going to have to

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.340 
depth alright so we're going to have to
manually<00:04:32.470> input<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.910> material<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.810> the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
manually input the material and the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.860 
manually input the material and the
overall<00:04:35.770> width<00:04:36.280> height<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.550> depth<00:04:37.000> for<00:04:37.810> each

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
overall width height and depth for each

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.250 
overall width height and depth for each
part<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.800> first<00:04:39.900> let's<00:04:40.900> go<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.110> the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
part so this first let's go to the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.650 
part so this first let's go to the
second<00:04:41.680> one<00:04:41.830> here<00:04:42.190> so<00:04:42.700> that's<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.120> socket

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
second one here so that's the socket

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.310 
second one here so that's the socket
it's<00:04:43.870> made<00:04:44.290> of<00:04:44.440> ABS<00:04:45.070> plastic<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:46.140> that's<00:04:47.140> our

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
it's made of ABS plastic so that's our

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.310 
it's made of ABS plastic so that's our
material<00:04:47.890> and<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:49.240> overall<00:04:49.660> size<00:04:49.990> we're

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
material and the overall size we're

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.430 
material and the overall size we're
going<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.500> put<00:04:50.710> in<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.950> fractional<00:04:51.580> number<00:04:53.670> and

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
going to put in a fractional number and

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.110 
going to put in a fractional number and
that's<00:04:56.440> two<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.890> half<00:04:57.070> by<00:04:57.370> one<00:04:58.740> by<00:04:59.740> one<00:05:00.250> and

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
that's two and a half by one by one and

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.210 
that's two and a half by one by one and
a<00:05:01.150> half<00:05:02.310> okay<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.870> takes<00:05:05.080> care<00:05:05.230> of<00:05:05.440> the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
a half okay so that takes care of the

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.300 
a half okay so that takes care of the
one<00:05:06.430> block<00:05:06.700> socket<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.770> let<00:05:08.890> me<00:05:08.950> speak<00:05:09.190> a

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
one block socket so so let me speak a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.030 
one block socket so so let me speak a
minute<00:05:09.580> about<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:10.510> sizes<00:05:11.110> here<00:05:11.380> so<00:05:11.650> for<00:05:11.950> the

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
minute about the sizes here so for the

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.100 
minute about the sizes here so for the
size<00:05:12.250> on<00:05:12.730> our<00:05:12.910> parts<00:05:13.330> list<00:05:13.600> we<00:05:13.780> want<00:05:13.900> the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
size on our parts list we want the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.520 
size on our parts list we want the
overall<00:05:15.000> maximum<00:05:16.000> size<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.630> in<00:05:17.110> most<00:05:17.290> cases

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
overall maximum size and in most cases

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.590 
overall maximum size and in most cases
it<00:05:18.040> can<00:05:18.250> just<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.520> fractional<00:05:19.150> because<00:05:19.450> this

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
it can just be fractional because this

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.910 
it can just be fractional because this
gives<00:05:19.810> whoever<00:05:20.200> is<00:05:20.320> going<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.530> build<00:05:20.710> this

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
gives whoever is going to build this

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.510 
gives whoever is going to build this
part<00:05:21.250> or<00:05:21.490> analyze<00:05:22.480> it<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:22.840> gives<00:05:22.990> them<00:05:23.370> just<00:05:24.370> a

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
part or analyze it it gives them just a

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.820 
part or analyze it it gives them just a
quick<00:05:24.760> reference<00:05:25.000> to<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.810> overall<00:05:26.230> size<00:05:26.530> of

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
quick reference to the overall size of

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.770 
quick reference to the overall size of
the<00:05:26.980> stock<00:05:27.250> they<00:05:27.490> would<00:05:27.640> need<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.000> the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
the stock they would need and the

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.720 
the stock they would need and the
material<00:05:29.410> okay<00:05:30.070> so<00:05:30.130> that's<00:05:30.340> kind<00:05:30.490> of<00:05:30.610> the

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
material okay so that's kind of the

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.340 
material okay so that's kind of the
purpose<00:05:30.910> of<00:05:31.300> putting<00:05:31.480> this<00:05:31.750> on<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:31.960> parts

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
purpose of putting this on the parts

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.990 
purpose of putting this on the parts
list<00:05:32.470> because<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.830> might<00:05:32.980> ask<00:05:33.220> well<00:05:33.850> why

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
list because you might ask well why

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.240 
list because you might ask well why
don't<00:05:34.060> I<00:05:34.270> just<00:05:34.450> go<00:05:34.600> back<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.620> individual

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
don't I just go back to the individual

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.610 
don't I just go back to the individual
drawing<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:36.880> take<00:05:37.030> a<00:05:37.060> look<00:05:37.360> at<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.660> but<00:05:38.410> for

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
drawing and take a look at it but for

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.770 
drawing and take a look at it but for
again<00:05:38.800> for<00:05:38.830> someone<00:05:39.220> building<00:05:39.760> this<00:05:39.910> this

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
again for someone building this this

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.020 
again for someone building this this
gives<00:05:41.350> them<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.650> quick<00:05:41.890> accurate<00:05:42.160> reference<00:05:42.640> as

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
gives them a quick accurate reference as

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.530 
gives them a quick accurate reference as
far<00:05:43.300> as<00:05:43.450> what<00:05:44.050> they're<00:05:44.170> going<00:05:44.320> to<00:05:44.380> need<00:05:45.540> so

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
far as what they're going to need so

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.700 
far as what they're going to need so
once<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:46.810> have<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:47.050> in<00:05:47.200> there<00:05:47.320> you<00:05:47.470> can<00:05:47.590> hit

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
once you have that in there you can hit

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.149 
once you have that in there you can hit
apply<00:05:47.950> as<00:05:48.220> well<00:05:48.400> so<00:05:48.840> obviously<00:05:49.950> we

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
apply as well so obviously we

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
apply as well so obviously we
go<00:05:51.249> down<00:05:51.489> through<00:05:51.789> all<00:05:51.999> of<00:05:52.029> these<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:54.179> fill

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:55.179 
go down through all of these and fill

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:56.760 
go down through all of these and fill
out<00:05:55.330> this<00:05:55.509> column<00:05:55.899> and<00:05:56.050> make<00:05:56.469> sure<00:05:56.649> that

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
out this column and make sure that

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.409 
out this column and make sure that
everything<00:05:57.279> is<00:05:57.969> accurate<00:05:59.849> the<00:06:00.849> other<00:06:00.999> thing<00:06:01.269> I

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
everything is accurate the other thing I

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.509 
everything is accurate the other thing I
see<00:06:01.629> here<00:06:01.659> is<00:06:02.050> I<00:06:02.080> have<00:06:02.669> part<00:06:03.669> three<00:06:04.269> and<00:06:05.459> let<00:06:06.459> me

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:06.519 
see here is I have part three and let me

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:12.600 
see here is I have part three and let me
go<00:06:06.639> back<00:06:06.669> into<00:06:06.879> that<00:06:11.039> that<00:06:12.039> one<00:06:12.309> should

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
go back into that that one should

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:28.269 
go back into that that one should
actually<00:06:12.849> be<00:06:13.979> the<00:06:15.029> triangle

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:28.279 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.489 

so<00:06:28.909> again<00:06:29.239> it<00:06:29.359> all<00:06:29.479> depends<00:06:29.839> what<00:06:29.989> you<00:06:30.229> named

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:30.499 
so again it all depends what you named

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:32.769 
so again it all depends what you named
your<00:06:30.679> part<00:06:30.979> I<00:06:31.249> obviously<00:06:32.209> named<00:06:32.389> that<00:06:32.599> one

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779 
your part I obviously named that one

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.409 
your part I obviously named that one
part<00:06:33.049> three<00:06:33.349> by<00:06:33.499> accident<00:06:34.149> so<00:06:35.149> that<00:06:35.269> takes

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
part three by accident so that takes

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:36.819 
part three by accident so that takes
care<00:06:35.569> of<00:06:35.719> that<00:06:35.839> issue<00:06:36.049> as<00:06:36.289> well<00:06:36.319> so<00:06:36.619> you<00:06:36.709> might

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:36.829 
care of that issue as well so you might

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.049 
care of that issue as well so you might
have<00:06:36.919> to<00:06:37.009> go<00:06:37.129> in<00:06:37.279> and<00:06:37.369> change<00:06:37.609> some<00:06:37.699> of<00:06:37.879> these

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:38.059 
have to go in and change some of these

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.629 
have to go in and change some of these
if<00:06:38.239> you<00:06:38.329> didn't<00:06:38.569> name<00:06:38.719> your<00:06:38.899> parts<00:06:39.639> accurately

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
if you didn't name your parts accurately

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.749 
if you didn't name your parts accurately
you<00:06:40.939> can<00:06:40.969> go<00:06:41.269> in<00:06:41.419> and<00:06:41.539> edit<00:06:41.719> those<00:06:42.339> as<00:06:43.339> well

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 
you can go in and edit those as well

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.159 
you can go in and edit those as well
okay<00:06:44.719> so<00:06:44.749> when<00:06:45.019> you're<00:06:45.109> all<00:06:45.139> finished<00:06:47.169> your

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
okay so when you're all finished your

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.949 
okay so when you're all finished your
parts<00:06:48.499> list<00:06:48.739> will<00:06:49.729> look<00:06:49.909> basically<00:06:50.509> like<00:06:50.689> this

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:50.959 
parts list will look basically like this

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:54.189 
parts list will look basically like this
okay<00:06:51.739> or<00:06:51.769> any<00:06:52.099> parts<00:06:52.489> list<00:06:52.749> but<00:06:53.749> this<00:06:53.869> one<00:06:54.049> in

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
okay or any parts list but this one in

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.259 
okay or any parts list but this one in
particular<00:06:54.349> for<00:06:54.949> our<00:06:54.979> autumn<00:06:55.369> of<00:06:55.459> blocks<00:06:55.699> the

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:56.269 
particular for our autumn of blocks the

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:57.339 
particular for our autumn of blocks the
next<00:06:56.479> thing<00:06:56.599> I<00:06:56.629> want<00:06:56.749> to<00:06:56.779> show<00:06:56.959> you<00:06:57.019> is<00:06:57.229> we're

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
next thing I want to show you is we're

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.679 
next thing I want to show you is we're
going<00:06:57.439> to<00:06:57.499> go<00:06:57.589> in<00:06:57.709> and<00:06:57.829> add<00:06:57.949> these<00:06:58.129> balloons<00:06:58.689> so

00:06:59.679 --> 00:06:59.689 
going to go in and add these balloons so

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.239 
going to go in and add these balloons so
this<00:06:59.869> tells<00:07:00.109> again<00:07:00.619> the<00:07:00.769> person<00:07:01.129> it

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:01.249 
this tells again the person it

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:04.329 
this tells again the person it
identifies<00:07:01.989> the<00:07:02.989> particular<00:07:03.619> part<00:07:04.159> in

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:04.339 
identifies the particular part in

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.639 
identifies the particular part in
conjunction<00:07:04.729> with<00:07:04.939> the<00:07:05.179> parts<00:07:05.449> list<00:07:05.629> and<00:07:05.899> this

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:06.649 
conjunction with the parts list and this

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.569 
conjunction with the parts list and this
is<00:07:06.829> a<00:07:06.860> this<00:07:07.249> is<00:07:07.309> a<00:07:07.459> fairly<00:07:07.969> easy<00:07:08.179> process<00:07:08.919> so<00:07:09.919> up

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:10.579 
is a this is a fairly easy process so up

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:13.029 
is a this is a fairly easy process so up
top<00:07:10.789> here<00:07:11.059> we<00:07:11.179> have<00:07:11.209> balloon<00:07:11.809> we<00:07:12.529> could<00:07:12.769> auto

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 
top here we have balloon we could auto

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.729 
top here we have balloon we could auto
balloon<00:07:13.549> okay<00:07:14.449> which<00:07:14.929> would<00:07:15.110> just<00:07:15.289> plug<00:07:15.529> in

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:15.739 
balloon okay which would just plug in

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:17.079 
balloon okay which would just plug in
the<00:07:15.860> balloons<00:07:16.189> but<00:07:16.399> we<00:07:16.519> want<00:07:16.669> to<00:07:16.729> be<00:07:16.819> a<00:07:16.849> little

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.089 
the balloons but we want to be a little

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:19.209 
the balloons but we want to be a little
more<00:07:17.239> particular<00:07:17.809> than<00:07:17.869> that<00:07:18.229> the<00:07:19.039> other

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:19.219 
more particular than that the other

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:20.979 
more particular than that the other
thing<00:07:19.489> is<00:07:19.639> we<00:07:19.819> don't<00:07:19.969> need<00:07:20.149> to<00:07:20.360> put<00:07:20.509> a<00:07:20.569> balloon

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:20.989 
thing is we don't need to put a balloon

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:23.019 
thing is we don't need to put a balloon
on<00:07:21.259> every<00:07:21.679> single<00:07:21.889> wheel<00:07:22.279> on<00:07:22.610> every<00:07:22.849> single

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:23.029 
on every single wheel on every single

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:25.569 
on every single wheel on every single
tire<00:07:23.419> once<00:07:24.169> we<00:07:24.319> have<00:07:24.529> those<00:07:24.709> identified<00:07:25.369> we

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:25.579 
tire once we have those identified we

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:27.869 
tire once we have those identified we
don't<00:07:25.759> need<00:07:25.879> to<00:07:26.059> do<00:07:26.179> it<00:07:26.359> more<00:07:26.539> than<00:07:26.599> once<00:07:26.779> so

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 
don't need to do it more than once so

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:32.009 
don't need to do it more than once so
then<00:07:28.879> we<00:07:28.969> can<00:07:29.089> go<00:07:29.149> in<00:07:29.449> and<00:07:29.599> click<00:07:29.719> the<00:07:29.959> part<00:07:30.229> and

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:32.019 
then we can go in and click the part and

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:35.549 
then we can go in and click the part and
right<00:07:33.019> click<00:07:33.319> continue

00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:35.559 
right click continue

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:40.229 
right click continue
and<00:07:37.299> you<00:07:38.299> can<00:07:38.449> see<00:07:38.689> this<00:07:38.869> is<00:07:39.079> going<00:07:39.409> to

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:40.239 
and you can see this is going to

00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:44.169 
and you can see this is going to
coincide<00:07:41.239> with<00:07:41.509> our<00:07:42.379> parts<00:07:42.829> list<00:07:43.099> so<00:07:43.369> number

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:44.179 
coincide with our parts list so number

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:46.659 
coincide with our parts list so number
11<00:07:44.629> is<00:07:44.779> our<00:07:44.959> tire<00:07:45.259> number<00:07:45.949> 10<00:07:46.159> is<00:07:46.339> our<00:07:46.489> wheel

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:46.669 
11 is our tire number 10 is our wheel

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:49.839 
11 is our tire number 10 is our wheel
number<00:07:47.119> seven<00:07:47.509> is<00:07:47.659> our<00:07:48.499> axle<00:07:48.979> okay<00:07:49.549> so<00:07:49.610> that

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:49.849 
number seven is our axle okay so that

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:51.969 
number seven is our axle okay so that
part<00:07:50.089> doesn't<00:07:50.989> take<00:07:51.259> long<00:07:51.499> at<00:07:51.649> all<00:07:51.739> and<00:07:51.799> really

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:51.979 
part doesn't take long at all and really

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:54.669 
part doesn't take long at all and really
the<00:07:52.249> parts<00:07:52.549> list<00:07:52.789> itself<00:07:53.179> is<00:07:53.479> also<00:07:54.319> a<00:07:54.349> pretty

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:54.679 
the parts list itself is also a pretty

00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:56.769 
the parts list itself is also a pretty
quick<00:07:55.369> process<00:07:55.429> compared<00:07:56.299> to<00:07:56.389> actually

00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:56.779 
quick process compared to actually

00:07:56.779 --> 00:08:00.039 
quick process compared to actually
making<00:07:56.989> the<00:07:57.639> exploded<00:07:58.639> view<00:07:58.939> alright<00:07:59.839> good

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:00.049 
making the exploded view alright good

00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:02.079 
making the exploded view alright good
luck
