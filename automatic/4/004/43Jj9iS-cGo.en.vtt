so I am using a griddle here now if you
don't<00:00:51.289> have<00:00:51.590> one<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:52.129> can<00:00:52.280> use<00:00:52.309> it

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
don't have one you can use it

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.209

well<00:00:55.570> but<00:00:56.570> I'm<00:00:56.690> using<00:00:56.899> my<00:00:57.260> griddle<00:00:58.129> I<00:00:58.670> love

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
well but I'm using my griddle I love

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.549 
well but I'm using my griddle I love
being<00:00:59.359> able<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.539> make<00:00:59.690> so<00:00:59.899> many<00:01:00.079> pieces<00:01:00.260> at

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
being able to make so many pieces at

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.919 
being able to make so many pieces at
once<00:01:00.739> but<00:01:01.579> this<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:01.879> really<00:01:02.210> really<00:01:02.600> easy<00:01:02.899> to

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
once but this is really really easy to

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.649 
once but this is really really easy to
do<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:03.859> need<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.040> few<00:01:04.460> ingredients<00:01:04.729> not<00:01:05.449> too

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
do you need a few ingredients not too

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.520 
do you need a few ingredients not too
many<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.860> need<00:01:07.009> bread<00:01:08.170> we're<00:01:09.170> gonna<00:01:09.290> use<00:01:09.500> a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
many you need bread we're gonna use a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.969 
many you need bread we're gonna use a
quarter<00:01:10.009> cup<00:01:10.100> of<00:01:10.670> milk<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:11.960> ideally<00:01:12.710> you

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
quarter cup of milk now ideally you

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.830 
quarter cup of milk now ideally you
should<00:01:13.009> try<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.460> measure<00:01:13.790> liquid<00:01:14.720> ingredients

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
should try to measure liquid ingredients

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.870 
should try to measure liquid ingredients
in<00:01:15.439> a<00:01:15.740> liquid<00:01:16.280> measuring<00:01:16.490> cup<00:01:16.850> because

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
in a liquid measuring cup because

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.810 
in a liquid measuring cup because
they're<00:01:17.390> more<00:01:17.840> accurate<00:01:18.079> this<00:01:18.680> way<00:01:18.829> if<00:01:19.670> you

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
they're more accurate this way if you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.940 
they're more accurate this way if you
don't<00:01:19.939> have<00:01:20.090> one<00:01:20.420> that's<00:01:20.840> okay<00:01:21.229> but<00:01:21.619> if<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.799> do

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
don't have one that's okay but if you do

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.359 
don't have one that's okay but if you do
grab<00:01:22.369> that<00:01:22.610> one<00:01:22.850> we're<00:01:23.329> gonna<00:01:23.420> use<00:01:23.659> one<00:01:23.960> egg

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
grab that one we're gonna use one egg

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.120 
grab that one we're gonna use one egg
now<00:01:25.369> I'm<00:01:25.610> using<00:01:25.790> a<00:01:26.090> large<00:01:26.479> egg<00:01:26.900> if<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.950> don't

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
now I'm using a large egg if you don't

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.889 
now I'm using a large egg if you don't
feel<00:01:28.549> me<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.729> small<00:01:29.149> eggs<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.570> might<00:01:29.720> want<00:01:29.869> to

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
just a little bit of salt because that

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.910 
just a little bit of salt because that
helps<00:01:35.600> everything<00:01:35.990> taste<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.560> little<00:01:36.740> bit

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
helps everything taste a little bit

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.389 
helps everything taste a little bit

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
better we're gonna use sugar because

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.069 
better we're gonna use sugar because
it's<00:01:40.579> recipe<00:01:41.000> but<00:01:41.180> developed<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.600> long<00:01:41.810> time

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
it's recipe but developed a long time
