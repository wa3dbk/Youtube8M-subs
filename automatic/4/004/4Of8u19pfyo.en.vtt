00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.870
 piranha bytes the developers of gothic 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.640
 and recently we have a new one 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.740
 game announced elix means that will 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.180
 a science fiction roleplaying game and here 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 at the gamescom is called for the first time in 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.660
 Movement seen so to speak, a pre 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.550
 alpha version is still a relative 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 early pre-release but at least there was 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.360
 to see some movement and what you also 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.940
 has seen again that the game is so 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.279
 at least graphically the old strengths and 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.900
 Weakened by gothic outlines inherits that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.240
 means the landscapes will see again 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 class from the can easily 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.869
 landscape architecture very much 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.830
 atmospheric on the other side 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.059
 Dialoge are not that great from the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.010
 facial animation was still pretty 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.180
 star so there was little mood over there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.649
 but well it is still there 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.239
 the game is supposed to work 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.790
 fourth quarter of 2016 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.530
 what I find interesting about alexis the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.640
 contrast in the game world 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.790
 because actually it's an end-time 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.020
 world civilization has gone down 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.149
 on the other hand a bit like 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.890
 gothic i already said that actually 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.200
 looks electro like you have that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.270
 ruhr area of ​​the near future in the air 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.800
 blown around then the gothic world over it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.789
 I also have to build the developers 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.829
 they say they are a bit weird 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.940
 Looked already fits for me it looks like that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.529
 but I find this contrast 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.990
 just exciting that one hand 

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:08.459
 somehow factory ruins metal corridors 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.259
 or even things like energy 

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:11.789
 weapons on the other side though 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.799
 even villages that are simply medieval 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.509
 look like craftsmen standing around and 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.009
 hit nails in the wall or where 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.509
 Farmers plant English in the swamp 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.700
 between, that is, from a scenario 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.990
 ever quite interesting then 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 Do also make things mechanics 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.099
 different this time especially in the fight 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.659
 they are not supposed to be easy this time 

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:29.249
 only one click will be fixed where you always 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.630
 just one key or one 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.459
 mouse button or on the button gamepad 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.259
 Button must hammer to fight 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.240
 win but this time it should be there 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.099
 actually you can go tactical 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.659
 not just block permanently 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.700
 but has a persistence bar the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.719
 when blocking decreases so that it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.759
 stop someday just not going anymore 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.950
 and you really have to think about how 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.819
 I'm now tactically against 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.770
 which opponent 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.599
 but I have to say too much 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 you have not seen it until yet 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.429
 This is where the fighting still looks like 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.049
 as in gothic or just know that one 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.429
 Now somehow a city monster 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.659
 at the beginning a magic spell around the ears 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.369
 wants to start hitting the fight 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.559
 easy with an energy weapon couple 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.059
 behind the ears soon too nice but like 

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:08.399
 said nothing earth-shattering new 

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.899
 Nevertheless, I am very curious what the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.849
 the ideas are still in play 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.930
 sound good, but it is also 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.819
 you have to say clearly 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.709
 very ambitious project should be one 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.209
 Great worlds are not going through 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.799
 not so the world need to partially 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.810
 two and drivers but really im 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.390
 principle again a game that way 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.670
 ambitious is like gothic 3 and waiting 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.560
 one at gothic 3 there was something 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.120
 to start with yes okay it was pretty 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.579
 They want to pack this time 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.260
 Avoid promising them now 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.989
 just have more experience with one 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.670
 technology is more established and I work 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.170
 hope that this time with nordic 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.629
 games and publishers have them 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.519
 time gives the game just neat 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.739
 get ready and really too 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.389
 polish that is in the end and round 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.159
 experience becomes so piranha bytes 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.419
 I press you the thumb and hope 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.419
 that we will hear more soon 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.310
