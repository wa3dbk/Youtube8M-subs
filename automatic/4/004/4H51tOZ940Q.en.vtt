Peterson<00:01:09.049> regardless<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.260> how<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.409> feel

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
about the situation he put himself in I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
about the situation he put himself in I
think<00:01:13.409> he's<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> top<00:01:13.860> three<00:01:14.070> running<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.570> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
think he's a top three running back and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.440 
think he's a top three running back and
he<00:01:16.110> definitely<00:01:16.470> deserves<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.040> card<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.580> he

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
he definitely deserves this card and he

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
he definitely deserves this card and he
has<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> boss<00:01:19.080> card<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.680> he<00:01:19.710> should<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
being a 99 super bowl MVP card with

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.550 
being a 99 super bowl MVP card with
godly<00:02:12.720> stats

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
godly stats

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
godly stats
alright<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.940> i<00:02:15.150> would<00:02:15.300> sell<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.660> card<00:02:15.870> ASAP

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
alright and i would sell that card ASAP

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.320 
alright and i would sell that card ASAP
because<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:17.190> cards<00:02:17.730> price<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.180> gonna

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
because that cards price is gonna

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.110 
because that cards price is gonna
plummet<00:02:18.800> because<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.010> card<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.849> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
plummet because of this card but the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.390 
plummet because of this card but the
stats<00:02:21.360> look<00:02:21.569> even<00:02:21.870> better<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.560> card<00:02:22.830> he's

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
stats look even better on this card he's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.339 
stats look even better on this card he's
obviously<00:02:23.819> going<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> great<00:02:24.480> passer<00:02:24.959> so

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
obviously going to be a great passer so

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.380 
obviously going to be a great passer so
if<00:02:25.440> that's<00:02:25.560> your<00:02:25.800> thing<00:02:25.830> pick<00:02:26.790> him<00:02:26.880> up<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.150> guess

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
if that's your thing pick him up I guess

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.900 
if that's your thing pick him up I guess
I<00:02:27.680> obviously<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.890> mobile<00:02:29.130> quarterbacks<00:02:29.730> I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
I obviously like mobile quarterbacks I

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.320 
I obviously like mobile quarterbacks I
think<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.239> imperative<00:02:30.599> in<00:02:31.080> season<00:02:31.560> 30<00:02:32.330> but

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
think it's imperative in season 30 but

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.350 
think it's imperative in season 30 but
similarly<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.650> Adrian<00:02:35.190> Peterson<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.819> think

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
similarly to Adrian Peterson I think

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.630 
similarly to Adrian Peterson I think
he's<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> top<00:02:36.780> 3<00:02:37.019> quarterback<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.560> all<00:02:37.709> time<00:02:38.010> but

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
he's a top 3 quarterback of all time but

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.250 
he's a top 3 quarterback of all time but
I<00:02:38.670> don't<00:02:38.910> see<00:02:39.060> my<00:02:39.180> man<00:02:39.360> Peyton<00:02:39.750> Manning<00:02:40.050> get<00:02:40.230> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
I don't see my man Peyton Manning get a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.920 
I don't see my man Peyton Manning get a
19<00:02:40.650> getting<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.190> 99<00:02:41.640> card<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.120> mobile<00:02:42.750> I

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
19 getting a 99 card on mobile I

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.500 
19 getting a 99 card on mobile I
realized<00:02:43.769> he<00:02:43.920> has<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> flashback<00:02:44.519> card<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.970> 99

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
realized he has a flashback card a 99

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.270 
realized he has a flashback card a 99
flashback<00:02:45.930> card<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.260> console<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.130> don't

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
flashback card on console but I don't

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.500 
flashback card on console but I don't
even<00:02:47.370> think<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.670> counts<00:02:47.880> because<00:02:48.120> he's<00:02:48.390> in

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
even think that counts because he's in

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
even think that counts because he's in
like<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> colts<00:02:49.080> uniform<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.769> their

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
like a colts uniform and their

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.340 
like a colts uniform and their
insinuating<00:02:50.819> like<00:02:50.940> he's<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.269> 99<00:02:51.780> back<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
insinuating like he's a 99 back in the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.030 
insinuating like he's a 99 back in the
day<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.630> also<00:02:54.989> don't<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.410> my<00:02:55.530> boy<00:02:55.680> Steve
