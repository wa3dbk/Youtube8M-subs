00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.669
 Hey everyone, Alison still needs more rest and settles his new job. 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.160
 So please join me in welcoming partner Shannon Meisner 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 This week we are going to do something a little different and play a game before continuing to watch. 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.430
 This is a Flash game that takes you up to three minutes at most but I think you will find it in this three minute time 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.920
 Can let you talk about more than 20 hours of gaming experience 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 Link up quickly below (show full information) 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.398
 But in case you see this video link from some places through embedded 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.489
 So go play and we are waiting for you here. 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.649
 Ok so you might like it or hate it 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.280
 Maybe you think it's correct or think it describes it very accurately 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.160
 But the focus is on any of the ways we can discuss it. 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 I always see people writing in the analysis game. 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.140
 Talk about story writing and discuss its implications by talking about books 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.539
 I mean this is a good thing, but we rarely hear the meaning of people discussing the mechanism. 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.170
 So today 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.520
 We are going to talk about a meaningful mechanism as a symbolic mechanism. 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.500
 Because for me if we want the game to be a really powerful experience 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.320
 If we really want them to reach their full potential and be able to explore a wide range of concepts 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 If we want to get more experience when the player finally puts down the controller and then sit there and stunned 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.340
 Then we start to test the meaning of the game in the action instead of just the text. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.980
 Not doing it is like denying that a movie can convey its meaning without a script. 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.820
 It’s like saying that the narrative in the movie can only be expressed through the words of the characters. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.840
 So let's take a look at the "loneliness". What is the highlight? There is no denying the existence of narrative in the game. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.480
 Even if it is characterized by no text except the last few words of the designer's idea 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.780
 The most unbelievable thing for me is that narratives can be different for different people. 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.360
 Some people will try to enter all groups 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.720
 Some people may have begun to avoid groups 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.989
 Some people may try to turn back to see if something is missing. 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.229
 Some people may hold the last "point" will be the last hope 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.218
 Some people may end up straight because they don’t want to be rejected anymore. 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.500
 Some people may give up and close in the middle of the game. 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.000
 Each of these possibilities is a unique narrative. Every reaction is a small part of ourselves. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 This game not only tries to put us in an emotional state that is always excluded from being alone. 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.128
 But it lets us explore what this game is unique to me. 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.520
 The groups you go to will have a leader. He is always looking for a place that suits them. 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.930
 The lone who starts to avoid everything decides that he/she does not need a world that does not accept them. 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.380
 Most people may subconsciously make this decision while playing. 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.540
 Even if you have no impression if you think about your gaming experience 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.140
 Those who avoid groups may have flashed this idea in their heads. 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.280
 I don’t need them for this group of people who are X, when you choose to start to avoid 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.840
 And those who try to join each group may say this to themselves. 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.360
 I thought about it at least for a short time. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.230
 I hope this group will accept me. 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.799
 Observing and reflecting on this experience can better understand yourself through the meaning of the mechanism 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.489
 This gives us the opportunity to really make choices and really explore through play. 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.980
 Most people have been trained to think about the choices in the game, usually the alternative dialog option. 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.720
 Or very clear action, I should save or not save this person but choose to be analogous here. 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.820
 Choose every moment that appears in the play 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.060
 Maybe you are trying to find someone who can connect 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.340
 But then decided that you are tired of the world, the best to remain lonely 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.260
 Until the end of the game, you decide to make a final try to see if you can go back to the world and find someone who accepts you. 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.640
 Maybe you go straight through everyone and keep focusing on your path. 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.940
 Or your story is unfolding in a completely different way. This is the real choice. 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.360
 The choices offered are even more than those games give you more 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.380
 Now you may think that what I said is useless. 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.860
 Or you may have a completely different view of these things and their value. 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.780
 But this is very good 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.380
 My favorite type of entertainment is to argue with my brothers after dinner and argue about its true meaning. 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.080
 Or what effect it has on the world we live in, these are what you can do. 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.900
 Even if you think this game is very exaggerated or bad, these are the discussions of this time. 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.580
 So please join us next week and we will talk about the concept of the mechanism as a symbol of how to use it in mainstream listing games. 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.700
 We will discuss the benefits and difficulties of using this concept. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.680
 And perhaps the most important part of talking about AAA games that already use this concept. 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.520
 If you know the mechanics of other games have their meanings, share them in the forum or send us a letter. 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.280
 I can't guarantee that we can reply one by one, but this is what we like to hear. 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.299
 Thanks again for coming back to help our Shannon. We will see you next week.
