00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
think if every company did that in their

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.219 
think if every company did that in their
particular<00:01:45.790> sector<00:01:46.420> let's<00:01:46.899> say<00:01:47.049> they're

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
particular sector let's say they're

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.139 
particular sector let's say they're
doing<00:01:47.469> it<00:01:47.619> for<00:01:47.829> appliances<00:01:48.460> somebody<00:01:48.969> does<00:01:49.119> it

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
doing it for appliances somebody does it

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.959 
doing it for appliances somebody does it
for<00:01:49.420> cars<00:01:49.689> somebody<00:01:50.439> does<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:50.799> for<00:01:51.070> whatever

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
for cars somebody does it for whatever

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.880 
for cars somebody does it for whatever
you<00:01:52.329> know<00:01:52.450> different<00:01:52.630> different<00:01:52.990> things<00:01:53.259> I<00:01:53.469> I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
you know different different things I I

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.889 
you know different different things I I
think<00:01:54.399> half<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.969> global<00:01:55.360> warming<00:01:55.689> problem

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
think half a global warming problem

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.899 
think half a global warming problem
would<00:01:56.170> anyway<00:01:56.530> go<00:01:56.710> away<00:01:56.950> because<00:01:57.640> these

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
would anyway go away because these

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.609 
would anyway go away because these
problems<00:01:58.360> are<00:01:58.509> actually<00:01:58.899> coming<00:01:59.079> from<00:01:59.469> the

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
problems are actually coming from the

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.640 
problems are actually coming from the
consumer<00:02:00.130> market<00:02:00.159> coming<00:02:00.880> from

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
consumer market coming from

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.020 
consumer market coming from
no<00:02:02.250> people<00:02:02.640> were<00:02:02.880> making<00:02:03.080> technology<00:02:04.080> so<00:02:04.590> it's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
no people were making technology so it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
no people were making technology so it's
fantastic<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.510> sound<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.200> serious<00:02:07.770> about
