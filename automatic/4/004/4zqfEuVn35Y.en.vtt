00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
and we had some momentum they did a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
position on the long pass we should add

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.120 
position on the long pass we should add
somebody<00:02:18.290> right<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.739> middle<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.040> the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
and he just panicked a little bit by the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.510 
and he just panicked a little bit by the
linebacker<00:03:02.110> running<00:03:02.590> through<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.220> then<00:03:03.340> they

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
linebacker running through and then they

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:14.940 
linebacker running through and then they
you<00:03:03.910> know<00:03:03.940> they<00:03:04.150> dug<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.570> ball<00:03:04.720> out<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:13.950> felt

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
you know they dug the ball out I felt

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.260 
you know they dug the ball out I felt
good<00:03:15.130> about<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.580> start<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.180> know

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
good about the start you know

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.940 
good about the start you know
particularly<00:03:16.870> when<00:03:17.140> we<00:03:17.290> were<00:03:17.410> converting<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
particularly when we were converting the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.650 
particularly when we were converting the
third<00:03:18.130> downs<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.970> know<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:19.270> weren't<00:03:19.420> running

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
third downs you know we weren't running

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.300 
third downs you know we weren't running
the<00:03:19.900> ball<00:03:20.080> very<00:03:20.320> well<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.770> first<00:03:21.070> drive

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
the ball very well in that first drive

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.949 
the ball very well in that first drive
but<00:03:21.610> we<00:03:21.730> were<00:03:21.850> converting<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.450> third<00:03:22.630> downs

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
but we were converting the third downs

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.440 
but we were converting the third downs
and<00:03:23.350> protecting<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.340> quarterback<00:03:24.520> so<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.180> felt

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
and protecting the quarterback so I felt

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.600 
and protecting the quarterback so I felt
like<00:03:25.600> we<00:03:25.810> were<00:03:25.959> there<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.709> then<00:03:27.190> we<00:03:27.400> you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
like we were there and and then we you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.460 
like we were there and and then we you
know<00:03:27.730> move<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.270> ball<00:03:28.450> off<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.690> end<00:03:28.870> zone<00:03:29.230> and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
know move the ball off the end zone and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.160 
know move the ball off the end zone and
had<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> chance<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.000> drive<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> little<00:03:31.959> bit

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
had a chance to drive it a little bit

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.660 
had a chance to drive it a little bit
and<00:03:32.320> that's<00:03:32.470> when<00:03:32.680> we<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.280> know<00:03:33.400> hit<00:03:33.640> the

and that's when we you know hit the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.430 
and that's when we you know hit the
hands<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.240> ball<00:03:34.420> popped<00:03:34.840> up<00:03:34.990> in<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.290> air

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
hands and the ball popped up in the air

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.910 
hands and the ball popped up in the air
so<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:36.070> turned<00:03:36.640> in<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:36.910> hurry<00:03:37.120> that's<00:03:37.540> for<00:03:37.780> sure

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.740 

yeah

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.030 

yeah<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.290> that's<00:03:49.500> what<00:03:49.710> I've<00:03:49.860> never

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
yeah you know that's what I've never

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.560 
yeah you know that's what I've never

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.100 
in sixth place so obviously we we needed
to<00:03:55.590> figure<00:03:56.010> something<00:03:56.340> else<00:03:56.550> out<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.300> you

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.160 
felt like they did a good job and we
need<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.700> continue<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:50.330> stop<00:05:50.540> the<00:05:50.720> run<00:05:50.900> and

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
need to continue to stop the run and

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.170 
need to continue to stop the run and
make<00:05:51.740> him<00:05:51.890> throw<00:05:52.040> the<00:05:52.130> ball<00:05:52.400> get<00:05:52.820> pressure<00:05:53.060> on

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
make him throw the ball get pressure on

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.720 
make him throw the ball get pressure on
the<00:05:53.390> quarterback<00:05:53.980> which<00:05:54.980> we<00:05:55.220> weren't<00:05:55.460> able<00:05:55.580> to

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
the quarterback which we weren't able to

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.400 
the quarterback which we weren't able to
do<00:05:55.940> when<00:05:56.270> they<00:05:56.390> did<00:05:56.570> throw<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:56.930> ball<00:05:57.110> they<00:05:57.260> did

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
do when they did throw the ball they did

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.690 
do when they did throw the ball they did
a<00:05:57.440> nice<00:05:57.680> job<00:05:57.710> of<00:05:57.980> protecting<00:05:58.400> their

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
a nice job of protecting their

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.210 
a nice job of protecting their
quarterback<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.720> offensively<00:06:00.560> you<00:06:00.860> know<00:06:01.010> we

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
quarterback and offensively you know we

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.100 
quarterback and offensively you know we
survived<00:06:01.610> turnovers<00:06:02.330> and<00:06:02.630> we're<00:06:02.750> only<00:06:02.840> down
