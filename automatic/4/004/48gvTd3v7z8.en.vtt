00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 very needy I understand that we are in 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.310
 minecraft 1.7 points 2 let's see a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.230
 mod 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.260
 of team fortress 2 game that I do not 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.330
 it was fine but one way that I add 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 so super pimps are dispensed that you see that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.770
 they are from the game I do but it has effects 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.609
 very very cool as you see here is done 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.289
 with corners iron 2 reston 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 glass in the middle a dispense below and what 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.990
 from above we can change it or red is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 here or blue is here does the same thing 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.439
 the two 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.110
 this is red and blue is pretty 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.719
 cool here just this bar 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.750
 here is how the energy is what 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.489
 we can find with gold iron or diamond 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.870
 iron here we fill it to the fullest with 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.739
 diamond we also get it to the fullest 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.140
 I say but this one is pretty enough 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.210
 cool here we decide what we want that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.100
 do then let's go let's do 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.960
 some tests ok let's see one of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.600
 things for example and that is that 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.000
 recover the hunger 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.710
 and we put ourselves here see the particles 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.070
 that come out and we are recovering the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.920
 hungry 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.110
 it's super cool this comes out here like 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.150
 you see that this more raised I do not know very 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.159
 well why but good another thing of the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.520
 that you also make repairs like 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.600
 you see here this sword that this one does not arrive 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.200
 in half but good out there 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.540
 repair goals to repair and on top 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.010
 super fast that is something else too 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.450
 is that it cures our lives 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.850
 now life and hunger because you 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.370
 we have put both of these things 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.140
 superchulo of the day plus as one of 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.120
 iron fill the entire bar of 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.730
 every way I put iron and you have 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:45.090
 seen that it is full here diamond 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:47.640
 and it is full but it is not spent almost 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.670
 now it does not have to be empty, I do not know 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.230
 but they seem to me superchulo 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.360
 better touch with iron not 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.310
 but it seems that when putting iron 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.480
 it is spent much faster with diamond 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.970
 look that only been spent here 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.590
 with iron more than half but good 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.760
 here we can choose for example that if 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.920
 we do not want him to heal us now 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.390
 activated everything we do not want to cover us 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.940
 for example then they will only fill us 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.920
 hunger and we repair things already 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.050
 here we can choose to have we can put 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.280
 this to neutralize for example that this 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.130
 to neutralize simply is that we 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.220
 removes effects I put night vision and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.340
 should take us away if not directly 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.060
 it's quite pretty cool and it's 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.950
 pretty cool 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.800
 As you can see these these prices 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.020
 dispensers of team fortress 2 is 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.480
 quite this dwells much on all the 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.860
 fact that it heals you and that you repair 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.750
 automatic it costs you clear because you have 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.040
 to put something in there is a good thing 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.810
 script are weird stuff 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.580
 Obviously it costs you with iron 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.920
 you can do enough not much 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.920
 no, but well, it's pretty 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.930
 pretty pretty good 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.850
 bye
