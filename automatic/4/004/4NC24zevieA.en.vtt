00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.139 
been looking hard enough
and<00:01:44.990> waffle<00:01:45.990> mold<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> waffle

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
and waffle mold because I have a waffle

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.510 
and waffle mold because I have a waffle
maker<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.229> lazy<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.799> don't<00:01:50.399> like

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
maker but I'm so lazy I don't like

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280 
maker but I'm so lazy I don't like
taking<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> its<00:01:51.329> box<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.869> washing<00:01:52.200> in

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
taking it out of its box and washing in

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.359 
taking it out of its box and washing in
stuff<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> thought<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.100> easier

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
stuff so I thought this would be easier

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.200 
stuff so I thought this would be easier
and<00:01:54.240> some<00:01:54.829> deco<00:01:55.829> stickers<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.579> left<00:01:57.000> there<00:01:57.119> for

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
and some deco stickers I left there for

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.340 
and some deco stickers I left there for
your<00:01:57.360> nail<00:01:57.540> or<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.049> thought<00:01:58.170> they'd<00:01:58.320> be

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
your nail or not but I thought they'd be

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.020 
your nail or not but I thought they'd be
cute<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.070> use<00:01:59.479> for<00:02:00.479> crafting

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.230
