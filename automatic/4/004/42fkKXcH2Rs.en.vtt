which<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.469> concerned<00:00:46.890> about<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.450> see

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
which to be concerned about you can see

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240 
which to be concerned about you can see
looking<00:00:49.020> these<00:00:49.140> pictures<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.620> his<00:00:49.860> back<00:00:50.070> has

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
looking these pictures that his back has

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.860 
looking these pictures that his back has
done<00:00:50.399> no<00:00:50.610> work<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.300> about<00:00:51.360> sixteen

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
done no work at all it's about sixteen

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720 
done no work at all it's about sixteen
hundred<00:00:51.899> miles<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.489> hardly

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
hundred miles on it and some it's hardly

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.290 
hundred miles on it and some it's hardly
being<00:00:53.940> used

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
being used

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.670 
being used
it's<00:00:54.420> never<00:00:54.570> been<00:00:54.719> dirty<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.260> anything<00:00:55.320> like

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
it's never been dirty or anything like

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's never been dirty or anything like
that<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.059> looking<00:00:57.329> around<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> bike<00:00:58.039> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
that so just looking around the bike the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.529 
that so just looking around the bike the
only<00:00:59.250> thing<00:00:59.430> really<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> point<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.059> noticed

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
only thing really the point I noticed

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
only thing really the point I noticed
whilst<00:01:00.750> riding<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> harmonic

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
whilst riding it there is a harmonic

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
whilst riding it there is a harmonic
vibration<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.420> somewhere<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.140> thought<00:01:04.439> maybe

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
vibration from somewhere I thought maybe

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
vibration from somewhere I thought maybe
modeling<00:01:05.189> coming<00:01:05.460> from<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> exhaust<00:01:05.970> or

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
modeling coming from the exhaust or

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700 
modeling coming from the exhaust or
something<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.260> maybe<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.619> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
something like that or maybe a bit of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.640 
something like that or maybe a bit of
teamwork<00:01:07.950> somewhere<00:01:09.170> it's<00:01:10.170> probably<00:01:10.470> being

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
teamwork somewhere it's probably being

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.960 
teamwork somewhere it's probably being
in<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.830> into<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.220> new<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.610> would<00:01:11.790> say

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
in this into as new and I would say

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
in this into as new and I would say
that's<00:01:12.180> probably<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.720> characteristic<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that's probably a characteristic of the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.880 
that's probably a characteristic of the
model<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.720> this<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.110> bike<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.590> good<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
model so this the bike is as good as it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
model so this the bike is as good as it
looks<00:01:16.920> oh<00:01:17.310> there<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> good<00:01:18.299> luck<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
looks oh there we go good luck with a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
looks oh there we go good luck with a
bidding<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.560> long<00:01:23.400> chin

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
bidding so this is the long chin

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.620 
bidding so this is the long chin
horizontal<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> five<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.729> short

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
horizontal one to five this is a short

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
horizontal one to five this is a short
road<00:01:27.930> test<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.829> show<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.400> an<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
road test to show that an a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.130 
road test to show that an a
demonstration<00:01:30.240> show<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> brakes<00:01:30.960> are

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
demonstration show that the brakes are

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
demonstration show that the brakes are
clutch<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.740> gears<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.850> work<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.180> they

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
clutch the gears that all work as they

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
clutch the gears that all work as they
should<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.220> first<00:01:35.220> thing<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> start<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
should do so first thing is to start the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.719 
should do so first thing is to start the
engine

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
engine

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
engine
so<00:01:38.729> ignition<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
so ignition on you can see that's a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.140 
so ignition on you can see that's a
neutron

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.820 

actually<00:01:44.930> seems<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.200> be<00:01:45.260> a<00:01:45.350> car<00:01:45.590> on<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.740> bike

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
actually seems to be a car on the bike

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.330 
actually seems to be a car on the bike
it<00:01:48.830> starts<00:01:49.220> first<00:01:49.370> time<00:01:49.670> every<00:01:49.940> time

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
it starts first time every time

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.260 
it starts first time every time
so<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.400> first<00:01:52.670> thing<00:01:52.850> we're<00:01:52.940> going<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.090> do<00:01:53.210> is

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.360 
so the first thing we're going to do is
up<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.110> junction<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.770> if<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.040> a<00:01:55.070> little<00:01:55.280> bit

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
up to the junction and if I a little bit

last<00:03:12.720> check<00:03:12.990> is<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> horn

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.640 

have<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.210> test<00:03:17.450> them<00:03:17.630> when<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.470> bike

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
have to test them when the bike

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.560 
have to test them when the bike
effectively<00:03:19.580> performs<00:03:20.000> exactly<00:03:20.150> as<00:03:20.480> he

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570
