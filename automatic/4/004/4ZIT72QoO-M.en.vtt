00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
that linked as well but each of them has
a<00:01:28.920> flaw<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.700> Shadowman<00:01:30.360> actually

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
a flaw and the Shadowman actually

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.410 
a flaw and the Shadowman actually
discovers<00:01:32.280> useful<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
discovers useful and that will have a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.160 
discovers useful and that will have a
big<00:01:33.869> role<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.140> how<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.619> map<00:01:34.979> place<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.909> each<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
big role in how the map place so each of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.319 
big role in how the map place so each of
them<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:38.220> know<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.549> shows<00:01:38.880> them<00:01:39.060> killing

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
them you know it just shows them killing

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.679 
them you know it just shows them killing
someone<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:41.130> badass<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
someone in a really badass way and that

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.170 
someone in a really badass way and that
would<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.170> there<00:01:43.560> flaw<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.549> map<00:01:44.820> but

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
would be there flaw for the map but

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.300 
would be there flaw for the map but
it'll<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.500> more<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.799> depth<00:01:47.009> when<00:01:47.189> we

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it'll be way more in depth when we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.670 
it'll be way more in depth when we
actually<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> play<00:01:48.140> another<00:01:49.140> gun<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
actually get to play another gun and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.160 
actually get to play another gun and
this<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:50.340> upgraded<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.540> obviously

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
this is actually upgraded so obviously

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
this is actually upgraded so obviously
upgrade<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> game

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
upgrade is going to be in the game

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.480 
upgrade is going to be in the game
you've<00:01:54.299> seen<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> lot<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.079> melee<00:01:55.470> weapons<00:01:55.890> but

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
you've seen a lot of melee weapons but

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.149 
you've seen a lot of melee weapons but
holy<00:01:56.880> crap<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.869> finally<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.740> melee

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
holy crap we finally get some melee

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
holy crap we finally get some melee
swords<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.810> playing<00:02:01.110> in

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
swords and that's going to be playing in

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.800 
swords and that's going to be playing in

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
abilities here at first when I saw this

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.440 
abilities here at first when I saw this
I<00:02:56.280> thought<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.520> was<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.640> perk<00:02:56.850> machine<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
I thought it was a perk machine like the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.270 
I thought it was a perk machine like the
wonderful<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.740> building<00:02:59.040> machine

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
wonderful but it's in a building machine

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
around him like he doesn't exist he's

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.750
