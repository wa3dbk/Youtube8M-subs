to cut off and as long as you have the

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.400 
to cut off and as long as you have the
right<00:00:16.340> burr<00:00:16.790> it's<00:00:17.180> really<00:00:17.660> not<00:00:17.779> difficult<00:00:18.290> at

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
right burr it's really not difficult at

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.679 
right burr it's really not difficult at
all<00:00:18.590> and<00:00:18.830> so<00:00:19.009> I'm<00:00:19.220> gonna<00:00:19.369> cut<00:00:19.700> this<00:00:19.910> Brooks<00:00:20.540> or

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
all and so I'm gonna cut this Brooks or

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.569 
all and so I'm gonna cut this Brooks or
crown<00:00:20.900> off<00:00:21.050> that<00:00:21.200> you<00:00:21.290> see<00:00:21.470> right<00:00:21.680> here<00:00:21.710> this

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
crown off that you see right here this

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.940 
crown off that you see right here this
is<00:00:22.640> azor<00:00:23.150> cut<00:00:23.450> diamond<00:00:23.960> from<00:00:24.140> axis<00:00:24.619> dental

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
is azor cut diamond from axis dental

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.880 
is azor cut diamond from axis dental
it's<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.189> very<00:00:25.399> fine<00:00:25.849> grit<00:00:26.750> diamond<00:00:27.320> which<00:00:27.590> is<00:00:27.860> a

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
it's a very fine grit diamond which is a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.560 
it's a very fine grit diamond which is a
little<00:00:28.220> counterintuitive<00:00:28.610> you<00:00:29.210> would<00:00:29.329> think

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
little counterintuitive you would think

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.569 
little counterintuitive you would think
you<00:00:29.689> need<00:00:29.930> something<00:00:30.259> really<00:00:30.739> coarse<00:00:31.160> to<00:00:31.399> cut

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
you need something really coarse to cut

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:32.950 
you need something really coarse to cut
through<00:00:31.910> something<00:00:32.300> really<00:00:32.509> tough<00:00:32.720> like

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
through something really tough like

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.229 
through something really tough like
zirconia<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:33.829> that's<00:00:34.489> not<00:00:34.670> true<00:00:34.940> you<00:00:35.059> need<00:00:35.180> a

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
zirconia but that's not true you need a

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.819 
zirconia but that's not true you need a
fine<00:00:35.510> grit<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:35.809> can<00:00:35.930> see<00:00:36.050> I'm<00:00:36.170> just<00:00:36.200> a<00:00:36.469> lay<00:00:36.769> it

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
fine grit you can see I'm just a lay it

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.169 
fine grit you can see I'm just a lay it
against<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.280> tooth<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:37.699> then<00:00:37.820> pull<00:00:38.000> it<00:00:38.090> away

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
against the tooth and then pull it away

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.729 
against the tooth and then pull it away
lay<00:00:38.629> it<00:00:38.690> against<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.050> tooth<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.469> pull<00:00:39.620> it

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
lay it against the tooth and pull it

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.439 
lay it against the tooth and pull it
away<00:00:39.800> lay<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:40.250> against<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:40.670> tooth<00:00:40.879> pull<00:00:41.329> it

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
away lay it against the tooth pull it

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.150 
away lay it against the tooth pull it
away<00:00:41.510> got<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.780> lot<00:00:42.019> or<00:00:42.230> water<00:00:42.440> spray<00:00:42.769> going<00:00:42.980> on

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
away got a lot or water spray going on

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.979 
away got a lot or water spray going on
there<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:43.370> there's<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.699> tooth<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:44.690> can<00:00:44.839> see

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
there and there's the tooth you can see

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.869 
there and there's the tooth you can see
the<00:00:45.079> two<00:00:45.260> start<00:00:45.559> in<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.710> show<00:00:45.859> through<00:00:46.219> the

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
the two start in the show through the

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.610 
the two start in the show through the
difference<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:47.359> color<00:00:47.570> between<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.019> zirconia

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
difference in color between the zirconia

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.959 
difference in color between the zirconia
and<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:48.800> prep<00:00:49.039> makes<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:49.429> really<00:00:49.609> easy<00:00:49.879> to

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
and the prep makes it really easy to

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.569 
and the prep makes it really easy to
know<00:00:50.210> when<00:00:50.420> you've<00:00:50.539> cut<00:00:50.859> far<00:00:51.859> enough<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:52.460> in

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
know when you've cut far enough so in

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.040 
know when you've cut far enough so in
that<00:00:52.699> respect<00:00:52.940> that's<00:00:53.359> kind<00:00:53.570> of<00:00:53.629> like<00:00:53.780> cutting

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
that respect that's kind of like cutting

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.979 
that respect that's kind of like cutting
off<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.559> typical<00:00:55.339> pfm<00:00:56.269> crown<00:00:56.539> it's<00:00:56.690> not<00:00:56.839> that

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
off a typical pfm crown it's not that

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.419 
off a typical pfm crown it's not that
difficult<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.469> see<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.829> shape<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.280> burr

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
difficult to see the shape of the burr

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.270 
difficult to see the shape of the burr
here<00:00:58.640> is<00:00:58.699> not<00:00:58.879> that<00:00:59.089> important<00:00:59.629> I'm<00:01:00.140> using<00:01:00.469> a

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
here is not that important I'm using a

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.340 
here is not that important I'm using a
bird<00:01:01.820> here<00:01:01.999> with<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.149> whiter<00:01:02.449> tip<00:01:02.780> because<00:01:03.170> it's

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
bird here with a whiter tip because it's

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.200 
bird here with a whiter tip because it's
a<00:01:03.440> Supra<00:01:03.890> gingival<00:01:04.370> margin<00:01:04.760> I<00:01:04.909> go<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.150> a

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
a Supra gingival margin I go to a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.690 
a Supra gingival margin I go to a
tapered<00:01:05.810> narrow<00:01:06.620> tip<00:01:06.980> burr<00:01:07.159> when<00:01:07.400> I'm<00:01:07.490> really

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
tapered narrow tip burr when I'm really

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.120 
tapered narrow tip burr when I'm really
close<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.270> gingiva<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:08.960> now<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.040> I've

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
close to the gingiva and now that I've

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.499 
close to the gingiva and now that I've
gone<00:01:10.250> all<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.490> way<00:01:10.520> through<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.880> buckle<00:01:11.210> and

the ACLU's law I'm going to take my
Christensen<00:01:14.390> crown<00:01:14.780> remover<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.890> actually

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
Christensen crown remover and actually

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.249 
Christensen crown remover and actually
go<00:01:16.369> inside<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.790> here<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:17.540> slots<00:01:17.899> a<00:01:18.049> little

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
go inside of here that slots a little

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.749 
go inside of here that slots a little
wider<00:01:18.500> than<00:01:18.710> I'd<00:01:18.860> want<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.189> to<00:01:19.280> be<00:01:19.399> from<00:01:19.700> that

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
wider than I'd want it to be from that

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.999 
wider than I'd want it to be from that
wide<00:01:20.570> diamond<00:01:21.110> but<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.380> white<00:01:21.530> diamond<00:01:21.890> was

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
wide diamond but the white diamond was

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.350 
wide diamond but the white diamond was
more<00:01:22.219> efficient<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.759> boy<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:22.909> can<00:01:23.119> see<00:01:23.270> I'm

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
more efficient and boy you can see I'm

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.209 
more efficient and boy you can see I'm
really<00:01:23.390> having<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.110> crank<00:01:24.680> there<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.100> that

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
really having a crank there and that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.490 
really having a crank there and that
distal<00:01:26.030> half<00:01:26.180> comes<00:01:26.479> popping<00:01:26.990> off<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.380> there

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
distal half comes popping off of there

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.830 
distal half comes popping off of there
and<00:01:27.649> that's<00:01:28.369> not<00:01:28.820> only<00:01:28.969> a<00:01:29.090> testament<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.689> the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
whole mesial half of the crown has not

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.420 
whole mesial half of the crown has not
even<00:01:38.750> moved<00:01:39.020> yet<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:39.829> we've<00:01:39.950> got<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.219> cut

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
even moved yet and so we've got to cut

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.649 
even moved yet and so we've got to cut
through<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.820> again<00:01:41.060> because<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.479> just

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
through that again because you just

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.469 
through that again because you just
can't<00:01:41.899> grab<00:01:42.140> onto<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.590> with<00:01:43.240> rheostats<00:01:44.240> and

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
can't grab onto that with rheostats and

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.149 
can't grab onto that with rheostats and
pull<00:01:44.659> that<00:01:44.810> off<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.289> this<00:01:45.649> is<00:01:45.829> one<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.009> the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
pull that off so this is one of the

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.950 
pull that off so this is one of the
difficulties<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:46.880> these<00:01:47.000> all<00:01:47.210> ceramic<00:01:47.509> crowns

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
difficulties in these all ceramic crowns

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.099 
difficulties in these all ceramic crowns
as<00:01:48.229> opposed<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.740> pfm<00:01:49.250> is<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:50.060> can't<00:01:50.420> bend

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
as opposed to a pfm is you can't bend

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.170 
as opposed to a pfm is you can't bend
the<00:01:51.320> framework<00:01:51.799> Bend<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.490> substructure<00:01:52.969> and

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
the framework Bend the substructure and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.840 
the framework Bend the substructure and
then<00:01:53.390> remove<00:01:53.719> the<00:01:53.899> whole<00:01:54.079> thing<00:01:54.579> when<00:01:55.579> you<00:01:55.700> go

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
then remove the whole thing when you go

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.370 
then remove the whole thing when you go
to<00:01:55.909> bend<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.359> it<00:01:56.509> breaks<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.079> you<00:01:57.140> have<00:01:57.200> to

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
to bend it it breaks and you have to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.069 
to bend it it breaks and you have to
take<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.680> off<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.920> pieces<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.960> typically<00:01:59.960> we're

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
take it off in pieces so typically we're

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.319 
take it off in pieces so typically we're
taking<00:02:00.380> off<00:02:00.530> three<00:02:01.189> maybe<00:02:01.490> four<00:02:01.609> different

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
taking off three maybe four different

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.630 
taking off three maybe four different
pieces<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.780> crown<00:02:03.200> usually<00:02:03.799> for<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.130> would<00:02:04.429> say

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
pieces of crown usually for I would say

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.310 
pieces of crown usually for I would say
so<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:04.969> took<00:02:05.090> up<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.390> first<00:02:05.600> one<00:02:05.840> I'm<00:02:06.049> going<00:02:06.259> to

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
so we took up the first one I'm going to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.279 
so we took up the first one I'm going to
crack<00:02:07.030> through<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.210> mesial<00:02:08.600> marginal<00:02:08.630> Ridge

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
crack through the mesial marginal Ridge

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.800 
crack through the mesial marginal Ridge
and<00:02:09.560> separate<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.340> lingual<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.480> buccal

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
and separate the lingual and buccal

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.930 
and separate the lingual and buccal
portions<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.610> there<00:02:13.610> goes<00:02:13.790> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
portions and there goes the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.190 
portions and there goes the
mesial-buccal<00:02:14.390> portion<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:14.990> crown

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
mesial-buccal portion of the crown

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.290 
mesial-buccal portion of the crown
coming<00:02:15.560> off<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:16.010> actually<00:02:16.760> usually<00:02:17.150> you

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
coming off and actually usually you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.309 
coming off and actually usually you
would<00:02:17.420> have<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.630> cut<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.110> half

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
would have to cut this in half

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.860 
would have to cut this in half
one<00:02:18.620> more<00:02:18.829> time<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.069> get<00:02:19.340> lucky<00:02:19.730> here<00:02:19.939> and<00:02:20.120> just

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
one more time I get lucky here and just

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.869 
one more time I get lucky here and just
push<00:02:21.109> on<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.469> and<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.099> vibration<00:02:22.639> from<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
push on it and the vibration from the

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.459 
push on it and the vibration from the
handpiece<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.450> broken<00:02:23.689> the<00:02:23.900> cement<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.319> bond

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
handpiece is broken the cement and bond

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.830 
handpiece is broken the cement and bond
so<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.769> can<00:02:24.980> actually<00:02:25.159> pull<00:02:25.609> this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
so I can actually pull this

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.140 
so I can actually pull this
mesial-lingual<00:02:26.840> piece<00:02:27.379> off<00:02:28.060> usually<00:02:29.060> you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
mesial-lingual piece off usually you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.899 
mesial-lingual piece off usually you
would<00:02:29.269> have<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.540> cut<00:02:29.749> that<00:02:29.959> in<00:02:30.950> half<00:02:31.010> again<00:02:31.519> and

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
would have to cut that in half again and

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.270 
would have to cut that in half again and
then<00:02:32.749> maybe<00:02:32.900> even<00:02:33.079> prep<00:02:33.469> off<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.859> last<00:02:34.040> little

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
then maybe even prep off the last little

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.119 
then maybe even prep off the last little
eighth<00:02:34.549> of<00:02:34.819> crown<00:02:35.269> from<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:35.689> tooth<00:02:36.109> so<00:02:36.439> again

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
eighth of crown from the tooth so again

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.559 
eighth of crown from the tooth so again
the<00:02:37.250> key<00:02:37.459> point<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.790> remember<00:02:37.879> here<00:02:38.359> is<00:02:38.450> you

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
the key point to remember here is you

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.030 
the key point to remember here is you
need<00:02:38.719> to<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:38.989> one<00:02:39.109> of<00:02:39.200> those<00:02:39.290> fine<00:02:39.650> grit

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
need to have one of those fine grit

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.309 
need to have one of those fine grit
desert<00:02:40.430> cut<00:02:40.700> burs<00:02:41.000> available<00:02:41.719> from<00:02:41.900> axis

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
desert cut burs available from axis

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.199 
desert cut burs available from axis
dental<00:02:42.620> they're<00:02:43.129> also<00:02:43.310> available<00:02:43.609> in<00:02:44.120> the

Brooks or adjustment and polishing kit

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.920 
Brooks or adjustment and polishing kit
so<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.340> do<00:02:46.549> not<00:02:46.730> need<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.060> separate<00:02:47.540> barrettes

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
so you do not need a separate barrettes

so in this introduction to Brooks or

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.569 
so in this introduction to Brooks or
restorations<00:03:09.769> I've<00:03:09.949> mentioned<00:03:10.370> my<00:03:10.519> two

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
restorations I've mentioned my two

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.610 
restorations I've mentioned my two
favorite<00:03:11.209> indications<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.019> first<00:03:12.230> one<00:03:12.469> is

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
favorite indications the first one is

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
better than composite or porcelain so

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.589 
better than composite or porcelain so
