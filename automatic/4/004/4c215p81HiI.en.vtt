00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.960
 Hello 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.840
 two 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.900
 to make these piranhas you need a 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.090
 the clip Clothesline marks 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.010
 silhouette of the clothespin on a paper we 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.010
 we will guide her to draw the strip 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.469
 draw the head of the piranha oriented 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.469
 to the side by which it opens 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.160
 draw a line that separates the part 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.460
 superior of the interior of the body of the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.460
 tail 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.730
 each of them will be stuck in one of 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.730
 the pencil pieces 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.590
 draw your teeth in the city 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.590
 make them in the form of a closure 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 ah 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.950
 cut out the two halves you've drawn 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.250
 You can also skip this step and trace 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.250
 the charm of using tracing paper 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.840
 late 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.360
 ah 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.060
 ah 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.500
 copy them and is cut on a tone 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.630
 with junin 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.880
 now turn the figure and mark the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.150
 backwards so that the pyramid to the side 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.150
 opposite 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.730
 two 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.440
 To decorate them I used enamel 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.570
 gray nails but can be used 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.370
 perfectly painting 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.010
 in fact, I painted the eyes with paint 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.570
 white acrylic also painted white 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.770
 your teeth both from the top 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.770
 as from the bottom 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.629
 so many 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.500
 with it is frozen little taps of 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.540
 orange paint on the front belly 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.550
 and I added some detail with paint 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.550
 plated mainly on the tail 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:08.500
 and let the paint dry between each one 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.500
 of these steps 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.290
 and finally I have reviewed with marker 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.290
 black mouth and eyes 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.770
 two 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.200
 to stick the stone in the clamp uses 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.650
 a glue something strong like silicone 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.510
 hot if you're younger remember that 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.680
 you must do it under the supervision of a 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.780
 adult 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.489
 as I told you previously you should paste 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.350
 carefully each of the parties in 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.210
 the pieces of the clamp 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.920
 try that the teeth fit well 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.710
 so that later the mouth opens and 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.010
 close without difficulty you can decorate 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.360
 also the inside of the cardboard 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.620
 I hope you liked the idea and that 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.170
 inspire you to perform 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.940
