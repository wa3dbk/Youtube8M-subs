it looks just like sugar it's kind of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.600 
it looks just like sugar it's kind of
granulated<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.980> use<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.400> for

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
granulated like that and I use it for

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.490 
granulated like that and I use it for
the<00:02:37.840> tops<00:02:39.040> kind<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.100> like<00:02:40.250> sugar<00:02:40.489> cookies<00:02:41.500> and

then<00:02:43.040> I'm<00:02:43.970> going<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.630> put<00:02:44.870> these<00:02:44.989> in<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> oven

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
then I'm going to put these in the oven

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.250 
then I'm going to put these in the oven
for<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:48.880> don't<00:02:49.880> know<00:02:50.030> about<00:02:50.180> 18<00:02:50.750> minutes<00:02:50.959> is

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
for I don't know about 18 minutes is

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.770 
for I don't know about 18 minutes is
what<00:02:51.470> my<00:02:51.650> oven<00:02:51.950> usually<00:02:52.310> cooks<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.700> at<00:02:52.850> you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
what my oven usually cooks it at you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.780 
what my oven usually cooks it at you
want<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.050> probably<00:02:54.830> check<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.400> little<00:02:55.580> bit

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
want to probably check it a little bit

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.110 
want to probably check it a little bit
before<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:57.260> see<00:02:57.440> how<00:02:57.590> they're<00:02:57.770> looking

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
before that to see how they're looking

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.620 
before that to see how they're looking
I'm<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.239> Colorado<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.050> it's<00:03:00.170> high<00:03:00.560> altitude

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
I'm in Colorado so it's high altitude

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.460 
I'm in Colorado so it's high altitude
probably<00:03:02.630> makes<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.930> little<00:03:03.080> bit<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.320> a

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
probably makes a little bit of a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.620 
probably makes a little bit of a
difference<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.930> also<00:03:06.320> cook<00:03:06.739> on<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.630> pampered

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
difference but I also cook on a pampered

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.949 
difference but I also cook on a pampered
chef<00:03:08.739> stoneware<00:03:09.739> which<00:03:10.040> helps<00:03:10.519> with<00:03:10.760> the

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
chef stoneware which helps with the

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.400 
chef stoneware which helps with the
crisping<00:03:11.959> on<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.320> bottom<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:14.090> time<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.110> put<00:03:15.320> in

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
crisping on the bottom so time to put in

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.640 
crisping on the bottom so time to put in
the<00:03:15.470> oven<00:03:15.590> okay<00:03:16.959> here<00:03:17.959> they<00:03:18.080> are<00:03:18.230> out<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.440> the
