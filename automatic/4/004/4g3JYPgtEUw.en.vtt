automatically it uses a new plug as you
can<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.090> especially<00:00:52.050> wider<00:00:53.039> than<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
can see here especially wider than the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.740 
can see here especially wider than the
original<00:00:54.860> USB<00:00:55.860> plug<00:00:56.250> they've<00:00:56.520> been<00:00:56.760> using<00:00:56.789> not

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
original USB plug they've been using not

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
original USB plug they've been using not
quite<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.109> tall<00:00:58.320> does<00:00:59.100> come<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> data

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
quite as tall does come with a data

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.680 
quite as tall does come with a data
cable<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> box<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:01.020> well<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.219> charger<00:01:02.850> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
cable in the box as well as a charger so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.240 
cable in the box as well as a charger so
you<00:01:03.750> don't<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> worry<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:04.769> buying

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you don't have to worry about buying

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.810 
you don't have to worry about buying
your<00:01:05.729> accessories<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:07.400> phone<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.430> very

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
your accessories for that phone is very

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.210 
your accessories for that phone is very
thin<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.070> actually

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
thin you can see here it's actually

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.630 
thin you can see here it's actually
thinner<00:01:11.640> than<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> original<00:01:12.600> motorola<00:01:12.930> razr

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
thinner than the original motorola razr

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.330 
thinner than the original motorola razr
so<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> those<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:16.340> know

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so if you have one of those you can know

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700 
so if you have one of those you can know
exactly<00:01:17.670> what<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.240> talking<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:19.560> got

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
exactly what we talking about it's got

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
exactly what we talking about it's got
great<00:01:19.890> tactile<00:01:20.369> feedback<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> hit

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
great tactile feedback so when you hit

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.109 
great tactile feedback so when you hit
one<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> buttons<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.820> even<00:01:23.820> actually

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
one of the buttons here even actually

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.630 
one of the buttons here even actually
feel<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> button<00:01:24.659> being<00:01:24.810> pressed<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.490> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
feel the button being pressed and it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780 
feel the button being pressed and it
also<00:01:26.790> has<00:01:26.970> haptics<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> message

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
also has haptics so if you get a message

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
also has haptics so if you get a message
or<00:01:30.180> even<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.600> tap<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.220> feel

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

keypad

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.120 

well<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.580> phone<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:47.000> actually<00:01:47.390> running<00:01:47.630> the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
well the phone is actually running the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.090 
well the phone is actually running the
motorola<00:01:49.130> linux<00:01:49.490> operating<00:01:49.640> system<00:01:51.100> which

the number one z6 also runs so it's a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.970 
the number one z6 also runs so it's a
little<00:01:55.700> bit<00:01:55.970> different<00:01:56.420> than<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.720> ptk<00:01:57.560> system

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
little bit different than the ptk system

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.420 
little bit different than the ptk system
that<00:01:58.130> we've<00:01:58.280> been<00:01:58.460> used<00:01:58.670> two<00:02:00.370> options<00:02:01.370> here
