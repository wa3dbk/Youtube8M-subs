NFL<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.809> Nick<00:00:52.649> Foles<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> better

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
NFL and Nick Foles I think is a better

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
NFL and Nick Foles I think is a better
quarterback<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.100> reliable<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
quarterback and more reliable and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.150 
quarterback and more reliable and
today's<00:00:57.420> healthier<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> don't<00:00:58.559> understand

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
today's healthier so I don't understand

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.849 
today's healthier so I don't understand
why<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.609> would<00:00:59.820> swap<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.660> better<00:01:01.500> quarterback

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
why we would swap a better quarterback

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.850 
why we would swap a better quarterback
for<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> worst<00:01:03.090> quarterback<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.989> am<00:01:04.350> very

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
for a worst quarterback I am very

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.070 
for a worst quarterback I am very
confused<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.850> understand<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:06.990> was

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
confused I understand that there was

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
confused I understand that there was
potential<00:01:07.470> Sam<00:01:08.010> Bradford<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.549> supposed<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
potential Sam Bradford was supposed to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.160 
potential Sam Bradford was supposed to
be<00:01:09.000> good<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.020> don't

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
be good but you know what I don't

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.350 
be good but you know what I don't
believe<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.680> he's<00:01:11.010> had<00:01:11.250> enough<00:01:11.670> time<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.150> try

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
believe it he's had enough time to try

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
believe it he's had enough time to try
and<00:01:12.420> prove<00:01:12.600> himself<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.320> he<00:01:13.680> did<00:01:13.890> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and prove himself and he did it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
and prove himself and he did it
sniffles<00:01:14.939> his<00:01:15.180> luck<00:01:15.479> had<00:01:15.689> less<00:01:15.930> time<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> prove

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
sniffles his luck had less time to prove

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.560 
sniffles his luck had less time to prove
himself<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.070> he's<00:01:17.640> done<00:01:17.880> better<00:01:18.119> than

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
himself and he's done better than

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.719 
himself and he's done better than
Bradford<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:20.100> he's<00:01:20.340> had<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> better

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
Bradford I think he's had a better

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.289 
Bradford I think he's had a better
career<00:01:21.060> than<00:01:21.119> Bradford<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.850> honestly<00:01:23.850> have

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
career than Bradford so I honestly have

he being crazy moves
I<00:02:46.340> think<00:02:47.150> it's<00:02:47.800> depending<00:02:48.800> on<00:02:48.920> what<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.190> terms

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
I think it's depending on what the terms

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.150 
I think it's depending on what the terms
are<00:02:49.730> are<00:02:50.090> there<00:02:50.270> draft<00:02:50.690> picks<00:02:50.990> involved<00:02:51.620> like

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
are are there draft picks involved like

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.090 
are are there draft picks involved like
it<00:02:52.520> cannot<00:02:52.910> be<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> straight<00:02:53.540> up<00:02:53.720> trade<00:02:54.709> like

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100

it cannot be a straight up trade like
the<00:02:55.459> bills<00:02:55.700> trade<00:02:56.090> was<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.540> can't<00:02:56.840> because

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the bills trade was it can't because

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.840
