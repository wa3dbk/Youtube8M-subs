00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 the action of the spirits in the phenomena of 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.320
 nature are due to fortuitous causes 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.170
 or on the contrary all have an end 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.130
 the great phenomena of the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.440
 nature 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.670
 those that are considered as disturbance 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.970
 two elements 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.720
 everything has a reason to be and nothing 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.859
 happens without God's permission 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.720
 always aim for a man 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.869
 phenomena 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 sometimes has as an immediate reason for being 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.930
 the man in most cases meanwhile 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.780
 for the sole purpose of restoring 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.780
 the balance and harmony of the forces 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.820
 of nature 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.180
 we conceive perfectly that the will 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.020
 of God is the primary cause in this as 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 in all 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.570
 but knowing that the spirits exercise 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.940
 action on the matter and what are the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.789
 agents of the will of God 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.859
 we asked if some of them did not 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.409
 exercised some influence over the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.640
 elements to stir them to calm the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.760
 to drive but of course could not 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 to be otherwise listening to an exercise 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.920
 direct action on the matter 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.650
 he finds dedicated agents in all 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.290
 The range of degrees worlds 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.080
 mythology of the ancients was founded 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.210
 entirely spiritual ideas with the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.970
 only difference that they considered the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.430
 spirits as divinities that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.759
 presented these gods or those 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.350
 spirits with special attributions 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.590
 so some were in charge of the winds 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.060
 other other distance to chair the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.799
 phenomenon of vegetation and etc. 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.079
 similar belief is totally 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.649
 unfounded 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.220
 so deprived is the foundation and 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.799
 still far from the truth. 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.350
 then to see spirits that inhabit the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.320
 the interior of the earth and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.800
 the geological phenomena of the spirits in a 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.260
 habit so positively the earth 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.040
 they govern the phenomena and direct them 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.160
 according to the attributions that have a day 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.590
 will come where we will receive the explanation of 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.100
 all these phenomena and the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.220
 will understand better form category 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.670
 especially in the spiritist world the spirits 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.130
 which preside over the phenomena of nature 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.000
 they will be separate beings or spirits that 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:43.290
 were incarnated like us who were or 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.290
 that the will be belong these spirits the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.940
 higher orders or lower orders 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.780
 spiritual hierarchy 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.430
 This is hungry, more or less. 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.200
 more or less intelligent material 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.109
 role they play us 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.739
 execute those who perform things 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:08.310
 materials are always of lower order 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:12.109
 between the spirits and between the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:16.019
 men the production of certain phenomena 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:18.569
 of storms, for example, is the work of a 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.220
 only spirit or many gather 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.220
 informing large masses 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.209
 produce them meet in masses 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.269
 innumerable the spirits who exercise 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.280
 action in the phenomena of nature operate 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.010
 aware of 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.340
 using free will or for effect 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:44.069
 of instinctive owen reflected impulse one 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:48.780
 yes, others have not established a 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.200
 comparison considers these myriads of 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:57.389
 animals that gradually emerge 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:01.260
 dohmann islands and archipelagos believe that 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:03.959
 not at last providence, and that this 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.919
 transforming the Earth's surface not 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.139
 general harmony is required 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.989
 however they are animals of the order finally 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:16.440
 who carry out these works by providing 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:20.489
 their needs and without suspecting 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.620
 which are instruments of god as well 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.430
 in the same way the most 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.889
 offers usefulness to the whole 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.930
 while rehearsing for life before 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.229
 who are fully aware of their 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.860
 acts and are in the full enjoyment of the free 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.860
 arbitration act on certain phenomena of 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.900
 which unconsciously constitute the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.290
 agents 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.229
 first run later when 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.410
 your brains have already reached 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.979
 a certain development ordered and 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.070
 directed to the things of the material world 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.160
 then they can direct those of the rural world 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.130
 This is how it is all good that everything 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.550
 chain in nature since the atom 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:12.030
 primitive to the archangel who also 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.280
 began to be the admirable class of law of 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.160
 harmony that your in the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.400
 spirit has not yet been able to learn 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.400
 set
