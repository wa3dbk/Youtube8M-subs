00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
this and now it's redstone time so one

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630 
this and now it's redstone time so one
redstone<00:01:45.240> dust<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.830> redstone<00:01:47.100> dust

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
redstone dust here one redstone dust

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
redstone dust here one redstone dust
here<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:48.480> then<00:01:49.220> torch<00:01:51.620> torch<00:01:52.730> torch<00:01:53.730> and<00:01:54.560> then

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
here and then torch torch torch and then

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.100 
here and then torch torch torch and then
the<00:01:56.130> most<00:01:56.340> important<00:01:56.910> piece<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.870> pressure

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the most important piece is the pressure

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.770 
the most important piece is the pressure
plate<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.680> then<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.850> run<00:02:00.090> wherever<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
plate and then you can run wherever you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.720 
plate and then you can run wherever you
choose<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.290> run<00:02:01.440> this<00:02:01.650> I'm<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.520> run

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
choose to run this I'm just going to run

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.430 
choose to run this I'm just going to run
this<00:02:02.880> over<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.900> show<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.080> is

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
this over here so you can show that is

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.850 
this over here so you can show that is
working<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.150> need<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.990> put<00:02:07.830> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
working so what you need to do is put a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.090 
working so what you need to do is put a
block<00:02:08.129> then<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> torch<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.479> make<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.920> it's

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
block then a torch to make it so it's

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.710 
block then a torch to make it so it's
oats<00:02:11.340> continuously<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.390> don't<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.600> what<00:02:12.690> you

yeah I'm not a very good redstone person
but<00:02:18.480> anyways<00:02:19.170> we'll<00:02:19.350> get<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:19.860> so

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
it this is can be hidden of course like

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.559 
it this is can be hidden of course like
it<00:02:43.770> would<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:43.920> hidden<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.580> actually<00:02:45.209> except

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
it would be hidden and actually except

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.570 
it would be hidden and actually except
for<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> don't<00:02:45.900> know<00:02:46.200> how<00:02:46.319> we<00:02:46.560> would<00:02:46.860> hide<00:02:47.100> this

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
for I don't know how we would hide this

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.479 
for I don't know how we would hide this
dust<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:48.560> but<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.830> could<00:02:49.980> probably<00:02:50.160> make<00:02:50.430> it

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
dust here but we could probably make it

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.040 
dust here but we could probably make it
back<00:02:50.790> on<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.180> or<00:02:51.269> something<00:02:51.300> I'm<00:02:51.810> sure<00:02:51.959> we

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
back on it or something I'm sure we

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.449 
back on it or something I'm sure we
could<00:02:52.110> figure<00:02:52.260> something<00:02:52.410> out<00:02:52.830> there<00:02:53.040> but

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
could figure something out there but

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.390 
could figure something out there but
like<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.209> say<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.100> really<00:02:56.100> really<00:02:56.130> cool
