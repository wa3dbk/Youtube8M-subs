00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:16.180
 I'm not surprised 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.180
 3 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.450
 and as you can see in the video name 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.060
 this is an application of the effects of 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.340
 AragÃ³n sight and good sounds that do not 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.070
 I had very well thought so that it goes up 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.370
 this application or not but good the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.410
 truth is that the z range is a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:48.330
 application that forgiveness is a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.989
 been to fly the course and 7 is a series 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.829
 that I love and well I guess 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.800
 all in their childhood as they have seen this 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.460
 great series so good I wanted to go up 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.140
 this application because I do not know if there is a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.960
 auto video that has uploaded this but from 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.170
 I wanted to upload it and well this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.720
 application because the truth is that it is very 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.940
 good has all the sounds 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.090
 and is that the truth has been updated and 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.740
 really clear lately they have 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.500
 updated a lot have come out many 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.090
 new sounds I do not know if they are heard 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.439
 everyone 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.439
 wait for me, turn up the volume 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.120
 with many sounds that they can use 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.690
 whether to play or anything like 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.690
 they can use them anyway 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:55.100
 and as you can see, he has most of the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.610
 sounds that come in the series just like 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.250
 that removes the teleportation here 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.250
 I really love that sound 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.030
 and there was an option here is that the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.880
 we can use in fact as tone of 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.000
 call notification tone or for 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.570
 the same messages can be used well 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.760
 how good this is a great application of 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.580
 this series that I really wanted to do 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.980
 this 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.640
 I hope you like it because of good to 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.640
 I love it 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.000
 with my brother I like to do this well 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.359
 Well I hope you liked it and 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.359
 until
