 without his incredible commitment without 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.660
 his intention would be the fc bavaria today 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.770
 not what he is fortunately 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 and represents it is a home game for 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.210

 stand behind him and show that too 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.120
 in the form of minutes of applause

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.670
 tax evasion before court 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.010
 answer for 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.739
 but in his speech he switches quickly 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.799
 I want to attack a few again 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.189
 facts say I do not have hundreds of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.799
 millions made abroad 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.850
 i have no euro untaxed money 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.740
 brought from germany to switzerland 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.720
 I have been tens for many years 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.200
 million euros a personal tax 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.689

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.570

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:31.409
 donated over five million euros 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 I did not take any fees on lectures 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.190
 that has all the advertising revenue for 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.290
 donated to social institutions 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.790

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.170
 in the sole hands of 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.950
 bavaria family lie 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.310
 That's why I decided to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.600
 the process my colleagues or bosses 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.400
 and ask karl hopfner 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.300

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.160
 ask a question of trust 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.440
 I would predict give them the right 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.720
 to decide if I'm still the right one 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.720
 am president of this club 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.530
 the answers are provided by the members in the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.170
 hall on direct ways 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.770
