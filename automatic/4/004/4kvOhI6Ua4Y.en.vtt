 hi little friends and continuing with the course 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.130
 of accordion for children we will know 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:20.900
 our accordion let's start our part 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.910
 right we have the fretboard if which 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.119
 has the buttons that activate the notes 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.490
 musicals behind the fretboard is a 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.840
 correct very important which we 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.239
 it serves to introduce our finger 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.750
 thumb very carefully to have a 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.420
 better grip of the accordion 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.210
 in this part we have the row 7 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.610
 buttons 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.610
 as we all know the notes 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.590
 musicals are do re my fa sun and if in 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.290
 that cord will be very easy to identify 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.949
 Well, since it's over, it's going to correspond 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.960
 two musical notes of the scale 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.430
 spread out well let's start with the first 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.269
 button the first button is do closing and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.269

 we continue with the fourth button the fourth 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.890
 is something vice versa the first three 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.680
 since closing will not be the lowest note 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.710
 but the highest note then we have 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.090

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.160
 that 's how it divides the musical notes in 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.700
 this keyboard 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.400
 in this part we have the grill if 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.160
 This is a small window through which 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.310
 the musical notes in this part 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.100
 we have the table here we have a strap 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.020
 and adjust and here we have another these two 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.030
 they are used to close our portion 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.100
 when and we will not touch when 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.240

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.709
 bellows 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.510
 this little box keeps the air 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.510
 to be able to expel musical notes 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.010
 and on our left side we have the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.380
 low and ends a very interesting button 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.870
 the air button which helps us to 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.300
 open and close much faster than 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.240
 accordion to be able to produce the note 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.240
 required and finally here we have a 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.980
 correct and now with the masters it's true 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.800

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.560
 best portion 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.860
 and finally as you can see here there are 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.630
 one two three and four practices those 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.450
 practices have been done for the 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.150
 Accordion like this 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.500
