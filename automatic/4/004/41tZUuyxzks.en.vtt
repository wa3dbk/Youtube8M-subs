only have to help with step number three
and<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:18.949> is<00:00:19.949> asking<00:00:20.369> us<00:00:20.490> if<00:00:20.670> we'd<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.240> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
computer back to its original state

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.990 
computer back to its original state
that'll<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.130> take<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.520> bit<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> time

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that'll just take a little bit of time

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.819 
that'll just take a little bit of time
it<00:00:33.510> says<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> couple<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> minutes<00:00:34.559> but

it says a couple of minutes but
depending<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.520> our<00:00:35.550> system<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.420> could<00:00:36.630> take

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
depending on our system it could take

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.400 
depending on our system it could take
anywhere<00:00:36.809> from<00:00:37.730> just<00:00:38.730> 30<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.510> 40<00:00:39.809> seconds<00:00:40.260> up

okay I'm just going to demonstrate

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.930 
okay I'm just going to demonstrate
briefly<00:03:01.470> exactly<00:03:02.470> what<00:03:03.130> would<00:03:03.280> happen<00:03:03.640> if<00:03:03.790> you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
briefly exactly what would happen if you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.000 
briefly exactly what would happen if you
at<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.660> point<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.080> program<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.530> start<00:03:05.800> is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
at this point the program is start is

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.949 
at this point the program is start is
set<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:06.700> just<00:03:06.880> need<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.540> run<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.840> we're

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
set and you just need to to run it we're

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.320 
set and you just need to to run it we're
going<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.170> close<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.820> we<00:03:09.940> can<00:03:10.060> show

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
going to close it so that we can show

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.680 
going to close it so that we can show
how<00:03:11.320> that<00:03:11.500> would<00:03:11.620> work<00:03:11.650> from<00:03:12.510> starting<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.600> up

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
how that would work from starting it up

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.229 
how that would work from starting it up
from<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.110> basic<00:03:14.590> program<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.280> double-click

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
from the basic program just double-click

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.530 
from the basic program just double-click
on<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.450> icon<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:18.010> with<00:03:18.160> load<00:03:18.370> it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540
