00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.830
 very good to explain how to get 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.010
 basil seeds 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.110
 when the plant made the flower and it ends 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.500
 drying with we will have ears with 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.500
 our 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.200
 Inside each dry leaf or dry flower 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.510
 we will find a seed 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.510
 they could get around between 45 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.510
 personally 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.070
 the only advantage is that many 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.910
 little leaves then we get many 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.440
 seeds 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 we will simply eradicate them 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:48.460
 and then removing them as I do not have the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.720
 tripod I will teach you as well as for him 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.720
 it's like they 're falling 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.230
 the fact of trying 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.210
 obviously with both hands 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.770
 Like it shows 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.900
 previously that each one of us have 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.780
 this from a spike 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.780
 the waste of the own spike 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.630
 and it is no longer complicated 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.420
 take into account each little seed of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.220
 these when we want a trick will be a 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.990
 new plant 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.500
 and there's nothing better than producing your 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.500
 own seeds 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 and not have to depend on the dea 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.110
 and more when these plants produce 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.910
 so many of the day 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.510
 because these three picked them up a 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.990
 moment of the garden 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.710
 and I still had the plant does not know how much a 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.650
 barbarity but how much will 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.049
 as extra advice I can give is if 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.700
 you want the plant to last longer not 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.130
 hesitate to remove the seeds before 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.890
 that the shape with this plant will have more 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.420
 supply for her food and not 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.720
 will have to devote himself to creating seeds 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.760
 will live much longer 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.130
 and that's it if you liked the video 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.130
 hit like and see you in the next
