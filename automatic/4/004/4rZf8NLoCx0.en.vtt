we have a double strength glass which

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.189 
we have a double strength glass which
works<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.119> very<00:00:30.179> well<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.960> type<00:00:31.170> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
works out very well for this type of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
works out very well for this type of
application<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:32.399> twice<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:32.969> thick<00:00:33.000> as<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
application it's twice as thick as the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
application it's twice as thick as the
single<00:00:33.870> strength<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> say<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
single strength and like I say with the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
single strength and like I say with the
pocketed<00:00:36.180> frame<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:37.260> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
pocketed frame that you have here this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.869 
pocketed frame that you have here this
is<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.800> we'd<00:00:37.950> recommend<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.640> type<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
is what we'd recommend in this type of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.810 
is what we'd recommend in this type of
application<00:00:39.629> okay<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.520> tempered<00:00:41.520> not

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
application okay so tempered not

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.340 
application okay so tempered not
tempered<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.510> situation<00:00:43.050> what<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
tempered in this situation what do you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
tempered in this situation what do you
think<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.640> situation<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
think right in this situation with the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.020 
think right in this situation with the
standard<00:00:46.140> windows<00:00:46.530> tempers<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.489> needed

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
standard windows tempers not needed

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.720 
standard windows tempers not needed
tempered<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> safety<00:00:49.739> glass<00:00:50.010> that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
tempered is actually a safety glass that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270 
tempered is actually a safety glass that
we'd<00:00:50.879> use<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.300> applications<00:00:51.590> on<00:00:52.590> shower<00:00:52.890> doors

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
we'd use in applications on shower doors

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
we'd use in applications on shower doors
and<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:54.030> window<00:00:54.360> applications<00:00:55.110> they'd<00:00:55.320> be

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and in window applications they'd be

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
and in window applications they'd be
used<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.129> actually<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.270> moving<00:00:57.660> door

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
used if it was actually in a moving door

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
used if it was actually in a moving door
or<00:00:58.320> right<00:00:58.559> adjacent<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.399> walkway<00:00:59.730> now<00:01:00.390> we

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
or right adjacent to a walkway now we

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.060 
or right adjacent to a walkway now we
did<00:01:00.930> give<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> measurements<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.859> could

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
did give you measurements so you could

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
did give you measurements so you could
bring<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.550> size<00:01:02.789> glass<00:01:03.059> yeah<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
bring out the right size glass yeah and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
bring out the right size glass yeah and
you<00:01:03.750> also<00:01:03.989> asked<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.400> space<00:01:05.640> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
you also asked about if the space is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.850 
you also asked about if the space is
gonna<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.030> heated<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.409> gonna<00:01:07.619> matter

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
gonna be heated now is that gonna matter

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620 
gonna be heated now is that gonna matter
um<00:01:08.340> no<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> reason<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.119> asked<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.510> was

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
um no the reason I asked if it was

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.410 
um no the reason I asked if it was
heated<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.140> homes<00:01:11.130> most<00:01:11.729> homes<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.299> are

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
heated because homes most homes that are

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.560 
heated because homes most homes that are
heated<00:01:12.750> climate<00:01:13.140> control<00:01:13.470> 24/7<00:01:14.450> typically<00:01:15.450> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
heated climate control 24/7 typically in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
heated climate control 24/7 typically in
Minnesota<00:01:16.020> these<00:01:16.259> days<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.820> double

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
Minnesota these days have the double

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
Minnesota these days have the double
pane<00:01:18.390> glass<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.140> insulated<00:01:19.799> glass<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
pane glass the insulated glass and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
pane glass the insulated glass and
that's<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.600> energy

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that's just for a little more energy

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
that's just for a little more energy
efficiency<00:01:22.560> beings<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.310> type<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.939> shed
