these<00:03:06.410> up<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:07.370> little<00:03:13.180> so<00:03:14.180> they<00:03:14.330> don't<00:03:14.540> get

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
these up a little so they don't get

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.460 
these up a little so they don't get
caught<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.500> sewing<00:03:15.710> machine<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.230> next

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
caught in a sewing machine so the next

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.020 
caught in a sewing machine so the next
step<00:03:22.070> is<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.570> see

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.760 

think<00:03:27.720> I'm<00:03:30.050> sewing<00:03:31.050> machine<00:03:31.350> because<00:03:31.620> it's

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
think I'm sewing machine because it's

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.240 
think I'm sewing machine because it's
quite<00:03:32.010> difficult<00:03:32.490> to<00:03:32.850> get<00:03:33.060> in<00:03:33.270> make<00:03:34.140> sure<00:03:34.440> it's

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
quite difficult to get in make sure it's

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:47.570 
quite difficult to get in make sure it's
all<00:03:35.430> nice<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.670> even<00:03:36.120> at<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.330> bottom<00:03:45.830> and<00:03:46.830> you

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
all nice and even at the bottom and you

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.070 
all nice and even at the bottom and you
start<00:03:47.940> sewing<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:51.090> before<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.630> start<00:03:51.690> sewing

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
start sewing but before you start sewing

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.070 
start sewing but before you start sewing
make<00:03:52.350> sure<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.860> everything<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:54.510> even<00:03:54.959> at

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
make sure that everything is is even at

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.330 
make sure that everything is is even at
the<00:03:55.200> bottom<00:03:55.350> because<00:03:55.709> sometimes<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.550> fabric

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
the bottom because sometimes the fabric

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.660 
the bottom because sometimes the fabric
you<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.520> crunch<00:03:59.760> off<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> little<00:04:01.520> so<00:04:02.520> when

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
you can crunch off a little so when

00:04:02.670 --> 00:05:20.140 
you can crunch off a little so when
you're<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.970> far<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.690> start<00:04:03.990> sewing

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.950

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
then I changed from the straight stitch

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.510 
then I changed from the straight stitch

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.499 
corner of the fabric has gone in it

to do now is we're going to cut that

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.009 
to do now is we're going to cut that
excess<00:06:18.839> fabric<00:06:19.339> with<00:06:20.339> the<00:06:20.459> lace<00:06:20.639> top<00:06:20.969> now<00:06:21.749> very

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:22.019 
excess fabric with the lace top now very

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:24.889 
excess fabric with the lace top now very
gently<00:06:22.110> so<00:06:22.769> you<00:06:23.069> don't<00:06:23.219> drag<00:06:23.759> cut<00:06:24.029> into<00:06:24.389> actual

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:24.899 
gently so you don't drag cut into actual

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:30.619 
gently so you don't drag cut into actual
jeans<00:06:28.399> it<00:06:29.399> doesn't<00:06:29.729> have<00:06:29.819> to<00:06:29.969> be<00:06:30.089> perfect

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:30.629 
jeans it doesn't have to be perfect

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.189 
jeans it doesn't have to be perfect
because<00:06:31.789> and<00:06:32.789> don't<00:06:33.149> worry<00:06:33.419> about<00:06:33.569> the<00:06:33.899> edges

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
because and don't worry about the edges

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.959 
because and don't worry about the edges
they<00:06:34.379> will<00:06:34.559> shred<00:06:34.739> a<00:06:34.800> little<00:06:35.219> but<00:06:35.519> it<00:06:35.669> doesn't

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
they will shred a little but it doesn't

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.790 
they will shred a little but it doesn't
matter<00:06:36.119> because<00:06:36.389> it's<00:06:36.689> well<00:06:36.899> secured<00:06:37.349> by

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
matter because it's well secured by

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:56.679 
matter because it's well secured by
using<00:06:38.069> this<00:06:38.339> stage<00:06:40.759> so<00:06:41.759> you<00:06:41.819> put<00:06:42.149> around<00:06:42.419> it

00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:56.689 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:02.019 

that<00:06:58.189> so<00:06:59.189> that's<00:06:59.399> the<00:06:59.579> inside<00:06:59.909> of<00:07:00.779> the<00:07:00.959> patch

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:02.029 
that so that's the inside of the patch

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:05.509 
that so that's the inside of the patch
and<00:07:03.029> this<00:07:03.329> is<00:07:03.509> the<00:07:03.659> outside<00:07:04.079> I<00:07:04.379> quite<00:07:05.039> like<00:07:05.279> the

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:05.519 
and this is the outside I quite like the

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:08.689 
and this is the outside I quite like the
idea<00:07:05.549> with<00:07:06.359> the<00:07:06.479> lace<00:07:06.629> I<00:07:07.369> like<00:07:08.369> the<00:07:08.519> way<00:07:08.639> it

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
idea with the lace I like the way it

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.029 
idea with the lace I like the way it
