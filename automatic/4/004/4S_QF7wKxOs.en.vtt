of out of it

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.350 
of out of it
for<00:00:11.730> about<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.030> year<00:00:12.450> or<00:00:12.690> two<00:00:13.200> now<00:00:14.000> but<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.030> mean<00:00:15.330> I

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
for about a year or two now but I mean I

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.570 
for about a year or two now but I mean I
figured<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.109> would<00:00:16.260> start<00:00:16.400> making<00:00:17.400> videos

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580

figured I would start making videos
again<00:00:18.119> everyone<00:00:18.779> has<00:00:18.990> been<00:00:19.140> suggesting<00:00:19.410> would

again everyone has been suggesting would

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.359 
again everyone has been suggesting would
do<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.640> again<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.920> thought<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.310> would

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
do that again so I just thought I would

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.509 
do that again so I just thought I would
start<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.119> what's<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.619> what's<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.310> my

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
start with what's in your what's in my

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.230 
start with what's in your what's in my
bag<00:00:26.789> video<00:00:27.680> it's<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> couple<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.090> those
