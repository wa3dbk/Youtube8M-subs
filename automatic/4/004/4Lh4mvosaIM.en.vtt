00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
suite last season at Joe Louis Arena and

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.799

for<00:01:00.960> every<00:01:01.350> game<00:01:01.559> these<00:01:02.250> seats<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.850> filled<00:01:03.420> we

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
for every game these seats are filled we

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.190

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
so I think we had about 430 guests I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
so I think we had about 430 guests I
think<00:01:11.280> last<00:01:11.520> year<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.540> kid<00:01:12.780> it's

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
think last year not just a kid it's

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.039 
think last year not just a kid it's
their<00:01:14.549> whole<00:01:14.700> family<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> whole<00:01:15.659> family

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
their whole family so the whole family

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.060 
their whole family so the whole family
can<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.350> something<00:01:16.770> together<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.460> hopefully

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070
