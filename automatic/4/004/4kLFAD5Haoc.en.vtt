00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.250
 the new line for glass manufacturing that we inaugurate today 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.780
 represented such an example in the use of cutting-edge technology 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:14.219
 and generation of high value-added products 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.400
 this oven that 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.050
 one of the largest in the world and surely the most modern so far 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.239
 strengthen sandoval 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.300
 in its position in the international market 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.710
 and strengthens Mexico as an investment destination 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.180
 because it has the largest float glass line in the world 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.780
 and that suits the company 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.550
 and it suits our country 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.070
 this expansion this new production line that cost approximately 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 130 million dollars 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.610
 gender almost six thousand jobs during its construction 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 more than 100 new permanent jobs that will be incorporated 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.130
 to the workforce of almost 1,000 workers of San GabÃ¡n 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.200
 in this industrial zone 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.340
 also with the construction of this production line 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.140
 are going to elaborate in Mexico products that are currently importing the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.970
 country 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.200
 and they are going to generate additionally to these imports that are canceled 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.350
 exports 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.780
 in the amount of 60 million dollars 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 that will benefit our trade balance 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.730
 investments like this 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.030
 they are of great benefit for mexico 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.840
 not only because these two increase by passions 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.160
 but because it allows mexico to acquire adapt new technologies 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.500
 that the much more skilled workforce was developed 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.860
 much more specialized 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.710
 and that productive chains are built cadavers more is also sophisticated 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.520
 that puts mexico 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.369
 as investment destination 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.110
 and production 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.070
 increasingly specialized and increasingly privileged 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.570
 that in turn will allow us to improve the economic performance of the country 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.409
 better jobs for Mexicans and Mexicans 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.159
 good example of these positive effects is 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.969
 what is happening in the state of morelos that is in the process of 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.179
 become 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.719
 in a key industrial zone 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.469
 for the life of the country 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.469
 here already inputs of other productive chains are produced 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.310
 with which we not only strengthen the country's productive plant 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.780
 but new development opportunities open up for Morelos 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.819
 and for Mexicans here in our own land 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.569
 to continue growing 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.759
 to be able to grow faster 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.909
 to generate more employment 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.049
 more jobs than corks 150 thousand new jobs 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.179
 that were generated in Mexico last year 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:55.569
 we need to continue 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.559
 promoting investment 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.729
 We need to modernize our production plant 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.149
 we need to continue making reforms that allow 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:09.609
 that the productive apparatus of the country will be the most efficient hyde 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.899
 most competitive in the world 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:14.029
 we are more investment 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.499
 more public investment plus private investment 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.309
 more national investment 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.189
 more global investment 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.249
 and to bring that investment 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:27.439
 we need to generate the conditions that make that investment 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.779
 he sits 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.779

 we formally installed the high level committee mexico france 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.440
 that will be focused to bring more and more 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.229
 to our country 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.819
 when I met with President Sarkozy 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.989
 in paris a few months ago 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.449
 we agreed 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.919
 create a high level committee ie a committee formed 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.189
 by leading personalities of the company in the field of 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:01.809
 culture 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:07.069
 to get closer to mexico and franz today we meet this morning precisely 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.509
 in the state of morelos 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.899
 and this investment that today we inaugurate a tango bar 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.439
 It is a good faith sample 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:21.639
 is a concrete sample of the purpose of approaching the investment trade 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.990
 the culture between both countries 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.849
 I want to invite all the investors 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.069
 take advantage of the comparative advantages offered by mexico 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.240
 our extensive network of commercial treaties that gives us access 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.149
 To over 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.780
 to the high commercial exchange that we have in the geographical position that 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.110
 we have North America in short 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.270
 we are as a government of more boosting diversification 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.090

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.139
 remarkably and our purpose is to increase the causes more 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.870
