one<00:00:00.359> of<00:00:00.420> the<00:00:00.510> questions<00:00:00.870> that<00:00:00.930> always<00:00:01.260> comes

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
one of the questions that always comes

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.949 
one of the questions that always comes
up<00:00:01.620> about<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.100> tearing<00:00:02.429> wines<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.720> fact

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
up about the tearing wines is the fact

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.260 
up about the tearing wines is the fact
that<00:00:04.080> we<00:00:04.230> don't<00:00:04.410> use<00:00:04.620> sulfites<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:06.150> issue

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
that we don't use sulfites the issue

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.810 
that we don't use sulfites the issue
around<00:00:06.629> sulfites<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.500> essentially<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.610> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
around sulfites is essentially it's a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.030 
around sulfites is essentially it's a
preservative<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.990> that's<00:00:10.440> added<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.769> wine

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
preservative that that's added to wine

taken<00:00:45.539> away<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.649> has<00:00:46.800> always<00:00:46.950> been<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
taken away but this has always been a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.560 
taken away but this has always been a
very<00:00:48.020> complex<00:00:49.020> issue<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:50.010> our<00:00:50.219> wines

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
very complex issue about our wines

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.850 
very complex issue about our wines
people<00:00:51.570> sometimes<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> gets<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> way<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
people sometimes it gets in the way of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
people sometimes it gets in the way of
what<00:00:53.039> people<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.610> about<00:00:54.020> in<00:00:55.020> terms<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
what people think about in terms of the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.450 
what people think about in terms of the
wine<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.989> we're<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.949> makes<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
wine that we're what makes that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
wine that we're what makes that
difference<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> things<00:01:01.440> I

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
difference and one of the things I

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280 
difference and one of the things I
firmly<00:01:02.070> believe<00:01:02.510> it's<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.690> opinion<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
firmly believe it's my opinion is that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.030 
firmly believe it's my opinion is that
so2<00:01:04.949> sulfur<00:01:05.129> dioxide<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.180> poison<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
so2 sulfur dioxide is a poison and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.380 
so2 sulfur dioxide is a poison and
essentially<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.280> should<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:08.939> any<00:01:09.090> food

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
essentially it should not be in any food

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.859 
essentially it should not be in any food
product<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.810> were<00:01:10.320> ingesting<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.850> think<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
product that were ingesting I think that

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.070 
product that were ingesting I think that
so2<00:01:13.560> inhibits<00:01:14.220> obviously<00:01:15.119> inhibits<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> not

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
so2 inhibits obviously inhibits the not

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
so2 inhibits obviously inhibits the not
in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.259> native<00:01:16.619> East<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.490> use<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.880> use

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
in the native East that we use we use

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.600 
in the native East that we use we use
natural<00:01:18.150> yeast<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:18.869> our<00:01:18.930> fermentation

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
natural yeast and all our fermentation

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.450 
natural yeast and all our fermentation
it<00:01:20.610> also<00:01:20.759> gets<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> way<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.080> fruit

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
it also gets in the way of the fruit

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.440 
it also gets in the way of the fruit
there's<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.610> allow<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> fruit<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
there's and allow the fruit to be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.179 
there's and allow the fruit to be
expressed<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.200> well<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> could<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
expressed and as well as it could be in

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.969 
expressed and as well as it could be in
the<00:01:26.280> wine<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:27.420> importantly<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.439> really

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the wine but more importantly it really

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
the wine but more importantly it really
diminishes<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.390> if<00:01:30.540> used<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:30.990> high<00:01:31.110> enough

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
diminishes and if used at high enough

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.660 
diminishes and if used at high enough
levels<00:01:31.799> takes<00:01:32.579> away<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:34.290> our<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.100> taste<00:01:35.400> of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
levels takes away to our the taste of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.760 
levels takes away to our the taste of
Earth<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.240> sense<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.780> place<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.320> wine<00:01:37.500> which

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
Earth the sense of place of a wine which

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
Earth the sense of place of a wine which
i<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.280> probably<00:01:39.150> one<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> most

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
i think is probably one of the most

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.880 
i think is probably one of the most
important<00:01:40.619> aspects<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.280> wine<00:01:42.180> wine<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:43.680> for

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
important aspects of wine wine would for

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.249 
important aspects of wine wine would for
that<00:01:44.100> matter<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.670> food<00:01:45.000> should<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:46.020> have

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that matter all food should really have

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.560 
that matter all food should really have
an<00:01:46.500> expression<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.250> where<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> came<00:01:47.759> from<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
an expression of where it came from it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
an expression of where it came from it
should<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.020> able<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.560> taste<00:01:50.399> taste<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
should really be able to taste taste the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.990 
should really be able to taste taste the
produce<00:01:51.720> taste<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.350> meat<00:01:52.560> taste<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.640> fruit

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
produce taste the meat taste the fruit

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.840 
produce taste the meat taste the fruit
taste<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.659> wine<00:01:54.840> taste<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.530> beer<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> really

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
taste the wine taste the beer and really

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.450 
taste the wine taste the beer and really
give<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> consumer<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:59.009> clear<00:01:59.430> idea

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
give to the consumer a very clear idea

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.429 
give to the consumer a very clear idea
that<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.180> actually<00:02:00.600> came<00:02:00.840> from<00:02:00.869> somewhere

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
that this actually came from somewhere

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.459 
that this actually came from somewhere
and<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.159> think<00:02:02.369> using<00:02:02.969> organic<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.020> biodynamic

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
and I think using organic and biodynamic

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.050 
and I think using organic and biodynamic
growing<00:02:05.340> methods<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.770> limiting<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.670> use<00:02:08.879> of

growing methods and limiting the use of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.479 
growing methods and limiting the use of
any<00:02:09.239> chemicals<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.899> our<00:02:10.379> food<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
any chemicals in our food it's going to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.640 
any chemicals in our food it's going to
make<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> huge<00:02:11.910> difference<00:02:12.540> no<00:02:12.720> I'm<00:02:12.900> saying

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
make a huge difference no I'm saying

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.300 
make a huge difference no I'm saying
not<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.129> much<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.519> trying<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:16.010> convince<00:02:17.010> or

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
not so much as trying to convince or

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.270 
not so much as trying to convince or
criticize<00:02:18.090> other<00:02:18.750> ways<00:02:19.379> that<00:02:19.650> wine<00:02:19.890> are<00:02:20.099> made

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
criticize other ways that wine are made

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.429 
criticize other ways that wine are made
this<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> way<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.450> choose<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.290> it

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
this is a way that we choose to do it

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.559 
this is a way that we choose to do it
and<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.769> think<00:02:22.879> we<00:02:23.879> should<00:02:23.939> be<00:02:24.180> given<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> same

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
and I think we should be given the same

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.410 
and I think we should be given the same
respect<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.470> all<00:02:25.739> other<00:02:26.400> wines<00:02:26.730> are<00:02:26.939> given<00:02:27.239> I

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
respect that all other wines are given I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.500 
respect that all other wines are given I
mean<00:02:27.930> there's<00:02:28.110> plenty<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:29.269> choices<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.420> I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
mean there's plenty of choices and I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.539 
mean there's plenty of choices and I
think<00:02:30.540> that's<00:02:30.900> what<00:02:31.109> as<00:02:31.319> human<00:02:31.890> beings<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.430> as

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
think that's what as human beings and as

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.720 
think that's what as human beings and as
adults<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.780> really<00:02:34.019> need<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.829> to<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.099> choices

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
adults we really need is to have choices

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.339 
adults we really need is to have choices
and<00:02:35.909> that's<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.629> really<00:02:36.870> putting<00:02:37.200> out

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
and that's what I'm really putting out

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.559 
and that's what I'm really putting out
there<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.799> think<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.909> aspect<00:02:39.390> of

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
there I think that in the aspect of

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.599 
there I think that in the aspect of
truth<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.989> labeling<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.560> go<00:02:40.680> hand<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.069> hand<00:02:41.129> I

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
truth of labeling and go hand in hand I

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.839 
truth of labeling and go hand in hand I
think<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.840> know<00:02:43.099> whatever<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:44.370> put<00:02:44.549> into

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
think that you know whatever is put into

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.240 
think that you know whatever is put into
any<00:02:45.000> food<00:02:45.269> product<00:02:45.599> should<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.650> listed<00:02:46.889> on<00:02:47.129> the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
and stop buying it I think I don't think

and stop buying it I think I don't think
that's<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.949> issue<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.579> product<00:03:21.180> as<00:03:21.329> simple<00:03:21.720> as

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
that's the issue a product as simple as

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.580 
that's the issue a product as simple as
Twinkies<00:03:22.290> has<00:03:22.889> complete<00:03:23.400> label<00:03:24.590> disclosure

Twinkies has complete label disclosure

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.379 
Twinkies has complete label disclosure
and<00:03:26.010> they're<00:03:26.609> sure<00:03:26.790> not<00:03:26.819> going<00:03:27.180> out<00:03:27.299> of

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
and they're sure not going out of

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.479 
and they're sure not going out of
business<00:03:27.569> with<00:03:27.900> them<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.349> I<00:03:28.620> think<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.280> very

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
business with them so I think the very

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.050 
business with them so I think the very
first<00:03:29.790> step<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.500> really<00:03:31.680> get<00:03:31.919> some<00:03:32.730> truth

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
first step is to really get some truth

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.400 
first step is to really get some truth
in<00:03:33.180> labeling<00:03:33.329> going<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:34.019> our<00:03:34.859> wine<00:03:35.190> industry
