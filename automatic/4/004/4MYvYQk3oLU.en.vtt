00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
about well we come to set the first day

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.900 
about well we come to set the first day
and<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:57.410> it<00:01:57.800> was<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:57.980> there<00:01:58.340> our<00:01:58.460> chemistry

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
and and it was just there our chemistry

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.970 
and and it was just there our chemistry
our<00:01:58.970> best<00:01:59.300> friendship<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.260> was<00:02:00.440> really<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.950> was

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
our best friendship it was really it was

our best friendship it was really it was
really<00:02:01.310> there<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.640> think<00:02:01.700> that's<00:02:02.000> what

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
really there and I think that's what

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.840 
really there and I think that's what
really<00:02:03.010> influences<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.040> storyline<00:02:04.550> in<00:02:04.730> that

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
really influences the storyline in that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.670 
really influences the storyline in that

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.000 
eyes on other people in the school and
and<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.300> think<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:18.050> I'm<00:02:18.410> interested<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.950> see

and I think and I I'm interested to see
where<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.340> goes<00:02:19.580> because<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.060> think<00:02:20.240> there's

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
where that goes because I think there's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.840 
where that goes because I think there's
always<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:20.870> something<00:02:20.990> there<00:02:21.470> for<00:02:21.950> Beth
