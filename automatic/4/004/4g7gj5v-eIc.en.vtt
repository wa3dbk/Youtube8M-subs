see<00:03:07.260> great<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:07.770> no<00:03:08.720> no<00:03:14.269> well<00:03:17.870> okay<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.320> shows<00:03:19.620> up

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
see great so no no well okay it shows up

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.030 
see great so no no well okay it shows up
occasionally<00:03:20.550> i<00:03:20.580> think<00:03:20.970> that's<00:03:21.180> what<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.600> is

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
occasionally i think that's what it is

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.810 
occasionally i think that's what it is
um<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.519> could<00:03:23.700> go<00:03:24.090> down<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.390> durability<00:03:24.989> I

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
um it could go down a durability I

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.070 
um it could go down a durability I
haven't<00:03:26.820> completely<00:03:27.209> tested<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:27.930> that's

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
haven't completely tested it but that's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
haven't completely tested it but that's
my<00:03:28.320> theory<00:03:28.620> on<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.400> don't<00:03:30.300> like<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.870> at<00:03:31.050> all

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
my theory on it I don't like it at all

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.759 
my theory on it I don't like it at all
it's<00:03:32.100> great<00:03:32.310> for<00:03:32.459> beginners<00:03:32.840> can't<00:03:33.840> stand<00:03:34.320> it

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769
