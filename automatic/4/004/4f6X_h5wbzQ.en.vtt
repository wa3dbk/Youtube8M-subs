in<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.570> video<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.959> will<00:00:04.140> be<00:00:04.410> constructing<00:00:05.220> the

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
in this video I will be constructing the

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.049 
in this video I will be constructing the
in-center<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.400> inscribed<00:00:08.400> circle<00:00:08.670> within

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
in-center and inscribed circle within

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.310 
in-center and inscribed circle within
triangle<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.840> CT<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:11.540> construct<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.900> centre

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
triangle a CT to construct the in centre

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.499 
triangle a CT to construct the in centre
of<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.500> triangle

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
of a triangle

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.410 
of a triangle
we<00:00:15.509> need<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.990> bisect<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:17.490> least<00:00:17.850> two<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
we need to bisect at least two of the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.929 
we need to bisect at least two of the
angles<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.199> I'm<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.680> bisect<00:00:19.890> angle<00:00:20.580> T

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
angles so I'm going to bisect angle T

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.060 
angles so I'm going to bisect angle T
and<00:00:22.010> angle<00:00:23.010> C<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.390> first<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:25.019> mark<00:00:25.230> two

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and angle C to do this first we mark two

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.650 
and angle C to do this first we mark two
arcs<00:00:26.970> through<00:00:28.099> side<00:00:29.099> ta<00:00:29.720> inside<00:00:30.720> TC<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.660> from

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
arcs through side ta inside TC and from

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.299 
arcs through side ta inside TC and from
each<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.989> those<00:00:34.110> intersections<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:35.070> going

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
each of those intersections we're going

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.360 
each of those intersections we're going
to<00:00:35.460> strike<00:00:35.790> another<00:00:36.059> arc<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.149> can

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
to strike another arc so that we can

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:49.850 
to strike another arc so that we can
make<00:00:41.370> our<00:00:41.550> angle<00:00:41.820> bisector<00:00:48.200> we<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.559> draw

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
make our angle bisector we can then draw

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.229 
make our angle bisector we can then draw
ray<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.390> ray<00:00:52.219> which<00:00:53.219> bisects<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.940> angle<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
ray this ray which bisects the angle and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.420 
ray this ray which bisects the angle and
you<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> divides<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> angle<00:00:55.739> nicely

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you can see it divides the angle nicely

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.750 
you can see it divides the angle nicely
into<00:00:56.670> two<00:00:56.879> parts<00:00:57.949> then<00:00:58.949> we'll<00:00:59.190> repeat<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
into two parts then we'll repeat the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
into two parts then we'll repeat the
same<00:00:59.940> process<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.510> angle<00:01:01.020> C<00:01:01.050> placing<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
same process for angle C placing the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.299 
same process for angle C placing the
stylus<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.699> C<00:01:03.739> striking<00:01:04.739> an<00:01:04.860> arc<00:01:04.979> through

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
stylus on C striking an arc through

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.320 
stylus on C striking an arc through
again<00:01:05.729> TC<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.040> segment<00:01:08.040> CA<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.970> from

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
again TC and segment CA and then from

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
again TC and segment CA and then from
each<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.720> those<00:01:12.869> intersection<00:01:13.590> points<00:01:13.619> will

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
each of those intersection points will

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.880 
each of those intersection points will
strike<00:01:14.400> arcs<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.229> construct<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
strike arcs so that we can construct the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
strike arcs so that we can construct the
bisector<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.240> as<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.450> lay<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:24.810> compass

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
bisector and as you lay your compass

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.399 
bisector and as you lay your compass
down<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.580> pick<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> straightedge<00:01:27.600> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
down and pick up the straightedge you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.630 
down and pick up the straightedge you
want<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> make<00:01:28.829> sure<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.340> straight

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
want to make sure that your straight

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
want to make sure that your straight
edge<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.479> carefully<00:01:31.049> aligned<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
edge is very carefully aligned so that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.630 
edge is very carefully aligned so that
you<00:01:32.450> go<00:01:33.450> through<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> center<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.409> the

you go through the center of the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.179 
you go through the center of the
intersections<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:39.200> once<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.740> we've

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
intersections and once we do that we've

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
intersections and once we do that we've
got<00:01:41.460> our<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.850> center<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.299> point<00:01:42.720> of

order<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.170> construct<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.009> inscribed<00:01:47.729> circle

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
order to construct the inscribed circle

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.889 
order to construct the inscribed circle
we<00:01:48.420> need<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.439> distance<00:01:49.860> from<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.720> in

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
we need to know the distance from the in

we need to know the distance from the in
center<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> three<00:01:54.360> sides<00:01:54.659> because

center to one of the three sides because

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.959 
center to one of the three sides because
we<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> conjecture<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.280> says<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> in

we have a conjecture that says the in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.880 
we have a conjecture that says the in
center<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.479> equally<00:01:57.810> distant<00:01:58.259> from<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> three

sides of a triangle so to do that we

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
going to use side C T which that's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.770 
going to use side C T which that's

each of those intersections will strike
two<00:02:25.319> arcs<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.739> create<00:02:26.069> another<00:02:26.340> intersection

two arcs to create another intersection

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.229 
two arcs to create another intersection
and<00:02:27.810> we'll<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.799> nice<00:02:29.040> perpendicular<00:02:29.909> from

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.410 
segment represents the distance and the
radius<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.390> inscribed<00:02:45.840> circle<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
radius of the inscribed circle so the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.649 
radius of the inscribed circle so the
distance<00:02:48.810> from<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> center<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:50.420> side<00:02:51.420> of

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
distance from the center to the side of

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.819 
distance from the center to the side of
the<00:02:51.780> triangle<00:02:54.139> next<00:02:55.139> we<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> set<00:02:55.799> our

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
the triangle next we want to set our

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.839 
the triangle next we want to set our
compass<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.700> length<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.319> we<00:02:58.319> can<00:02:58.849> strike

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
compass to that length and we can strike

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:07.399 
compass to that length and we can strike
a<00:02:59.879> circle<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:04.549> we<00:03:05.549> can<00:03:05.730> see<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:07.139> touches

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
a circle and we can see that it touches

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.099 
a circle and we can see that it touches
all<00:03:07.799> three<00:03:08.099> sides<00:03:08.340> very<00:03:08.670> nicely<00:03:08.939> of<00:03:09.840> our

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
all three sides very nicely of our

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.559 
all three sides very nicely of our
triangle<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:11.819> concludes<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
triangle and that concludes the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.220 
triangle and that concludes the
construction<00:03:13.349> of<00:03:13.500> both<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.159> in<00:03:14.430> center<00:03:15.000> and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
construction of both the in center and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.099 
construction of both the in center and
the<00:03:16.230> inscribed<00:03:16.769> circle
