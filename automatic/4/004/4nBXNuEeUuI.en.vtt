hello<00:00:04.620> mark<00:00:04.950> here<00:00:05.220> from<00:00:05.250> jazz<00:00:05.790> guitar<00:00:06.090> lessons

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
hello mark here from jazz guitar lessons

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.000 
hello mark here from jazz guitar lessons
dotnet<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.229> a<00:00:07.260> follow<00:00:07.529> up<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.769> the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
dotnet so this is a follow up to the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.780 
dotnet so this is a follow up to the
drop<00:00:08.309> two<00:00:08.610> video<00:00:08.990> so<00:00:09.990> today<00:00:10.050> drop<00:00:10.650> three<00:00:11.040> one

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
drop two video so today drop three one

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.030 
drop two video so today drop three one
number<00:00:12.089> above<00:00:12.330> we're<00:00:13.169> going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.410> go<00:00:13.620> pretty

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
number above we're going to go pretty

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.799 
number above we're going to go pretty
much<00:00:14.099> do<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> same<00:00:14.459> process<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> ideas<00:00:15.570> I

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
much do the same process the ideas I

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.770 
much do the same process the ideas I
think<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:16.950> learn<00:00:17.130> drop<00:00:17.670> threes<00:00:18.000> or

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
think that you can learn drop threes or

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.360 
think that you can learn drop threes or
drop<00:00:19.080> 2s<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.380> three<00:00:19.590> steps<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:20.010> first<00:00:20.160> step

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
drop 2s and three steps the first step

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.340 
drop 2s and three steps the first step
being<00:00:20.550> understanding<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> theory<00:00:21.870> but<00:00:22.140> just

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
being understanding the theory but just

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.290 
being understanding the theory but just
how<00:00:22.710> does<00:00:22.770> it<00:00:23.130> know<00:00:23.610> where<00:00:23.850> does<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.120> come<00:00:24.240> from

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
how does it know where does it come from

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.690 
how does it know where does it come from
really<00:00:24.870> and<00:00:25.050> then<00:00:25.770> finding<00:00:26.040> a<00:00:26.190> good<00:00:26.370> fingering

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
really and then finding a good fingering

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.640 
really and then finding a good fingering
then<00:00:27.210> playing<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.750> through<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> scales<00:00:28.350> those

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
then playing it through the scales those

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.910 
then playing it through the scales those
are<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.250> three<00:00:30.120> steps<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.600> so<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.650> first

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
are the three steps really so the first

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.729 
are the three steps really so the first
idea<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.700> understand<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> drop<00:00:33.540> 3<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.140> once

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
idea to understand a drop 3 is once

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.829 
idea to understand a drop 3 is once
again<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.249> go<00:00:35.460> back<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.089> to<00:00:36.449> look<00:00:36.629> at<00:00:36.809> what

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
again to go back and to look at what

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.110 
again to go back and to look at what
arrangers<00:00:37.679> did<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.039> where<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.339> terminology

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
arrangers did and where the terminology

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.939 
arrangers did and where the terminology
comes<00:00:39.329> from<00:00:39.539> so<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.109> you<00:00:40.199> look<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.499> voicing

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
comes from so if you look at a voicing

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.590 
comes from so if you look at a voicing
oh<00:00:41.100> yeah<00:00:41.309> today<00:00:41.730> we're<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
oh yeah today we're going to be in the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:55.099 
oh yeah today we're going to be in the
key<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.749> G<00:00:43.050> major<00:00:44.629> G<00:00:45.629> G<00:00:52.940> ok<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.179> let's<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.510> look

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
key of G major G G ok so let's just look

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.799 
key of G major G G ok so let's just look
at<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.319> G<00:00:55.739> major<00:00:56.069> 7<00:00:56.429> voicing<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.179> now<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.510> don't

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
at a G major 7 voicing and now we don't

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.540 
at a G major 7 voicing and now we don't
really<00:00:57.929> have<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.319> practical<00:00:58.769> way<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.069> play<00:00:59.339> this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
really have a practical way to play this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.079 
really have a practical way to play this
open<00:00:59.909> unless<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.749> something<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.379> this

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
open unless we do something like this

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.910 
open unless we do something like this
with<00:01:03.089> we<00:01:03.659> need<00:01:03.809> an<00:01:03.929> F<00:01:04.050> sharp<00:01:04.080> note<00:01:04.379> somewhere

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
with we need an F sharp note somewhere

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.330 
with we need an F sharp note somewhere
right<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.780> there's<00:01:06.780> no<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.290> good<00:01:07.680> way<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
right so there's no really good way to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.859 
right so there's no really good way to
play<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.820> thirds<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> chord<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
play it in thirds but the chord the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
play it in thirds but the chord the
notes<00:01:10.200> within<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.649> chord<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.070> G<00:01:12.290> B<00:01:13.290> D<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.399> F

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
notes within the chord is G B D and F

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.499 
notes within the chord is G B D and F
sharp<00:01:17.090> D<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.840> sure<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> principle<00:01:20.880> behind

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
sharp D I'm sure the principle behind

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.560 
sharp D I'm sure the principle behind
the<00:01:21.719> drop<00:01:22.079> 3<00:01:22.920> voicing<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.060> take<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.329> 3rd

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the drop 3 voicing is to take the 3rd

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.899 
the drop 3 voicing is to take the 3rd
note<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.079> the<00:01:25.229> top<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.340> take<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> down<00:01:26.759> an

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
note from the top and to take it down an

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.300 
note from the top and to take it down an
octave<00:01:27.000> once<00:01:27.600> again<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.950> comes<00:01:29.219> from

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
octave once again as this comes from

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
octave once again as this comes from
arranging<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.329> arranging<00:01:30.780> for

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
arranging really arranging for

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
arranging really arranging for
orchestras<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> when<00:01:32.369> you're<00:01:32.490> right<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.850> 4

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
orchestras and when you're right for 4

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.810 
orchestras and when you're right for 4
horns<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.780> violins<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.740> stuff<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.039> that<00:01:35.189> so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
horns and violins and stuff like that so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.569 
horns and violins and stuff like that so
the<00:01:36.149> drop<00:01:36.450> 3<00:01:37.109> all<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.829> theory<00:01:38.039> you<00:01:38.250> need<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the drop 3 all the theory you need to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.090 
the drop 3 all the theory you need to
know<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.630> no<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.320> need<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> learning<00:01:41.039> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
know is not no really need to learning a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.859 
know is not no really need to learning a
bunch<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.369> scales<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.880> modes<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:42.600> going

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
bunch of scales and modes and then going

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.539 
bunch of scales and modes and then going
for<00:01:43.049> progressions<00:01:43.469> don't<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:44.340> thing

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
for progressions don't know the thing

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.849 
for progressions don't know the thing
that<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.509> here's<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.409> rock<00:01:46.590> 3

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
that we need to know is here's of rock 3

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.709 
that we need to know is here's of rock 3
it<00:01:47.009> sounds<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.609> this<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.240> finger<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
it sounds like this and you finger it

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.260 
it sounds like this and you finger it
yes

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
yes

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.609 
yes
it<00:01:50.689> is<00:01:50.990> G<00:01:52.119> muted<00:01:53.119> string<00:01:53.390> F<00:01:54.140> sharp<00:01:54.460> and

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.069 

so<00:01:58.549> your<00:01:58.729> step<00:01:59.000> one<00:01:59.210> understanding<00:01:59.960> the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
so your step one understanding the

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.440 
so your step one understanding the
theory<00:02:00.320> well<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.159> understand<00:02:01.579> how<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.090> notes

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
theory well you understand how the notes

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.450 
theory well you understand how the notes
are<00:02:02.570> laid<00:02:02.810> out<00:02:03.049> on<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.469> guitar<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.280> have

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
are laid out on the guitar that you have

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.090 
are laid out on the guitar that you have
a<00:02:04.520> root<00:02:04.759> note<00:02:04.969> that's<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.390> your<00:02:05.600> sixth<00:02:05.840> string

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
a root note that's on your sixth string

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.889 
a root note that's on your sixth string
then<00:02:07.100> an<00:02:07.250> empty<00:02:07.369> string<00:02:07.819> a<00:02:08.000> muted<00:02:08.479> string<00:02:08.750> and

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
then an empty string a muted string and

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.380 
then an empty string a muted string and
then<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.259> three<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.590> your<00:02:09.709> notes<00:02:09.890> on<00:02:10.009> top<00:02:10.390> so

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
then the three of your notes on top so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.350 
then the three of your notes on top so
this<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.690> G<00:02:11.870> major<00:02:11.959> seven<00:02:12.440> now<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.970> step<00:02:14.209> two

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
this is G major seven now the step two

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.539 
this is G major seven now the step two
is<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.569> find<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.870> good<00:02:15.019> fingering<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.680> well

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
is to find a good fingering and well

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.970 
is to find a good fingering and well
that's<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.269> regardless

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.089 

and<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.810> third<00:02:22.080> step<00:02:22.379> is<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.620> take<00:02:22.920> this

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
and the third step is to take this

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.160 
and the third step is to take this
through<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> scale<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.120> sis<00:02:24.300> since<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:24.959> chose

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
through the scale and sis since we chose

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.970 
through the scale and sis since we chose
G<00:02:25.590> major

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
G major

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.680 
G major
I<00:02:26.099> chose<00:02:26.310> G<00:02:26.489> major<00:02:26.700> because<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.150> lays<00:02:27.330> really

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
I chose G major because it lays really

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.119 
I chose G major because it lays really
nicely<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.200> fretboard<00:02:28.410> sort<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
nicely on the fretboard sort of the

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.710 
nicely on the fretboard sort of the
third<00:02:29.310> fret<00:02:29.640> when<00:02:29.849> I'm<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:30.060> here<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.569> back

third fret when I'm up here and back

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.490 
third fret when I'm up here and back
down<00:02:31.019> but<00:02:31.769> we'll<00:02:31.980> take<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.459> same<00:02:32.670> voicing

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
down but we'll take the same voicing

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.400 
down but we'll take the same voicing
through<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.680> scale<00:02:34.920> meaning<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:36.260> we<00:02:37.260> will

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
through the scale meaning that we will

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.500 
through the scale meaning that we will
be<00:02:37.620> playing<00:02:40.069> but<00:02:41.069> with<00:02:41.280> four<00:02:41.670> voices<00:02:42.330> at<00:02:42.480> once

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
any team just by transposing your root

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.620 
any team just by transposing your root
with<00:04:38.150> your<00:04:38.300> big<00:04:38.450> string<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:40.180> if<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.330> didn't<00:04:41.570> do

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
with your big string so if you didn't do

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.210 
with your big string so if you didn't do
so<00:04:41.810> already<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.350> should<00:04:42.530> probably<00:04:42.830> look<00:04:43.070> at

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
so already you should probably look at

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.400 
so already you should probably look at
the<00:04:43.430> other<00:04:43.730> video<00:04:44.030> which<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.330> called<00:04:44.540> drop<00:04:44.810> 2

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
the other video which is called drop 2

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.680 
the other video which is called drop 2
voicings<00:04:45.980> which<00:04:46.190> is<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.460> same<00:04:46.760> same<00:04:47.330> thing<00:04:47.390> as

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
voicings which is the same same thing as

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.510 
voicings which is the same same thing as
we<00:04:47.810> did<00:04:47.840> in<00:04:48.050> this<00:04:48.170> video<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:48.860> we<00:04:48.980> did<00:04:49.130> in<00:04:49.250> C

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
we did in this video but we did in C

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.550 
we did in this video but we did in C
major<00:04:49.670> but<00:04:50.060> just<00:04:50.810> by<00:04:50.930> looking<00:04:51.290> at<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.530> other

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.710 
major but just by looking at the other
video<00:04:51.920> and<00:04:52.190> by<00:04:52.520> looking<00:04:52.820> at<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.090> video<00:04:53.270> here

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
video and by looking at this video here

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.830 
video and by looking at this video here
we<00:04:54.470> have<00:04:54.740> 14<00:04:55.520> chords<00:04:55.940> that<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.210> can<00:04:56.360> play<00:04:56.570> and

we have 14 chords that you can play and
if<00:04:57.170> you<00:04:57.290> start<00:04:57.590> transposing<00:04:58.430> them<00:04:58.730> just<00:04:58.970> by

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
if you start transposing them just by

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
if you start transposing them just by
moving<00:04:59.420> them<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:01.240> thread<00:05:02.240> by<00:05:02.420> fret<00:05:02.690> by<00:05:02.840> just

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
moving them and thread by fret by just

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.290 
moving them and thread by fret by just
changing<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.470> base<00:05:04.190> root<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.880> name<00:05:05.030> of<00:05:05.180> the

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
changing the base root the name of the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.840 
changing the base root the name of the
base<00:05:05.450> note<00:05:05.750> then<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.560> get<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.220> lot<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.640> course

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
base note then you get a lot of course

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.460 
base note then you get a lot of course
not<00:05:08.120> an<00:05:08.270> infinite<00:05:08.570> amount<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:08.990> course<00:05:09.200> but<00:05:09.380> you

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
not an infinite amount of course but you

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.280 
not an infinite amount of course but you
still<00:05:09.710> get<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.040> lot<00:05:10.400> of<00:05:10.550> things<00:05:10.790> so<00:05:11.390> in<00:05:12.110> my

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
still get a lot of things so in my

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.050 
still get a lot of things so in my
opinion<00:05:12.470> once<00:05:13.070> again<00:05:13.310> that's<00:05:13.520> how<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.640> started

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
opinion once again that's how I started

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.260 
opinion once again that's how I started
the<00:05:14.180> other<00:05:14.270> video<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:14.630> say<00:05:14.900> well<00:05:15.670> you<00:05:16.670> get<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:16.970> lot

coming<00:05:19.970> from<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.360> how<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.140> works<00:05:21.410> rather<00:05:21.740> than

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040
