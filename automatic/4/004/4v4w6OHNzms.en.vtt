 sky gamblers culture puts you in the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.649
 time of cold war the act of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 Spiels begins in 1951 in the game 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.570
 you'll be in between spectacular there 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.329
 Russians and Americans are involved 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.430
 playfully the title goes the usual way 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.200
 your plane will either be on your own 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.329
 Controlled or virtual 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.860
 analog stick over buttons you can 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.870
 fire missiles or that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 use machine gun or your 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.480
 send squadrons on or squad 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.430
 form 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 who wants to can during the flights too 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.199
 turn on the autopilot and yourself 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.909
 complains completely on driving focus 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.369
 but not afterwards if you then 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.470
 but be shot down or the enemies 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.960
 not the control will get you in 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.790
 a tutorial brought close that you 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.009
 but could also skip if you 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.009
 be familiar with the sky gamers series 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.700
 The campaign mode is the centerpiece 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.550
 of the game 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.070
 here you have 12 very extensive but 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.700
 even very heavy missions master the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.380
 you to vietnam korea siberia or 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.560
 afghanistan can lead a mission 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.690
 easy to take 15 to 30 minutes 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.760
 you have different types of aircraft 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.620
 for your missions to choose from 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.180
 Often it is about opposing 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.100
 shoot down planes 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.290
 but in some mission you also have to 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.720
 certain goals on the grain take one 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.590
 Base protect or exploration flights 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.020
 carry out 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.060
 Overall, the gameplay looks as if 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.119
 the developers focus a little more 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.640
 had put on action against the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.750
 predecessors is a pity as at 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.700
 the precursors that the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.100
 between sequences and the story only 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.810
 be told in text form itself 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.830
 FunksprÃ¼che are only as text 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.890
 displayed 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.890
 this gives away a lot of atmosphere 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.500
 on the other hand, it is really convincing again 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.959
 times the graphics still a jag 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.830
 looks better than the previous ones 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.950
 play 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.349
 the textures are incredibly sharp the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.390
 lighting effects and mirroring just 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.849
 the madness and the degree of detail as well 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.140
 the foresight breathtaking the whole 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.120
 should also be six 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.019
 different camera angles 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.360
 marvel at 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.269
 it is unbelievably impressive too 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.000
 see how far mobile play in 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.560
 technical aspect has developed nice 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.110
 is also that the title the airplay 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.269
 feature has fully integrated who over 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.819
 An apple tv features the magnificent ones 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.920
 enjoy aerial combat on your television 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.690
 on the iphone or ipad display will 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.690
 then a radar is displayed 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.510
 in other game modes you are allowed 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.300
 for example in a survival mode 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.410
 prove how many opposing waves 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.940
 withstand her 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.069
 Of course you may also drop the 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.290
 campaign individual missions states or 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.720
 in a free flight mode just yours 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.590
 improve the art of flying and the environment 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.150
 admire 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.569
 in multiplayer mode you can per 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.910
 local wireless bluetooth or online against 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.610
 other pilots in capture the flag team 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.610
 deathmatch or the fanbase 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.830
 my conclusion gamers culture is right 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.110
 good game 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.270
 Airplane fans multiplayer fans as well 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.440
 graphic fetishists come here full 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.540
 your costs 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.970
 Realism fanatics are here, however 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.580
 out of place because the whole game is 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.950
 but the plastic I have to 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.390
 I also say a little personally 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.830
 disappointed with the title 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.140
 the series has in my opinion 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.670
 only limited development clear 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.590
 The graphic is still a tick better 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.810
 but otherwise exists 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.680
 all just new issues with new ones 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.330
 aircraft 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.920
 what bothers me the most is the 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 weaken the atmosphere 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.550
 sorry dear developers but combined 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.290
 but please take this title with you 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.700
 gripping interludes and 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.070
 voice output 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.910
 then you can play the game right 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.520
 thrill 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.490
 Also important is sky gamblers 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.420
 codeword is not a beginner's game 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.340
 missions are sometimes crisp heavy 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.690
 but now enough bitching because 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.060
 otherwise the title has again 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.550
 damn much to offer especially in 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.280
 things extent and multiplayer modes 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.480
 nobody does sky gamblers that fast 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.670
 something before 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.900
 write your opinion on the game in 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.640
 the comments 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.950
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.950
 next video fabian
