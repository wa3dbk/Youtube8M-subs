00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
really learned something that's what I

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.080 
really learned something that's what I
think<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> definition<00:00:32.400> of<00:00:32.519> using<00:00:32.820> your<00:00:32.910> mind

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
think the definition of using your mind

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.150 
think the definition of using your mind
better<00:00:33.330> is<00:00:33.480> because<00:00:33.989> you're<00:00:34.590> actually<00:00:34.769> going

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
better is because you're actually going

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
better is because you're actually going
in<00:00:35.430> depth<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.000> decision<00:00:36.330> you're<00:00:36.600> not<00:00:36.809> just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
in depth to a decision you're not just

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.380 
in depth to a decision you're not just
skimming<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.589> the<00:00:38.370> outline<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.089> you're

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
skimming the the outline of it you're

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.770 
skimming the the outline of it you're
actually<00:00:40.200> picking<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.739> apart<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.629> looking<00:00:42.629> at

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
actually picking it apart and looking at

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
actually picking it apart and looking at
all<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> different<00:00:43.200> variables<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.100> what

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
all the different variables like what

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
all the different variables like what
what<00:00:45.000> am<00:00:45.090> i<00:00:45.180> learning<00:00:45.390> what's<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
what am i learning what's the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.430 
what am i learning what's the
significance<00:00:47.780> what<00:00:48.780> else<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.020> people<00:00:49.050> think

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
significance what else do people think

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.520 
significance what else do people think
about<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.000> definitely<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.260> helps

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
about it and it just definitely it helps

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.580 
about it and it just definitely it helps
you<00:00:52.770> register<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> better<00:00:53.789> thought<00:00:54.320> my<00:00:55.320> goals

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you register a better thought my goals

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.479 
you register a better thought my goals
for<00:00:56.570> these<00:00:57.570> kids<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:59.329> are<00:01:00.710> why<00:01:01.710> would<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
for these kids is are why would have to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.329 
for these kids is are why would have to
go<00:01:02.640> back<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.080> comment<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.559> my<00:01:04.890> comments

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
go back to the comment about my comments

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
go back to the comment about my comments
about<00:01:05.430> learning<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.240> use<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.710> their<00:01:07.710> minds

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
about learning to use my their minds

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.270 
about learning to use my their minds
well<00:01:08.479> they<00:01:09.479> don't<00:01:09.899> have<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.350> memorize<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
well they don't have to memorize the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.600 
well they don't have to memorize the
structures<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.240> functions<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.959> a<00:01:13.080> cell<00:01:13.610> they

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
structures and functions of a cell they

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.339 
structures and functions of a cell they
don't<00:01:14.819> have<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> memorize<00:01:15.300> all<00:01:17.840> all<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:19.349 
don't have to memorize all all the

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:21.859 
don't have to memorize all all the
hundreds<00:01:19.800> of<00:01:19.979> amino<00:01:20.250> acids<00:01:20.910> out<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.660> I

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
hundreds of amino acids out there but I

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.910 
hundreds of amino acids out there but I
guess<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> want<00:01:23.369> them<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:24.440> learn<00:01:25.440> how<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
guess that I want them to learn how to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.210 
guess that I want them to learn how to
problem-solve<00:01:26.929> that's<00:01:27.929> that's<00:01:28.349> all<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.830> want

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
problem-solve that's that's all I want

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.880 
problem-solve that's that's all I want
from<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.550> they<00:01:29.789> they<00:01:30.090> need<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.590> push<00:01:31.590> people

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
from then they they need to push people

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770 
from then they they need to push people
for<00:01:32.039> evidence<00:01:32.399> don't<00:01:33.060> take<00:01:33.270> things<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.630> they

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
for evidence don't take things as they

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
for evidence don't take things as they
are<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.940> really<00:01:35.940> question<00:01:36.660> what<00:01:37.610> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
are and really question what the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.120 
are and really question what the
authority<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.209> in<00:01:39.239> charge<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.840> saying<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.380> don't

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
authority is in charge is saying I don't

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.529 
authority is in charge is saying I don't
think<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.459> all<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> theories<00:01:41.940> are<00:01:42.119> always

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
think that all the theories are always

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.330 
think that all the theories are always
correct<00:01:43.099> challenge<00:01:44.099> they're<00:01:44.220> all

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
correct challenge they're all

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.809 
correct challenge they're all
misconceptions<00:01:45.979> force<00:01:46.979> other<00:01:47.250> people<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.130 

come<00:01:50.819> up<00:01:50.940> with<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> evidence<00:01:51.239> based<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.959> what

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
come up with the evidence based on what

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
come up with the evidence based on what
they're<00:01:52.259> saying<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.069> I<00:01:53.160> think<00:01:53.429> that<00:01:53.610> once<00:01:54.270> if

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
they're saying and I think that once if

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.300 
they're saying and I think that once if
they<00:01:54.660> have<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.830> they're<00:01:55.950> set<00:01:56.130> for

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
they have that I think they're set for

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.620 
they have that I think they're set for
life<00:01:56.630> they're<00:01:57.630> set<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:57.959> life<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.640> guess<00:01:59.640> using

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
life they're set for life I guess using

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.830 
life they're set for life I guess using
your<00:02:00.810> mind<00:02:01.200> well<00:02:01.440> would<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:02.429> able<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.759> do

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
your mind well would just be able to do

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.410 
your mind well would just be able to do
using<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.860> best<00:02:06.040> way<00:02:06.220> possible<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:07.090> whatever
