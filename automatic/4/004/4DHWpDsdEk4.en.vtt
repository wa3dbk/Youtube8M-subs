workers and the workers I have they also

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.540 
workers and the workers I have they also
could<00:00:44.120> be<00:00:44.150> a<00:00:44.690> worker<00:00:45.260> who<00:00:45.620> don't<00:00:45.860> can<00:00:46.040> handle

could be a worker who don't can handle
so<00:00:46.790> very<00:00:47.530> rough<00:00:48.530> for<00:00:49.060> heavy<00:00:50.060> things<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.690> could

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
so very rough for heavy things I could

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.740 
so very rough for heavy things I could
have<00:00:51.770> a<00:00:52.040> worker<00:00:52.400> who<00:00:52.730> is<00:00:52.910> good<00:00:53.420> on<00:00:53.600> computers

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.920 
have a worker who is good on computers
and<00:00:54.500> like<00:00:54.980> computers<00:00:55.610> I<00:00:55.850> could<00:00:56.390> have<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:56.570> worker

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
and like computers I could have a worker

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.520 
and like computers I could have a worker
who<00:00:57.290> is<00:00:57.880> good<00:00:58.880> on<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.300> animals<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.989> cfa

Emma's<00:01:00.860> they<00:01:01.309> don't<00:01:01.550> have<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.970> milk<00:01:02.450> a<00:01:02.690> cow<00:01:02.720> the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
Emma's they don't have to milk a cow the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.469 
Emma's they don't have to milk a cow the
whole<00:01:03.440> day<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:04.220> does<00:01:04.399> the<00:01:04.579> enough<00:01:05.180> stewing

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
whole day that does the enough stewing

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.469

for<00:01:05.600> me<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.250> think<00:01:07.640> that's<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.119> very<00:01:08.360> good

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479

late evenings or early mornings and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.039 
late evenings or early mornings and
longer<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:40.520> cows<00:01:40.760> are<00:01:41.000> really<00:01:41.330> like<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.659> VLS

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.880 
so it's very good for the cows and they
are<00:01:49.310> exactly<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.000> same<00:01:50.060> as<00:01:50.360> we<00:01:50.930> are<00:01:51.110> some<00:01:51.680> are

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
are exactly the same as we are some are

and they can do what suits the
calvinists<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.240> we<00:01:59.240> think<00:01:59.390> it's<00:01:59.600> good<00:01:59.900> that

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140
