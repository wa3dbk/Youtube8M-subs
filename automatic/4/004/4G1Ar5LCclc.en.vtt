00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello how am I lupita welcome to my 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.870
 channel in this video of today them 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.259
 I'm going to talk a bit about the care of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.690
 this palm is corduroy that is called girl 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.820
 or if I will want or that your 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.029
 growth is very very slow its 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.000
 true growth that is very very 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.099
 strong and it is very difficult that this palm 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 is placed for some reason 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.199
 that really is very strong 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 any climate exists which is very 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.360
 resistant to pests one of the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.820
 you have these leaves that I have here 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.970
 that look white that look yellow 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.440
 are because of the weather is beginning to 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.270
 being cold is already starting to do 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.550
 enter December and start doing 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.560
 very cold and really the cold yes 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.660
 It affects a little but nothing happens 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.670
 very strong survive but if it affects 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.790
 a little bit and his eyes start to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.460
 make yellowish and suddenly if you 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.650
 they came to fall to dry forgiveness you have to 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.390
 remove them you have to remove all 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.730
 leaves that begin to turn yellow 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 very very yellow so they start 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.040
 to dry this is going to stimulate 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.380
 birth of more leaves ok its 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.340
 reproduction is through the seeds 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.850
 ok some seeds that grow to the center of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 the palm you have to take them to sow and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.399
 well is the reproduction of this palm is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.399
 a very elegant palm to have in 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:30.119
 house to have the balcony on the terrace 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.700
 or in the yard ok it's 100 percent are 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.630
 He loves the sun and if you put it into 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.300
 one in an area where the truth is a 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.539
 little dark or that my shadow will tend 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.340
 to lean towards where the light is and 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.149
 is going to look a little weird that is not going to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.530
 to grow like this is going to grow a little bit 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.100
 the dyad and is going to do 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.619
 that is really beautiful you the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.810
 I recommend closed eyes is not for nothing 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.060
 complicated you can have the interior 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.250
 I hope there is enough light or the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.170
 you can have outdoors ok 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.000
