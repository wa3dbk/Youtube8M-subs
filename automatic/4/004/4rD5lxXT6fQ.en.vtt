00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:09.760
 Yes Hello is the name the way Kaoru 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:13.100
 Have you seen App-view times ? 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.550
 As I declared that 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:21.410
 Did not read live 19 ah 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.180
 The big one is the details of that apple watch and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.580
 After Mac is not possible 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.350
 It is that Tteyuu story of the new macbook 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.650
 Unexpectedly a little small place 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.920
 Excuse me if you say it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.510
 I think I'm glad that the pull tv price cut 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.880
 Hey 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:44.230
 What good Do not think I was but hey Well macbook would normally 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.670
 This one is pure in me, but how is it 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.160
 It is this t model of the brave man macbook pro that I use this now 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.800
 That freedom of freedom. 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.360
 Uncle of Sendai is using it, and it is taking over and using it soon . 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.870
 I will do it here 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.300
 This announcement has been of Hasa 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.260
 also Toka macbook pro of Aiu high Gotegote 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.200
 What a creative thing I do not do 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.930
 I was I thought pretty Do not wanted Ya came out mid-odd mon 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.300
 how is it 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.690
 that 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:25.080
 Speaking outsider, it is lighter and smaller than macbook air 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:29.040
 I think it's kind of stylish 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.300
 Well I wonder if it is stylish macbook air a 6 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.510
 It's pretty stylish though 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:39.280
 Hey it is Han'nen specs but I think 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:44.159
 There is no big deal , but only the resolution of the screen has been raised, but what is that ? 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.460
 Though it was quite halfway sound sound integer 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.700
 It has been used It is something I feel that questions remain 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.310
 selling cpu Toka scary m probably om 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.780
 I 'm a child girl public but 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.070
 hey 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:06.460
 I think it's a cpu like a tablet 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.890
 Small tablet rpu cpu piles up and is panless I'm doing it 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.960
 Ugh say I 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:21.440
 The cat is m because it is to become fanless 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:25.640
 Well thanks to that it's pretty light 920 grams to cut 1 kg so 13 inches 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.320
 macbook air is 35 km a turn 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:34.980
 After 11 days of macbook air 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:39.720
 Because it is 1.08 kg, it is this macbook 12 inch model 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 It's totally lighter than it's because it is 920 grams 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.780
 After thin 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:51.900
 After this cat and this price range is getting smaller 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:55.920
 It's done, but it's good that the portability of the whole tongue is so great 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:02.030
 I think, but I did not have any specs . 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.030
 It's higher than macbook a without much 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:12.110
 I was wondering Tsu Na whether such toward anyone thought I mean by that 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:19.910
 If after Well port is not only a usb type c 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:22.319
 You with Tari were in where or data transfer was a power supply or 8 the screen 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:27.450
 I'm going to do everything there is to output 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.189
 There's only one but it's nice to keep it simple but it's a notebook 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.230
 What do you think? 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:37.340
 While it connects to the notebook power to basically say Datte many people of sanaa 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.310
 Maa , pointing to a smartphone and a phone 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:47.080
 The other on the screen was collected or was usb or memory was the hard disk is to be or insert 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:53.050
 Even if you decide to use it on your face after you decide 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:56.600
 In particular, in the case of a meeting, etc., it will be reflected on a large screen and presented there. 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.440
 It's something that you ignore it completely 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.420
 Of course it is supplemented by accessories 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.340
 There is a way to swipe the adapter 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.460
 I put that usb taxi and it is divided from there , but it is one 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.569
 Adapter is 9500 yen dimensions 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:19.759
 I think I have a 9000 child role 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:24.050
 I wonder if it will hit me after I do not feel smart in me 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:29.419
 Certainly this notebook itself is so great 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.750
 It has been cured in a smart form or a beautiful form, because there are few ana and ana 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.740
 The 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.100
 But what is the extension from there is high 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.450
 What Nanako 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:42.540
 It's strange that it looks like a weird moth comes out and there's a cable phone in there 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:48.060
 It says beautiful of selfishness as a whole picture 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.960
 Well this is also this day but it's macbook and higher and I wonder what 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.090
 I thought to 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:57.660
 It might be tempting to say something like this in me completely, but for believers 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.910
 I think I'm doing 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:07.849
 Of course, I wrote a lot in the past, and it has caused a reform . 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:12.649
 Ne in the age of floppy disk cd-rom I used to use 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:16.550
 It's a firewire, it's a damn thing, so no thunderbolt this time 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:20.660
 I 'll only do it in perspective and say I 'll eliminate it with Thunderball 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.050
 Of course I didn't use it, but I guess that would be that 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.400
 If you say such a thing 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:32.440
 It may have to go down but I think the up has lost 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:37.380
 Maker who made the third party to make a third-party accessories 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:41.640
 If but not me deal at all thunderbolt 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:44.820
 I guess losing to have been the only An about to say 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.880
 This time I use pipe and it is 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:52.120
 It because the spec manner is superior to the thunderbolt and was 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.200
 When considering the specs of 10th lower data layer 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:59.750
 Because it is completely different 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:02.100
 20 one this time of usb of type c Nante rear movie Gogi is I Thunder this taken 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.790
 I will say 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:10.990
 It would have lost completely already that it will be suppressed 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:14.200
 Or in the future macbook pro Once Well if However 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.300
 It further model change is the Tteyuu Toka a mac pro 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.330
 do it 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.320
 I have only made minor changes this time 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.110
 In model change 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:30.530
 It is a complete defeat if there is no Thunderball degree 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:34.730
 The three bullets I have it, and for that reason why it is against the balance bolt 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.680
 It looks good at first glance This macbook is light if you want it so 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:40.310
 What it became I 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:45.889
 Something really good to become one in Ford 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:51.600
 I thought it sounds like an intelligence smell but it works well 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:56.270
 I think I do something really Mendokuse when you were thinking 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.570
 deaf when the iphone Toka smartphone there charging 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:04.790
 You have to choose something from the charge of the computer 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:07.550
 If you don't choose something, let's bite the adapter and look up at all 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.060
 And I thought I Thats Ne Nanchatte or is it considered 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:16.240
 In that sense I thought it was halfway 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:19.240
 I don't buy it, but I think there are quite a lot of people who have done 5 macbook 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:23.039
 Seriously not only this macbook 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.039
 It seems this time apple watch Ne 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:46.889
 bj 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:46.889
 Oh oh oh nice nice 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.300
 ana
