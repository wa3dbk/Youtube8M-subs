it and started thinking how am I gonna
beat<00:00:37.680> these<00:00:37.860> bases<00:00:38.309> they<00:00:38.820> keep<00:00:39.030> getting

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
beat these bases they keep getting

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.060 
beat these bases they keep getting
harder<00:00:39.690> levels<00:00:40.379> keeps<00:00:40.620> getting<00:00:40.920> higher

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
harder levels keeps getting higher

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.540 
harder levels keeps getting higher
defenses<00:00:41.850> keep<00:00:42.059> getting<00:00:42.360> better<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.280> kind

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
defenses keep getting better so I kind

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
defenses keep getting better so I kind
of<00:00:44.579> figured<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.059> only<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.989> by

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
of figured the only way to do it is by

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590 
of figured the only way to do it is by
some<00:00:47.070> diamonds<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.850> you're<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.270> gonna<00:00:48.390> buy

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
some diamonds so you're just gonna buy

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.830 
some diamonds so you're just gonna buy
these<00:00:48.750> 1,200<00:00:49.260> diamonds<00:00:49.590> right<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:51.000> then

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
these 1,200 diamonds right here and then

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.130 
these 1,200 diamonds right here and then
I<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.559> only<00:00:52.949> thing<00:00:53.129> left<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.850> is

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
I think the only thing left to do is

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.170 
I think the only thing left to do is
upgrade<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.500> headquarters<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> level<00:00:56.670> 11<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
upgrade the headquarters to level 11 and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.250 
upgrade the headquarters to level 11 and
get<00:00:57.300> some<00:00:57.449> tanks<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.870> we'll<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.079> how<00:00:58.199> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
get some tanks and we'll see how that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
get some tanks and we'll see how that
goes<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.309> need<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> quick

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
goes so I just need to do a quick

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970

buildings now i do have enough for
another<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.590> i<00:01:52.619> decided<00:01:53.040> let's<00:01:53.430> try<00:01:53.880> out

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
another one but i decided let's try out

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.780 
another one but i decided let's try out
the<00:01:54.689> real<00:01:55.110> test<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:55.890> tags<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> see

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the real test on these tags just to see

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
the real test on these tags just to see
how<00:01:56.909> strong<00:01:56.969> they<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.869> are<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.829> i'm

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
how strong they actually are so i'm

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.740 
how strong they actually are so i'm
running<00:01:59.310> them<00:01:59.430> straight<00:01:59.820> up<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> middle<00:02:00.149> not

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
running them straight up the middle not

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.270 
running them straight up the middle not
caring<00:02:01.110> about<00:02:01.200> anything<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.829> mines<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
caring about anything the mines the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.130 
caring about anything the mines the
defenses<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.299> we're<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> focus

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
defenses and we're just going to focus

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.830 
defenses and we're just going to focus
on<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.740> big<00:02:05.310> boom<00:02:05.579> cannon<00:02:06.030> taking<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.780> out

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
on that big boom cannon taking that out

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
on that big boom cannon taking that out
first<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.829> we're<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.069> work<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.399> some

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
first then we're going to work on some

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.130 
first then we're going to work on some
of<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> other<00:02:08.879> smaller<00:02:09.270> defenses<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.929> as<00:02:10.020> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
of the other smaller defenses and as you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.440 
of the other smaller defenses and as you
guys<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.500> all<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.459> my<00:02:11.760> tanks<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.209> still

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
guys can see all of my tanks are still

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.640 
guys can see all of my tanks are still
at<00:02:12.599> fairly<00:02:12.930> high<00:02:12.959> health

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
at fairly high health

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.250 
at fairly high health
they're<00:02:14.099> not<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.400> doing<00:02:14.610> too<00:02:14.849> much<00:02:14.970> damage

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
they're not really doing too much damage

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.110 
they're not really doing too much damage
so<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.290> decided<00:02:16.680> let's<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.189> take<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.640> HQ

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
so I decided let's just take out the HQ

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.470 
so I decided let's just take out the HQ
drop<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> flare<00:02:19.140> down<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.530> HQ<00:02:20.099> med<00:02:21.030> pack<00:02:21.269> on

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
drop a flare down on the HQ med pack on

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.580 
drop a flare down on the HQ med pack on
top<00:02:21.659> of<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.840> tanks<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.379> thought<00:02:22.530> it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
top of the tanks because I thought it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.780 
top of the tanks because I thought it
was<00:02:22.650> going<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.829> be<00:02:22.950> taking<00:02:23.340> damage<00:02:23.459> from<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
was going to be taking damage from that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.119 
was going to be taking damage from that
boom<00:02:24.120> cannon<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.689> it<00:02:24.870> turns<00:02:25.140> out<00:02:25.379> I'm<00:02:25.799> out<00:02:26.069> of

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
boom cannon but it turns out I'm out of

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.500 
boom cannon but it turns out I'm out of
the<00:02:26.310> range<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.579> the<00:02:26.700> boom<00:02:26.849> cannon<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the range of the boom cannon and the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.929 
the range of the boom cannon and the
only<00:02:27.750> thing<00:02:27.900> hitting<00:02:28.290> me<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.739> one<00:02:29.579> sniper

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
only thing hitting me is one sniper

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.240 
only thing hitting me is one sniper
tower<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.569> one<00:02:31.200> mortar<00:02:31.590> which<00:02:31.769> isn't<00:02:32.159> going

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
tower and one mortar which isn't going

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.619 
tower and one mortar which isn't going
to<00:02:32.310> be<00:02:32.400> enough<00:02:32.430> damage<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.150> take<00:02:33.329> out<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
to be enough damage to take out the

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.899 
to be enough damage to take out the
tanks<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.739> I'm<00:02:35.129> just<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.519> let<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.700> tank

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
tanks so I'm just going to let the tank

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.160 
tanks so I'm just going to let the tank
sit<00:02:36.180> there<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.599> they're<00:02:36.720> going<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.870> slowly

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
sit there and they're going to slowly

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.309 
sit there and they're going to slowly
take<00:02:37.439> out<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.769> HQ<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.970> as<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.599> see<00:02:39.840> i<00:02:39.870> went

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
take out the HQ so as you can see i went

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.559 
take out the HQ so as you can see i went
from<00:02:40.530> getting<00:02:41.189> absolutely<00:02:41.640> destroyed<00:02:42.359> from

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
from getting absolutely destroyed from

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.289 
from getting absolutely destroyed from
my<00:02:42.780> Gunners<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.230> my<00:02:43.500> Zukas<00:02:43.950> upgraded<00:02:44.939> to<00:02:45.030> tags

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
my Gunners and my Zukas upgraded to tags

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.140 
my Gunners and my Zukas upgraded to tags
and<00:02:45.620> steamrolled<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.769> guy<00:02:46.920> space<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.609> could

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
and steamrolled this guy space I could

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.879 
and steamrolled this guy space I could
have<00:02:48.239> taken<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.659> all<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.930> his<00:02:49.170> defenses<00:02:49.680> and

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
have taken out all of his defenses and

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.970 
have taken out all of his defenses and
probably<00:02:50.340> lost<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.970> tank<00:02:51.420> maybe<00:02:52.290> two<00:02:52.590> tanks

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
probably lost a tank maybe two tanks

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.160 
probably lost a tank maybe two tanks
tops<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.489> would<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:54.150> taken<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.750> whole<00:02:54.930> base
