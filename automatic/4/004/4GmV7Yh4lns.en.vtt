I've never heard of any of these

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.130 
I've never heard of any of these
breaking<00:02:57.630> ever<00:02:59.120> now<00:03:00.120> for<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.510> front<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.080> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
breaking ever now for the front is a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.900 
breaking ever now for the front is a
different<00:03:01.620> matter<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:02.310> front<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.760> vehicle

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
different matter in front of the vehicle

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.720 
different matter in front of the vehicle
you<00:03:03.450> have<00:03:03.480> factory<00:03:03.989> points<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:05.010> instead<00:03:05.670> of

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
you have factory points so instead of

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.400 
you have factory points so instead of
fact<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.299> factory<00:03:06.600> points<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.019> shear<00:03:07.260> off

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
fact the factory points of the shear off

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.710 
fact the factory points of the shear off
all<00:03:07.680> therefore<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.220> for<00:03:08.459> towing<00:03:09.299> your<00:03:09.390> vehicle

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
all therefore is for towing your vehicle

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.620 
all therefore is for towing your vehicle
on<00:03:09.900> tarmac<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:11.820> other<00:03:11.940> point<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.360> just<00:03:12.540> a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
on tarmac and the other point is just a

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.660 
on tarmac and the other point is just a
tie-down<00:03:12.840> point<00:03:13.260> which<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.310> for<00:03:14.489> shipping

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
tie-down point which is for shipping

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.350 
tie-down point which is for shipping
when<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.060> ship<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> vehicles<00:03:15.810> over<00:03:16.130> now<00:03:17.130> so

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
when I ship the vehicles over now so

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.420 
when I ship the vehicles over now so
what<00:03:18.360> we<00:03:18.450> need<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.630> first<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.769> all<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:19.920> rated

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
what we need is first of all a rated

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.640 
what we need is first of all a rated
recovery<00:03:20.880> point<00:03:21.120> now<00:03:21.780> not<00:03:21.989> all<00:03:22.140> vehicles<00:03:22.350> have

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
recovery point now not all vehicles have

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.270 
recovery point now not all vehicles have
this<00:03:23.190> available<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.380> next<00:03:25.590> step<00:03:25.799> is<00:03:26.040> a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
this available so the next step is a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.539 
this available so the next step is a
attic<00:03:27.120> w'ite<00:03:27.299> recovery<00:03:28.230> point<00:03:28.470> now<00:03:29.070> adequate

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
attic w'ite recovery point now adequate

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.430 
attic w'ite recovery point now adequate
recovery<00:03:29.790> points<00:03:30.239> I'll<00:03:30.420> use<00:03:30.720> them<00:03:30.989> on<00:03:31.260> my

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
recovery points I'll use them on my

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.460 
recovery points I'll use them on my
Horlicks<00:03:31.860> which<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.220> had<00:03:32.340> before<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.350> they<00:03:34.350> are

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
Horlicks which I had before and they are

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.220 
Horlicks which I had before and they are
fine<00:03:34.850> but<00:03:35.850> what<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.060> suggest<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.630> with<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.959> razor

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
fine but what I suggest is with a razor

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.870 
fine but what I suggest is with a razor
point<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.680> can<00:03:37.799> get<00:03:37.890> away<00:03:37.980> with<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:38.430> with<00:03:38.760> an

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
point you can get away with one with an

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.030 
point you can get away with one with an
adequate<00:03:39.269> point<00:03:39.570> they<00:03:40.080> say<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.500> get<00:03:40.620> away<00:03:40.799> one

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
adequate point they say can get away one

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.090 
adequate point they say can get away one
but<00:03:41.310> I'd<00:03:41.459> rather<00:03:41.670> put<00:03:41.910> two<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.470> put<00:03:43.470> two<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.709> and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
but I'd rather put two on put two on and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.830 
but I'd rather put two on put two on and
then<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.519> use<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> bridle<00:03:45.269> or<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.540> tree

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
then you can use a bridle or a tree
