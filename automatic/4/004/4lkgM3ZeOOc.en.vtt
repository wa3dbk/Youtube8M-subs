really okay all right let me talk a
little<00:02:18.340> bout<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.549> tech<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.940> makes<00:02:19.120> this

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
little bout the tech that makes this

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.490 
little bout the tech that makes this
thing<00:02:19.480> work<00:02:19.540> it's<00:02:19.870> sort<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.290> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
thing work it's sort of like a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.259 
thing work it's sort of like a
motorcycle<00:02:21.069> that's<00:02:21.459> gotten<00:02:21.760> turned<00:02:22.000> into<00:02:22.239> a

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
motorcycle that's gotten turned into a

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.420 
motorcycle that's gotten turned into a
car<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:23.080> takes<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.500> engine<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.069> transmission

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
car it takes the engine and transmission

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.960 
car it takes the engine and transmission
and<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.269> output<00:02:25.660> from<00:02:26.019> a<00:02:26.080> GTR<00:02:26.920> 1200<00:02:27.489> kawasaki

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
motorcycle and attaches this has very

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.699 
motorcycle and attaches this has very
low<00:02:30.489> sort<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.000> race<00:02:31.510> car<00:02:31.840> type<00:02:32.170> chassis

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
through that single rear wheel basically

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.470 
through that single rear wheel basically
you've<00:02:38.950> got<00:02:39.069> an<00:02:39.190> automotive<00:02:39.579> type<00:02:39.940> interface

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
you've got an automotive type interface

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.350 
you've got an automotive type interface

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
to control the motorcycle drivetrain you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.430 
to control the motorcycle drivetrain you
got<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.540> steering<00:02:43.810> wheel<00:02:43.930> instead<00:02:44.319> of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
got a steering wheel instead of

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.380 
got a steering wheel instead of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
normally the handlebar would come right

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.220 
normally the handlebar would come right
through<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.569> here's<00:02:49.840> your<00:02:49.930> headlight
