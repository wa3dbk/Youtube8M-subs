this<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:29.330> body<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:31.430> not<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.670> usual

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
this the body is it's not a usual

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.400 
this the body is it's not a usual
monument<00:03:33.140> it's<00:03:34.420> it's<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:37.070> only<00:03:37.610> surviving

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
monument it's it's the only surviving

building<00:03:39.820> vertical<00:03:40.820> structure<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.660> Hiroshima

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
building vertical structure in Hiroshima

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.240 
building vertical structure in Hiroshima
just<00:03:44.210> underneath<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:45.200> as<00:03:45.500> i<00:03:45.710> mentioned<00:03:46.160> in

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
just underneath of as i mentioned in

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.390 
just underneath of as i mentioned in
film<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.880> presenter<00:03:47.630> of<00:03:47.660> explosion<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.070> it's<00:03:49.280> a

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
film I presenter of explosion so it's a

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.530 
film I presenter of explosion so it's a
witness<00:03:51.460> it's<00:03:52.460> preserved<00:03:53.210> wounded<00:03:54.140> body<00:03:55.540> so

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
witness it's preserved wounded body so

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.240 
witness it's preserved wounded body so
it's<00:03:56.780> obviously<00:03:57.260> not<00:03:57.620> very<00:03:58.610> easy<00:03:58.760> to<00:04:00.250> to

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
it's obviously not very easy to to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.420 
it's obviously not very easy to to
imagine<00:04:01.850> what<00:04:02.030> else<00:04:02.390> such<00:04:03.230> body<00:04:04.130> could

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
imagine what else such body could

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.860 
imagine what else such body could
express<00:04:04.850> because<00:04:05.570> it's<00:04:05.750> already<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.500> much<00:04:07.870> so

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
express because it's already so much so

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
express because it's already so much so
I<00:04:09.320> decided<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:11.120> should<00:04:11.840> be<00:04:12.020> various

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
I decided that that should be various

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.420 
I decided that that should be various
generations<00:04:13.690> try<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.750> say<00:04:15.470> something<00:04:15.500> beyond

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
generations try to say something beyond

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.470 
generations try to say something beyond
what<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.150> monument<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:17.840> saying<00:04:18.170> because

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
what this monument is saying because

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.100 
what this monument is saying because
also<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.630> rivers<00:04:21.130> witness<00:04:22.130> inside<00:04:22.760> of<00:04:23.110> the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
also the rivers witness inside of the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.340 
also the rivers witness inside of the
worst<00:04:24.350> things<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:24.770> happen<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:26.120> that<00:04:26.750> was<00:04:27.140> the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
worst things that happen so that was the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.060 
worst things that happen so that was the
reason<00:04:27.380> why<00:04:28.010> those<00:04:28.570> hands<00:04:29.570> appear<00:04:30.140> so<00:04:30.560> much

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
reason why those hands appear so much

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.730 
reason why those hands appear so much
about<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.730> water<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.900> water<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.470> course

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
about the water but the water of course

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.350 
about the water but the water of course
is<00:04:34.390> moving<00:04:35.390> and<00:04:36.100> that<00:04:37.100> brings<00:04:38.000> certain

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
is moving and that brings certain

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.070 
is moving and that brings certain
cinematic<00:04:39.200> aspects<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.160> projection

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
cinematic aspects to this projection

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.980 
cinematic aspects to this projection
maybe<00:04:42.080> more<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:42.440> than<00:04:42.920> the<00:04:42.980> motion<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:43.990> hands

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
maybe more so than the motion of hands

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.450 
maybe more so than the motion of hands
selves<00:04:45.890> because<00:04:46.610> it's<00:04:47.390> a<00:04:48.610> continuing

cinematic event trauma is being

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.670 
cinematic event trauma is being
transmitted<00:04:56.390> from<00:04:56.690> one<00:04:56.750> generation<00:04:56.990> to
