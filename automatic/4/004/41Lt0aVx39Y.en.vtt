00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.050
 I would cook a recipes today 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.570
 What the first recipe I have 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.289
 got to know how to cook in the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.529
 trivial what is in paris is a part of one 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.949
 felt tyczka siegfried here or her 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:31.360
 I can do it in the oven too 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:35.300
 need meat salt sulfur caraway 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.379
 paprika olive oil and a bit of peter 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.489
 not so much 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.010
 that is very easy the onion very much 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.859
 finely chopped it is important you do 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.480
 nobody fulfilled before because he had to leave 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.190
 they may have to approximate 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.280
 three and a half hours or course 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.620
 covered or outside because of the pond 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.649
 Knowing when we do detail is very 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.230
 soft if they condition something completely 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.480
 break something 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.550
 It's important when the game starts 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.170
 from roast we make a meat the 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.270
 make me a bit of a 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.009
 Mattress maybe that's the taste 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.020
 and the mirror comes in a flesh 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.630
 that really is really that exist 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.700
 is a secret and my mother if 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.689
 they know that I'll do a film 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.450
 I have a big problem 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.640
 we do the spices and not 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.530
 me that was important was the taste 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.479
 from the gameplay would then come 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.479
 roll all the same 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:48.860
 At the end , a bit of today 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:48.860
 done some fresh parsley chop 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.450
 and it's done now you have to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.000
 About half an hour or so 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.440
 Of course , being cold can prepare one 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.640
 days ahead 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.310
 it's cool that's more important to me 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.050
 would me for me because the fed goes 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.050
 I'll do that to you 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:21.240
 Tastes like mom that's a compliment 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.370
 now the easy parts i have come 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.990
 in the puff pastry buy better the lies 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.990
 already here then rolls cut 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.930
 just leave it here 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.940
 I can keep on doing a few in 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.760
 Canada so I'll be three or four 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.060
 even do that but I leave me 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.310
 look what is more important 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.690
 she does not have to feel and not so much 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.610
 too little to prove that with experience 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.370
 Last time was a disaster 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.450
 maybe just about this one 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.130
 that's twelve centimeters dia meter me 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:20.290
 do not bring a tablespoon stream anymore 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:22.620
 at a bit which is very important one 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.920
 warm water make reader with water happiness 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.739
 Half if this water detail will 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.940
 Much better works and then in the 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:37.690
 to make hands is already hot 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.980
 I left 180 degrees I can too 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.340
 for the animals but it is much more 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.950
 healthy if they make him open 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.980
 after the way to and then two fingers 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:52.410
 that I'm slow 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.410
 this finger must give the formula 1 one 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.049
 but if she can not do that I can 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.820
 I'll just teach away with one 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.530
 cable with a spoon is no matter what she is 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.530
 make in this page like that 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.500
 And that is very important color sometimes 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.330
 There are many local with empanadas like that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.100
 we are that is a very normal 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.360
 appetizers before meat so we are 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:39.790
 meat in front of sm meat flesh likes open 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:41.720
 180 degrees and ten minutes speaks like 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.790
 my mum's kitchen 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.040
 but if in front makes chili 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.380
 team that can not be created 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.880
 I want one here and that and that 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.490
 is ready and good appetite 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:57.200
