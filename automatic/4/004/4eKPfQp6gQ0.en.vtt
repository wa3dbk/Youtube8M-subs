 hey here is with her from with n tv 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.530
 today it's about the subject of film 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:22.400
 this one 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:26.380
 I have been suffering from simon for about a year 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.380
 two years two of them 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.610
 so wait for bright so this helmet is 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.360
 suitable for athletes then and 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 cyclist has one for both 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.829
 admission 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.539
 When sport climbing ask many heroes 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.510
 if she slips somewhere in the mountain 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.129
 easy from ropes or on and tree 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.050
 would be high 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.890
 I always find it important that you 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.489
 Helmet also carries when standing below 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.210
 even when rope pulling com is a right 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:13.429
 down and then the helmet is right 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:22.700
 important now but here for this helmet 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:30.539
 as i said i have 2 he has many 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:35.009
 very light helmet very good 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:39.929
 padded the typical size 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.200
 Adjustment and the usual bender hall 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.200
 for sure 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.090
 which is also common for 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.090
 lighting 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.520
 I find that they are with the helmet in 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.120
 summer never really step and winter 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.060
 a little too cold and therefore clearly the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.130
 buy recommendation here on this topic 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.650
 contains 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.650
 thank you very much and have fun with itv
