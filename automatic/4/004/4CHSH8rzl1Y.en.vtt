00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.960
 in 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.190
 the magistrate 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.039
 so 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.410
 who are banks 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.050
 that they will show simple so 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.989
 aluminum here all the glass surface 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.169
 like his laptops trackpad so 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:31.250
 a really a very glass surface 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.780
 fine and goes off it's a surface so 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.100
 which is not clickable ie 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.280
 if you press there nothing happens 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.220
 behind 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.890
 no better and actually the clickable part 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.479
 it's only the two little ones 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.939
 supports here it's just these little ones 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.680
 points that clicks ie that 

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:53.119
 when you put it flat 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.150
 pressure you have to be hand or 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.680
 with the thumb will make click and its two 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.129
 little more high all the rest is 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.979
 rigid here we have the stop button 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.979
 and then the housing for the batteries 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.340
 so to give an idea of ​​his 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.619
 dimensions 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.579
 if you have a wireless keyboard in fact 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.579
 it's exactly in the extension 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.920
 even the same angle the surface by 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.040
 report to keypads including which bed 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.850
 marry very well appreciated reindeer a 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.690
 bluetooth keyboard with numeric keypad 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.430
 so that's not the same at all 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.900
 dimensions it is slightly more one 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.990
 try to order the thickness of a 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.860
 wing of a touch but a little longer 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.140
 on the other hand, it makes a surface a bit 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.479
 biggest source office we go we will be 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.440
 maybe rather tempted to position him 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.150
 a little bit differently 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.270
 the idea in use actually is 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.979
 to have this object that is fixed not like 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.190
 a mouse convinces that we will go for a walk on 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.930
 the table is all good 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.120
 a good place on the table and then the 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.720
 nose is fixed more and there is the hand 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.820
 who moves and relative to a trackpad 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.070
 a laptop 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.140
 so here was saying that it's about 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.100
 80% larger 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.930
 we knew as a surface enough 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.090
 comfortable and at the level of 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.560
 use at the beginning since we have this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.750
 large area we have a little bit 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.660
 tendency to get their hands on 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.460
 ie there is to be one magic 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.970
 trackpad and we put the hand and then we 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.040
 get the clicks with the thumbs actually the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.470
 little we used it is that one more 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.120
 practice to back down because 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.360
 sandars clickable surfaces we tend 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.520
 sometimes with the corner to make 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.880
 press or press a little bit on the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.370
 area 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.980
 so he actually wanted to be put the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.510
 hand back is rather manipulate it 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.020
 like that with your fingertips 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.960
 how would I do 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.120
 with a trackpad trackpad him we did not 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.510
 the damask part is not going to press the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.580
 area 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.780
 you have to take a little bit of habit 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.460
 with the magic trackpad to do the same 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.570
 thing but not wanting like that the 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:01.020
 cover at all costs so there we see his 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.680
 Click and click here click here 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.900
 we have it clicks we are calm 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.790
 away from the two studs but in 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.860
 forcing a little bit better anyway 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.910
 that's all the comfortable surface for 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.910
 click we will say here is
