problem<00:00:26.980> so<00:00:27.980> let's<00:00:28.370> get<00:00:28.490> started<00:00:29.650> so<00:00:30.650> this<00:00:30.950> is

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
problem so let's get started so this is

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.110 
problem so let's get started so this is
720p<00:00:32.360> at<00:00:32.629> 30<00:00:32.870> frames<00:00:33.050> per<00:00:33.230> second<00:00:33.739> as<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:34.970> can

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
see there are lines absolutely

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.430 
see there are lines absolutely
everywhere<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:38.570> is<00:00:38.750> what<00:00:38.900> I<00:00:38.930> would<00:00:39.050> class<00:00:39.410> as

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
everywhere this is what I would class as

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.700 
everywhere this is what I would class as
a<00:00:39.680> low-light<00:00:40.160> shot<00:00:40.750> as<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.870> arrow<00:00:42.050> points<00:00:42.530> out

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
a low-light shot as the arrow points out

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.990 
a low-light shot as the arrow points out
there's<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.820> worst<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.420> lines<00:00:45.129> I<00:00:46.129> what<00:00:46.970> I

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
there's the worst of the lines I what I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.910 
there's the worst of the lines I what I
did<00:00:47.269> was<00:00:47.479> it<00:00:47.690> was<00:00:47.809> about<00:00:47.960> midday<00:00:48.229> so<00:00:48.470> it<00:00:48.800> was<00:00:48.890> a

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
did was it was about midday so it was a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.290 
did was it was about midday so it was a
lot<00:00:49.040> of<00:00:49.100> light<00:00:49.280> outside<00:00:49.519> and<00:00:50.320> I<00:00:52.120> closed<00:00:53.120> the

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
lot of light outside and I closed the

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.049 
lot of light outside and I closed the
curtains<00:00:53.720> just<00:00:54.170> leaving<00:00:54.620> them<00:00:55.400> open<00:00:55.580> slightly

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
curtains just leaving them open slightly

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.130 
curtains just leaving them open slightly
to<00:00:56.390> be<00:00:56.510> able<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.809> let<00:00:57.199> in<00:00:57.350> some<00:00:57.379> kind<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.010> light

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
to be able to let in some kind of light

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.579 
to be able to let in some kind of light
but<00:01:00.140> basically<00:01:00.430> here<00:01:01.430> we<00:01:01.580> have<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.589> zoom

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
but basically here we have the zoom

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.980 
but basically here we have the zoom
problem<00:01:04.159> where<00:01:04.400> it<00:01:04.460> goes<00:01:04.610> darker<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:05.360> never<00:01:05.750> had

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
problem where it goes darker I never had

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.219 
problem where it goes darker I never had
the<00:01:06.350> blackout<00:01:07.040> on<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.729> zoom<00:01:07.970> but<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.720> did<00:01:08.930> go<00:01:09.200> a

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
the blackout on the zoom but it did go a

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.700 
the blackout on the zoom but it did go a
lot<00:01:09.500> dark<00:01:09.799> up<00:01:10.040> which<00:01:10.250> was<00:01:10.370> a<00:01:10.430> bit<00:01:10.610> annoying

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
lot dark up which was a bit annoying

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.859 
lot dark up which was a bit annoying
yeah<00:01:12.710> but<00:01:13.010> then<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.340> picture<00:01:13.939> got<00:01:14.119> better<00:01:14.630> as

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
yeah but then the picture got better as

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.760 
yeah but then the picture got better as
it<00:01:15.110> zoomed<00:01:15.320> out<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:16.009> is<00:01:16.189> wvga<00:01:17.530> it's<00:01:18.530> about

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
it zoomed out this is wvga it's about

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.039 
it zoomed out this is wvga it's about
half-past<00:01:19.100> ten<00:01:19.399> in<00:01:19.579> the<00:01:19.610> morning<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:20.930> I'm

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
half-past ten in the morning that I'm

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.920 
half-past ten in the morning that I'm
taking<00:01:21.469> this<00:01:21.850> as<00:01:23.469> you<00:01:24.469> can<00:01:24.649> see<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.219> is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
taking this as you can see it is

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.510 
taking this as you can see it is
probably<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.170> best<00:01:27.380> out<00:01:27.649> of<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.920> lot<00:01:28.070> other

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
probably the best out of a lot other

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.170 
probably the best out of a lot other
than<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.909> 1080p<00:01:29.649> you<00:01:30.649> can't<00:01:30.920> really<00:01:31.130> see<00:01:31.310> many

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
than the 1080p you can't really see many

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.010 
than the 1080p you can't really see many
of<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.539> lines<00:01:33.579> maybe<00:01:34.579> along<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.030> bottom<00:01:35.329> you

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
of the lines maybe along the bottom you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.469 
of the lines maybe along the bottom you
can<00:01:36.049> sort<00:01:36.469> of<00:01:36.530> see<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.890> lines<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:37.399> you<00:01:38.329> know

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
can sort of see the lines but you know

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.899 
can sort of see the lines but you know
it<00:01:39.229> does<00:01:39.469> seem<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.799> be<00:01:41.020> relatively<00:01:42.020> good<00:01:42.909> but

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
it does seem to be relatively good but

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.020 
it does seem to be relatively good but
it's<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.539> know<00:01:44.570> it's<00:01:44.689> only<00:01:44.960> overcast<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.030> you

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
it's you know it's only overcast and you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.849 
it's you know it's only overcast and you
it's<00:01:47.299> it's<00:01:47.719> early<00:01:48.109> in<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.259> morning<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.619> it

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
it's it's early in the morning so it

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.330 
it's it's early in the morning so it
should<00:01:49.100> do<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.549> lot<00:01:50.299> better<00:01:50.450> than<00:01:50.689> that<00:01:50.869> and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
should do a lot better than that and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.959 
should do a lot better than that and
there<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:52.520> have<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.729> lines<00:01:53.119> oh<00:01:54.969> there

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
there we have the lines oh there

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
especially in the tree where the arrow

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.289

bit<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:33.170> know<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.460> an<00:02:37.640> annoyance

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
bit you know it is it is an annoyance

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.640 
bit you know it is it is an annoyance
and<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:39.020> we<00:02:39.080> go<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.960> 720p<00:02:41.960> that<00:02:42.380> for<00:02:42.590> a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
and now we go on to the 720p that for a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.030 
and now we go on to the 720p that for a
second<00:02:43.180> 60<00:02:44.180> frames<00:02:44.420> per<00:02:44.540> second<00:02:45.020> was<00:02:45.230> more<00:02:45.950> or

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
second 60 frames per second was more or

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.740 
second 60 frames per second was more or
less<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.370> same<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.590> lines<00:02:49.270> obviously<00:02:50.270> you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
less the same the lines obviously you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.740 
less the same the lines obviously you
can<00:02:50.930> see<00:02:51.170> them<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.830> they<00:02:53.230> are<00:02:54.230> pretty<00:02:54.440> bad<00:02:55.750> but

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
can see them and they are pretty bad but

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.460 
can see them and they are pretty bad but
it's<00:02:56.930> weird<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.530> until<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.310> actually<00:02:58.490> notice

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
it's weird and until you actually notice

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.250 
it's weird and until you actually notice
you<00:03:00.470> don't<00:03:00.710> notice<00:03:00.890> if<00:03:01.160> you're<00:03:01.280> not<00:03:01.400> i<00:03:01.430> mean

but they are there i mean i went through

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.090 
but they are there i mean i went through
earlier<00:03:05.180> footage<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.470> did<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.920> first

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
earlier footage that I did on the first

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.190 
earlier footage that I did on the first
see<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.430> ate<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:07.910> add<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.780> lines<00:03:08.990> were

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
see I ate that I add and the lines were

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.140 
see I ate that I add and the lines were
there<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.770> as<00:03:09.950> bad<00:03:10.160> as<00:03:10.400> they<00:03:10.520> are<00:03:10.550> on<00:03:10.880> here

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
there just as bad as they are on here

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.240 
there just as bad as they are on here
and<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:12.110> firmware<00:03:12.560> doesn't<00:03:12.860> do<00:03:12.950> anything

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
and the firmware doesn't do anything

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.400 
and the firmware doesn't do anything
about<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.890> know<00:03:17.230> there<00:03:18.230> they<00:03:18.380> are

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
again and you know the flip manages to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.760 
again and you know the flip manages to
be<00:03:23.390> able<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:24.050> do<00:03:24.800> pretty<00:03:25.550> clear<00:03:26.230> pictures<00:03:27.230> but

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.340 
that I did and there were no lines at
all<00:03:47.390> I<00:03:47.660> mean<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.860> picture<00:03:49.190> quality<00:03:49.340> wasn't

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
all I mean the picture quality wasn't

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.810 
all I mean the picture quality wasn't
that<00:03:51.350> great<00:03:51.820> but<00:03:52.820> there<00:03:53.570> were<00:03:53.750> no<00:03:53.990> lines<00:03:54.260> so

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
you know and here is the bedroom shot

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.000 
you know and here is the bedroom shot
okay<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.250> picture<00:04:02.320> could<00:04:03.320> be<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.590> little<00:04:03.830> bit

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
okay the picture could be a little bit

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.380 
okay the picture could be a little bit
better<00:04:05.770> but<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:07.430> know<00:04:07.490> there's<00:04:08.000> no<00:04:08.180> blue

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390

better but you know there's no blue
lines<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:09.610> when<00:04:10.610> in<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.570> minute<00:04:11.720> there's

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
lines and when in in a minute there's

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.200 
lines and when in in a minute there's
another<00:04:12.350> clip<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.740> I've<00:04:12.890> got<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:13.610> I

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
another clip that I've got and I

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.039 
another clip that I've got and I
actually<00:04:14.360> zoom<00:04:14.840> in<00:04:15.580> so<00:04:16.580> this<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:17.390> with<00:04:17.960> the

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
actually zoom in so this is with the

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.880 
actually zoom in so this is with the
curtains<00:04:18.410> shut<00:04:18.650> but<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.130> light<00:04:19.310> on<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:21.650> I'd

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
curtains shut but the light on so I'd

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.430 
curtains shut but the light on so I'd
still<00:04:22.190> classes<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:22.700> low-light<00:04:23.180> shot<00:04:23.450> no<00:04:24.110> lines

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
still classes a low-light shot no lines

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.700 
still classes a low-light shot no lines
tall<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:25.550> did<00:04:26.320> wvga<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.980> 720p<00:04:28.640> in<00:04:29.060> this<00:04:29.710> same

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
tall I did wvga and 720p in this same

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.470 
tall I did wvga and 720p in this same
lighting<00:04:30.980> conditions<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.850> there<00:04:32.270> were<00:04:32.450> no

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
lighting conditions and there were no

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.620 
lighting conditions and there were no
problems

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
problems

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.630 
problems
and<00:04:33.900> as<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.170> can<00:04:34.350> see<00:04:34.380> okay<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.460> pitch

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
and as you can see okay the pitch

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.060 
and as you can see okay the pitch
quality<00:04:36.060> doesn't<00:04:36.270> get<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.350> great<00:04:37.740> but

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
quality doesn't get that great but

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.500 
quality doesn't get that great but
there's<00:04:38.280> no<00:04:38.490> darkness<00:04:39.620> involved<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:43.350> know

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
there's no darkness involved so you know

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.790 
there's no darkness involved so you know
what's<00:04:45.510> going<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:45.990> there<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.290> what<00:04:47.130> is<00:04:47.340> going<00:04:47.820> on

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
what's going on there a what is going on

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.060 
what's going on there a what is going on
okay<00:04:49.800> so<00:04:50.700> there<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.120> go<00:04:51.150> as<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.260> can<00:04:52.380> see<00:04:52.680> in

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
okay so there you go as you can see in

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.780 
okay so there you go as you can see in
the<00:04:53.640> low<00:04:54.000> light<00:04:54.770> it<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:55.920> quite<00:04:56.160> bad<00:04:56.340> which<00:04:56.640> you

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
the low light it is quite bad which you

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.510 
the low light it is quite bad which you
could<00:04:57.030> almost<00:04:57.390> sort<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.220> forgive<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.370> for

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
could almost sort of forgive it for

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.670 
could almost sort of forgive it for
doing<00:04:59.760> that<00:04:59.880> because<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.930> know<00:05:00.960> at<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.350> kind

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
doing that because you know at that kind

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.320 
doing that because you know at that kind
of<00:05:01.740> price<00:05:01.890> range<00:05:02.040> they're<00:05:02.910> probably<00:05:03.120> hasn't

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
of price range they're probably hasn't

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
of a bit you know knocked at the whole

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.010 
of a bit you know knocked at the whole
situation<00:05:20.540> but<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:21.600> thing<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:21.750> couldn't

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
situation but the thing I couldn't

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.850 
situation but the thing I couldn't
understand<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.710> why<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.580> 1080p<00:05:24.470> could<00:05:25.470> handle

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
understand is why the 1080p could handle

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.640 
understand is why the 1080p could handle
all<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.610> kind<00:05:27.480> of<00:05:27.600> low<00:05:27.840> light<00:05:28.080> situation

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
the settings at 720p seem to be the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.830 
the settings at 720p seem to be the
worst<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:36.230> the<00:05:37.230> thing<00:05:37.410> is<00:05:37.440> you<00:05:37.860> know<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:39.180> wvga

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
worst and the thing is you know the wvga

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.700 
worst and the thing is you know the wvga
you<00:05:39.990> could<00:05:40.410> use<00:05:40.910> all<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.450> time<00:05:42.810> and<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.110> could

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
you could use all the time and you could

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.170 
you could use all the time and you could
just<00:05:43.740> about<00:05:44.040> get<00:05:44.280> away<00:05:44.460> with<00:05:44.640> not<00:05:44.760> seeing<00:05:45.000> the

just about get away with not seeing the
lines<00:05:45.410> but<00:05:46.410> then<00:05:46.650> you<00:05:46.980> know<00:05:47.130> what's<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.460> point

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
lines but then you know what's the point

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.700 
lines but then you know what's the point
of<00:05:47.730> getting<00:05:47.850> a<00:05:48.000> HD<00:05:48.360> camcorder<00:05:48.960> if<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.530> can't

shame because the kodak zi8 does have

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.140 
shame because the kodak zi8 does have
the<00:06:27.810> potential<00:06:28.140> to<00:06:28.350> be<00:06:28.650> one<00:06:29.310> of<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.550> best<00:06:29.760> of

the potential to be one of the best of
the<00:06:30.390> pocket<00:06:30.690> HD<00:06:30.990> camcorders<00:06:31.560> but<00:06:32.490> at<00:06:32.610> the

the pocket HD camcorders but at the

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.110 
the pocket HD camcorders but at the
moment<00:06:32.850> with<00:06:33.360> these<00:06:34.170> lines<00:06:34.530> it<00:06:35.100> just<00:06:35.820> really

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
moment with these lines it just really

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.290
