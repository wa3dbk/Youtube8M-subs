00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.490
 the faleyras circuit gets a new look 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 a huge yard moves away for a while 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 guigui and race cars place is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.699
 left to the big machines stuffing horses 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 but clearly less flexible and agile it 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.310
 completely reformates the stÃ©phane track 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.430
 zittoun thus marks his formidable 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.989
 ambition for faleyras so the repair 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.180
 of the track and the upgrading to the standards of the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.640
 of the French Sports Federation 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.430
 for 2014 was part of 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.100
 my commitments beyond that I think 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.160
 that it is pure having seen then 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.899
 I saw some rallycross circuit 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.289
 I think that and to talk about it with 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.510
 pilots 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.909
 I think that faleyras is part of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.789
 favorite sites of French pilots and 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.070
 Europeans so it would be a shame in any 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.629
 case of not giving him back his adventures 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 that he has already lived through the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.270
 passed improvements and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.520
 major changes essential to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.009
 the sport classification of the circuit 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.200
 she was expected with a lot 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.270
 impatience by the president of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.009
 the management association 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.509
 competitions for the events of the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.369
 rallycross now there is a ride 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.960
 joker who is called who is who is 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.560
 compulsory on all events of the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.569
 France championship 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.979
 no we will not miss him I think 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.450
 good thing after you have to know that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.250
 dates are already filed well in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.080
 advance so there are already trials that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.580
 have already put themselves on the ranks good I 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.259
 think with the realization that is going to be 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.440
 fact that is being done on the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.990
 circuit I think we have good 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.649
 chances of being able to pass 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.799
 in front of the others 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.000
 it's an honor to have found 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.580
 to have found an owner who is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.670
 in love with the mechanical sport that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.560
 is investing 100% with us and the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.820
 volunteers 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.140
 it is clear that volunteers are 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.000
 happy to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.560
 to be able to see that the circuit of 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.120
 faleyras will continue and that go 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.680
 always be able to put their stone to 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.380
 the building because without the volunteers 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.700
 is nothing and volunteers in god 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.869
 know he needs it for the tests 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.370
 and all that can be at the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.560
 arrangements the interviews of the circuit 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.090
 and all that very quickly the circuit goes 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.180
 return to normal activity 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.310
 many events are already 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.840
 programmed the championship of France of 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.880

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.430
