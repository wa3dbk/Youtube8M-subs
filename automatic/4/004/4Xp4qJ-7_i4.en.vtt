00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 of sugar you who follow me already 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.920
 You know how it is that I model 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.810
 expensive bodies 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.620
 let's say of figures or in this case it's a 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.230
 woman the sleeping beauty 'then if not 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.270
 You have seen it still in the video or the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.020
 videos that I have posted I will leave below 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:00.820
 two options an option of how to model 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.260
 a woman without molds only with her 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.830
 hands and good one on that other 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.960
 instrument and another video that I made that 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.170
 hung up recently that is also from a 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.119
 woman I hope you help me for the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.190
 face of a mold that is the mold of 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.800
 silicone only for the part of the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.759
 face but it's not really that it was 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.220
 so marked the factions but let's say 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.750
 it helps a little that they have two 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.540
 if they can not work with their 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.220
 hands then use the mold and if 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.990
 they do well or their hands well cohabitation 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.159
 the portability mold with your hands 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 can do 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.840
 various face shapes and features and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.900
 one is not limited to just that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.670
 good karaoke way then I leave you 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.659
 these two videos I will also leave you 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.940
 down all the information about the cake 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.920
 in itself how is it done as they went around 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.990
 as it is covered to tota as it is filled and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.440
 all that for people who are 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.440
 starting 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.830
 obviously I'm not much I'm not the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.700
 Expert but I always do my best 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.979
 effort to do things the best that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.630
 you can then I'll show you how 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.440
 was the cake what 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.980
 but not 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.410
 and the cake was left like this is a first 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.990
 flat but I think that there you can not see 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.800
 turn off the light and here to 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.600
 well, because if we do not we can not serve it 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.310
 excuse me if I only make the videos 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.890
 always at night is that at this time 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.050
 I usually finish the cakes and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.120
 come to pick up now type right now they are 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.810
 7 o'clock at night they come to pick them up 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.150
 in 2 hours and then this one then 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.070
 the light does not help me in sunlight 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.400
 then I only have my little bit and 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.070
 Ready, this is how I told you this 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.650
 It is the face that we have aside you 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.510
 you can see it here it's better a face 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.420
 modeled without the mold is only 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.390
 using the fingers 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.270
 and if the dress is doll this stop 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.069
 it's the same methodology as dolls 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.069
 that are sitting only that 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.370
 instead of placing him say the stick 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.319
 that when the dolls are 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.390
 sitting down you see the video I put the 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.840
 stick that serves as support to everything 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.090
 which is the body when the doll is 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.260
 sitting true then only the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.660
 stick reaches what would be the most 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.310
 down the hips ok holds everything 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.489
 from there up from the thorax 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.849
 up in this case on the sticks 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.650
 I have 21 for each leg and therefore each one 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.370
 Holds one leg and at the same time 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.190
 leave a little bit left me a bit of a 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.310
 free stick to be able to click on the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.130
 cake and so the good ornament does not move 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.740
 that 's the doll that I made here the can 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.740
 see back profile 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.040
 this is a two-story cake I made 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.350
 flowers that I already explained how is 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.080
 that I paste the flowers in the video that 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.600
 I made of llull 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.150
 from the movie River are the same kind of 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.370
 flowers and how they are stuck and these flowers 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.980
 They are already dry because they work days 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.230
 with days of anticipation then never 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.500
 they dare to stick something dry in the 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.540
 fondant that the fondant let's say the 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.070
 Cake shape in the early morning 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.870
 that is to say at this time that I finish 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.170
 place the flowers the fondant was already 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.970
 not dry but hey this was not cool 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.650
 really cool because as you go 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.400
 the hours the fondant loses 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.130
 moisture then when they have flowers 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.760
 dry, what I recommend is to do 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.310
 paste like little balls of fondant 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.370
 cool 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.280
 his flower stick it in the back and 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.580
 then hit to paste that part 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.070
 they have added fresh fondant and that 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.530
 it's just stuck to the cake and it does not 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.130
 forget to put a stick in the middle 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.390
 of the flower so you see go well sure 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.380
 especially when the cakes go to 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.020
 travel ok 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.690
 well then I made little butterflies around 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.690
 in place the name and I also made a 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.690
 crown that see it down here because this 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.150
 person wanted the topper of the beautiful 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.950
 sleeper 'and also wanted the crown and 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.630
 I wanted butterflies and you wanted flowers 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.760
 so I wanted a lot of things and I was 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.220
 thinking how to put all that together in the 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.810
 cake and well it occurred to me that this was 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.670
 a good option since above no longer 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.160
 there is room to place more things 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.590
 so I said I put the crown on the 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.520
 part of below and thus also gives me a 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.759
 foreground 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.090
 nicer let's say for the cake true 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:51.229
 and well here everything is edible except 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.090
 these stones that I placed for the crown 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.490
 that are simply ornaments and obviously 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.060
 that if you put something that is not 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.490
 edible like these to these areas 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.430
 that hold the butterflies or the 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.800
 sticks that go to that help to stick the 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.030
 flowers or the sticks that hold the 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.729
 doll 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.990
 all that they have to warn the 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.610
 person who were wearing the watch 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.949
 cake so they have caution to the 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.900
 time to leave you eat it good that's 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.060
 all this is a chocolate cake with 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.440
 vanilla filling covered with toilet 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.150
 cream and well that's all that's all 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.240
 I hope you liked it here 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.940
 I make a close-up 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.140

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.140
