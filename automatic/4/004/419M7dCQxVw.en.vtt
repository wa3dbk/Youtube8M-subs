00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.950 
cooking 94 cooking already halfway to 99
well<00:05:02.100> quite<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.580> bit<00:05:02.730> over<00:05:02.880> halfway<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.360> 99<00:05:03.780> but

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
well quite a bit over halfway to 99 but

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.930 
well quite a bit over halfway to 99 but
I've<00:05:04.440> started<00:05:04.770> with<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.070> Rockdale<00:05:05.550> cooking

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
I've started with the Rockdale cooking

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.970 
I've started with the Rockdale cooking
now<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.060> did<00:05:06.270> about<00:05:06.450> 100k<00:05:06.930> XP<00:05:07.290> of<00:05:07.440> rock<00:05:07.650> tales

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
now I did about 100k XP of rock tales

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.280 
now I did about 100k XP of rock tales
but<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.790> had<00:05:09.060> already<00:05:09.210> done<00:05:09.480> two<00:05:09.690> levels<00:05:10.080> today

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
but I had already done two levels today

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.710 
but I had already done two levels today
in<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.620> Sharks<00:05:10.950> so<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.400> figured<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.390> know<00:05:12.480> it's

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
in the Sharks so I figured you know it's

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.480 
in the Sharks so I figured you know it's
time<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:12.990> take<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.140> break<00:05:13.230> from<00:05:13.530> cooking<00:05:13.740> when

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
time to take a break from cooking when

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.220 
time to take a break from cooking when
you<00:05:14.580> got<00:05:14.730> over<00:05:14.970> a<00:05:15.000> mil<00:05:15.270> cooking<00:05:15.600> XP<00:05:15.930> in<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.050> day

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
you got over a mil cooking XP in a day

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.810 
you got over a mil cooking XP in a day
then<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:16.770> figure<00:05:16.980> you're<00:05:17.220> doing<00:05:17.430> pretty<00:05:17.520> good

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
then you figure you're doing pretty good

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.750 
then you figure you're doing pretty good
but<00:05:18.150> yeah<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:19.200> most<00:05:19.800> likely<00:05:20.040> will<00:05:20.340> be<00:05:20.400> getting

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
but yeah I most likely will be getting

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.320 
but yeah I most likely will be getting
99<00:05:20.940> cooking<00:05:21.600> in<00:05:22.100> not<00:05:23.100> too<00:05:23.370> long<00:05:23.400> maybe<00:05:24.060> even

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
99 cooking in not too long maybe even

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.760 
99 cooking in not too long maybe even

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
actually is having like a big event this

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.870 
actually is having like a big event this
Saturday<00:05:30.210> whole<00:05:30.419> large<00:05:31.410> 99<00:05:32.040> getting<00:05:32.400> event<00:05:32.640> so

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
i might try to get in on that it

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.650 
i might try to get in on that it
probably<00:05:35.550> wouldn't<00:05:35.820> be<00:05:35.880> too<00:05:36.060> difficult<00:05:36.090> to

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
probably wouldn't be too difficult to

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.500 
probably wouldn't be too difficult to
pound<00:05:37.200> out<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:37.500> cooking<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:37.980> before<00:05:38.520> then<00:05:38.640> but
