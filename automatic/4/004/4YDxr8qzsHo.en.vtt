get<00:00:34.480> bomb-throwing<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:37.390> gonna<00:00:37.510> do<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:37.629> short

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
get bomb-throwing we're gonna do a short

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.799 
get bomb-throwing we're gonna do a short
little<00:00:38.609> tester<00:00:39.609> I<00:00:39.670> got<00:00:39.879> two<00:00:40.300> liters<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.600> water

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
little tester I got two liters of water

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.160 
little tester I got two liters of water
and<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.460> water<00:00:42.609> bladder<00:00:42.940> back<00:00:43.180> here<00:00:43.449> so<00:00:44.019> one

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
and the water bladder back here so one

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.330 
and the water bladder back here so one
of<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.289> reasons<00:00:44.530> like<00:00:44.680> you're<00:00:44.859> in<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:45.010> filter

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
of the reasons like you're in a filter

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.060 
of the reasons like you're in a filter
is<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:46.719> own<00:00:46.840> water<00:00:47.109> you<00:00:47.320> can<00:00:47.469> filter<00:00:47.800> you

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
is your own water you can filter you

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.139 
is your own water you can filter you
always<00:00:48.280> got<00:00:48.399> you<00:00:48.460> don't<00:00:48.519> have<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.730> carry<00:00:48.940> dance

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
always got you don't have to carry dance

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.790 
always got you don't have to carry dance
less<00:00:49.300> weight<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.600> have<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.809> carry<00:00:50.050> now<00:00:50.620> this

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
less weight you have to carry now this

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.439 
less weight you have to carry now this
weighs<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.010> pound<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.519> little<00:00:51.820> over<00:00:51.969> a<00:00:52.000> pound

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
weighs a pound a little over a pound

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.840 
weighs a pound a little over a pound
I<00:00:52.570> think<00:00:52.840> it's<00:00:53.309> might<00:00:54.309> be<00:00:54.429> your<00:00:54.550> own<00:00:54.609> opponent

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
I think it's might be your own opponent

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.229 
I think it's might be your own opponent
half<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.629> I'll<00:00:55.929> have<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.140> look<00:00:56.320> but<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:58.149> know

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
half a I'll have to look but you know

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.729 
half a I'll have to look but you know
that's<00:00:58.329> not<00:00:58.780> much<00:00:58.960> water<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.260> think<00:00:59.440> what<00:00:59.620> is

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
that's not much water I think what is

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.910 
that's not much water I think what is
water<00:01:01.079> pounds<00:01:02.079> per<00:01:02.260> gallon<00:01:02.320> there's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
water pounds per gallon there's

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.430 
water pounds per gallon there's
something<00:01:03.160> like<00:01:03.249> that<00:01:04.050> another<00:01:05.050> reason<00:01:05.379> I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
something like that another reason I

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.990 
something like that another reason I
like<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.740> don't<00:01:05.800> have<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.190> tear<00:01:06.370> my<00:01:06.490> pack<00:01:06.670> apart

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
like I don't have to tear my pack apart

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.060 
like I don't have to tear my pack apart
to<00:01:07.150> get<00:01:07.270> pull<00:01:08.049> my<00:01:08.140> water<00:01:08.320> bladder<00:01:08.560> off<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.890> take

the ceramic filter in and I want to pull

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.680 
the ceramic filter in and I want to pull
it<00:03:55.170> apart<00:03:55.230> I'll<00:03:55.500> show<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:56.660> kind<00:03:57.660> of

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
it apart I'll show that kind of

the<00:04:51.260> katadyn<00:04:51.889> I'll<00:04:52.400> show<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.639> how<00:04:52.760> things

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
the katadyn I'll show you how things

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.409 
the katadyn I'll show you how things
apart<00:04:54.580> up<00:04:55.580> here<00:04:55.930> first<00:04:56.930> off<00:04:57.110> fire<00:04:57.710> holds<00:04:57.979> this

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
apart up here first off fire holds this

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.150 
apart up here first off fire holds this
so<00:04:59.419> this<00:04:59.539> works<00:04:59.750> one-handed<00:05:00.260> drink<00:05:00.860> clean

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
so this works one-handed drink clean

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.679 
so this works one-handed drink clean
water<00:05:01.190> hose<00:05:04.990> dirty<00:05:05.990> water<00:05:06.229> hose

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.040 

top<00:05:09.689> unscrews<00:05:10.139> here<00:05:11.509> and<00:05:12.509> it<00:05:12.629> pulls<00:05:12.870> out<00:05:13.020> your

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
top unscrews here and it pulls out your

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.070 
top unscrews here and it pulls out your
piston<00:05:14.509> every<00:05:15.509> once<00:05:15.629> in<00:05:15.689> a<00:05:15.750> while<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.900> want<00:05:16.020> to

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
piston every once in a while you want to

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.830 
piston every once in a while you want to
keep<00:05:16.199> oil<00:05:16.469> this<00:05:16.560> little<00:05:17.330> gasket<00:05:18.330> on<00:05:18.419> there

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
keep oil this little gasket on there

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:34.680 
keep oil this little gasket on there
then<00:05:21.480> comes<00:05:22.480> off<00:05:32.070> covered<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:34.270> ceramic

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
then comes off covered the ceramic

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.629 
then comes off covered the ceramic
filter<00:05:34.770> so<00:05:35.770> there<00:05:35.919> it<00:05:35.980> is<00:05:36.070> it's<00:05:36.280> all<00:05:36.430> there<00:05:36.550> is

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
filter so there it is it's all there is

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.270
