00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
she actually went through herself

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.610 
she actually went through herself
because<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.510> get<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.780> see<00:04:00.810> some<00:04:01.080> of<00:04:01.170> her<00:04:01.320> story

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
because you get to see some of her story

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.620 
because you get to see some of her story
in<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.860> too<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:03.090> all<00:04:03.239> adds<00:04:03.420> up<00:04:03.570> to

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
in this too and it all adds up to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.240 
in this too and it all adds up to
something<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.350> can<00:04:04.530> be<00:04:04.680> really<00:04:04.980> really

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
something that you can be really really

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.850 
something that you can be really really
sad<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.060> move<00:04:06.780> watching<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.380> film<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.769> then

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
sad and move watching this film and then

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.320 
sad and move watching this film and then
you<00:04:08.010> can<00:04:08.160> also<00:04:08.310> feel<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.700> little<00:04:08.970> bit<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.150> Hope

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
you can also feel a little bit of Hope

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.140 
you can also feel a little bit of Hope
too<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.320> it's<00:04:10.739> an<00:04:10.920> incredible<00:04:11.580> work<00:04:11.940> and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
too so it's it's an incredible work and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.300 
too so it's it's an incredible work and
I<00:04:12.600> really<00:04:12.930> give<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.530> actors<00:04:13.890> more<00:04:14.130> than

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
I really give it to the actors more than

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.340 
I really give it to the actors more than
anybody<00:04:14.730> else<00:04:14.940> in<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.360> film<00:04:15.660> yeah<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.290> I

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
anybody else in this film yeah and I

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.539 
anybody else in this film yeah and I
think<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.590> cinematographer<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.280> something

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
think the cinematographer is something

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.430 
think the cinematographer is something
to<00:04:17.609> be<00:04:17.729> talked<00:04:18.299> about<00:04:18.510> as<00:04:18.630> well<00:04:18.810> because<00:04:19.260> it's

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
to be talked about as well because it's

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.170 
to be talked about as well because it's
just<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.709> way<00:04:19.859> it's<00:04:20.609> created<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.090> when

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
just the way it's created and when

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.909 
just the way it's created and when
you're<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.419> working<00:04:21.989> on<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.109> period<00:04:22.470> piece<00:04:22.560> to

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
you're in working on a period piece to

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.230 
you're in working on a period piece to
you<00:04:23.039> really<00:04:23.190> felt<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.640> were<00:04:23.820> during

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
you really felt like you were during

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.970 
you really felt like you were during
these<00:04:24.360> times

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
these times

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.770 
these times
there's<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.520> really<00:04:25.670> really<00:04:25.970> great<00:04:26.120> piece<00:04:26.480> over

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
there's a really really great piece over

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.530 
there's a really really great piece over
I<00:04:26.990> mean<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.800> would<00:04:28.340> probably<00:04:28.580> say<00:04:28.970> if<00:04:29.120> this<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.390> a

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
of five and I think that um yeah I think

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.960 
of five and I think that um yeah I think
that<00:05:06.410> I<00:05:06.440> agree<00:05:06.560> with<00:05:06.710> your<00:05:06.890> point<00:05:06.950> data<00:05:07.460> it

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
that I agree with your point data it

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
that I agree with your point data it
almost<00:05:08.240> felt<00:05:08.510> like<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.750> could<00:05:08.840> have<00:05:08.930> been

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
almost felt like it could have been

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.570 
almost felt like it could have been
three<00:05:09.320> parts<00:05:09.680> like<00:05:10.100> there<00:05:10.250> was<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.430> first

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
three parts like there was the first

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.010 
three parts like there was the first
part<00:05:10.790> when<00:05:10.880> he's<00:05:10.970> younger<00:05:11.150> bar<00:05:11.690> when<00:05:11.810> he's<00:05:11.900> in

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
part when he's younger bar when he's in

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.630 
part when he's younger bar when he's in
jail<00:05:12.230> and<00:05:12.440> then<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:12.620> think<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:12.980> third<00:05:13.280> part

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
jail and then I think the third part

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.760 
jail and then I think the third part
when<00:05:13.880> he<00:05:13.910> rises<00:05:14.630> to<00:05:14.750> power<00:05:14.930> could<00:05:15.320> have<00:05:15.560> been

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
when he rises to power could have been

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.200 
when he rises to power could have been
longer<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.430> you<00:05:16.700> would<00:05:16.790> have<00:05:16.850> seen<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.030> little

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
longer and you would have seen a little

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.120 
longer and you would have seen a little
bit<00:05:17.360> more<00:05:17.570> what<00:05:17.690> he<00:05:17.780> accomplished<00:05:18.380> but<00:05:18.890> again

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
bit more what he accomplished but again

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.890 
bit more what he accomplished but again
it's<00:05:19.370> it<00:05:19.700> is<00:05:20.000> what<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.240> is<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.450> just<00:05:20.480> Alba<00:05:20.840> is

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
it's it is what it is it just Alba is

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.520 
it's it is what it is it just Alba is
going<00:05:21.200> to<00:05:21.320> be<00:05:21.440> nominated<00:05:22.010> I<00:05:22.250> think<00:05:22.960> yeah<00:05:23.990> and
