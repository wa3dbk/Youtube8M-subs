from here and went out in fro to was

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.160 
from here and went out in fro to was
like<00:03:38.640> trying<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.700> go<00:03:40.420> under<00:03:40.660> rent<00:03:40.870> his<00:03:40.960> header

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
like trying to go under rent his header

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.900 
like trying to go under rent his header
and<00:03:41.380> he<00:03:41.470> spun<00:03:41.800> out<00:03:41.860> nowhere<00:03:42.460> I<00:03:42.520> could<00:03:42.730> go<00:03:42.880> I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
and he spun out nowhere I could go I

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.640 
and he spun out nowhere I could go I
clipped<00:03:43.360> them<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.840> broke<00:03:44.020> my<00:03:44.170> brake<00:03:44.440> line

I could sit here and be mad or think

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.910 
I could sit here and be mad or think
about<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.720> but<00:03:49.810> nothing<00:03:50.110> you<00:03:50.200> do<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.440> change<00:03:50.620> it
