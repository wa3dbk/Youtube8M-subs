00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
our review up into three separate phases

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.019 
our review up into three separate phases
first<00:00:20.010> we'll<00:00:20.220> talk<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> construction

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
first we'll talk about the construction

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.460 
first we'll talk about the construction
then<00:00:21.630> we'll<00:00:21.750> give<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.900> some<00:00:22.080> information

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
then we'll give you some information

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.050 
then we'll give you some information
about<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> fit<00:00:22.860> specs<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.460> finally<00:00:23.940> we'll

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
about the fit specs and finally we'll

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.340 
about the fit specs and finally we'll
wrap<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.360> with<00:00:24.510> how<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> boot<00:00:24.869> performs<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
wrap up with how the boot performs in

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.790 
wrap up with how the boot performs in
the<00:00:25.410> field<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:26.100> you<00:00:26.160> ready

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.100 

first<00:00:30.800> construction<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.540> reason<00:00:32.900> that<00:00:32.989> we

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
first construction the reason that we

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.979 
first construction the reason that we
like<00:00:33.320> this<00:00:33.500> booth<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.010> much<00:00:34.250> is<00:00:34.700> it<00:00:35.270> has<00:00:35.510> almost

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
like this booth so much is it has almost

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.100 
like this booth so much is it has almost
an<00:00:36.200> old-school<00:00:36.860> philosophy<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:38.360> its<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.989> its

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
an old-school philosophy to its to its

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.900 
an old-school philosophy to its to its
design<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.650> its<00:00:39.739> construction<00:00:40.129> it's<00:00:40.820> very

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
design and its construction it's very

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.580 
design and its construction it's very
simple<00:00:41.480> uses<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:41.960> very<00:00:42.110> simple<00:00:42.350> construction

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
simple uses a very simple construction

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.009 
simple uses a very simple construction
the<00:00:43.309> entire<00:00:43.670> upper<00:00:44.120> of<00:00:44.270> this<00:00:44.420> boot<00:00:44.480> is<00:00:44.809> made

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
the entire upper of this boot is made

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.590 
the entire upper of this boot is made
from<00:00:45.199> only<00:00:45.320> five<00:00:45.980> pieces<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.489> in<00:00:46.670> fact<00:00:46.910> two

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
from only five pieces and in fact two

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.049 
from only five pieces and in fact two
pieces<00:00:48.019> of<00:00:48.050> leather<00:00:48.320> comprise<00:00:48.920> probably<00:00:49.699> 90%

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
pieces of leather comprise probably 90%

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.630 
pieces of leather comprise probably 90%
of<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.780> upper<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.290> that<00:00:51.680> means<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:52.129> greatly

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
of the upper and that means a greatly

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.299 
of the upper and that means a greatly
reduced<00:00:52.820> amount<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.570> seams<00:00:53.900> and<00:00:54.309> because

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
reduced amount of seams and because

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.520 
reduced amount of seams and because
there's<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.239> much<00:00:56.390> less<00:00:56.660> seams<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.199> boot<00:00:57.350> can

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
there's so much less seams the boot can

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.430 
there's so much less seams the boot can
fold<00:00:57.829> increase<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.820> conform<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.019> become

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
fold increase and conform and become

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.950 
fold increase and conform and become
much<00:01:00.800> more<00:01:01.010> comfortable<00:01:01.610> for<00:01:02.120> for<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.780> user

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
much more comfortable for for the user

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.660 
much more comfortable for for the user
so<00:01:03.289> that's<00:01:03.500> one<00:01:03.770> thing<00:01:03.949> that<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:04.190> really<00:01:04.460> like

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
so that's one thing that we really like

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.540 
so that's one thing that we really like
the<00:01:05.390> second<00:01:05.780> thing<00:01:05.899> is<00:01:06.110> this<00:01:06.920> leather<00:01:07.250> is

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
the second thing is this leather is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.639 
the second thing is this leather is
actually<00:01:08.240> according<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:09.140> guarantee<00:01:09.500> the
