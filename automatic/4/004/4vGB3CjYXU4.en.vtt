00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.759
 Well, what you think that holds the band 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.279
 have the bathing scene followed by top 14 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.420
 could be the top 5 at something tricks the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.680
 we have for you today and I would 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.939
 say and click in the first one 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.650
 just tip exactly and that is what we have there 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 directly on the map, the children know the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.060
 In the middle there is the glass above and if you are 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.700
 there a box then placed 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.780
 you can from the inside of the box 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.010
 Just access it as you go 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.480
 the glass breaks and one hits 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.070
 Right click immediately and the glass 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 once again appears only anyway 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.850
 is responsible and so you can actually 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.579
 in front of the opponents inside are in the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.890
 google protect the end crate and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.920
 at the same time in his own best 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.420
 transport gold and best yet 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.770
 a team with it then in the base 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.500
 take out that it is not in there 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.629
 stay in the box and yes then 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.100
 you just have as the crate will then 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 not dismantled by any 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.910
 other teams are separated there 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.379
 that is why it is good that the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.820
 really out there because if that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.350
 you would have it in there then maybe you would have 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.479
 for a moment and always have to 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.430
 take a new one in the box and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.430
 so outside cover glass 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.420
 punch through and dingens in the box 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 enter and the b is transported 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.270
 I would say we may have to 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.659
 second trick we have today or 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.460
 yes, that's exactly where we have that gives 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.950
 it's new in battles namely the tabs 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.600
 So this case will be disabled if 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.380
 You can run against it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.619
 place well 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.000
 the way the first is at the middle 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 So if you are the way centered 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.340
 board and you get this trip on the very 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.990
 start where from the middle and if 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.149
 then an opponent runs over it then comes 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.950
 a signal that an enemy is watching 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.149
 has gone over it and gets 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.490
 plus a few negative ones 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.409
 effects that means he sees less eating 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.780
 slow and so on and then you can 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.310
 The down throw attacks and one is 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.840
 just better prepared if 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.009
 an opponent will not attack anymore 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 Surprised that captain yes at our 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.340
 peters follow 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.689
 our bed was mined there again and we 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.240
 ask us then a few words fuck 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.190
 why was our bed dismantled ? 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.590
 and quite useful and yes 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.810
 Then I would come to the third 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.599
 wears and the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.610
 on a map that is on the caravan 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.410
 there you have the small caravan in 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.840
 can rank and out there at the door 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.730
 could place whole and not crate 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 the box is not the complete one 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.840
 block big and that is why the type of 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.130
 then on the crate is not easy 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.560
 he could go in purely theoretically 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.660
 to put a blog over it with him 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.580
 shopping and that's the way it is 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.760
 Many do not know and therefore to me 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.680
 get the kids and boni 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.640
 First of all the box though she did that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.920
 would not have to 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.600
 and so could with a box alone 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.120
 actually quite good the whole 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.680
 although he usually defends more 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.190
 but we like to play without 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.190
 bed then I would say come on 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.870
 to the next or exactly knows each other 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.150
 All the most opponents you like 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.500
 the beds or the way to the beds with 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.209
 you know, for example, boxes 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.459
 candy where he likes to meet people 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.549
 crates is blocked or even china where 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.349
 we take these opposite to the bed with quasi 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.209
 There are also boxes full 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.590
 still are other maps but there are 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.269
 now a remedy that me the whole 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.670
 you had to break down boxes 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.310
 namely with a mp all between the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.420
 Slits quasi through godfather looks too 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.220
 in the background we go for example 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.630
 At the ladder could be at candy 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.220
 when the kiss is placed above there 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.079
 you just have to climb up and then 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.120
 at the gap between crate and block 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.100
 throw the npd through and you're there 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.290
 in the room where the bed is and can 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.290
 cozy mine does not have extra-piste 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.480
 leave and then I will come 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.150
 we are the last and indeed the rescue 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.069
 use platforms as a way because it 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.959
 mostly it is that would be really 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.400
 During the walk you will be so often 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.230
 shot underneath and that's the way it is 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
 has annoying and if you too much gold 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.609
 then just make rescue platform 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.709
 jump right over and gossip that 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.630
 away or you can do it too 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.859
 use around at an existing path 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.870
 just an arrow and a bow 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.359
 Dodge on the left for example 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.489
 so if you really have enough gold 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.989
 makes it easy is really cool 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.400
 especially with the single apps there 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.829
 you get enough gold and there you can as well 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.109
 really good use and then the 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.280
 Slap opponents relatively easy 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.290
 and that's exactly what it was 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.299
 yes, one would only say who by the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.560
 Today's top pursuers I liked 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.440
 then you can like the like button 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.900
 cumshots and yes that's what of mine 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.900
 page and see you next time
