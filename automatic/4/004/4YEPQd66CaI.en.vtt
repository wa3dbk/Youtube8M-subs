core over four he'll removes it from the
cabinet<00:00:24.890> all<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.010> now<00:00:26.189> he's<00:00:26.369> just<00:00:26.430> cutting

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
cabinet all right now he's just cutting

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.540 
cabinet all right now he's just cutting
into<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.449> vapor<00:00:27.869> line<00:00:28.170> prior<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.519> had

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
into the vapor line prior to this we had

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.479 
into the vapor line prior to this we had
already<00:00:30.320> recovered<00:00:31.320> all<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> refrigerant

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
already recovered all the refrigerant

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.080 
already recovered all the refrigerant
and<00:00:34.760> located<00:00:35.760> down<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.239> here's<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.760> new<00:00:38.760> coil

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and located down so here's the new coil

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.720 
and located down so here's the new coil
we<00:00:39.930> had<00:00:40.050> pulled<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> old<00:00:40.440> coil<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:41.100> sitting

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
we had pulled the old coil out sitting

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.920 
we had pulled the old coil out sitting
to<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.879> side<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:44.489> notice<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.780> we're

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to the side and notice here we're

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.410 
to the side and notice here we're
putting<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.469> new<00:00:46.890> coil<00:00:47.190> back<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.239> new

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
putting the new coil back in the new

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.540 
putting the new coil back in the new
coils<00:00:49.010> are<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.719> aluminum<00:00:51.800> piping<00:00:52.800> which

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
coils are all aluminum piping which

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.250 
coils are all aluminum piping which
helps<00:00:53.910> reduce<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.590> acid<00:00:55.590> eating<00:00:56.550> away<00:00:56.699> at<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
helps reduce the acid eating away at the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.479 
helps reduce the acid eating away at the
joints<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.730> causing<00:00:59.730> leaks<00:01:00.859> here<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.100> new

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
joints and causing leaks here the new

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.600 
joints and causing leaks here the new
coil<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.120> place<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:03.660> cutting<00:01:04.019> into<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
coil is in place we're cutting into the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
coil is in place we're cutting into the
vapor<00:01:05.610> line<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.210> release<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.860> nitrogen<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
vapor line to release the nitrogen that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.410 
vapor line to release the nitrogen that
was<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> system<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> dry

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
was in this system this was a dry

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
was in this system this was a dry
replacement<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.619> old<00:01:10.890> r22<00:01:11.700> system<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
replacement for old r22 system so the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
replacement for old r22 system so the
nitrogen<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> being<00:01:15.060> released<00:01:17.450> now<00:01:18.450> we're

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
nitrogen is being released now we're

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
nitrogen is being released now we're
gonna<00:01:18.720> fit<00:01:19.020> back<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> liquid<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.130> vapor

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
gonna fit back the liquid and vapor

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.060 
gonna fit back the liquid and vapor

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
the proper adjustments to the pipe

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.420 
the proper adjustments to the pipe
four<00:01:29.480> correct<00:01:29.810> fittings<00:01:30.230> will<00:01:30.530> braise<00:01:31.010> of<00:01:31.280> us

four correct fittings will braise of us

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.900 
four correct fittings will braise of us
in<00:01:32.590> won't<00:01:33.590> show<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.920> brazing<00:01:34.400> because<00:01:34.700> the
