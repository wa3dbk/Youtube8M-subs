 External manual feed

 they are passages that get angry and 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.790
 put on the lips like the ones that came 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.280
 with the chewing gum that we 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.190
 we put 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.950
 we looked for them and they stayed exactly 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.990

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.349

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.450
 they are called sexy passion and explains 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.540
 they come like this and come with a lot of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.510
 designs the only purchase that these have 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.250
 tattoos is that they come to us in format 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.000
 ready they always come 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.730
 with this is it kind of yelling or come with 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.400
 gang or with animal print is 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.530
 great for parties to dazzle 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.300
 with the lips but some plugs for 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.490
 every day and this is fantastic for 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.060
 his Portuguese peers with brides because they do not 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.850
 they go they can eat eat they can give 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.400
 kisses and do not transfer does not come out 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.780
 they are delicious so stay there 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.510
 we're going to try it 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 when we take out the plastic we'll see 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.450
 here in back here come all the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.770
 instructions 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.969
 Y 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.969
 we open this 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.720
 he is the saint who from the back has 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.409
 this pattern which we have to 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.509
 cut 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.569
 is in the bottom part is in the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.850
 part of above and see that here I do not know if 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.159
 it looks says not to cut down and not 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.319
 cut above or we have 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.079
 We measure this in our own 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.909
 lips and go trimming what is going to see how 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.159
 is this is what I'll do 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.679
 now 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.679
 first I'm going to cut the top 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
 cutting 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.870
 to see that come in my lips young 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.390
 because if it's good is that if you have 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.240
 several little things like me with these 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.430
 Tattoos are not noticeable if you enlarge them 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.830
 change with the eyeliner there are other 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.850
 so with these photos you can send a 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.850
 little more larger 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.590
 once they gave me 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.319
 has a plastic agraven we are going to 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.580
 take out the plastic 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.530
 and we will support it from the side 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.530
 the design so 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.280
 but no 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.880
 once we catch with a cotton 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.810
 and water 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.810
 let's go down 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:31.290
 because I did not want and I put another what 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.290
 It's good that he looks 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.970
 and it does not come out that's what it has 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.350
 spectacular 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.300
 this tattoo is here bevelled that's what 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.060
 that has the bad that they are all two 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.030
 they have some pattern yes or yes what I did 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.120
 so they know is take on the part of 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.070
 up the bottom part cut well 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.540
 if they have these that most of them have left 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:02.580
 here a piece of black that is the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.580
 same image as this 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.660
 when we cut the lip down that a 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.970
 bit that's not good 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.330
 but we just made the pitfall it showed 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.330
 much 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.150
 we remove the plastic we put of this 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.690
 part in the lip we arrange it well 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.510
 as we want and then once 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.270
 that we have it like this we wet with the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.400
 cotton until it comes off just not 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.650
 we have to give it to us because if 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.650
 they start to throw us good 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.240
 it only takes about 10 seconds whenever 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:49.370
 we are looking for it we put it to pain 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:53.150
 my opinion is also the special zone 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.949
 If you want to spend a night with goodbye with 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.770
 something on the lips all night is 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:01.520
 great because we eat we take 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.680
 they are now to fight to put them 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.870
 because it's not easy to put it later what 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.699
 what they can do is delineate the ones a little 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.560
 put a bit of concealer on them to 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.990
 that who more perfect because the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.510
 edges are usually a bit cloudy and 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.510
 again they do not come out 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:23.210
 it does not transfer it's great for 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.360
 this the truth that is the super I think that 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.930
 have to always remove it with a 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.779
 oil base or can be removed with 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.189
 baby oil with almond oil or 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:39.409
 with the eye makeup the one that had 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:42.909
 with this bazaar is fantastic slowly 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:46.620
 With a lot of patience they do not have to 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:50.150
 slowly remaining with cotton quoted 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.150
 the corn product before 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.449
 so I hope you liked it or review 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.150
 below I'll leave a link to the 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:04.710
