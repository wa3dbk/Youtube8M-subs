00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 Grow baby welcomes you and for today I have prepared you, teach your son the concept 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.269
 of number. 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.269
 From the age of 2 it is already propitious to start teaching your child the concept of number. 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.269
 In one way or another, you start to conceive it when you tell it; you are 1 year old or you have 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.269
 2 years old, immediately your little one appropriates your finger, to look at it, but not 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.269
 is appropriating the quantity, that is 1 finger or that it is 2 fingers is only doing 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.269
 imitations 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.269
 If you want to teach your child more effectively the notion of number is important 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.269
 that you appropriate your daily life. 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.269
 For each article, for each garment, for each object that surrounds the little one is a real 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.269
 element to teach him the notion of number. 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:42.710
 For example, if lunch time arrives and you are going to prepare fruit, before giving it 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:01:15.709
 your breakfast, if you show it is an apple and he looks at it, touches it, is associating the number 

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.016
 1 to an article, in this case to a fruit and you're already starting it in a concrete way 

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.016
 to the concept of number. 

00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:22.429
 If the time comes to prepare the table and you ask him to place a cup, which place 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:32.189
 spoons, which place the dishes for those who go to breakfast the single act of placement 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.850
 It is already taking him to conceive quantity. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:50.171
 And if during this journey of being placed the table you stop a moment to ask; 

00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:51.380
 How many cups are there? Or you indicate that there is a cup here and then you ask him to place it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.729
 on the plate, the child is already making associations, quantity and what is 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.639
 correspond to another article, immediately you are leading to the notion of class and subclass. 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:16.900
 Why? because he realizes and asks you that there are more dishes and cups are missing, you are taking 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:30.110
 the child at the beginning of the logic at the beginning of the amount and if you take advantage of that 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.860
 moment to count the dishes now, the child will follow you. 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:58.080
 Show him how he is 1, 2, 3 plates and 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.080
 1 cup and you took it to 2 vital moments to conceive number. 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080
 And if you close the moments of breakfast, lunch or dinner doing the same with another 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.540
 article as the spoons will continue reinforcing number concept. 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:26.200
 Counting is such a simple action that can be given through everyday life, either at the moment 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:35.990
 to dress it, either at the time of putting the shoes, either at the time of putting it 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:50.970
 socks. Each item, item or item that 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.010
 crossing the path of the child will serve perfectly to bring you to understand the notion of number. 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.190
