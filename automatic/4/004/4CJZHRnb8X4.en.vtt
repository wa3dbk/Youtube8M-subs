that's yours this is your lesson you can
see<00:00:53.450> it<00:00:53.660> looks<00:00:53.810> like<00:00:53.870> a<00:00:53.990> brain<00:00:54.320> doesn't<00:00:54.680> that

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
see it looks like a brain doesn't that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.380 
see it looks like a brain doesn't that
look<00:00:54.860> like<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.070> brain<00:00:55.400> brain<00:00:55.910> connection

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
look like a brain brain connection

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.880 
look like a brain brain connection
that's<00:00:56.750> what<00:00:56.930> that<00:00:57.050> does<00:00:57.200> it<00:00:57.410> feeds<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.710> brain

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
that's what that does it feeds the brain

short walk off a long walk off a short

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.230 
short walk off a long walk off a short
dock<00:01:06.140> that's<00:01:06.650> how<00:01:06.860> dumb<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.430> okay<00:01:07.790> you

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
dock that's how dumb that is okay you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.559 
dock that's how dumb that is okay you
use<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.869> now<00:01:09.759> what<00:01:10.759> we're<00:01:10.880> doing<00:01:11.149> Mozilla

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569 
use that now what we're doing Mozilla

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.510 
use that now what we're doing Mozilla
later<00:01:11.869> well<00:01:12.469> we're<00:01:12.590> doing<00:01:12.710> basically<00:01:12.950> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
later well we're doing basically the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.789 
later well we're doing basically the
reason<00:01:13.789> why<00:01:13.909> we're<00:01:14.090> separating<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.899> two<00:01:15.109> you

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
reason why we're separating the two you

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.160 
reason why we're separating the two you
don't<00:01:16.009> have<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.689> reason<00:01:17.960> why<00:01:18.049> you're

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
don't have to but the reason why you're

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.899 
don't have to but the reason why you're
separating<00:01:18.560> two<00:01:18.679> because<00:01:19.069> there's<00:01:19.280> fat<00:01:19.579> net

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
separating two because there's fat net

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.749 
separating two because there's fat net
lecithin<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.740> when<00:01:21.859> you<00:01:21.950> dry<00:01:22.189> it<00:01:22.249> up<00:01:22.490> the

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
lecithin and when you dry it up the

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.879 
lecithin and when you dry it up the
lecithin<00:01:23.210> can<00:01:23.389> go<00:01:23.569> rancid<00:01:23.780> on<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:24.619> what<00:01:24.770> we

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
lecithin can go rancid on you so what we

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.349 
lecithin can go rancid on you so what we
want<00:01:25.130> now<00:01:25.310> is<00:01:25.369> we<00:01:25.579> want<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.850> protein

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
want now is we want the protein

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.929 
want now is we want the protein
I<00:01:26.389> want<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.869> dry<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:27.079> up<00:01:27.409> as<00:01:27.590> well<00:01:27.859> but<00:01:28.819> when

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
I want to dry this up as well but when

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.779 
I want to dry this up as well but when
I'll<00:01:29.060> do<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.329> first<00:01:29.539> I'll<00:01:29.749> spray<00:01:30.049> it<00:01:30.079> out<00:01:30.229> with

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
I'll do is first I'll spray it out with

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.629 
I'll do is first I'll spray it out with
rosemary<00:01:31.789> essential<00:01:31.999> oil<00:01:32.479> okay<00:01:33.490> dilute<00:01:34.490> it

with water well I'm a little alcohol or
salt<00:01:37.759> water<00:01:37.969> and<00:01:38.179> spray<00:01:38.450> Donders<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:39.170> keep<00:01:39.439> the

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
salt water and spray Donders to keep the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.760 
salt water and spray Donders to keep the
fat<00:01:39.889> from<00:01:40.159> breaking<00:01:40.549> down<00:01:41.350> rosemary<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.530> sage

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
fat from breaking down rosemary and sage

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.940 
fat from breaking down rosemary and sage
both<00:01:43.159> have<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.609> equivalency<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.179> BH<00:01:44.659> GBH<00:01:45.409> a<00:01:45.709> as

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
both have the equivalency of BH GBH a as

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.520 
both have the equivalency of BH GBH a as
a<00:01:46.310> fat<00:01:46.850> preserver<00:01:47.719> so<00:01:47.929> it<00:01:48.020> doesn't<00:01:48.319> allow<00:01:48.499> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
a fat preserver so it doesn't allow the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.779 
a fat preserver so it doesn't allow the
fat<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:48.950> break<00:01:49.130> down<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.490> then<00:01:49.609> when<00:01:49.729> you

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
fat to break down and then when you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.699 
fat to break down and then when you
consume<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.569> it<00:01:50.869> keeps<00:01:51.139> the<00:01:51.289> fat<00:01:51.499> in<00:01:51.619> your

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
consume it it keeps the fat in your

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.010 
consume it it keeps the fat in your
arteries<00:01:52.130> flowing<00:01:52.659> some<00:01:53.659> of<00:01:53.749> you're<00:01:53.840> going<00:01:53.959> to

arteries flowing some of you're going to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.690 
arteries flowing some of you're going to
say<00:01:54.200> what<00:01:54.740> about<00:01:55.009> cholesterol

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
say what about cholesterol

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.519 
okay what about cholesterol cholesterol
has<00:01:58.159> been<00:01:58.369> overrated<00:01:59.119> as<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.659> bad<00:01:59.840> guy<00:02:00.109> it<00:02:00.350> has

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
has been overrated as the bad guy it has

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:02.980 
has been overrated as the bad guy it has
nothing<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:00.979> do<00:02:01.249> with<00:02:01.639> your<00:02:02.209> heart<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:02.840> other

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
heart healthy okay so what we're doing

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.860 
heart healthy okay so what we're doing
basically<00:02:09.709> I'm<00:02:09.770> just<00:02:09.800> cleaning<00:02:10.069> out<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.870> fat

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
basically I'm just cleaning out the fat

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.180 
basically I'm just cleaning out the fat
content<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:14.470> mean<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.560> get<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.830> all<00:02:15.920> up<00:02:16.100> but

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
content I mean I get it all up but

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.580 
content I mean I get it all up but
that's<00:02:16.310> okay<00:02:16.460> alright<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.330> there<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.540> go

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
that's okay alright so there we go

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.809 
that's okay alright so there we go
the<00:02:19.040> other<00:02:19.220> down<00:02:24.250> sometimes<00:02:25.250> they<00:02:25.370> cooperate

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
the other down sometimes they cooperate

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:34.540 
the other down sometimes they cooperate
sometimes<00:02:26.209> they<00:02:26.330> don't

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.170 

then<00:02:36.340> they're<00:02:37.340> gonna<00:02:37.490> mushroom<00:02:39.880> hmm<00:02:40.910> you're

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
then they're gonna mushroom hmm you're

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.140 
then they're gonna mushroom hmm you're
not<00:02:41.390> gonna<00:02:41.510> mushroom<00:02:43.630> there<00:02:44.630> we<00:02:44.720> go<00:02:45.940> hey<00:02:46.940> can<00:02:47.090> I

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
not gonna mushroom there we go hey can I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.200 
not gonna mushroom there we go hey can I
break<00:02:47.330> this<00:02:47.540> down<00:02:48.220> as<00:02:49.220> much<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:49.640> can

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:59.740 

and<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.450> more<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.720> break<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.730> yeah<00:02:58.910> then<00:02:59.630> a

the absorbability omelet egg add gelatin

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.360 
the absorbability omelet egg add gelatin
to<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.680> gelatin<00:04:06.680> doesn't<00:04:06.980> matter<00:04:07.100> which<00:04:07.190> one

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
to it gelatin doesn't matter which one

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.250 
to it gelatin doesn't matter which one
you<00:04:07.459> want<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.730> use<00:04:07.760> gelatin<00:04:08.180> okay<00:04:09.050> when<00:04:09.200> you

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
you want to use gelatin okay when you

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.460 
you want to use gelatin okay when you
add<00:04:09.380> gelatin<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:10.250> an<00:04:10.340> egg<00:04:10.750> your<00:04:11.750> bb<00:04:12.170> rating

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
add gelatin to an egg your bb rating

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.900 
add gelatin to an egg your bb rating
goes<00:04:12.620> from<00:04:12.950> 93<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:14.050> 99<00:04:15.250> okay<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.760> means

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
goes from 93 to 99 okay that means

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.849 
goes from 93 to 99 okay that means
you're<00:04:17.209> absorbing<00:04:17.510> 99<00:04:17.930> percent<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.410> this<00:04:18.560> so

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
you're absorbing 99 percent of this so

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.920 
you're absorbing 99 percent of this so
you're<00:04:19.100> gonna<00:04:19.220> dehydrate<00:04:19.459> this<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.780> what<00:04:20.870> do

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
you're gonna dehydrate this so what do

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.040 
you're gonna dehydrate this so what do
you<00:04:20.989> do<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:22.220> put<00:04:22.370> them<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.610> pan<00:04:23.020> like<00:04:24.020> this

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
you do you put them in a pan like this

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.300 
you do you put them in a pan like this
and<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:24.860> dehydrate<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.120> get<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:27.310> this

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
and you dehydrate it so you get a this

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.580 
and you dehydrate it so you get a this
is<00:04:28.730> not<00:04:28.880> completely<00:04:29.270> dehydrated<00:04:29.510> and<00:04:30.260> let<00:04:30.470> it

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
is not completely dehydrated and let it

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.780 
is not completely dehydrated and let it
set<00:04:30.890> last<00:04:31.070> night<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.340> thought<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.580> would<00:04:31.669> be

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
set last night I thought it would be

this<00:06:24.379> and<00:06:24.710> then<00:06:24.889> powder<00:06:25.219> it<00:06:25.610> up<00:06:25.870> once<00:06:26.870> you

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
this and then powder it up once you

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.959 
this and then powder it up once you
powder<00:06:27.229> it<00:06:27.409> up<00:06:27.500> put<00:06:27.740> it<00:06:27.770> in<00:06:27.919> the<00:06:28.069> jar<00:06:28.310> label<00:06:28.849> it

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 
powder it up put it in the jar label it

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.209 
powder it up put it in the jar label it
go<00:06:29.300> in<00:06:29.479> those<00:06:29.629> air<00:06:29.839> vacuum<00:06:30.110> things<00:06:30.589> and<00:06:30.919> you

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
go in those air vacuum things and you

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.399 
go in those air vacuum things and you
see<00:06:31.460> that<00:06:31.610> it'll<00:06:32.000> last<00:06:32.180> you<00:06:32.389> 30<00:06:32.539> years<00:06:32.960> in<00:06:33.229> a

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
see that it'll last you 30 years in a

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.860 
see that it'll last you 30 years in a
jar<00:06:33.649> with<00:06:33.830> those<00:06:34.009> air<00:06:34.189> things<00:06:34.460> air<00:06:34.759> air<00:06:35.089> oxygen

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
jar with those air things air air oxygen

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.619 
jar with those air things air air oxygen
and<00:06:36.050> oxidizers<00:06:36.800> so<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:37.759> you<00:06:37.849> can<00:06:38.029> use<00:06:38.210> it<00:06:38.449> as<00:06:38.599> a

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
and oxidizers so and you can use it as a

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.350 
and oxidizers so and you can use it as a
protein<00:06:38.990> now<00:06:39.379> how<00:06:39.469> would<00:06:39.529> you<00:06:39.770> use<00:06:39.830> it<00:06:40.189> in<00:06:40.550> a

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
protein now how would you use it in a

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.860 
protein now how would you use it in a
soup<00:06:41.659> and<00:06:41.990> in<00:06:42.529> a<00:06:42.909> smoothie<00:06:43.909> any<00:06:44.210> way<00:06:44.509> you<00:06:44.569> like

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
soup and in a smoothie any way you like

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.980 
soup and in a smoothie any way you like
it's<00:06:45.319> a<00:06:45.439> protein<00:06:45.969> okay<00:06:46.969> put<00:06:47.360> it<00:06:47.449> in<00:06:47.539> jello<00:06:47.779> if

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
it's a protein okay put it in jello if

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.629 
it's a protein okay put it in jello if
you<00:06:48.050> like<00:06:48.229> that's<00:06:48.889> another<00:06:49.099> way<00:06:49.279> to<00:06:49.310> do<00:06:49.399> it<00:06:49.490> now

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
you like that's another way to do it now

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.909 
you like that's another way to do it now
what<00:06:49.729> are<00:06:49.849> we<00:06:49.879> gonna<00:06:50.000> do<00:06:50.149> with<00:06:50.240> this<00:06:50.919> same

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
what are we gonna do with this same

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.209 
what are we gonna do with this same
thing<00:06:52.189> you<00:06:52.879> would<00:06:53.000> spray<00:06:53.360> it<00:06:53.560> dry<00:06:54.560> it<00:06:54.620> powder

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:55.219 
thing you would spray it dry it powder

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:57.339 
thing you would spray it dry it powder
it<00:06:55.490> but<00:06:55.669> you<00:06:55.819> have<00:06:56.000> to<00:06:56.180> remember<00:06:56.419> this<00:06:57.080> lesson

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
it but you have to remember this lesson

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.860 
it but you have to remember this lesson
not<00:06:57.680> can<00:06:57.889> be<00:06:57.979> used<00:06:58.219> to<00:06:58.909> make<00:06:59.120> chocolate<00:06:59.419> or

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
not can be used to make chocolate or

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.080 
not can be used to make chocolate or
other<00:06:59.930> things<00:07:00.349> that<00:07:00.529> keep<00:07:00.680> things<00:07:00.860> soft

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
other things that keep things soft

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
you're breaking into him or you can take

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.900
