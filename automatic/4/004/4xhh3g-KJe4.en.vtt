his who stopped reading the book because
he<00:04:45.259> came<00:04:45.500> to<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:45.830> trick<00:04:46.129> anyway<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:46.969> know<00:04:47.090> I

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389

laughs<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:48.080> up<00:04:48.169> until<00:04:48.500> then<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:48.710> then<00:04:49.189> it<00:04:49.310> just

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
laughs it up until then and then it just

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.399 
laughs it up until then and then it just
was<00:04:49.580> rubbish<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.240> just<00:04:50.449> you<00:04:51.110> know<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.349> I

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
was rubbish and I just you know and I

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.920 
was rubbish and I just you know and I
can't<00:04:51.650> believe<00:04:51.800> anything<00:04:52.370> after<00:04:52.819> that<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:53.689> so

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
can't believe anything after that and so

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.119 
can't believe anything after that and so
I<00:04:54.199> mean<00:04:54.830> but<00:04:55.789> but<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.389> point<00:04:56.599> is<00:04:56.870> is<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.169> you

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
I mean but but the point is is that you

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.510 
I mean but but the point is is that you
see<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:59.419> the<00:04:59.900> trick<00:05:00.199> is<00:05:00.379> to<00:05:00.409> focus<00:05:00.800> on<00:05:01.159> the<00:05:01.340> end

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
see the the trick is to focus on the end

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.480 
see the the trick is to focus on the end
result<00:05:01.969> of<00:05:02.240> this<00:05:02.449> is<00:05:02.659> is<00:05:02.930> is<00:05:03.680> all<00:05:04.069> the<00:05:04.279> way

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
result of this is is is all the way

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.040 
result of this is is is all the way
through<00:05:04.879> sticking<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.449> straw<00:05:05.689> through<00:05:05.900> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
through sticking the straw through the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.850 
through sticking the straw through the
potato<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:08.090> all<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.719> way<00:05:08.870> through<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.289> action

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
potato to all the way through the action

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.100 
potato to all the way through the action
to<00:05:10.370> imagine<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.300> end<00:05:11.569> result<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:13.689> you<00:05:14.689> see

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
to imagine the end result and you see

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.230 
to imagine the end result and you see
what<00:05:15.529> people<00:05:16.159> that<00:05:16.279> don't<00:05:16.520> succeed<00:05:16.909> at<00:05:17.090> this

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
what people that don't succeed at this

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.480 
what people that don't succeed at this
and<00:05:17.449> also<00:05:17.719> down<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.229> succeed<00:05:18.590> at<00:05:18.949> magical

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
and also down to succeed at magical

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.899 
and also down to succeed at magical
results<00:05:20.029> in<00:05:20.150> their<00:05:20.300> lives<00:05:20.539> is<00:05:21.439> because

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
results in their lives is because

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.700 
results in their lives is because
basically<00:05:22.909> they<00:05:23.389> focused<00:05:23.930> on<00:05:24.080> how<00:05:24.439> they're

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
basically they focused on how they're

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.369 
basically they focused on how they're
supposed<00:05:24.919> to<00:05:25.250> be<00:05:25.430> doing<00:05:25.460> it<00:05:26.029> rather<00:05:26.629> than<00:05:27.110> on

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:27.379 
supposed to be doing it rather than on

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.399 
supposed to be doing it rather than on
what<00:05:27.439> they<00:05:27.979> want<00:05:28.219> to<00:05:28.310> attract<00:05:28.729> and<00:05:29.199> you<00:05:30.199> see

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
what they want to attract and you see

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.219 
what they want to attract and you see
when<00:05:31.129> we<00:05:31.310> go<00:05:31.490> from<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:32.180> process<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:32.960> how<00:05:33.169> we

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
when we go from the process and how we

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.230 
when we go from the process and how we
supposed<00:05:33.770> to<00:05:33.860> be<00:05:34.009> doing<00:05:34.039> something<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:35.120> the

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
supposed to be doing something to the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.089 
supposed to be doing something to the
end<00:05:35.539> result<00:05:36.110> we<00:05:36.680> engage<00:05:37.159> our<00:05:37.520> natural<00:05:38.150> ability

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
end result we engage our natural ability

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.189 
end result we engage our natural ability
and<00:05:40.099> and<00:05:40.580> when<00:05:40.729> we<00:05:40.819> go<00:05:41.029> back<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.389> the<00:05:41.629> process

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
and and when we go back to the process

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.260 
and and when we go back to the process
of<00:05:42.349> how<00:05:42.529> we<00:05:42.589> should<00:05:42.919> be<00:05:43.069> doing<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.550> we<00:05:43.849> banish

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
of how we should be doing it we banish

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.450 
of how we should be doing it we banish
our<00:05:44.479> natural<00:05:44.930> ability<00:05:45.289> we<00:05:45.440> just<00:05:45.949> go<00:05:46.099> into<00:05:46.370> our

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
our natural ability we just go into our

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.010 
our natural ability we just go into our
rash<00:05:46.759> more<00:05:47.060> mechanistic<00:05:49.060> mentality<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.240> way

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
rash more mechanistic mentality and way

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.269 
rash more mechanistic mentality and way
of<00:05:51.080> doing<00:05:51.500> things<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:51.949> and<00:05:52.940> so<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.750> know<00:05:54.279> I'm

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279 
of doing things and and so you know I'm

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.980 
of doing things and and so you know I'm
always<00:05:55.310> getting<00:05:55.789> people<00:05:56.240> to<00:05:56.360> do<00:05:56.509> this<00:05:56.690> trip

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
always getting people to do this trip

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.369 
always getting people to do this trip
because<00:05:57.379> it<00:05:57.680> Justin<00:05:57.979> trains<00:05:58.339> them<00:05:58.960> keep<00:05:59.960> the

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
because it Justin trains them keep the

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.790 
because it Justin trains them keep the
most<00:06:01.250> important<00:06:01.879> thing<00:06:02.150> to<00:06:02.360> keep<00:06:02.839> in<00:06:03.110> mind<00:06:03.169> all

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
most important thing to keep in mind all

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.579 
most important thing to keep in mind all
the<00:06:04.129> way<00:06:04.250> through<00:06:04.580> a<00:06:04.659> process<00:06:05.659> is<00:06:05.870> the<00:06:06.379> end

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
the way through a process is the end

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:15.519 
the way through a process is the end
result

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529
