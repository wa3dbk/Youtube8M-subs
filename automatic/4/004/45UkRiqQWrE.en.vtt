what we are all about is to bring about
a<00:00:33.030> revolution<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> electrochemical

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a revolution with the electrochemical

a storage device you store energy in it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
a storage device you store energy in it
and<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:40.079> pretty<00:00:40.590> need<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.460> withdraw

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and then pretty need it you can withdraw

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
and then pretty need it you can withdraw
it<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.180> will<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> huge<00:00:42.960> difference<00:00:43.290> now

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it you will see a huge difference now

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.340 
it you will see a huge difference now

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
conversion process you are still reliant

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.479 
conversion process you are still reliant

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.400 
on a fossil based feedstock the goal
however<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.329> make<00:01:00.750> hydrogen<00:01:00.989> from

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

there have a fuel cell program but the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
there have a fuel cell program but the
big<00:01:07.439> problem<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> cost<00:01:08.400> all<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.060> fuel

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
big problem is the cost all the fuel

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
big problem is the cost all the fuel
cells<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> low-temperature

platinum<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> expensive<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.680> our<00:01:16.979> quest

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
platinum is expensive and so our quest

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
platinum is expensive and so our quest
is<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> completely<00:01:18.780> eliminate<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.799> noble

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
is to completely eliminate all noble

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.810 
is to completely eliminate all noble
metals<00:01:21.020> from<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.320> fuel<00:01:22.530> cell<00:01:22.799> system<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.670> the
