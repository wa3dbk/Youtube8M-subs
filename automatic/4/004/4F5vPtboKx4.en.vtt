every single pebble that comes off the

tight and all the dimensions are perfect

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
tight and all the dimensions are perfect
partly<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.310> we've<00:01:11.610> maintained<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
partly because we've maintained the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.149 
partly because we've maintained the
exact<00:01:12.750> same<00:01:12.960> waterproofing<00:01:13.590> rating<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.100> the

exact same waterproofing rating for the
first<00:01:14.340> pebble<00:01:14.520> couple<00:01:15.180> steals<00:01:15.470> waterproof<00:01:16.470> 25

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920

atmospheres and one of the idea of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.789 
atmospheres and one of the idea of
keeping<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.850> waterproof<00:01:21.350> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> goes<00:01:22.590> with

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
keeping it waterproof kind of goes with

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.200 
keeping it waterproof kind of goes with
our<00:01:22.920> philosophy<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> making<00:01:23.880> sure<00:01:23.939> that

our philosophy of making sure that

our philosophy of making sure that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
pebble will mesh perfectly into your

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
pebble will mesh perfectly into your
everyday<00:01:26.040> life<00:01:26.340> we've<00:01:27.060> maintained<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
everyday life we've maintained all the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
everyday life we've maintained all the
other<00:01:27.840> features<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> five<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.950> seven<00:01:29.220> day

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
other features like a five to seven day

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
other features like a five to seven day
long<00:01:29.520> battery<00:01:29.790> life<00:01:29.960> we've<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.170> made<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
long battery life we've even made it a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
long battery life we've even made it a
bit<00:01:31.680> smaller<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.369> more<00:01:32.520> compact<00:01:32.970> reducing

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
bit smaller and more compact reducing

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.469 
bit smaller and more compact reducing
the<00:01:34.079> border<00:01:34.560> area<00:01:34.890> around<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> display

the border area around the display

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.580 
the border area around the display
really<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.840> wanted<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> make<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> watch

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
really because we wanted to make a watch

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.460 
really because we wanted to make a watch
that<00:01:37.939> can<00:01:38.939> get<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.659> people's<00:01:40.020> wrists

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that can get on to more people's wrists

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.560 
that can get on to more people's wrists
around<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> world<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:41.909> once<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.509> on

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
around the world and then once it's on

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
around the world and then once it's on
the<00:01:42.720> wrist<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.799> provide<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.189> smart

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the wrist then we can provide that smart

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
the wrist then we can provide that smart
functionality<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.509> notifications<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
functionality like the notifications and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.679 
functionality like the notifications and
the<00:01:46.439> apps<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.890> stuff<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.659> one<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the apps and stuff like that so one of

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.600 
the apps and stuff like that so one of
the<00:01:48.840> reactions<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:50.040> our<00:01:50.159> editor<00:01:50.490> in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the reactions was from our editor in

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
pictures of the new pebble and he said

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.080 
pictures of the new pebble and he said
that<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:55.250> first<00:01:56.250> mile<00:01:56.520> watch<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:56.969> were

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that it was first mile watch they were

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
part of you drive behind the design to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
part of you drive behind the design to
get<00:02:04.500> those<00:02:04.649> people<00:02:05.009> who<00:02:05.430> wouldn't<00:02:05.610> consider

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.410 
beginning of pebble people love the idea
of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420

which are going to be releasing at the
end<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.060> month<00:02:40.269> january<00:02:40.840> 2014<00:02:41.400> that's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
end of this month january 2014 that's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.940 
end of this month january 2014 that's
around<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.700> time<00:02:42.760> when<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.380> properly<00:02:44.380> launch

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
around the time when you properly launch

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.770 
around the time when you properly launch
your<00:02:45.040> app<00:02:45.099> store<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.730> it's<00:02:46.300> around<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> time

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
your app store and it's around the time

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.850 
your app store and it's around the time
that<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.019> public<00:02:47.260> still<00:02:47.380> will<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.620> arriving

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
that the public still will be arriving

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.309 
that the public still will be arriving
yeah<00:02:48.130> it's<00:02:48.489> kind<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.819> our<00:02:49.030> forward<00:02:49.810> push<00:02:50.050> for

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
yeah it's kind of our forward push for

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.520 
yeah it's kind of our forward push for
2014<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.190> think<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.819> in<00:02:51.940> 2014<00:02:52.660> pebble<00:02:53.380> will

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
2014 I think that in 2014 pebble will

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.580 
2014 I think that in 2014 pebble will
represent<00:02:54.690> more<00:02:55.690> than<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.170> hardware<00:02:56.560> i

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
represent more than just the hardware i

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.920 
represent more than just the hardware i
think<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.519> actual<00:02:58.000> functionality<00:02:58.600> will

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
think the the actual functionality will

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.539 
think the the actual functionality will
be<00:02:59.049> driven<00:02:59.260> by<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.530> apps<00:02:59.769> that<00:03:00.100> people<00:03:00.130> create

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
be driven by the apps that people create

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.550 
be driven by the apps that people create
around<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.209> platform<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.019> up<00:03:02.140> until<00:03:02.290> this

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
around the platform and up until this

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.190 
around the platform and up until this
point<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:03.069> been<00:03:03.790> it's<00:03:04.600> been<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.840> bit<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.170> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
point it's been it's been a bit of a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.500 
point it's been it's been a bit of a
creative<00:03:05.980> process<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.519> find<00:03:06.700> apps<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.209> pebble

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
creative process to find apps for pebble

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.180 
creative process to find apps for pebble
we<00:03:07.870> didn't<00:03:08.110> have<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.290> centralized<00:03:08.920> app

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
we didn't have a centralized app

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.309 
we didn't have a centralized app
repository<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.480> there's<00:03:10.720> been<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.959> lot<00:03:11.290> of

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
repository so there's been a lot of

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.350 
repository so there's been a lot of
community<00:03:11.890> sponsored<00:03:12.519> projects<00:03:13.030> like<00:03:13.180> my

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
community sponsored projects like my

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.720 
community sponsored projects like my
pebble<00:03:13.540> faces<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.530> pebble<00:03:14.920> forums<00:03:15.310> that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
pebble faces and the pebble forums that

come up with new iterations why do you

come<00:03:46.299> from<00:03:46.500> well<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.530> think<00:03:48.150> other

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
come from well I think other

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.789 
come from well I think other
smartwatches<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.079> market<00:03:50.350> it's<00:03:50.470> not<00:03:50.620> it's

smartwatches in the market it's not it's

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.560 
smartwatches in the market it's not it's
not<00:03:50.920> necessarily<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> new<00:03:51.609> thing<00:03:51.910> even<00:03:52.420> before

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
not necessarily a new thing even before

not necessarily a new thing even before
we<00:03:52.750> launched<00:03:53.079> pebble<00:03:53.500> their<00:03:53.950> work<00:03:54.160> there<00:03:54.640> was

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
we launched pebble their work there was

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.520 
we launched pebble their work there was
I<00:03:55.000> think<00:03:55.030> what<00:03:55.390> are<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.750> two<00:03:56.019> versions<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.470> the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
I think what are the two versions of the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.740 
I think what are the two versions of the
Sony<00:03:56.769> SmartWatch<00:03:57.180> there<00:03:58.180> was<00:03:58.269> this<00:03:58.390> moto

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
Sony SmartWatch there was this moto

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.090 
Sony SmartWatch there was this moto
active<00:03:59.109> so<00:03:59.290> there's<00:03:59.440> always<00:03:59.650> been<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.829> lot<00:04:00.069> of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
active so there's always been a lot of

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.979 
active so there's always been a lot of
sort<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.459> movement<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:00.880> this<00:04:01.030> market<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.480> think

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
sort of movement in this market I think

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.370 
sort of movement in this market I think
what's<00:04:02.170> interesting<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:03.010> me<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.340> just<00:04:03.700> the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
what's interesting to me is just the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.960 
what's interesting to me is just the
just<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.560> fact<00:04:05.829> that<00:04:05.920> most<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.579> the<00:04:06.760> other

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
just the fact that most of the other

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.520 
just the fact that most of the other
people<00:04:07.450> who<00:04:07.540> are<00:04:07.569> making<00:04:07.840> products<00:04:08.350> are

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
people who are making products are

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.530 
people who are making products are
taking<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.010> very<00:04:09.190> different<00:04:09.670> stance<00:04:10.000> towards

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
taking a very different stance towards

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.059 
taking a very different stance towards
what<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.900> product<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.319> meant<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.650> do<00:04:11.799> in<00:04:11.950> your

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
what the product is meant to do in your

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.430 
what the product is meant to do in your
everyday<00:04:12.280> life<00:04:12.400> then<00:04:12.850> pedal<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.690> us<00:04:13.810> we're

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
everyday life then pedal for us we're

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.020 
everyday life then pedal for us we're
all<00:04:14.620> about<00:04:14.859> meshing<00:04:15.459> with<00:04:15.579> your<00:04:15.760> everyday

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
all about meshing with your everyday

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.210 
all about meshing with your everyday
life<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.959> it's<00:04:17.169> about<00:04:17.289> making<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.769> product<00:04:18.039> that

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
life so it's about making a product that

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.949 
life so it's about making a product that
doesn't<00:04:18.489> force<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.269> conform<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
doesn't force you to conform to the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.620 
doesn't force you to conform to the
product<00:04:20.350> it<00:04:20.470> conforms<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.100> your<00:04:21.190> own<00:04:21.400> life<00:04:21.630> and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
product it conforms to your own life and

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.150 
product it conforms to your own life and
offers<00:04:23.140> more<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.890> companion<00:04:24.880> to

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
offers more of a companion to

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.830 
offers more of a companion to
smart<00:04:25.430> phone<00:04:25.640> rather<00:04:25.880> than<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.180> replacement

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
smart phone rather than a replacement

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.990 
smart phone rather than a replacement
and<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:27.500> think<00:04:27.740> that's<00:04:28.100> kind<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.490> our<00:04:28.640> guiding

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
and I think that's kind of our guiding

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.580 
and I think that's kind of our guiding
principle<00:04:29.420> right<00:04:29.630> now<00:04:29.810> both<00:04:30.050> when<00:04:30.230> we<00:04:30.320> design

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
principle right now both when we design

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.440 
principle right now both when we design
pebble<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.100> pebble<00:04:31.430> steel<00:04:31.670> as<00:04:32.030> well<00:04:32.240> as<00:04:32.330> the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
pebble and pebble steel as well as the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.210 
pebble and pebble steel as well as the
software<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.020> we<00:04:33.110> make<00:04:33.350> that<00:04:33.920> will<00:04:34.100> be

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
software that we make that will be

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.680 
software that we make that will be
something<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.550> we<00:04:34.730> continue<00:04:35.210> forward<00:04:35.480> with

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
something that we continue forward with

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.900 
something that we continue forward with
were<00:04:35.870> bought<00:04:36.440> into<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.770> idea<00:04:36.980> we<00:04:37.280> believe

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
were bought into that idea we believe

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.520 
were bought into that idea we believe
that<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.330> best<00:04:38.570> product<00:04:38.930> on<00:04:39.080> your<00:04:39.110> wrist<00:04:39.410> is

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
that the best product on your wrist is

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.500 
that the best product on your wrist is
one<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:40.250> works<00:04:41.030> best<00:04:41.120> for<00:04:41.420> the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
one that works best for the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.060 
one that works best for the
circumstances<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:42.230> it's<00:04:42.440> built<00:04:42.650> for<00:04:42.710> and

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
circumstances that it's built for and

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.280 
circumstances that it's built for and
the<00:04:43.850> expanded<00:04:44.240> functionality<00:04:44.810> can<00:04:44.960> be<00:04:45.020> left

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
the expanded functionality can be left

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.010 
the expanded functionality can be left
on<00:04:45.440> your<00:04:45.560> phone<00:04:46.510> so<00:04:47.510> that's<00:04:47.660> kind<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:47.870> our

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
on your phone so that's kind of our

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.710 
on your phone so that's kind of our
guiding<00:04:48.620> principle<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.340> think<00:04:49.690> over<00:04:50.690> time

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
guiding principle and I think over time

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.960 
guiding principle and I think over time
you'll<00:04:51.110> see<00:04:51.260> more<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:51.620> more<00:04:51.760> more<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:52.820> more

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
you'll see more and more more and more
