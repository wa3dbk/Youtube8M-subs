exactly<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> same<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:54.870> almost<00:00:55.050> insights

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
exactly the same here almost insights

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.920 
exactly the same here almost insights
you<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.489> six<00:00:57.030> point<00:00:57.149> three<00:00:57.270> inch<00:00:57.570> display

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
would say though that the display looks

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.850 
would say though that the display looks
more<00:01:04.409> sharper<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.810> Nokia<00:01:06.810> Lumia
