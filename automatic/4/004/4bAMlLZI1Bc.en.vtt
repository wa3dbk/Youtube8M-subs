00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
different sector yeah they're not too

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.400 
different sector yeah they're not too
easy<00:02:33.519> I<00:02:34.000> mean<00:02:34.150> they're<00:02:34.750> not<00:02:34.870> too<00:02:35.080> hard<00:02:35.349> to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
easy I mean they're not too hard to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
hold on a second these things aren't

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.070 
hold on a second these things aren't
hard<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.580> go<00:02:47.730> through<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.150> step<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.990> the

hard to go through just step to the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.380 
hard to go through just step to the
other<00:02:49.140> side<00:02:49.530> wants<00:02:49.740> there<00:02:49.860> flashing<00:02:52.730> hey<00:02:53.730> he's

you<00:06:29.400> just<00:06:29.580> let<00:06:30.120> me<00:06:30.180> show<00:06:30.389> you<00:06:33.080> now<00:06:34.080> run<00:06:34.349> away

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.110 

doesn't<00:06:37.620> look<00:06:37.770> like<00:06:37.949> much<00:06:38.099> of<00:06:38.160> an<00:06:38.430> explosion

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
doesn't look like much of an explosion

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.640 
doesn't look like much of an explosion
but<00:06:39.300> yeah<00:06:39.840> it<00:06:40.050> works<00:06:40.320> I<00:06:41.990> just<00:06:42.990> don't<00:06:43.320> use<00:06:43.470> it

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
but yeah it works I just don't use it

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.870 
but yeah it works I just don't use it
much<00:06:43.770> because<00:06:43.949> it<00:06:44.190> just<00:06:44.310> takes<00:06:44.520> a<00:06:44.669> long<00:06:44.820> time

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
much because it just takes a long time

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.360 
much because it just takes a long time
that<00:06:45.240> it's<00:06:45.360> setup<00:06:49.039> it's<00:06:50.039> kind<00:06:50.220> of<00:06:50.250> like

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
that it's setup it's kind of like

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.610 
that it's setup it's kind of like
planting<00:06:50.759> c4<00:06:51.330> over<00:06:51.509> solid<00:06:51.870> snake<00:06:52.110> but<00:06:52.380> it's

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
planting c4 over solid snake but it's

00:06:52.620 --> 00:07:23.620 
planting c4 over solid snake but it's
not<00:06:52.830> easy

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.250 

there<00:07:24.630> it<00:07:24.780> is

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
there it is

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:37.420 
there it is
mug<00:07:25.560> shots<00:07:25.919> turf<00:07:33.110> Wow<00:07:34.110> looks<00:07:34.680> like<00:07:34.740> Vegas

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:45.200 

exactly<00:07:38.430> like<00:07:38.669> Vegas<00:07:43.550> isn't<00:07:44.550> shy

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.210 
exactly like Vegas isn't shy

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.230 
exactly like Vegas isn't shy
okay<00:07:46.169> so<00:07:46.229> we'd<00:07:46.650> always<00:07:46.830> here<00:07:47.190> somewhere<00:07:47.760> but

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
okay so we'd always here somewhere but

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.060 
okay so we'd always here somewhere but
how<00:07:48.450> are<00:07:48.630> we<00:07:48.690> supposed<00:07:49.139> to<00:07:49.290> find<00:07:49.620> him

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070 
how are we supposed to find him

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.940 
how are we supposed to find him
Mesa<00:07:50.550> City<00:07:51.000> is<00:07:51.150> a<00:07:51.180> big<00:07:51.540> place<00:07:51.930> given<00:07:52.710> that<00:07:52.830> he's

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:52.950 
Mesa City is a big place given that he's

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.920 
Mesa City is a big place given that he's
a<00:07:52.979> bulldog<00:07:53.340> it<00:07:53.910> seems<00:07:54.150> only<00:07:54.300> reasonable<00:07:54.600> to

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:54.930 
a bulldog it seems only reasonable to

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.960 
a bulldog it seems only reasonable to
assume<00:07:55.139> that<00:07:55.350> he<00:07:55.530> choose<00:07:55.770> to<00:07:55.800> live<00:07:56.100> in<00:07:56.220> a<00:07:56.310> giant

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:56.970 
assume that he choose to live in a giant

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.540 
assume that he choose to live in a giant
fire<00:07:57.419> hydrant<00:08:00.169> now<00:08:01.169> you<00:08:01.229> just<00:08:01.770> need<00:08:01.919> to<00:08:02.039> find<00:08:02.400> a

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.550 
fire hydrant now you just need to find a

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.420 
fire hydrant now you just need to find a
way<00:08:02.699> to<00:08:02.729> break<00:08:03.240> into<00:08:03.660> the<00:08:03.780> building<00:08:03.990> space<00:08:04.530> I'm

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:05.430 
way to break into the building space I'm

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.629 
way to break into the building space I'm
sure<00:08:05.669> I'll<00:08:05.820> think<00:08:06.060> of<00:08:06.150> something

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 
sure I'll think of something

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:11.450 
sure I'll think of something
