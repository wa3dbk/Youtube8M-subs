00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
would normally use Excel except I'm

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.750 
stuck using the camera man's fail Mac
but<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> use<00:00:36.719> numbers<00:00:37.410> okay<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
but I'm going to use numbers okay and I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.940 
but I'm going to use numbers okay and I
start<00:00:39.450> with<00:00:39.570> my<00:00:39.719> subscriber<00:00:40.170> list<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.770> there's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
start with my subscriber list so there's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.200 
start with my subscriber list so there's
no<00:00:41.070> easy<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.820> take<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.120> whole

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
no easy way to just take your whole

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
no easy way to just take your whole
subscriber<00:00:42.719> list<00:00:43.020> put<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.469> hat<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> draw

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
subscriber list put it in a hat and draw

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.069 
subscriber list put it in a hat and draw
one<00:00:44.910> unless<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.510> ten<00:00:45.870> subscribers

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
one unless you have like ten subscribers

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.590 
one unless you have like ten subscribers
but<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:47.100> working<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.700> fourteen<00:00:48.090> thousand

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
but I'm working with fourteen thousand

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
but I'm working with fourteen thousand
seven<00:00:49.020> hundred<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.350> twenty<00:00:49.620> six<00:00:49.800> subscribers

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
seven hundred and twenty six subscribers

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.760 
seven hundred and twenty six subscribers
so<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.449> NCIX<00:00:51.989> tech<00:00:52.230> tips<00:00:52.410> channel

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
so that's on my NCIX tech tips channel

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.100 
so that's on my NCIX tech tips channel
basically<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> take<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.910> divided<00:00:54.629> by<00:00:54.660> 40

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
basically I take that divided by 40

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.900 
basically I take that divided by 40
because<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.829> how<00:00:56.010> many<00:00:56.070> subscribers<00:00:56.610> are

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
because that's how many subscribers are

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.119 
because that's how many subscribers are
displayed<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.449> each<00:00:57.750> page<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.829> means<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
displayed on each page so that means I

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.770 
displayed on each page so that means I
have<00:00:59.160> three<00:00:59.550> hundred<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.940> sixty<00:01:00.300> nine<00:01:00.329> pages

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
have three hundred and sixty nine pages

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.219 
have three hundred and sixty nine pages
or<00:01:01.199> partial<00:01:01.890> pages<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.370> subscribers<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.780> go

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
or partial pages of subscribers so I go

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
or partial pages of subscribers so I go
into<00:01:04.409> numbers<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.189> use<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.670> read<00:01:06.000> between

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
into numbers and I use the read between

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.740 
into numbers and I use the read between
formula<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.380> paste<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.549> okay<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.479> paste

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
formula I paste that in okay so I paste

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.840 
formula I paste that in okay so I paste
that<00:01:09.990> under<00:01:10.260> page<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.970> I<00:01:11.970> end<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:13.369> 312<00:01:14.369> so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that under page and I end up with 312 so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.310 
that under page and I end up with 312 so
once<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.350> take<00:01:16.909> 312<00:01:17.909> times<00:01:18.600> 40

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
once I have that I take 312 times 40

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280 
once I have that I take 312 times 40
which<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> give<00:01:20.729> me<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.600> page<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
which is going to give me which page I

which is going to give me which page I
want<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.950> start<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.090> I'm<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> go

going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.590> start<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.340> page<00:01:30.200> no<00:01:31.200> that's<00:01:31.380> not

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
going to start on page no that's not

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.050 
going to start on page no that's not
right<00:01:31.860> hold<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> minute<00:01:32.369> hold<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.880> can

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
right hold on a minute hold on I can

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.490 
right hold on a minute hold on I can
figure<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.689> camera<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.200> won't<00:01:34.350> take

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
figure this out on camera it won't take

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.880 
figure this out on camera it won't take
that<00:01:34.530> long

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that long

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
that long
so<00:01:35.460> 312<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.540> 312<00:01:37.170> times<00:01:38.150> 40<00:01:39.150> equals<00:01:39.840> oh

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
so 312 you have 312 times 40 equals oh

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.870 
so 312 you have 312 times 40 equals oh
yeah<00:01:40.799> okay<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.340> start<00:01:41.850> at<00:01:42.119> 12<00:01:43.130> 480<00:01:46.310> equals<00:01:47.310> okay

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
yeah okay so start at 12 480 equals okay

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.600 
yeah okay so start at 12 480 equals okay
how<00:01:49.390> could<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:49.630> possibly<00:01:49.689> be<00:01:50.259> right<00:01:50.610> well

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
how could that possibly be right well

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.319 
how could that possibly be right well
that<00:01:51.729> can't<00:01:51.939> be<00:01:51.969> right

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
that can't be right

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.850 
that can't be right

going to go to our next sheet in the
failed<00:02:00.729> numbers<00:02:01.329> program<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.200> we<00:02:02.619> are<00:02:02.740> going

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
failed numbers program and we are going

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.510 
failed numbers program and we are going

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
to pick a rend between row so we are

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.540 
to pick a rend between row so we are
going<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:07.110> find<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.769> we<00:02:08.920> are<00:02:08.950> gonna<00:02:09.369> row

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
going to find that we are gonna row

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.120 
going to find that we are gonna row
number<00:02:09.849> two<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.019> winner<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.380> going<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.920> be

number two so the winner is going to be

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.660 
number two so the winner is going to be
one<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.940> these<00:02:13.330> ten<00:02:13.900> people<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.709> then<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.550> our
