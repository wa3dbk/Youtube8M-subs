00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
lemonade this old boiler right here's an

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.770 
lemonade this old boiler right here's an
old<00:00:09.860> oil<00:00:09.980> fired<00:00:10.429> you<00:00:11.150> can<00:00:11.269> see<00:00:11.420> we're<00:00:11.599> actually

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
old oil fired you can see we're actually

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.090 
old oil fired you can see we're actually
going<00:00:11.990> to<00:00:12.160> take<00:00:13.160> it<00:00:13.250> out<00:00:13.339> in<00:00:13.460> sections<00:00:14.799> due<00:00:15.799> to

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
going to take it out in sections due to

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.260 
going to take it out in sections due to
they<00:00:16.250> eliminated<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:16.610> bulkhead<00:00:17.060> and<00:00:17.120> that's

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
they eliminated the bulkhead and that's

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.609 
they eliminated the bulkhead and that's
how<00:00:17.390> to<00:00:17.450> put<00:00:17.689> it<00:00:17.720> disrupt<00:00:18.109> the<00:00:18.199> back<00:00:18.380> of<00:00:18.560> the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
how to put it disrupt the back of the

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.050 
how to put it disrupt the back of the
house<00:00:18.770> which<00:00:19.010> is<00:00:19.130> common<00:00:19.550> with<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:19.760> deal<00:00:19.880> this

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
house which is common with the deal this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.080 
house which is common with the deal this
once<00:00:20.240> in<00:00:20.359> a<00:00:20.420> while<00:00:20.600> not<00:00:21.439> a<00:00:21.470> big<00:00:21.710> deal<00:00:21.970> you<00:00:22.970> can

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
once in a while not a big deal you can

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.750 
once in a while not a big deal you can
see<00:00:23.210> we<00:00:23.330> eliminated<00:00:23.689> supply<00:00:24.109> and<00:00:24.260> return<00:00:24.760> so

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
see we eliminated supply and return so

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.400 
see we eliminated supply and return so
we're<00:00:25.880> actually<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.210> take<00:00:26.330> this<00:00:26.449> boiler<00:00:27.019> and

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
we're actually to take this boiler and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.080 
we're actually to take this boiler and
get<00:00:27.710> into<00:00:27.920> sections<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.609> get<00:00:28.730> up<00:00:28.880> of<00:00:29.029> the

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
get into sections to get up of the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
back outside for Salvage we did that

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.340 
back outside for Salvage we did that
going<00:00:34.730> on<00:00:34.880> we<00:00:35.180> also<00:00:35.360> have<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.780> oil<00:00:35.810> tank<00:00:36.080> over

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
going on we also have the oil tank over

good view of this let's go back and work

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.219 
good view of this let's go back and work
out<00:01:49.760> real<00:01:50.000> well<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:50.420> we<00:01:50.510> did<00:01:50.659> an<00:01:50.720> oil<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.110> gas

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
out real well so we did an oil to gas

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.620 
out real well so we did an oil to gas
conversion<00:01:51.950> which<00:01:52.790> will<00:01:52.940> save<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.240> hormones

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
conversion which will save the hormones

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.740 
conversion which will save the hormones
a<00:01:53.750> ton<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.050> money<00:01:54.260> on<00:01:54.590> energy<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:56.510> old
