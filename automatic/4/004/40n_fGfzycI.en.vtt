 provocative but still generated a certain 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.210
 controversy because it did not offer the

 engine compatible with this

 paulo from last year 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.799
 but before you talk about what jumps to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.229
 eyes that tt rs worth noting the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.090
 many internal details that already give 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.979
 Tip of what you can do with this 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
 car in which sportsmanship is carried 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.810
 very seriously the banks are of the type 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.330
 shell the steering wheel is larger with straight base 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.400
 you have the option of manual exchanges here 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.229
 behind the wheel without counting the many 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.229
 brushed aluminum details 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.290
 It's the story here, it's even sportsmanship. 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.579
 without modesty or some kind of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.189
 questioning 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.520
 pay attention to the recipe brings a motor 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.009
 audi 2.5 five-cylinder with turbo 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.119
 compressor and direct injection that generates 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.909
 no less than 340 horsepower and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.890
 add the full quattro 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.299
 and double tronic transmission 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.299
 clutch and seven speeds 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.410
 is the situation here could not be 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.989
 different the fit for the driver is 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.920
 absolutely no sports than 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.569
 complain 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.849
 now although it is enough 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.160
 competent in the streets also up 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.080
 because it is a more compact car 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.370
 It can annoy the most 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.290
 unsuspecting 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.510
 this because of the suspension that is 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.420
 The car is very rigid and 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.819
 our streets and also the answers of the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.569
 motor you need to take care and dosage 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.569
 the foot on the accelerator 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.030
 and this becomes clear when walking with him not 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.459
 there is the possibility of feeling 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.950
 street car driving behavior 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.120
 all the preparation is done to accompany the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.190
 engine power 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.470
 the sports suspension has the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.720
 magnetic raid that changes the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.060
 behavior of the shock absorbers as 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.400
 the situation and in practice and if the car 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.860
 lower and is much more rigid 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.440
 not to mention the large wheels of 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.440
 19 inches and the tires with more profile 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.890
 this little provocation is nonsense the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.280
 tt rs still offers soundtrack 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.920
 exclusive key with the sport key 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.530
 flat in the left exhaust outlet 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.340
 changes snoring and a daughter nothing in 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.340
 engine response 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.110
 a pack of dreams but well priced 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.450
 far from the majority but after all who 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.310
 search for a car of this type does not want to 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.880
 is to be mistaken for the mass 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.880
 as a matter of fact
