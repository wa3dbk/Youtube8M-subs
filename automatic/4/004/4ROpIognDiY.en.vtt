to<00:03:25.600> be<00:03:25.660> honest<00:03:25.840> maybe<00:03:26.019> they<00:03:26.260> could<00:03:26.410> do

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
to be honest maybe they could do

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.750 
to be honest maybe they could do
something<00:03:26.769> with<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.160> future<00:03:27.459> we<00:03:27.610> see

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
something with that in the future we see

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.100 
something with that in the future we see
what<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.940> mean<00:03:28.060> when<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.269> check<00:03:28.510> out<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.750> iPad

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
what I mean when I check out the iPad

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.590 
what I mean when I check out the iPad
version<00:03:29.160> in<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.280> little<00:03:30.610> while<00:03:30.820> but<00:03:31.299> that's<00:03:31.420> you

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
version in a little while but that's you

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.090 
version in a little while but that's you
know<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.989> good<00:03:32.230> it's<00:03:32.620> definitely<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.920> good

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
know it's a good it's definitely a good

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.560 
know it's a good it's definitely a good
change<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.640> do<00:03:33.700> like<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.299> can<00:03:34.420> close

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
change and I do like it you can close

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.330 
change and I do like it you can close
out<00:03:34.780> more<00:03:35.079> than<00:03:35.260> one<00:03:35.410> application<00:03:35.829> at<00:03:36.100> once

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
out more than one application at once

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.740 
out more than one application at once
and<00:03:36.519> it's<00:03:36.610> quite<00:03:36.790> quick<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.269> close<00:03:37.480> them<00:03:37.660> out

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
and it's quite quick to close them out

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.750 
and it's quite quick to close them out
as<00:03:37.959> well<00:03:38.260> next<00:03:38.860> up<00:03:38.950> we<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.250> folders

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
as well next up we have the folders

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.400 
as well next up we have the folders
interface<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.420> as<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.570> can<00:03:40.720> see<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.170> can

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
interface and as you can see you can

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.800 
interface and as you can see you can
enable<00:03:42.160> paging<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:42.970> your<00:03:43.090> folders<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.660> can

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
enable paging on your folders you can

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.840 
enable paging on your folders you can
have<00:03:43.989> quite<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.739> lot<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.040> apps<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:45.459> here<00:03:45.700> which

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
have quite a lot of apps in here which

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.610 
have quite a lot of apps in here which
is<00:03:45.880> good<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.359> just<00:03:46.540> drag<00:03:46.780> an<00:03:46.930> app<00:03:47.019> over<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
is good you just drag an app over to the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.920 
is good you just drag an app over to the
new<00:03:47.769> screen<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.640> seems<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.060> me<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.209> three

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
new screen it seems to me that three

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.810 
new screen it seems to me that three
pages<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:50.980> maximum<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.340> can<00:03:51.430> have<00:03:51.640> that

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
pages is the maximum you can have that

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.240 
pages is the maximum you can have that
may<00:03:51.970> well<00:03:52.180> be<00:03:52.420> wrong<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.900> haven't<00:03:53.290> spent<00:03:53.859> too

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
may well be wrong I haven't spent too

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.690 
may well be wrong I haven't spent too

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
function in here actually than you

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.690

normally<00:04:19.840> would<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.979> for<00:04:21.130> example<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.549> can

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
normally would so for example you can

got live filters just by tapping the
little<00:04:26.680> icon<00:04:27.099> down<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:27.460> the

little icon down in the
some<00:04:27.820> right-hand<00:04:28.240> corner<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.740> can

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
some right-hand corner and you can

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.170 
some right-hand corner and you can
actually<00:04:30.100> apply<00:04:30.310> those<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.610> see<00:04:30.910> how<00:04:31.060> they

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
actually apply those and see how they

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.820 
actually apply those and see how they
look<00:04:31.330> in<00:04:31.510> real<00:04:31.750> time<00:04:32.050> that's<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:32.380> really<00:04:32.650> nice

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
look in real time that's a really nice

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.980 
look in real time that's a really nice
addition<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:34.030> will<00:04:34.240> be<00:04:34.360> very<00:04:34.600> good<00:04:34.750> on<00:04:34.900> the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
addition this will be very good on the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.350 
addition this will be very good on the
iPhone<00:04:35.290> 5s<00:04:35.560> with<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.010> improved<00:04:36.370> camera<00:04:36.880> but

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
iPhone 5s with the improved camera but

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.480 
iPhone 5s with the improved camera but
now<00:04:37.450> taking<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.810> look<00:04:37.960> on<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.290> iPad<00:04:38.770> variation

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
now taking a look on the iPad variation

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.150 
now taking a look on the iPad variation
as<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:39.760> can<00:04:39.880> see<00:04:40.090> it's<00:04:40.930> bigger<00:04:41.410> I'm<00:04:41.950> sure

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
as you can see it's bigger I'm sure

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.920 
as you can see it's bigger I'm sure
you're<00:04:42.340> aware<00:04:42.580> of<00:04:42.760> that<00:04:42.910> by<00:04:43.060> now<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.630> be<00:04:43.720> honest

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
you're aware of that by now to be honest

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.660 
you're aware of that by now to be honest
that's<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.230> only<00:04:44.500> downside<00:04:44.950> about<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.280> iPad

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
that's the only downside about the iPad

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.330 
that's the only downside about the iPad
variant<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.300> iOS<00:04:46.540> 7<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.620> literally<00:04:48.070> is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
variant of iOS 7 is that it literally is

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.070 
variant of iOS 7 is that it literally is
just<00:04:48.700> bigger<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.390> don't<00:04:49.540> really<00:04:49.690> get<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.930> whole

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
just bigger you don't really get a whole

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.180 
just bigger you don't really get a whole
lot<00:04:50.560> more<00:04:50.770> function<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.880> iOS<00:04:52.240> 7<00:04:53.100> kind<00:04:54.100> of

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
lot more function in the iOS 7 kind of
