it's<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.540> working<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.290> that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
it's not not working it's just that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.510 
it's not not working it's just that
there<00:00:37.530> aren't<00:00:37.710> any<00:00:37.890> apps<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.280> currently

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
there aren't any apps that currently

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.799 
there aren't any apps that currently
supported<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.180> i'll<00:00:39.300> show<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.780> just

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
supported so i'll show you that in just

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.130 
supported so i'll show you that in just
a<00:00:40.050> minute<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.410> let's<00:00:40.710> take<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> look<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.140> sort

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a minute but let's take a look at sort

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.139 
a minute but let's take a look at sort
of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> fundamentals<00:00:43.890> right<00:00:44.700> now<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.940> can

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
of the fundamentals right now you can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.380 
of the fundamentals right now you can
see<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.379> very<00:00:46.770> similar<00:00:47.370> look<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
see that this is a very similar look and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.380 
see that this is a very similar look and
feel<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> android<00:00:49.559> l<00:00:49.829> lollipop<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.059> that's

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
feel to android l lollipop and that's

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.689 
feel to android l lollipop and that's
because<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.079> isn't<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> much

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
because there really isn't that much

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.209 
because there really isn't that much
fundamentally<00:00:53.699> different<00:00:54.270> underneath<00:00:55.219> in

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
fundamentally different underneath in

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.990 
fundamentally different underneath in
terms<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.730> aesthetics<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.899> Android<00:00:58.829> M<00:00:59.100> now

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
terms of aesthetics with Android M now

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.799 
terms of aesthetics with Android M now
we<00:01:00.059> don't<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> be

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
we don't know what it's going to be

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.500 
we don't know what it's going to be
called<00:01:01.140> yet<00:01:01.500> maybe<00:01:01.710> marshmallow<00:01:02.340> maybe<00:01:02.699> must

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
carboni I don't know but it'll certainly

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.460 
carboni I don't know but it'll certainly
be<00:01:06.090> revealed<00:01:06.659> later<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.049> year<00:01:07.110> along<00:01:07.439> with

lollipop users is the new volume of
controls<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.810> see<00:02:57.990> here<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:59.190> looks

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
controls and you can see here this looks

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.520 
controls and you can see here this looks
similar<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.970> android<00:03:00.240> 5.1<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.050> can<00:03:01.230> change

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
similar to android 5.1 you can change

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.460 
similar to android 5.1 you can change
your<00:03:02.130> system<00:03:02.790> notification<00:03:03.480> volume<00:03:03.900> your

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
your system notification volume your

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.070 
your system notification volume your
music<00:03:04.890> notification<00:03:05.490> your<00:03:05.580> alarm<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.450> what

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
music notification your alarm but what

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.590 
music notification your alarm but what
is<00:03:07.260> different<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.430> do<00:03:08.940> not<00:03:09.060> disturb<00:03:09.269> mode

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
is different is the do not disturb mode

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.650 
is different is the do not disturb mode
so<00:03:10.019> for<00:03:10.380> example<00:03:11.120> when<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.269> are<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.480> do<00:03:12.630> not

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
so for example when you are in do not

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.259 
so for example when you are in do not
disturb<00:03:12.810> mode<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.709> can<00:03:13.739> now<00:03:13.980> select<00:03:14.340> between

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
disturb mode you can now select between

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.190 
disturb mode you can now select between
total<00:03:15.870> silence<00:03:16.430> alarms<00:03:17.430> only<00:03:17.940> or<00:03:18.390> priority

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
total silence alarms only or priority

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.190 
total silence alarms only or priority
now<00:03:19.350> priority<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.250> also<00:03:21.120> customizable<00:03:21.720> and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
now priority is also customizable and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.860 
now priority is also customizable and
it's<00:03:22.440> more<00:03:22.680> granular<00:03:23.280> than<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.550> was<00:03:23.700> before

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
it's more granular than it was before

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.150 
it's more granular than it was before
obviously<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:24.959> priority<00:03:25.830> mode<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.130> can

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
obviously in priority mode you can

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.550 
obviously in priority mode you can
change<00:03:26.550> alarms<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:27.540> change<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.230> can<00:03:28.380> add

or disable reminders events messages and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.340 
or disable reminders events messages and
you<00:03:32.489> can<00:03:32.700> select<00:03:33.420> from<00:03:33.510> anybody<00:03:33.900> these<00:03:34.200> are

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
you can select from anybody these are

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.560 
you can select from anybody these are
all<00:03:34.470> things<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.459> could<00:03:35.730> change<00:03:36.390> before

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
all things that you could change before

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.850 
all things that you could change before
but<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.019> now<00:03:37.110> laid<00:03:37.320> out<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> little<00:03:37.680> bit

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
but it's now laid out a little bit

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.830 
but it's now laid out a little bit
differently<00:03:38.220> but<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.910> difference<00:03:39.299> here<00:03:39.390> is

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
differently but the difference here is

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.860 
differently but the difference here is
that<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.680> do<00:03:40.980> not<00:03:41.130> disturb<00:03:41.340> mode<00:03:41.790> allows<00:03:42.570> you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
that the do not disturb mode allows you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.449 
that the do not disturb mode allows you
to<00:03:43.260> really<00:03:43.830> draw<00:03:44.519> down<00:03:44.820> on<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:46.459> certain

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
to really draw down on on certain

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.880 
to really draw down on on certain
aspects<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.269> how<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.019> use<00:03:49.260> your<00:03:49.290> phone<00:03:49.650> so

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
aspects of how you use your phone so

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.699 
aspects of how you use your phone so
automatic<00:03:50.700> rules<00:03:50.970> for<00:03:51.269> example<00:03:51.720> allow<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
automatic rules for example allow you to

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.430 
automatic rules for example allow you to
set<00:03:53.040> rules<00:03:53.340> based<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.120> certain<00:03:54.630> days<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.290> for

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
set rules based on certain days so for

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430
