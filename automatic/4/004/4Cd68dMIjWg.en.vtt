motorcycle or like this jetski in front
of<00:00:24.880> me<00:00:24.970> so<00:00:25.439> I'm<00:00:26.439> going<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:26.739> work<00:00:26.890> on<00:00:27.039> this

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
of me so I'm going to work on this

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.790 
of me so I'm going to work on this
engine<00:00:27.489> right<00:00:27.640> here<00:00:27.849> and<00:00:28.119> I<00:00:28.720> think<00:00:29.289> it<00:00:29.619> has<00:00:29.769> a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
sure that you check timing marks on

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.359 
sure that you check timing marks on
overhead<00:01:54.970> cam<00:01:55.239> engines<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:56.649> how<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:56.979> check<00:01:57.340> to

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
overhead cam engines and how to check to

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.639 
overhead cam engines and how to check to
find<00:01:57.700> out<00:01:57.819> what's<00:01:58.060> wrong<00:01:58.239> with<00:01:58.300> an<00:01:58.539> engine<00:01:58.869> now

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
find out what's wrong with an engine now

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.830 
find out what's wrong with an engine now
when<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.340> took<00:02:00.459> this<00:02:00.819> engine<00:02:01.149> out<00:02:01.239> first<00:02:01.599> time

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
when I took this engine out first time

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.260 
when I took this engine out first time
this<00:02:01.989> year<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.470> went<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.310> started<00:02:03.640> up<00:02:03.729> at<00:02:03.849> Hydra

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
this year I went to started up at Hydra

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.070 
this year I went to started up at Hydra
locked<00:02:04.979> Hydra<00:02:05.979> lock<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.399> when<00:02:07.000> water<00:02:07.479> gets<00:02:07.869> in

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
locked Hydra lock is when water gets in

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.619 
locked Hydra lock is when water gets in
your<00:02:08.200> cylinders<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.950> since<00:02:09.670> water<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.330> non

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
your cylinders and since water is a non

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.970 
your cylinders and since water is a non
compressible<00:02:10.989> fluid<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:13.650> closes<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
compressible fluid it closes up the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.979 
compressible fluid it closes up the
space<00:02:15.370> or<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.700> air<00:02:15.970> inside<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.629> cylinder

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
space or the air inside the cylinder

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.720 
space or the air inside the cylinder
takes<00:02:17.260> up<00:02:17.440> space<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.010> compression<00:02:18.400> goes

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
takes up space so the compression goes

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.380 
takes up space so the compression goes
really<00:02:19.120> really<00:02:19.510> high<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:21.790> happens<00:02:22.209> is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
really really high and what happens is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.510 
really really high and what happens is
it<00:02:22.629> locks<00:02:23.079> up<00:02:23.349> at<00:02:23.500> Hydra<00:02:23.859> locks

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
it locks up at Hydra locks

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.830 
it locks up at Hydra locks
so<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> engine<00:02:24.970> can't<00:02:25.180> turn<00:02:25.390> over<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.720> sounds

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
so the engine can't turn over it sounds

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.290 
so the engine can't turn over it sounds
like<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> battery<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.590> dead<00:02:26.740> but<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.880> essence

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
like the battery is dead but in essence

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.730 
like the battery is dead but in essence
the<00:02:28.480> engine<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.870> locking<00:02:29.230> up<00:02:29.290> because<00:02:29.590> there's

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
the engine is locking up because there's

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.130 
the engine is locking up because there's
too<00:02:29.860> much<00:02:29.980> water<00:02:30.310> inside<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.970> cylinders<00:02:31.390> so

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
too much water inside the cylinders so

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.870 
too much water inside the cylinders so
let's<00:02:32.770> take<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> look<00:02:33.130> at<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.370> engine

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
let's take a look at this engine

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.430 
let's take a look at this engine
we'll<00:02:34.180> take<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.510> plugs<00:02:34.750> out<00:02:34.960> we'll<00:02:35.260> take<00:02:35.410> a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
we'll take the plugs out we'll take a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.290 
we'll take the plugs out we'll take a
look<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.770> see<00:02:35.890> what<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.070> looks<00:02:36.250> like<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.670> then

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
look and see what it looks like and then

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.610 
look and see what it looks like and then
I'll<00:02:37.360> start<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.810> assemble<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.380> disassemble

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
I'll start to assemble and disassemble

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.980 
I'll start to assemble and disassemble
it<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.010> we'll<00:02:39.190> analyze<00:02:39.760> each<00:02:40.270> part<00:02:40.690> as<00:02:40.870> we

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
it and we'll analyze each part as we

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.600 
it and we'll analyze each part as we
take<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.290> apart<00:02:41.530> figure<00:02:42.250> out<00:02:42.310> what's<00:02:42.460> wrong

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
take it apart figure out what's wrong

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.210 
take it apart figure out what's wrong
with<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.850> fix<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.330> put<00:02:43.480> back<00:02:43.630> together<00:02:44.220> so

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
with it fix it and put back together so

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.130 
with it fix it and put back together so
here's<00:02:45.400> our<00:02:45.520> basic<00:02:45.760> engine<00:02:46.240> it's<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.870> 4

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
here's our basic engine it's a 4

here and we have our intake up in front
the<00:03:09.310> drive<00:03:09.580> unit<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:10.000> underneath<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.600> it's

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the drive unit is underneath and it's

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.990 
the drive unit is underneath and it's
really<00:03:11.260> not<00:03:11.710> that<00:03:11.770> bad<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.250> get<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:12.820> first

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
really not that bad to get to so first

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.370 
really not that bad to get to so first
thing<00:03:13.150> I'm<00:03:13.240> do<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.450> I'm<00:03:13.780> going<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.960> take<00:03:14.140> these

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
thing I'm do is I'm going to take these

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.730 
thing I'm do is I'm going to take these
plug<00:03:15.160> wires<00:03:15.430> off<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.540> take<00:03:16.780> those<00:03:16.930> out<00:03:17.140> take<00:03:17.710> a

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
plug wires off and take those out take a

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.280 
plug wires off and take those out take a
look<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> see<00:03:18.070> what<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.280> plugs<00:03:18.520> look<00:03:18.700> like

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
look to see what the plugs look like

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.580 
look to see what the plugs look like
these<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.320> have<00:03:20.590> my<00:03:20.740> plugs<00:03:21.130> out<00:03:22.380> look<00:03:23.380> at<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
these I have my plugs out look at the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.460 
these I have my plugs out look at the
plugs<00:03:24.300> lot<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.420> water<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.780> lot<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.960> moisture<00:03:26.170> on

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
plugs lot of water a lot of moisture on

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.760 
plugs lot of water a lot of moisture on
the<00:03:26.530> tips<00:03:26.740> of<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:26.950> plugs<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.660> as<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.900> turn<00:03:29.650> over

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
the tips of the plugs and as I turn over

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.210 
the tips of the plugs and as I turn over
real<00:03:30.040> quick<00:03:32.100> mm-hmm

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
real quick mm-hmm

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.120 
real quick mm-hmm
and<00:03:33.490> as<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.440> suspected<00:03:35.440> there's<00:03:35.800> a<00:03:35.890> lot<00:03:36.010> of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
and as I suspected there's a lot of

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.190 
and as I suspected there's a lot of
water<00:03:36.370> in<00:03:36.610> there<00:03:36.760> I'll<00:03:37.450> take<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.720> close-up<00:03:37.990> of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
water in there I'll take a close-up of

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.730 
water in there I'll take a close-up of
this<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.460> see<00:03:40.350> let<00:03:41.350> me<00:03:41.410> let<00:03:41.560> me<00:03:41.620> do

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
this so you can see let me let me do

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.230 
this so you can see let me let me do
this<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.250> string<00:03:42.520> this<00:03:42.610> over<00:03:42.880> here<00:03:44.160> and

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
this on the string this over here and

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.820 
this on the string this over here and
looking<00:03:46.240> down<00:03:46.270> inside<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.050> bore<00:03:47.260> which<00:03:47.620> might

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
looking down inside the bore which might

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.950 
looking down inside the bore which might
be<00:03:47.950> tough<00:03:48.160> for<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> see<00:03:48.670> but<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.690> can<00:03:49.810> see

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
be tough for you to see but you can see

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.260 
be tough for you to see but you can see
here<00:03:50.110> all<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.260> water<00:03:50.760> all<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:51.940> water's

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
here all this water all this water's

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.730 
here all this water all this water's
just<00:03:52.330> spit<00:03:52.720> out<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.960> the<00:03:53.050> cylinder<00:03:53.290> so<00:03:53.470> there's

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
just spit out of the cylinder so there's

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.500 
just spit out of the cylinder so there's
water<00:03:54.010> inside<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.700> cylinders<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.360> looks

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
water inside the cylinders and it looks

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.780 
water inside the cylinders and it looks
like<00:03:55.570> it's<00:03:55.780> even<00:03:56.200> across<00:03:56.950> all<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.460> them<00:03:57.580> all

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
like it's even across all of them all

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.750 
like it's even across all of them all
the<00:03:57.910> spark<00:03:58.240> plugs<00:03:58.680> seem<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.770> be<00:03:59.890> followed<00:04:00.670> very

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
the spark plugs seem to be followed very

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.620 
the spark plugs seem to be followed very
similarly

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
similarly

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.280 
similarly
they<00:04:02.590> all<00:04:02.770> had<00:04:03.100> they<00:04:04.090> were<00:04:04.150> all<00:04:04.330> followed<00:04:04.870> with

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
they all had they were all followed with

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.640 
they all had they were all followed with
water<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.770> moisture<00:04:05.920> in<00:04:06.430> them<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.530> I'll<00:04:08.530> have

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
water and moisture in them so I'll have

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.350 
water and moisture in them so I'll have
the<00:04:08.770> take-off<00:04:09.130> start<00:04:09.610> taking<00:04:09.880> this<00:04:09.940> all<00:04:10.090> apart

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
the take-off start taking this all apart

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.240 
the take-off start taking this all apart
and<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:11.080> can<00:04:11.230> take<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.440> head<00:04:11.590> off<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.980> see<00:04:12.130> what

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
and I can take the head off and see what

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.790 
and I can take the head off and see what
it<00:04:12.310> looks<00:04:12.460> like<00:04:12.520> I<00:04:13.140> think<00:04:14.140> it's<00:04:14.380> fair<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.740> say

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
it looks like I think it's fair to say

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.520 
it looks like I think it's fair to say
this<00:04:15.640> will<00:04:15.820> be<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:15.940> fairly<00:04:16.270> involved<00:04:16.989> project

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
this will be a fairly involved project

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.590 
this will be a fairly involved project
it's<00:04:17.739> not<00:04:18.310> something<00:04:18.670> to<00:04:18.700> make<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:18.970> done<00:04:19.120> in<00:04:19.359> an

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
it's not something to make it done in an

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.510 
it's not something to make it done in an
afternoon<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:20.709> what<00:04:20.859> I'll<00:04:20.950> do<00:04:21.100> is<00:04:21.130> I'll<00:04:21.310> break

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
afternoon so what I'll do is I'll break

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.850 
afternoon so what I'll do is I'll break
this<00:04:21.670> up<00:04:21.880> into<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.420> series<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:22.930> smaller<00:04:23.440> videos

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
this up into a series of smaller videos

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.800 
this up into a series of smaller videos
so<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.640> can<00:04:24.700> watch<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.120> your<00:04:25.270> leisure<00:04:25.420> for

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
so you can watch it your leisure for

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.910 
so you can watch it your leisure for
something<00:04:26.110> like<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.380> know<00:04:26.470> if<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.620> watch<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
something like you know if to watch the

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.070 
something like you know if to watch the
whole<00:04:27.040> video<00:04:27.130> I'll<00:04:27.970> start<00:04:28.390> taking<00:04:28.540> this<00:04:28.780> apart

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
whole video I'll start taking this apart

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.070 
whole video I'll start taking this apart
and<00:04:29.410> making<00:04:29.770> notes<00:04:30.010> as<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.340> do<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:30.870> I'll<00:04:31.870> do<00:04:31.990> is

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
and making notes as I do so I'll do is

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.879 
and making notes as I do so I'll do is
I'll<00:04:32.200> make<00:04:32.230> videos

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
I'll make videos

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.610 
I'll make videos
taking<00:04:33.069> this<00:04:33.129> apart<00:04:33.520> how<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.349> analyzed<00:04:35.349> each

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
taking this apart how I analyzed each

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.309 
taking this apart how I analyzed each
part<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.249> find<00:04:36.520> out<00:04:36.639> what<00:04:36.819> the<00:04:36.909> problem<00:04:37.330> is

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
part and find out what the problem is

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.110 
part and find out what the problem is
I'll<00:04:38.680> show<00:04:38.949> you<00:04:39.009> taking<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.520> apart<00:04:39.759> so<00:04:39.939> you<00:04:40.030> can

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
I'll show you taking it apart so you can

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.580 
I'll show you taking it apart so you can
see<00:04:40.270> how<00:04:40.449> things<00:04:40.810> come<00:04:40.930> apart<00:04:41.199> on<00:04:41.319> a<00:04:41.379> four

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
see how things come apart on a four

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.070 
see how things come apart on a four
solar<00:04:41.919> engine<00:04:42.219> there<00:04:42.909> is<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> dual<00:04:43.870> overhead

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
solar engine there is a dual overhead

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.739 
solar engine there is a dual overhead
cam<00:04:44.680> so<00:04:45.370> there<00:04:45.610> are<00:04:45.639> cam<00:04:45.999> marks<00:04:46.389> I'll<00:04:46.569> have<00:04:46.659> to

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:46.749 
cam so there are cam marks I'll have to

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.239 
cam so there are cam marks I'll have to
make<00:04:46.870> sure<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.110> timing<00:04:47.379> is<00:04:47.620> held<00:04:47.830> correctly

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:48.249 
make sure the timing is held correctly

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:49.559 
make sure the timing is held correctly
and<00:04:48.939> I'll<00:04:49.060> do<00:04:49.240> that

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
and I'll do that

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.769 
and I'll do that
now<00:04:49.659> one<00:04:49.870> want<00:04:50.169> one<00:04:50.229> more<00:04:50.620> word<00:04:51.479> since<00:04:52.479> this<00:04:52.599> is

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:52.779 
now one want one more word since this is

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:59.100 
now one want one more word since this is
a<00:04:53.879> boat<00:04:54.879> or<00:04:55.180> a<00:04:56.610> marine<00:04:57.610> vehicle<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.419> jetski

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
a boat or a marine vehicle of jetski

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.700 
a boat or a marine vehicle of jetski
Scylla<00:04:59.379> marine<00:04:59.590> vehicle<00:04:59.949> I<00:05:01.319> hate<00:05:02.319> to<00:05:02.499> say

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
Scylla marine vehicle I hate to say

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.619 
Scylla marine vehicle I hate to say
different<00:05:03.189> care<00:05:03.490> because<00:05:03.939> you<00:05:04.210> want<00:05:04.389> to<00:05:04.449> take

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:04.629 
different care because you want to take

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:06.809 
different care because you want to take
care<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.080> every<00:05:05.469> engine<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:05.860> build<00:05:06.099> but

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
care on every engine you build but

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:10.290 
care on every engine you build but
marine<00:05:07.150> engines<00:05:07.689> take<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.919> special<00:05:09.819> attention

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
marine engines take a special attention

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.659 
marine engines take a special attention
because<00:05:10.840> if<00:05:11.560> your<00:05:11.770> car<00:05:12.009> engine<00:05:12.340> doesn't<00:05:12.550> work

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
because if your car engine doesn't work

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.790 
because if your car engine doesn't work
you<00:05:12.909> can<00:05:13.029> walk<00:05:13.240> home<00:05:13.479> if<00:05:14.139> you're<00:05:14.319> four<00:05:14.529> miles

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
you can walk home if you're four miles

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.439 
you can walk home if you're four miles

mindset I guess you have to be more

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.890 
mindset I guess you have to be more
cognizant<00:05:32.319> of<00:05:32.499> the<00:05:32.589> things<00:05:32.830> you're<00:05:33.009> doing<00:05:33.370> and

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
cognizant of the things you're doing and

cognizant of the things you're doing and
you<00:05:34.900> could<00:05:35.080> you<00:05:35.199> can't<00:05:35.439> make<00:05:35.620> any<00:05:35.740> mistakes<00:05:35.889> I

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
you could you can't make any mistakes I

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.740 
you could you can't make any mistakes I
don't<00:05:36.669> make<00:05:36.789> any<00:05:36.939> mistakes<00:05:37.029> when<00:05:37.330> I<00:05:37.419> build<00:05:37.599> any

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
don't make any mistakes when I build any

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.480 
don't make any mistakes when I build any
engine<00:05:38.080> but<00:05:38.500> marine<00:05:38.770> engines<00:05:39.129> for<00:05:39.310> some

engine but marine engines for some

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.179 
engine but marine engines for some
reason<00:05:39.909> it<00:05:40.539> just<00:05:40.810> requires<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.379> different

reason it just requires a different
