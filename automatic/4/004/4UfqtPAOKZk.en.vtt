issues<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.100> we're<00:00:47.250> using<00:00:47.280> debut<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.260> we're

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
issues so now we're using debut so we're

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
issues so now we're using debut so we're
sacrificing<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:50.219> framerate<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.969> I've<00:00:51.059> got

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
sacrificing a framerate and I've got

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
sacrificing a framerate and I've got
it's<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> tiny<00:00:52.020> bit<00:00:52.170> learning

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it's going to be a tiny bit learning

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.119 
it's going to be a tiny bit learning
hope<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:53.640> too<00:00:53.820> bad<00:00:54.199> it's<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.739> Pelican
