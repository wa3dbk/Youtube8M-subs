00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
fact that the suspension can use one or

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.670 
fact that the suspension can use one or
two<00:00:20.400> rear<00:00:21.000> shocks<00:00:21.330> you'll<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.530> we<00:00:22.650> have

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
two rear shocks you'll see that we have

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.160 
two rear shocks you'll see that we have
an<00:00:23.010> air<00:00:23.190> shock<00:00:23.520> here<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.690> used<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
an air shock here and it's used as a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.620 
an air shock here and it's used as a
blow-off<00:00:25.500> shock<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.340> then<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> primary

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
blow-off shock and then the primary

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.140 
blow-off shock and then the primary
shock<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.160> primary<00:00:29.490> shot<00:00:29.910> can

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
