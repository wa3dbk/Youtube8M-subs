00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
invigorating to the salt just to see

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.440 
invigorating to the salt just to see
these<00:00:55.320> trees<00:00:55.680> grow<00:00:55.950> and<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.940> such<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> short

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
these trees grow and in such a short

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.040 
these trees grow and in such a short
time<00:00:58.490> probably<00:00:59.490> my<00:00:59.940> main<00:01:00.150> motivation<00:01:00.450> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
time probably my main motivation is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.770 
time probably my main motivation is
about<00:01:01.320> recycling<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.300> looking<00:01:03.300> after<00:01:03.450> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
about recycling and looking after the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.320 
about recycling and looking after the
earth<00:01:03.900> so

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
earth so

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.840 
earth so
we're<00:01:06.020> always<00:01:06.200> planning<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.220> wrong<00:01:07.400> tree<00:01:07.700> in

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
we're always planning the wrong tree in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.700 
we're always planning the wrong tree in
the<00:01:07.940> wrong<00:01:08.090> place<00:01:08.360> for<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.600> wrong<00:01:08.810> reason<00:01:09.350> or

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
the wrong place for the wrong reason or

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.890 
the wrong place for the wrong reason or
we're<00:01:10.280> pruning<00:01:10.700> our<00:01:10.820> shrubs<00:01:11.150> in<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.420> garden

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
we're pruning our shrubs in the garden

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.020 
we're pruning our shrubs in the garden
and<00:01:12.470> we<00:01:12.560> go<00:01:12.680> look<00:01:12.950> what<00:01:13.640> do<00:01:13.700> we<00:01:13.760> do<00:01:13.850> with<00:01:13.910> the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
and we go look what do we do with the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.550 
and we go look what do we do with the
prunings<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:14.630> say<00:01:14.840> we'll<00:01:15.050> put<00:01:15.260> them<00:01:15.380> down

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
prunings and I say we'll put them down

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.350 
prunings and I say we'll put them down
back<00:01:15.830> on<00:01:15.980> the<00:01:16.100> earth<00:01:16.160> and<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.460> neatest<00:01:17.060> way

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
back on the earth and the neatest way

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.180 
back on the earth and the neatest way
possible<00:01:17.870> so<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:18.320> feel<00:01:18.350> it's<00:01:18.710> neat<00:01:18.950> but

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
possible so that you feel it's neat but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.740 
possible so that you feel it's neat but
all<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:19.700> nutrients<00:01:20.180> is<00:01:20.240> going<00:01:20.420> straight

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
all that nutrients is going straight

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:30.000 
all that nutrients is going straight
back<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.230> earth<00:01:21.350> it's<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.220> mulch

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:38.679 

Oh

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.620 

first<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.250> smiled<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:42.000> whole<00:01:42.030> paddock

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
first of all we smiled the whole paddock

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
first of all we smiled the whole paddock
we<00:01:43.020> dug<00:01:43.500> troughs<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:45.200> then<00:01:46.939> planted<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
we dug troughs and then planted the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.580 
we dug troughs and then planted the
trees<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> mounds<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.799> mounds<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:51.590> from

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
trees and the mounds in mounds on from

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.020 
trees and the mounds in mounds on from
soil<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.720> got<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.170> troughs<00:01:56.030> then

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
soil that we got out of the troughs then

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.120 
soil that we got out of the troughs then
we<00:01:57.119> mulched<00:01:57.450> heavily<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.350> more<00:01:58.560> nutrients

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
we mulched heavily the more nutrients

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.770 
we mulched heavily the more nutrients
the<00:01:59.310> more<00:01:59.490> balanced<00:01:59.939> there<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.539> soil

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the more balanced there is in the soil

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.660 
the more balanced there is in the soil
the<00:02:01.020> healthier<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.590> plants<00:02:01.950> are<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.490> can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the healthier the plants are so we can

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.179 
the healthier the plants are so we can
plant<00:02:03.110> sometimes<00:02:04.110> trees<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> really

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
plant sometimes trees on the really

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.070 
plant sometimes trees on the really
roughest<00:02:05.670> toughest<00:02:06.149> hardest<00:02:06.600> site<00:02:06.810> whether

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
roughest toughest hardest site whether

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.779 
roughest toughest hardest site whether
they're<00:02:07.350> clay<00:02:07.649> or<00:02:07.890> rocket<00:02:08.280> doesn't<00:02:08.429> matter

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
they're clay or rocket doesn't matter

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.820 
they're clay or rocket doesn't matter
put<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> chunky<00:02:09.840> pizza<00:02:10.229> most<00:02:10.440> over-the-top

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
put a chunky pizza most over-the-top

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.340 
put a chunky pizza most over-the-top
this<00:02:11.670> deep<00:02:11.940> put<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.660> plants<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.170> whether

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
this deep put the plants in whether

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.080 
this deep put the plants in whether
they're<00:02:13.560> two<00:02:13.739> meters<00:02:14.010> apart<00:02:14.310> or<00:02:14.519> four<00:02:14.760> doesn't

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
they're two meters apart or four doesn't

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.120 
they're two meters apart or four doesn't
matter<00:02:15.269> they<00:02:15.900> are<00:02:16.049> so<00:02:16.319> much<00:02:16.500> healthier<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
matter they are so much healthier and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.120 
matter they are so much healthier and
they<00:02:17.220> grow<00:02:17.430> nice<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.670> quickly<00:02:18.860> very<00:02:19.860> moist

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
they grow nice and quickly very moist

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.009 
they grow nice and quickly very moist
very<00:02:22.700> moist<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:24.530> mean<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.400> roots<00:02:26.610> of

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
very moist I mean this this the roots of

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.770 
very moist I mean this this the roots of
the<00:02:28.019> tree

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.280 

you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.630

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
make it a thick pizza at the more thick

00:02:36.640 --> 00:03:00.690 
make it a thick pizza at the more thick

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
where the palm log meets the earth it's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.070 
where the palm log meets the earth it's
a<00:03:04.550> really<00:03:05.030> great<00:03:06.070> humise<00:03:07.070> factory<00:03:08.080> there's

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
a really great humise factory there's

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.800 
a really great humise factory there's
all<00:03:09.560> sorts<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:09.920> insects<00:03:10.400> Slater's<00:03:11.890> centipedes

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
this is the breakdown of that log

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.960 
this is the breakdown of that log
