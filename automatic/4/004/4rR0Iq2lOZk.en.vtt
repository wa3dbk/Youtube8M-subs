00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.069 
way I've done it here so the here's the
CFG<00:01:51.829> loader<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:52.579> is<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.850> USB<00:01:53.119> loader<00:01:53.329> GX<00:01:53.810> and

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
CFG loader this is the USB loader GX and

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.380 
CFG loader this is the USB loader GX and
this<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.290> also<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.799> we<00:01:54.950> flow<00:01:55.310> program<00:01:55.939> if<00:01:56.180> you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
this is also the we flow program if you

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.510 
this is also the we flow program if you
guys<00:01:56.540> thinks<00:01:56.899> it's<00:01:57.020> useful<00:01:57.469> I<00:01:57.710> can<00:01:57.860> add<00:01:58.340> those

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
three programs into a zip file and put

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.289 
three programs into a zip file and put
it<00:02:00.710> on<00:02:00.860> mediafire<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:01.939> guys<00:02:02.060> can

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
programs are updated all the time so I

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.559 
programs are updated all the time so I
recommend<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.460> know<00:02:07.820> exactly<00:02:08.179> where

i've you a crash course in all of them

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.720 
i've you a crash course in all of them
so<00:02:29.840> let's<00:02:30.020> do<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.350> alright<00:02:31.280> here<00:02:31.490> we<00:02:31.520> are<00:02:31.610> at

so let's do this alright here we are at

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.830 
so let's do this alright here we are at
the<00:02:31.880> main<00:02:31.970> menu<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.390> let's<00:02:32.540> go<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the main menu so let's go to the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.550 
the main menu so let's go to the
homebrew<00:02:33.140> channel<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:35.230> let<00:02:36.230> me<00:02:36.320> show<00:02:36.500> you

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
homebrew channel and let me show you

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.620 
homebrew channel and let me show you
three<00:02:37.400> different<00:02:37.730> programs<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.240> went<00:02:38.390> over

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
three different programs we went over

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.020 
three different programs we went over
today<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.900> went<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.320> crash<00:02:39.980> course<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.910> all

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
today I went to a crash course and all

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.060 
today I went to a crash course and all
three<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.570> show<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:42.260> little<00:02:42.800> bit<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:42.950> each

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
three just show you a little bit of each

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.680 
three just show you a little bit of each
so<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.370> have<00:02:43.490> an<00:02:43.580> idea<00:02:43.850> what<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.210> games<00:02:44.420> are

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
so you have an idea what the games are

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.060 
so you have an idea what the games are
what<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.990> programs<00:02:45.320> look<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.800> let's<00:02:45.980> go

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
what the programs look like so let's go

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.920 
what the programs look like so let's go
ahead<00:02:46.160> with<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.430> first<00:02:46.460> one<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.630> USB

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
ahead with the first one this is USB

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.930 
ahead with the first one this is USB
loader<00:02:48.170> GX<00:02:48.620> this<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.370> actually<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.790> very

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
loader GX this is actually the very

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.850 
loader GX this is actually the very
first<00:02:50.090> USB<00:02:50.630> Lord<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.170> tried<00:02:51.440> on<00:02:51.560> my<00:02:51.680> own

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
first USB Lord it I tried on my own

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.000 
first USB Lord it I tried on my own
before<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.670> investigated<00:02:53.570> other<00:02:53.870> solutions<00:02:54.740> so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
before I investigated other solutions so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.650 
before I investigated other solutions so
I'll<00:02:55.460> talk<00:02:55.670> about<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:56.030> one<00:02:56.210> first<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.570> then

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
I'll talk about this one first and then

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.600 
I'll talk about this one first and then
we'll<00:02:56.840> talk<00:02:56.870> about<00:02:57.020> we<00:02:57.320> flow<00:02:57.530> second<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.220> then

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
we'll talk about we flow second and then

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.210 
we'll talk about we flow second and then
we'll<00:02:58.760> talk<00:02:58.910> about<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.450> USB<00:03:00.220> configurable

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
we'll talk about the USB configurable

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.580 
we'll talk about the USB configurable
loader<00:03:01.430> later<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:02.990> this<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.230> what<00:03:03.440> this

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
loader later on so this is what this

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.080 
loader later on so this is what this
interface<00:03:04.040> looks<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:04.520> pretty<00:03:04.640> simple

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
interface looks like it's pretty simple

little<00:06:25.419> second<00:06:25.870> for<00:06:26.260> a<00:06:26.320> couple<00:06:26.530> seconds<00:06:26.830> here

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
little second for a couple seconds here

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.700 
little second for a couple seconds here
now<00:06:28.060> in<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.330> meantime<00:06:28.540> this<00:06:29.290> is<00:06:29.350> a<00:06:29.500> nice

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
now in the meantime this is a nice

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.860 
now in the meantime this is a nice

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
can import that into here you have three

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.180 
can import that into here you have three

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
think you can change the music but I

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.230 
think you can change the music but I
haven't<00:07:00.070> tried<00:07:00.370> it<00:07:00.640> just<00:07:00.669> yet

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240
