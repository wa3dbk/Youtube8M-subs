00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
tunnel 8 it's even easier and I don't

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.920 
tunnel 8 it's even easier and I don't
even<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.059> me<00:00:51.120> started<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.449> town<00:00:51.660> all<00:00:51.780> nine

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
in town all ten it's pretty much a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
in town all ten it's pretty much a
cakewalk<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> see

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

50 new levels maybe 20 if I guess I'm

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
50 new levels maybe 20 if I guess I'm
being<00:00:57.420> greedy<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.870> 50<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:59.250> besides

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
being greedy with 50 and then besides

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
being greedy with 50 and then besides
that<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.180> complete<00:01:00.809> overhaul<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.469> where<00:01:01.620> we

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that a complete overhaul to where we

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.470 
that a complete overhaul to where we
could<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.010> maybe<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.579> sort<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> weekly<00:01:03.300> or

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
could get maybe some sort of weekly or

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.479 
could get maybe some sort of weekly or
bi-weekly<00:01:03.690> single-player<00:01:04.530> system<00:01:04.979> whether

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
bi-weekly single-player system whether

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.490 
bi-weekly single-player system whether

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
forums and then they get voted on and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.700 
forums and then they get voted on and
then<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:09.810> implemented<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> game

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
then they get implemented in the game

tournaments<00:02:25.980> I've<00:02:26.070> talked<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:26.430> this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
tournaments I've talked about this

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.980 
tournaments I've talked about this
earlier<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:27.030> having<00:02:27.210> clan<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.570> tournaments

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
earlier for having clan more tournaments

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.780 
earlier for having clan more tournaments
it<00:02:28.080> would<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> really<00:02:28.500> neat<00:02:28.800> thing<00:02:29.100> may<00:02:29.760> be

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
it would be a really neat thing may be

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.610 
it would be a really neat thing may be
broadcasting<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> top<00:02:30.990> clans<00:02:31.320> going

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
broadcasting like the top clans going

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.200 
broadcasting like the top clans going
off<00:02:31.770> against<00:02:32.130> each<00:02:32.250> other<00:02:32.430> maybe<00:02:32.700> having<00:02:33.060> like

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
off against each other maybe having like

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.990 
off against each other maybe having like
a<00:02:33.360> 8th<00:02:33.750> seed<00:02:34.260> tournament<00:02:34.770> sort<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:35.850> that

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
a 8th seed tournament sort of like that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.520 
a 8th seed tournament sort of like that
I<00:02:36.030> guess<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.330> NCAA<00:02:36.630> tournament<00:02:36.960> or<00:02:37.260> whatever

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
I guess the NCAA tournament or whatever

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.020 
I guess the NCAA tournament or whatever
stuff<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.340> would<00:02:38.550> be<00:02:38.640> really<00:02:38.790> cool

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
stuff like that would be really cool

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.490 
stuff like that would be really cool
they<00:02:39.210> can<00:02:39.330> stream<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.720> twitch<00:02:39.930> TV<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.470> I

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
they can stream it on twitch TV and I

feel like clans are definitely an

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.030 
feel like clans are definitely an
untapped<00:02:42.420> part<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.840> class<00:02:43.050> right<00:02:43.290> now<00:02:43.320> that

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
untapped part for class right now that

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.560 
untapped part for class right now that
they<00:02:44.130> could<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> lot<00:02:44.790> better<00:02:44.850> part<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.480> I

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
being active inside of a war when I was

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.650 
being active inside of a war when I was
away<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.580> we<00:03:23.700> actually<00:03:24.030> ended<00:03:24.209> up<00:03:24.300> losing

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
away and we actually ended up losing

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.090 
away and we actually ended up losing
that<00:03:24.690> war<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.170> because<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.530> my<00:03:25.650> opt<00:03:25.860> out

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
that war and because of my opt out

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.250 
that war and because of my opt out
feature<00:03:26.310> if<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.300> was<00:03:27.450> able<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.750> opt<00:03:27.930> out<00:03:28.080> and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
feature if I was able to opt out and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.210 
feature if I was able to opt out and
someone<00:03:28.410> else<00:03:28.590> could<00:03:28.709> have<00:03:28.770> taken<00:03:28.950> my<00:03:29.160> place

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
someone else could have taken my place

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.770 
someone else could have taken my place
that<00:03:29.580> could<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.820> swung<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.240> difference<00:03:30.600> so

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
that could have swung the difference so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.330 
that could have swung the difference so
overall<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.380> do<00:03:31.590> have<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.830> blame<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.250> me

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
overall I do have to blame that on me

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.949 
overall I do have to blame that on me
but<00:03:32.700> if<00:03:32.790> we<00:03:32.880> had<00:03:32.970> an<00:03:33.060> opt-out<00:03:33.360> feature<00:03:33.660> it

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
but if we had an opt-out feature it

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.510 
but if we had an opt-out feature it
would<00:03:34.050> help<00:03:34.170> clans<00:03:34.530> out<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.740> lot<00:03:35.010> I've<00:03:35.250> talked

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
would help clans out a lot I've talked

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.890 
would help clans out a lot I've talked
about<00:03:35.730> opt<00:03:35.880> out<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> lot<00:03:36.240> before<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> don't<00:03:36.810> have

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
about opt out a lot before I don't have

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.510 
about opt out a lot before I don't have
to<00:03:36.990> harp<00:03:37.170> on<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.650> then<00:03:38.010> for<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.250> heroes

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
to harp on it and then for the heroes

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.650 
to harp on it and then for the heroes
being<00:03:38.790> able<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.060> be<00:03:39.150> used<00:03:39.270> while<00:03:39.510> they're

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
being able to be used while they're

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.510 
being able to be used while they're
upgraded<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.290> makes<00:03:40.530> sense<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:41.100> lot<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.340> people

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
upgraded it makes sense a lot of people

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.580 
upgraded it makes sense a lot of people
they<00:03:41.730> upgrade<00:03:42.090> their<00:03:42.239> heroes<00:03:42.540> non-stop<00:03:43.080> to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
they upgrade their heroes non-stop to

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.840 
they upgrade their heroes non-stop to
the<00:03:43.680> point<00:03:43.920> where<00:03:44.040> they<00:03:44.130> don't<00:03:44.310> actually<00:03:44.550> get

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
the point where they don't actually get

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.250 
the point where they don't actually get
to<00:03:44.910> use<00:03:45.030> them<00:03:45.420> because<00:03:45.600> they're<00:03:45.870> constantly

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
to use them because they're constantly

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.380 
to use them because they're constantly
being<00:03:46.530> upgraded<00:03:46.800> so<00:03:47.489> at<00:03:47.640> two<00:03:47.910> really<00:03:48.239> no

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
being upgraded so at two really no

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.760 
being upgraded so at two really no
brainer<00:03:48.630> things<00:03:48.989> i<00:03:49.200> think<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.470> opt-out

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
brainer things i think the opt-out

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.960 
brainer things i think the opt-out
ability<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.340> takes<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.670> little<00:03:50.790> bit<00:03:50.910> of

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
ability just takes a little bit of

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.640 
ability just takes a little bit of
tweaking<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.480> see<00:03:51.630> how<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.900> be<00:03:52.080> implemented

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
tweaking to see how it be implemented

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.530 
tweaking to see how it be implemented
and<00:03:52.770> those<00:03:53.640> are<00:03:53.820> two<00:03:53.940> things<00:03:53.970> i<00:03:54.239> definitely

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
and those are two things i definitely

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.390 
and those are two things i definitely
want<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.690> see<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.170> third<00:03:55.440> sort<00:03:56.340> of

surprising<00:04:40.440> because<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.919> past<00:04:41.070> they've

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340

always thrown at these things that no
one's<00:04:43.169> even<00:04:43.289> thought<00:04:43.590> about<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.070> they've

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
one's even thought about and they've

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.890 
one's even thought about and they've
actually<00:04:44.580> been<00:04:44.759> really<00:04:44.880> cool<00:04:45.360> for<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.690> game

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900
