00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello let's do the drawing 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.790
 following 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.809
 modifying the scale appropriately 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:18.480
 and the orientation of the shading pattern 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.880
 which in our case is sans and 31 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.900
 we use for this the command of the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.080
 shaded drawing bar we observe that 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.649
 the figure consists of four squares 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 of dimensions 20 x 20 and separated between 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.899
 yes 5 units 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.839
 let's move on to draw the first 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:44.550
 square in the toolbar of 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:48.600
 drawing we select the rectangle order 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.090
 We mark the first point thereof and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.230
 we introduce the dimensions of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:00.260
 square by coordinates 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.260
 Cartesian relative for both at 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.460
 20.20 y 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 we give to filter 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.880
 well we already have the first square and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.990
 to perform the following we can 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.920
 use the command and copy or the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.590
 matrix command I will use the command 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.550
 matrix we select it in the bar 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.550
 modify tools 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.860
 command madrid 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.450
 we already have it selected and we would choose 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.400
 either polar matrix or my matrix 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.770
 rectangular matrix is selected 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.380
 rectangular which is what we want 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.420
 we have a one-row layout and 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.299
 four columns and the displacement 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:55.289
 between columns is 25 here is already put 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.710
 Well now what we have to do is 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.569
 select the objects we select 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.920
 the objects we give at the time of 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:11.129
 select objects we mark the object 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.100
 we want to repeat and we give intro 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.100
 once 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.370
 designated the same ones we're going to give the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.070
 preview and we observe that we 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.550
 it looks like the figure above 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.610
 then we give you to accept 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.050
 ok now let's move on to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.480
 what the exercise is about is 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.460
 use the shaded command for it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.790
 we go to the toolbar 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.250
 modify and select the order 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.120
 shaded we select the order 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.450
 shaded and 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.480
 and we choose 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.720
 the pattern the pattern that we are going to choose 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.959
 it's sans and 31 then in 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.380
 pattern tab we give it and we go to the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.160
 palette of shading patterns and 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.640
 we chose annecy and inside annecy the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.330
 Anzhi 31 we give you to accept and already what 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.330
 we have selected 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.560
 we have some angle and scale options 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.380
 default to angle 0 and scale 1 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.400
 what are we going to leave and go 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.220
 now to add or designate points we can 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.950
 do it in two ways well 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.570
 the outline or an internal point of 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.790
 outline let's designate a point 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.790
 internal then we select it 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.400
 we have selected and selected the 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:55.150
 internal point we give to the intro and 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:59.000
 let's see now how we would stay in 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.370
 preview because we observe that we 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.850
 it remains as in the figure above 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.280
 so we give it to then intro let's go 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.520
 now to move on to perform 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.370
 the second shading that is the same as 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.329
 the previous one but 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.940
 with a shading orientation of 90 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:25.190
 degrees with respect to the interior then 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.920
 ok let's repeat the command 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.010
 shading 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.070
 the 31st and what we have to modify in 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.090
 this case is the angle that has to be 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:42.380
 a turn against the needles of the 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.970
 90 degree clock then 90 and now what 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.650
 that we have the scale is the same because 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.160
 is the same distance between the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.320
 the different lines and now we're going to 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.960
 designate the outline and we're going to do it 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.870
 selecting objects instead of designating 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:02.620
 interior points then we designate the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.620
 object and now we give intro and 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.499
 we give it to previsualize we see that we 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.020
 it looks exactly the same as above 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:16.870
 so much we give intro 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.030
 well let's move on to perform the 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.379
 shaded of the third square we repeat 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:28.960
 the same shading options we observe 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:32.000
 that we have to put the angle as 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.120
 we had initially 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.550
 0 but the scale we see that the distance 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.840
 of separation between the lines is the 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.960
 double that in the case before in the 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.400
 first case then choose select the 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.969
 corresponding option 2 and now what 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.749
 I will have what we would have to 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:56.229
 do is designate the outline as 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:59.409
 we designate the outline in this case what 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.869
 designate we have using a point 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:05.729
 inside of it we have already designated 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:07.590
 we give intro and we give 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.950
 preview 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.850
 and we observe that we are left as in the 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.850
 figure above 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:21.480
 let's give the intro to say that 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.780
 we want this situation good and for 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:29.230
 we will finish shading the 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:34.410
 fourth we repeat the same option 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:38.800
 we have the nancy pattern and the angle is 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:41.920
 90 degrees with respect to the previous 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:46.300
 but in the opposite direction of the 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:50.560
 clock hands the scale is the same 2 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:55.570
 now we select the objects 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.639
 we select them intro and we give 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.650
 preview 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.099
 but we visualize we see that we have it 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:07.379
 same as above we give intro and 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:07.379
 we have finished the exercise
