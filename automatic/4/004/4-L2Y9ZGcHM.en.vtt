I'm<00:04:19.580> not<00:04:19.700> sure<00:04:19.760> how<00:04:20.000> much<00:04:20.150> carbohydrates<00:04:20.840> I'd

I'm not sure how much carbohydrates I'd

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.010 
I'm not sure how much carbohydrates I'd
be<00:04:21.430> about<00:04:22.430> 60<00:04:22.910> grams<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.240> carbohydrates<00:04:23.780> if<00:04:23.930> a

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
be about 60 grams of carbohydrates if a

big it out run eight ounce russet potato
but<00:04:26.360> I'm<00:04:26.419> using<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.690> smaller<00:04:26.990> one<00:04:27.140> right<00:04:27.169> now

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
but I'm using a smaller one right now

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.030 
but I'm using a smaller one right now
because<00:04:27.410> you've<00:04:27.560> got<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.710> shoot<00:04:27.890> tomorrow

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
and then again more green fiber so

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.280 
and then again more green fiber so
ignore<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.600> I'm<00:04:32.780> basically<00:04:32.990> going<00:04:33.200> to

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
ignore that and I'm basically going to

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.050 
ignore that and I'm basically going to
down<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:33.979> meal<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.550> got<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.790> head<00:04:34.880> up<00:04:34.910> to
