00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.680 
everything is sort of based around our
lives<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.850> kind<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.060> made<00:01:49.210> sense<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.510> we

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
lives so it kind of made sense that we

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.060 
lives so it kind of made sense that we
would<00:01:49.810> play<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.020> direct<00:01:50.409> it<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.890> do<00:01:51.040> it<00:01:51.070> so

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
would play to direct it and do it so

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.400 
would play to direct it and do it so
and<00:01:52.610> as<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.240> alluded<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:53.840> Canadian<00:01:54.200> film
