in<00:00:04.859> Africa<00:00:05.250> we<00:00:05.819> found<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.150> roots<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.600> our

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
in Africa we found the roots of our

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.020 
in Africa we found the roots of our
species<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.470> an<00:00:07.560> environment<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.220> fed<00:00:08.790> and

we<00:00:15.299> were<00:00:15.800> constructed<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.130> crucible<00:00:17.640> this

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
we were constructed this crucible this

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.810 
we were constructed this crucible this
DNA<00:00:18.720> recipe<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.949> expects<00:00:20.520> certain

DNA recipe that expects certain
behaviors<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.330> now<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:22.170> created<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.619> society

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
behaviors and now we created a society

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.370 
behaviors and now we created a society
and<00:00:23.369> technology<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.480> takes<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.019> lot<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> that

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and technology that takes a lot of that

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.210 
and technology that takes a lot of that
away<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:26.010> do<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.250> react<00:00:26.609> cess<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:28.220> humanity

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
away how do we react cess that humanity

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.310 
away how do we react cess that humanity
has<00:00:29.340> entered<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.880> unique<00:00:30.359> point<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.840> history

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.059 
can manipulate the entire planet with
our<00:02:07.729> mind<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.440> think<00:02:09.440> we<00:02:09.560> need<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.769> consider

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
our mind I think we need to consider

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.660 
our mind I think we need to consider
what<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> planet<00:02:11.420> really<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:13.190> planet<00:02:13.519> is

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
what the planet really is the planet is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.170 
what the planet really is the planet is
an<00:02:13.880> ecosystem<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:15.049> life<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:16.670> are<00:02:16.760> part<00:02:17.060> of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
an ecosystem of life and we are part of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.350 
an ecosystem of life and we are part of
that<00:02:17.330> ecosystem

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.080 

the<00:02:20.750> question<00:02:21.260> now<00:02:21.440> becomes<00:02:21.830> how<00:02:22.190> can<00:02:22.970> we

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the question now becomes how can we

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.570 
the question now becomes how can we
prosper<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:24.020> living<00:02:24.530> breathing<00:02:24.890> planet

prosper on this living breathing planet

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.830 
prosper on this living breathing planet
of<00:02:25.880> ours<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.360> not<00:02:27.050> further<00:02:27.470> down<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:29.420> order<00:02:29.720> to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
of ours and not further down in order to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.320 
of ours and not further down in order to
fully<00:02:30.290> understand<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.130> there's<00:02:31.700> only<00:02:31.910> one
