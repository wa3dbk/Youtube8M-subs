in space that's why the whole thing is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.370 
in space that's why the whole thing is
Namek<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.840> how<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.110> he<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you can't breathe is it because he's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.499 
you can't breathe is it because he's
