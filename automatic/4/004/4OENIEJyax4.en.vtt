00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.660 

so<00:00:05.500> basically<00:00:05.859> what<00:00:05.980> we<00:00:06.069> have<00:00:06.190> here<00:00:06.399> is<00:00:06.490> X

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
so basically what we have here is X

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.209 
so basically what we have here is X
dimension<00:00:06.819> this<00:00:07.390> is<00:00:07.569> augmented<00:00:08.410> reality<00:00:08.889> very

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
dimension this is augmented reality very

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.530 
dimension this is augmented reality very
new<00:00:09.400> technology<00:00:10.000> that<00:00:10.030> we're<00:00:10.240> able<00:00:10.360> to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
new technology that we're able to

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.990 
new technology that we're able to
actually<00:00:11.190> get<00:00:12.190> people<00:00:12.309> to<00:00:12.549> interact<00:00:12.730> with

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
actually get people to interact with

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.390 
actually get people to interact with
virtual<00:00:13.510> items<00:00:13.840> mixed<00:00:14.469> with<00:00:14.619> reality<00:00:15.160> and

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
virtual items mixed with reality and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.460 
virtual items mixed with reality and
really<00:00:16.119> create<00:00:16.449> an<00:00:16.660> environment<00:00:17.050> where<00:00:17.289> they

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
really create an environment where they

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.710 
really create an environment where they
can<00:00:17.500> learn<00:00:17.940> based<00:00:18.940> on<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.180> lot<00:00:19.359> of<00:00:19.510> cool

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
can learn based on a lot of cool

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.169 
can learn based on a lot of cool
different<00:00:19.990> 3d<00:00:20.919> effects<00:00:21.429> of<00:00:21.580> this<00:00:21.730> system<00:00:22.029> can

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
different 3d effects of this system can

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
different 3d effects of this system can
do<00:00:22.300> so<00:00:22.480> I'm<00:00:22.539> going<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.689> give<00:00:22.929> you<00:00:23.019> a<00:00:23.050> quick

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
do so I'm going to give you a quick

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.450 
do so I'm going to give you a quick
run-through<00:00:23.529> and<00:00:23.800> how<00:00:23.859> this<00:00:24.039> works<00:00:24.249> it's

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
run-through and how this works it's

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.339 
run-through and how this works it's
pretty<00:00:24.669> neat<00:00:24.849> so<00:00:25.449> first<00:00:25.689> thing<00:00:25.810> we<00:00:25.900> got<00:00:26.080> is

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
pretty neat so first thing we got is

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.589 
pretty neat so first thing we got is
what<00:00:26.769> we<00:00:26.830> call<00:00:27.009> a<00:00:27.039> full<00:00:27.339> XD<00:00:27.640> and<00:00:28.029> what<00:00:28.329> it<00:00:28.449> does

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
what we call a full XD and what it does

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.400 
what we call a full XD and what it does
is<00:00:28.660> it<00:00:28.960> projects<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:30.179> vehicle<00:00:31.179> out<00:00:31.869> in<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.259> open

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
is it projects a vehicle out in the open

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.470 
is it projects a vehicle out in the open
and<00:00:32.740> there's<00:00:33.370> actually<00:00:33.640> nothing<00:00:33.940> there<00:00:34.329> if

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
and there's actually nothing there if

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.880 
and there's actually nothing there if
you<00:00:34.600> look<00:00:34.720> look<00:00:35.200> up<00:00:35.320> above<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.680> screen

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
you look look up above the screen

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.890 
you look look up above the screen
there's<00:00:36.100> nothing<00:00:36.310> there<00:00:36.520> but<00:00:37.000> here<00:00:37.240> I<00:00:37.270> have<00:00:37.690> an

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
there's nothing there but here I have an

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.870 
there's nothing there but here I have an
entire<00:00:38.380> vehicle<00:00:38.650> and<00:00:39.070> we<00:00:39.340> build<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.640> very

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
entire vehicle and we build a very

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.780 
entire vehicle and we build a very
interactive<00:00:40.290> interface<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:42.130> allows<00:00:42.400> me<00:00:42.430> to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
interactive interface it allows me to

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.930 
interactive interface it allows me to
spin<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.270> car<00:00:43.450> around<00:00:43.800> allow<00:00:44.800> me<00:00:44.830> to<00:00:44.980> move<00:00:45.460> the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
spin the car around allow me to move the

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.730 
spin the car around allow me to move the
camera<00:00:46.210> as<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:47.050> notice<00:00:47.320> there's<00:00:47.440> people<00:00:47.680> in

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
camera as you notice there's people in

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.680 
camera as you notice there's people in
the<00:00:47.800> background<00:00:48.010> create<00:00:48.700> that<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:49.480> real

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
the background create that that real

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.010 
the background create that that real
illusion<00:00:50.080> I<00:00:50.860> can<00:00:51.340> zoom<00:00:51.580> in<00:00:51.790> on<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.450> vehicle<00:00:52.840> on

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
illusion I can zoom in on the vehicle on

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.990 
illusion I can zoom in on the vehicle on
different<00:00:53.680> levels<00:00:53.770> start<00:00:54.280> cutting<00:00:54.580> into<00:00:54.850> it

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
different levels start cutting into it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.640 
different levels start cutting into it
and<00:00:55.360> being<00:00:55.630> able<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.960> see<00:00:56.110> all<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.530> different

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
and being able to see all the different

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.220 
and being able to see all the different
parts<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:58.180> it<00:00:58.210> allows<00:00:58.390> me<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.690> explore<00:00:59.020> the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
parts so it allows me to explore the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.920 
parts so it allows me to explore the
vehicle<00:00:59.590> beyond<00:00:59.890> what<00:01:00.130> I<00:01:00.160> could<00:01:00.220> normally<00:01:00.730> do

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
vehicle beyond what I could normally do

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.910 
vehicle beyond what I could normally do
with<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:01.960> real<00:01:02.200> vehicle<00:01:02.440> because<00:01:02.740> of<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
with a real vehicle because of the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.880 
with a real vehicle because of the
cutout<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.629> obviously<00:01:04.989> I<00:01:05.080> can<00:01:05.379> zoom<00:01:05.560> back<00:01:05.710> out

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
cutout and obviously I can zoom back out

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.830 
cutout and obviously I can zoom back out
and<00:01:06.070> switch<00:01:06.310> different<00:01:06.670> colors<00:01:06.939> and<00:01:07.090> really

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
and switch different colors and really

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.599 
and switch different colors and really
have<00:01:07.990> some<00:01:08.020> fun<00:01:08.200> with<00:01:08.500> this<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:08.979> was<00:01:09.189> just<00:01:09.399> one

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:09.609 
have some fun with this it was just one

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:13.319 
have some fun with this it was just one
application<00:01:09.759> of<00:01:11.249> our<00:01:12.249> X<00:01:12.429> dimension<00:01:12.609> here<00:01:13.210> it

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
application of our X dimension here it

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.910 
application of our X dimension here it
was<00:01:13.450> using<00:01:14.079> our<00:01:14.170> augmented<00:01:14.320> reality

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
was using our augmented reality

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.919 
was using our augmented reality
technology<00:01:14.999> the<00:01:15.999> other<00:01:16.210> thing<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.600> can<00:01:16.780> do

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
technology the other thing I can do

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.050 
technology the other thing I can do
which<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.740> really<00:01:18.039> neat<00:01:18.249> is<00:01:18.399> what<00:01:18.729> we<00:01:18.820> call<00:01:18.969> the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
which is really neat is what we call the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.179 
which is really neat is what we call the
magic<00:01:19.390> book<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:19.810> I<00:01:20.350> can<00:01:20.499> switch<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> magic

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
magic book and I can switch the magic

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.149 
magic book and I can switch the magic
book<00:01:21.340> mode<00:01:21.549> just<00:01:21.819> by<00:01:21.909> clicking<00:01:22.119> this<00:01:22.499> hour<00:01:23.499> PTZ

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
book mode just by clicking this hour PTZ

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.770 
book mode just by clicking this hour PTZ
camera<00:01:24.520> switches<00:01:24.789> so<00:01:25.060> now<00:01:25.179> you<00:01:25.240> can<00:01:25.450> see<00:01:25.600> my

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
camera switches so now you can see my

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.239 
camera switches so now you can see my
hands<00:01:26.200> involved<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.829> can<00:01:26.920> actually<00:01:27.009> see<00:01:27.189> a

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
hands involved you can actually see a

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:28.510 
hands involved you can actually see a
little<00:01:27.399> bit<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.549> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
little bit of the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.399 
little bit of the
video<00:01:29.030> screen<00:01:29.270> there<00:01:29.450> I'm<00:01:29.899> going<00:01:30.049> to<00:01:30.109> pick<00:01:30.289> up

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
video screen there I'm going to pick up

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.039 
video screen there I'm going to pick up
this<00:01:30.560> book<00:01:30.890> okay<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.240> as<00:01:32.509> I<00:01:32.659> flipped<00:01:32.960> through

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
this book okay and as I flipped through

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.029 
this book okay and as I flipped through
it<00:01:33.259> I<00:01:33.909> can<00:01:34.909> actually<00:01:35.210> see<00:01:35.469> 3d<00:01:36.469> things<00:01:36.740> pop<00:01:37.009> up

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
it I can actually see 3d things pop up

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.760 
it I can actually see 3d things pop up
so<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:37.670> actually<00:01:37.929> view<00:01:38.929> these<00:01:39.500> three

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
so I can actually view these three

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.260 
so I can actually view these three
dimensional<00:01:40.219> objects<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.820> play<00:01:41.030> with<00:01:41.149> them

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
dimensional objects and play with them

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.639 
dimensional objects and play with them
and<00:01:41.390> interact<00:01:41.539> with<00:01:41.810> them<00:01:41.929> without<00:01:42.170> having<00:01:42.350> to

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
and interact with them without having to

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.249 
and interact with them without having to
do<00:01:42.799> any<00:01:43.840> interaction<00:01:44.840> with<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.049> actual

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
do any interaction with the actual

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.529 
do any interaction with the actual

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
like that it's going through a series of

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.709 
like that it's going through a series of
animations<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.119> can<00:01:50.270> see<00:01:50.360> right<00:01:50.390> there

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
animations like you can see right there

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.539 
animations like you can see right there
and<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.229> cool<00:01:51.409> thing<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.709> you<00:01:51.770> also<00:01:52.189> get<00:01:52.369> the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
and the cool thing is you also get the

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.090 
and the cool thing is you also get the
voice-over<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.719> explain<00:01:54.110> what's<00:01:54.409> going<00:01:54.500> on<00:01:54.829> in

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
voice-over to explain what's going on in

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.940 
voice-over to explain what's going on in
technologies<00:01:55.789> are<00:01:56.000> occurring<00:01:56.649> right<00:01:57.649> as<00:01:57.770> what

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
technologies are occurring right as what

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.949 
technologies are occurring right as what
i<00:01:57.979> write<00:01:58.459> what's<00:01:58.789> on<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.000> screen<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.840> other

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
i write what's on the screen the other

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.080 
i write what's on the screen the other
neat<00:02:00.079> thing<00:02:00.259> is<00:02:00.289> i<00:02:00.439> can<00:02:00.590> just<00:02:00.709> flip<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.920> page<00:02:01.189> and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
neat thing is i can just flip a page and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.929 
neat thing is i can just flip a page and
learn<00:02:02.420> about<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.289> new<00:02:03.409> element<00:02:03.920> i<00:02:04.189> can<00:02:04.670> lift<00:02:04.819> it

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
learn about a new element i can lift it

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.149 
learn about a new element i can lift it
up<00:02:05.060> i<00:02:05.239> can<00:02:05.390> spin<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.659> around<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.289> really<00:02:06.950> get<00:02:07.130> a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
up i can spin it around and really get a

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.170 
up i can spin it around and really get a
feel<00:02:07.549> for<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:08.000> vehicle<00:02:09.759> get<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> feel<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.120> a

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
feel for the vehicle get a feel for a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.520 
feel for the vehicle get a feel for a
lot<00:02:11.299> of<00:02:11.420> technologies<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.170> really<00:02:12.380> be<00:02:12.500> able

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
lot of technologies and really be able

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.440 
lot of technologies and really be able
to<00:02:12.769> see<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> lot<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.220> neat<00:02:13.579> things

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.270 

that<00:02:17.110> we<00:02:17.260> want<00:02:17.470> people<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.709> learn<00:02:17.860> about<00:02:18.010> and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
that we want people to learn about and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.070 
that we want people to learn about and
people<00:02:18.489> just<00:02:18.849> get<00:02:18.970> sucked<00:02:19.360> right<00:02:19.510> into<00:02:19.810> this

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
people just get sucked right into this

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.990 
people just get sucked right into this
just<00:02:20.500> because<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.830> has<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> real<00:02:21.790> wow<00:02:21.970> factor

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
just because it has a real wow factor

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.210 
just because it has a real wow factor
there's<00:02:22.900> also<00:02:23.019> that<00:02:23.260> learning<00:02:23.620> application

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
there's also that learning application

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.259 
there's also that learning application
where<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.580> learn<00:02:24.730> about<00:02:24.940> different

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
where you can learn about different

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.089 
where you can learn about different
technologies<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.230> really<00:02:26.739> kind<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:27.010> do<00:02:27.069> a

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
technologies and really kind of do a

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.390 
technologies and really kind of do a
self<00:02:27.400> exploration<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.330> figure<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:28.629> out<00:02:29.400> when

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
self exploration and figure it out when

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.350 
self exploration and figure it out when
you're<00:02:30.519> done<00:02:30.670> with<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:30.910> can<00:02:30.970> switch<00:02:31.209> back

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
you're done with it you can switch back

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.210 
you're done with it you can switch back
to<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.840> full<00:02:32.319> screen<00:02:32.500> mode<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:32.860> as<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.069> see

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
to the full screen mode so as you see

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.680 
to the full screen mode so as you see
like<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.459> camera<00:02:33.819> we<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.090> above<00:02:34.360> this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
like the camera we have above this

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.390 
like the camera we have above this
pointing<00:02:35.050> down<00:02:35.200> right<00:02:35.410> now<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:36.069> can<00:02:36.190> switch

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
pointing down right now you can switch

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.330 
pointing down right now you can switch
back<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:38.230> goes<00:02:38.349> back<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.739> forth<00:02:38.800> obviously

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
back it goes back and forth obviously

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.220 
back it goes back and forth obviously
somebody's<00:02:39.730> interacting<00:02:40.630> with<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.810> vehicle

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
somebody's interacting with the vehicle

somebody's interacting with the vehicle
through<00:02:41.440> another<00:02:41.709> station<00:02:41.950> they're<00:02:42.250> having<00:02:42.489> a

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
through another station they're having a

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.770 
through another station they're having a
lot<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.640> fun<00:02:42.760> with<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.420> X<00:02:43.630> dimension

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
lot of fun with it this X dimension

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.420 
lot of fun with it this X dimension
gives<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.319> great<00:02:44.590> example<00:02:44.739> of<00:02:45.160> how<00:02:45.370> we

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
gives you a great example of how we

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.210 
gives you a great example of how we
integrate<00:02:46.110> 3d<00:02:47.110> technology<00:02:47.739> with<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:47.950> real
