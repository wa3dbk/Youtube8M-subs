 her map shows the position 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.460
 here it is the water key 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.019
 water key is necessary for elves 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.960
 to get Emily Jones back 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.460
 this is a man in her home world that is she 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.940
 accidentally hit a colleague 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.309
 elves village elves and all now 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.620
 efforts are directed only to one thing

 bring her home as we see her mark 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.570
 Here is a sign of water on his shoulder 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.539
 remarkably done this print 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.840
 and also a bib with such silvery 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.910
 elements that shine too 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.420
 hair two-color shimmer like 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.080
 than that on the waves of the sea commands 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.030
 water it seems to me 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.180
 we insert and the next figure we and him 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.580
 he is ruled by the golden air 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.460
 bib immediately catches the eye he 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.369
 bicoloured 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.580
 hair and a glass with some juice maybe 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.830
 some kind of magic juice of elf berries 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 in this world everything is magical 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.869
 and all this is possible with us 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.200
 directly the key itself the key is located 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.750
 in the sink deep at the bottom of the ocean here it is 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.400
 Now I like it a rubber thing 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.619
 see how to perform allows 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.299
 spring like spring know from 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.880
 thanks to this the shell is closed 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.619
 really window it collapses and 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.810
 you can't open it completely like this 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.210
 will always collapse and for that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.729
 done this here rezinochka well 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.619
 it looks and here it is the key itself in this 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.110
 cockleshell 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.460
 here it is one more step to return emily 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.899
 Jones home here is such a shell 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.810
 separate business element from this 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.729
 set and finally let's take the sweetest and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.270
 the most tasty of course is the biggest 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.790
 rook is the size of length where 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.730
 25 centimeters is obtained from this set 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.430
 well everything looks great in 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.890
 alpine style 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.190
 the opening windows are a real cabin with us 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.270
 big massive sail like that 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.690
 Elvish what I do not know how it is 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.030
 name and philippine wings possible with 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.820
 back side we have two such seats 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.510
 you can eat and enjoy the rest 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.170
 also made here are such curls 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.180
 curls end here such rubies 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.840
 here we have the lamps 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.480
 they light the way everything is covered 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.810
 elven green colors such tanaka 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.340
 green purple and on top of us 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.160
 telescope on a turn based to 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.660
 observe changes of some kind 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.770
 sea 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.610
 Here we have a detail with a print 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.250
 the only thing in this set 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.820
 the rest is all we have stickers what 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.730
 you see novak years not much that is 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.000
 here it is a wonderful boat here 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.280
 a bucket to scrub the deck and such 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.320
 turning poddles and worth noting 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.080
 that sail depends on the steering wheel 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.660
 made a real mechanism this very 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.270
 cool look like this we are rotating what we 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.900
 can rotate the sail 360 degrees 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.570
 nothing on it does not interfere with this is 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.120
 here it is now that the deck can be removed and 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.030
 see what's inside of us is a real cabin 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.240
 a hairbrush some perfumes stand maybe and 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.060
 we also have a small kitchen a frying pan and 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.630
 so small mangalchik to 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.700
 cook yourself eat and eat hatch 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.410
 which can be observed starfish 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.150
 also seashells 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.370
 that is, we can see what's going on 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.080
 under the boat respectively we can 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.940
 see this shell 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.160
 and in my opinion it is it that is drawn 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.690
 here look here is such shell 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.920
 windows can be opened to let fresh 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.720
 air and you can also back dress the deck 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.350
 to eat was even more comfortable here 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.510
 the whole handle is provided that was 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.930
 one slid on the table made such 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.970
 transparent lining they 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.800
 I can't forgive the model 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.110
 really slippery smoldering 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.360
 minimum you can roll on any 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.360
 surfaces only incomprehensible to me 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.600
 moment honestly why on the one hand 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.750
 sail here now bend me now 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.440
 show it like this is a gorgeous elf 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.240
 rook if we turn the sail then something 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.620
 do not get a look 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.740
 Immediately somehow the set fades I would like 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.509
 so that this sail was two-sided with 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.120
 one side of such a fabric and from the other 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.070
 I have no fabric then 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.039
 questions would not have arisen for this set 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.590
 and so for some reason we only sail with 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.740
 one side here is a little bit like that 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.610
 I will say a small minus of this set 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.389
 overall it is a very good set 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.880
 balanced many details 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.020
 wonderful colors and also see more 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.960
 I forgot to show you 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.349
 there are such seats like this 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.169
 put our figurine and rest on 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:31.380
 water is a special water seat and 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:35.220
 they are joined together with the rook to 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.169
 nowhere made a character in the sea Well 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.970
