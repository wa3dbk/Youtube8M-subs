00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.629 
well I got this chasm as you can see
these<00:03:06.480> are<00:03:06.630> ABS<00:03:07.049> parts<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.739> spray<00:03:08.310> I

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
these are ABS parts and I spray I

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.080 
these are ABS parts and I spray I
sprayed<00:03:09.450> some<00:03:10.069> lacquer<00:03:11.069> paints<00:03:11.609> on<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.880> and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
sprayed some lacquer paints on it and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.629 
sprayed some lacquer paints on it and
what<00:03:12.299> happened<00:03:12.690> was<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.859> lacquer<00:03:14.069> makes<00:03:14.459> it

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
what happened was the lacquer makes it

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.330 
what happened was the lacquer makes it
brittle<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.389> it<00:03:16.139> basically<00:03:16.290> messes<00:03:17.040> up<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
brittle so it basically messes up the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.949 
brittle so it basically messes up the
part<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:19.850> oh<00:03:22.340> I'll<00:03:23.340> run<00:03:23.639> through<00:03:23.880> after<00:03:24.510> the
