the Northeast United States from October
19th<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.179> 21st<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:10.019> had<00:00:10.860> also<00:00:11.190> theorized

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
19th to the 21st I had also theorized

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.060 
19th to the 21st I had also theorized
that<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.059> conjunction<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.870> mercury<00:00:13.380> comet

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
that the conjunction of mercury comet

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.790 
that the conjunction of mercury comet
ison<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.940> earth<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> Sun<00:00:15.750> would<00:00:16.590> have

ison the earth in the Sun would have
some<00:00:17.070> electrical<00:00:17.670> effect<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.390> might<00:00:18.630> create

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
some electrical effect that might create

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.660 
some electrical effect that might create
more<00:00:19.380> earthquakes<00:00:19.619> or<00:00:20.100> create<00:00:20.460> some

more earthquakes or create some
electrical<00:00:21.270> disturbance<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.900> our<00:00:22.050> planet

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
electrical disturbance on our planet

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.650 
electrical disturbance on our planet
simply<00:00:22.920> take<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> look<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> t-junction<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
simply take a look at the t-junction I

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
simply take a look at the t-junction I
was<00:00:24.779> mentioning<00:00:25.400> it's<00:00:26.400> along<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> orbital

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
was mentioning it's along the orbital

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.759 
was mentioning it's along the orbital
plane<00:00:27.240> you'll<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.900> how<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.140> does<00:00:28.289> match<00:00:28.529> up

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
plane you'll see how it does match up

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.310 
plane you'll see how it does match up
into<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> tea<00:00:29.310> there<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> had<00:00:30.779> predicted<00:00:31.050> on

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
into a tea there what I had predicted on

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.260 
into a tea there what I had predicted on
the<00:00:31.380> 17th<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.969> sunspots<00:00:33.710> 1861<00:00:34.710> 1870<00:00:35.700> we

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the 17th was the sunspots 1861 1870 we

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.600 
the 17th was the sunspots 1861 1870 we
start<00:00:36.510> cracking<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.350> would<00:00:37.800> flare<00:00:38.129> off<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
start cracking and would flare off to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.940 
start cracking and would flare off to
electrically<00:00:39.329> connect<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.870> comet<00:00:40.170> ison<00:00:40.500> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
electrically connect with comet ison you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.650 
electrically connect with comet ison you
can<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> energetic<00:00:41.730> field<00:00:42.180> lines<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
can see the energetic field lines that I

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.380 
can see the energetic field lines that I
thought<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.260> metamorphosize<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.239> can

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
thought would metamorphosize and you can

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.740 
thought would metamorphosize and you can
see<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.840> did<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.649> actuality<00:00:47.280> connect<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
see they did in actuality connect to the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.540 
see they did in actuality connect to the
comet<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.170> believe<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
comet I believe as you can see the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.279 
comet I believe as you can see the
magnetic<00:00:50.969> field<00:00:51.239> lines<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.110> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
magnetic field lines that we have that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.260 
magnetic field lines that we have that
come<00:00:52.800> off<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> our<00:00:53.309> earth<00:00:53.520> could<00:00:53.730> easily

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
come off of our earth could easily

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
come off of our earth could easily
connect<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.710> neighborhood<00:00:56.219> if

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
connect to some in the neighborhood if

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.950 
connect to some in the neighborhood if
you<00:00:56.489> will<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:57.210> let's<00:00:57.390> talk<00:00:57.539> about<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you will now let's talk about the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.889 
you will now let's talk about the
northeastern<00:00:58.559> blackout<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> 1965<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.780> in

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
northeastern blackout of 1965 it's in

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.709 
northeastern blackout of 1965 it's in
the<00:01:00.989> exact<00:01:01.350> same<00:01:01.559> area<00:01:02.000> again<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.210> repeated

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the exact same area again it's repeated

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.679 
the exact same area again it's repeated
in<00:01:04.189> 1989<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> solar<00:01:05.729> disturbance<00:01:06.150> in

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
in 1989 with the solar disturbance in

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.250 
in 1989 with the solar disturbance in
Quebec<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.979> fast<00:01:08.220> forward<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> 2013<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
Quebec and if we fast forward to 2013 we

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
Quebec and if we fast forward to 2013 we
we<00:01:10.650> find<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.280> area<00:01:11.700> had<00:01:12.090> some

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
we find the same area had some

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.789 
we find the same area had some
electrical<00:01:12.840> disturbances<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.500> cause

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
electrical disturbances that cause

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
electrical disturbances that cause
blackouts<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> coincidence<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
blackouts is a coincidence that this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.830 
blackouts is a coincidence that this
internet<00:01:17.100> blackout<00:01:17.280> was<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> exact<00:01:18.450> same

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
internet blackout was in the exact same

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.289 
internet blackout was in the exact same

more<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.470> cosmic<00:01:50.250> capacitor<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.840> would

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
more a cosmic capacitor and you would

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
more a cosmic capacitor and you would
definitely<00:01:52.350> expect<00:01:52.680> something<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
definitely expect something like this to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
definitely expect something like this to
be<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.880> highly<00:01:54.210> energized<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> gets

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
be more highly energized as it gets

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
be more highly energized as it gets
closer<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> Sun<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.189> encourage<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.909> do

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
closer to the Sun I encourage you to do

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
closer to the Sun I encourage you to do
some<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.540> own<00:01:57.659> research<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.680> how

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
some of your own research to see how

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530 
some of your own research to see how
