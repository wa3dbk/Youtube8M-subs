00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 I had wondered why I was 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.150
 actually in every case in every video 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.379
 and blue t shirt to have kinda like 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.360
 it just caught my eye 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.389
 wardrobe back there almost only blog 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.389
 puts 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.279
 what program do you use for yours 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.720
 cool intro or could you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.460
 let's make a video how to do it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.050
 So professional intro makes it first 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.609
 the intro itself is just an after 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.380
 effects done together with premiere 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.880
 and then exported and so on but 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
 I would not say it is 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.550
 still professional that is me 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.189
 can do it professionally 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.760
 that's why I'm probably not there 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.510
 good choice to show something I have 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.829
 just a little bit around 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.200
 experimented thoughtfully 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.399
 I like it I do not know if you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.140
 something is perhaps striking 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.430
 I do not like it so much then I work 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.960
 make it easy in a lot of ways 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.530
 other background changes the colors 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.510
 easy etc 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.879
 I can do everything so everything in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.190
 the combination of photoshop premiere 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.629
 and after effects were created in the beginning 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.210
 of course in photoshop then I have the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.219
 individual levels that were in there 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.960
 individually animated from broken the whole 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.789
 about premiere then exported with music 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.320
 etc 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.540
 and so is the intro as well as that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.049
 car originated and I think is quite 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.760
 It's not interesting to look at it now 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.680
 definitely the best but cool think 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.640
 I like it and if I have something 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.780
 I do not like it then I'll just 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.820
 you could change yourself now 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.229
 imagine that technology so handy 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 TV and so on never invented 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.490
 were almost a world without 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.740
 high tech so said it is really a 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.180
 strange question but I believe mine 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 life would be completely different i would 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 just still ride a bike as 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.460
 Do not halve youtube anymore 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.130
 is the difference between 2k and 4k 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.560
 to be exact describe 2k and 4k 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.250
 actually only approximate resolution 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.329
 it describes, so to speak, the number of 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.829
 horizontal pixel for example this 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.020
 video is 10 80 1080p full hd too 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.030
 called and you could also call it 2k 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 describe 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.740
 give the different resolutions 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.189
 through 27 p that is 1280 x 720 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.020
 pixel 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.500
 we have full hd that is 1920 x 1080 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.579
 pixel 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.580
 we have two karwasz 2048 x 1080 pixels 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.960
 then we have qhd thats like that 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.840
 resolution of 2560 x 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.630
 we have ultra hd that's what we are 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.430
 also call 4k sometimes so said so 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:27.640
 3000 3840 x 2160 and we really have 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 4k is 4096 x 2160 and out there 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.190
 someone has moved with the ambulance 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.500
 the bet i hope that you can do yours 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.900
 ask a bit clarify but ultra the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.420
 as well as 4k both would like to be 4k 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.070
 is not exactly the same 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.950
 but so big is the pixel difference 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:48.350
 not 94 khd is almost the same 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.090
 not quite recorded what music listen 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.560
 you like that is an interesting question 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.000
 simply for the sake of mine 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.220
 Actually, favorite music is always very 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.170
 is similar and that is 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.540
 drum'n'bass at a speed 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.880
 from 160 beats per minute 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.250
 and mostly somehow in the basement 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.690
 fit in melodic better are not 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.430
 somehow a growling bass or something 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.900
 but a melodic something with a 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.520
 nice tune or for example one 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.140
 piano 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.420
 my two favorite songs i 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.820
 currently have a breeze of 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.660
 simmons cases and for example too 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.630
 cling middle of lt br gt and easy to 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.580
 black so two beautiful songs the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.200
 I love you but I still have you 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.570
 more songs compiled here below 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 in the video description as a playlist 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.170
 find and go in there and do something 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.700
 I know so and who knows maybe 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.390
 one of you a few good songs 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.310
 they liked 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.350
 So just check it out for free 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.080
 what do you think of apple ios and android 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.020
 What do you think is better? 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.530
 I think the systems are very 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.440
 different and have, above all 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.180
 different contact persons if 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.100
 I can say that I have that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.450
 For example, my iphone 5 times 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.010
 just for three weeks as a main 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.620
 phone used and no android 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.000
 currently and it is not a problem 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.650
 I can do anything with what I do 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.390
 want and it all works and that 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.860
 is great but I have noticed for myself 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.450
 that android for me the most efficient 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.850
 Variation is I'm faster in that 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.370
 what i do i can do what i do 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.870
 want and faster and better and for 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.340
 me more effective because I like it more 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.320
 can customize as it likes 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.340
 but that does not have to be that way I can 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.109
 also understand well if someone just 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.840
 say okay I like it better then 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.930
 just like that 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.540
 it's wonderful that's why it's currently 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.730
 at 1 7 and android 4.4 kitkat with me 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.410
 Android could do it with 18 yet 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.729
 Change depending on what apple brings what 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.090
 the next android operating system 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.520
 brings 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.900
 I am completely open and use that 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.320
 what better then me at the time 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.840
 like 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.729
 advantage of someone who does not 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.320
 determine what you are studying now 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.479
 actually I am still the time 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.550
 at the university leipzig and studied 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.080
 physics but i will change pretty much 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.699
 sure but what exactly am I going to do 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.949
 say if I was accepted otherwise 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.180
 that's a bit weird but me 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.080
 I am actually relatively sure that 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.840
 she would be accepted 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.919
 thanks to this cool rating system 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.020
 the college where I am a 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.639
 have written where then by still 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.169
 Once I have improved 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.889
 ironically a pretty good one 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:07.229
 which is pretty funny , yes 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.940
 but I say it when I am 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.280
 not enrolled'm really in it 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.770
 if so, I will tell you what I am 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.610
 study what do you think of the 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.320
 marketing strategy of the one plus one 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.250
 okay here i should 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.139
 maybe say something that one plus one 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.460
 I have a video that you can find 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.389
 also below in the video 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.220
 I could look at that description 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.690
 and I have to say that one plus one is 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.250
 an interesting smartphone sees it 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.560
 good from it has come neat performance 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.410
 with its the so actually the dream 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.970
 phone for me but you need one 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.410
 invitation to get a device so 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.310
 you need an invitation to do that 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.690
 to order 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.580
 that just has the sense that the 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.780
 company does not go bankrupt that is quite a 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.760
 small business what are new 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.349
 has started and promises a lot 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.880
 and say okay we do this 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.860
 Invitation system simply for the reason 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.360
 he will not produce too much and 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.470
 the people who once have and buy the 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.300
 will really want it 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.430
 is probably not return 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.450
 simply a protection for you 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.729
 do not produce too much 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.860
 and I think that could be good 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.900
 because many people do not know it before 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.190
 All too normal street streets people 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.110
 the one on the street one meets 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.060
 hey one plus one was already endured 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.990
 probably no one is heard 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.650
 already very big in front of us he in the factory 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.510
 in the youtube and the community 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.400
 There is very widespread and I think 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.840
 it's good that they do that, but me 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.310
 Demand is much higher than demand 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.440
 they suspect and they should already 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.409
 few more invitation rausholt rausholt 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.820
 that would be cool I would like to have one too 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.620
 to be honest which cell phone was 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.360
 your first and how old were you when 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.590
 This is my very first mobile phone I have 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.880
 get to the confirmation 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.250
 or I have myself 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.790
 Bought that was a dual sim phone from 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:45.650
 simvalley so recommend that to me 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:48.240
 No, do not do it but I was 14 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.650
 what the question answered and afterwards 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.180
 I had such a cool mobile phone 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.590
 that you still have old youtube videos 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.540
 looks at me and then I had one 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.310
 iphone 4s 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.180
 This has been my first smartphone 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.100
