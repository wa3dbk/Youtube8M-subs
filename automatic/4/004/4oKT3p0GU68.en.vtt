Oh

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.030 

in<00:00:09.639> today's<00:00:10.389> video<00:00:10.570> we<00:00:10.900> will<00:00:10.930> see<00:00:11.080> how<00:00:11.320> to<00:00:11.559> grow

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
in today's video we will see how to grow

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.980 
in today's video we will see how to grow
Swiss<00:00:12.549> chard<00:00:13.029> in<00:00:13.330> containers<00:00:15.600> Swiss<00:00:16.600> chard<00:00:16.869> is

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
Swiss chard in containers Swiss chard is

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.470 
Swiss chard in containers Swiss chard is
grown<00:00:17.320> for<00:00:17.560> its<00:00:17.590> leaves<00:00:18.039> its<00:00:18.670> green<00:00:19.180> leaves

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
grown for its leaves its green leaves

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.080 
grown for its leaves its green leaves
now<00:00:20.470> it<00:00:20.620> stems<00:00:20.920> might<00:00:21.160> have<00:00:21.340> different<00:00:21.730> colors

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
now it stems might have different colors

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.850 
now it stems might have different colors
but<00:00:22.390> it's<00:00:22.690> more<00:00:22.960> like<00:00:23.110> a<00:00:23.140> substitute<00:00:23.410> for

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
but it's more like a substitute for

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.160 
but it's more like a substitute for
growing<00:00:24.100> spinach<00:00:24.580> simply<00:00:25.570> because<00:00:25.810> it's<00:00:25.990> just

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
growing spinach simply because it's just

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.740 
growing spinach simply because it's just
so<00:00:26.380> easy<00:00:26.410> to<00:00:26.800> grow<00:00:27.039> and<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.760> produces<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.210> lot<00:00:28.570> of

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
so easy to grow and it produces a lot of

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.109 
so easy to grow and it produces a lot of
greens<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:30.160> best<00:00:30.369> part<00:00:30.610> about<00:00:30.670> Swiss

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
greens and the best part about Swiss

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.570 
greens and the best part about Swiss
chard<00:00:31.449> is<00:00:31.750> that<00:00:32.020> it<00:00:32.199> grows<00:00:32.379> year<00:00:32.739> round

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.100 

so<00:00:36.580> for<00:00:36.760> Swiss<00:00:36.970> chard<00:00:37.240> you<00:00:37.330> need<00:00:37.600> a<00:00:37.630> container

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
so for Swiss chard you need a container

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.130 
so for Swiss chard you need a container
which<00:00:38.410> is<00:00:38.440> about<00:00:38.710> 16<00:00:39.100> inches<00:00:39.130> wide<00:00:39.700> by<00:00:40.660> 16

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
which is about 16 inches wide by 16

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.950 
which is about 16 inches wide by 16
inches<00:00:41.470> tall<00:00:41.830> and<00:00:42.220> I<00:00:43.120> am<00:00:43.180> growing<00:00:43.390> about<00:00:43.660> 3

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
inches tall and I am growing about 3

the<00:01:03.340> most<00:01:03.580> common<00:01:04.270> varieties<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:05.020> people

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
the most common varieties that people

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.920 
the most common varieties that people
grow<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.979> called<00:01:06.310> bright<00:01:06.790> lights<00:01:07.150> which<00:01:07.900> is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
grow is called bright lights which is

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.670 
grow is called bright lights which is
basically<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.890> mixture<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:10.290> yellow<00:01:11.290> green<00:01:11.530> and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
basically a mixture of yellow green and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.090 
basically a mixture of yellow green and
red<00:01:12.040> Swiss<00:01:12.550> chard<00:01:12.910> and<00:01:13.750> for<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.619> most<00:01:14.800> part

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
red Swiss chard and for the most part

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.340 
red Swiss chard and for the most part
that's<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.400> good<00:01:15.580> variety<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:16.150> grow<00:01:16.180> but<00:01:17.140> there

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
that's a good variety to grow but there

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.930 
that's a good variety to grow but there
is<00:01:17.440> one<00:01:17.680> variety<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.400> highly<00:01:18.910> recommend

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
is one variety that I highly recommend

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.930 
is one variety that I highly recommend
growing<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:20.950> called<00:01:21.220> ruby<00:01:21.729> red

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
growing and that is called ruby red

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.109 
growing and that is called ruby red
Swiss<00:01:22.479> chard<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.550> reason<00:01:24.910> I<00:01:25.000> recommend

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
Swiss chard now the reason I recommend

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.210 
Swiss chard now the reason I recommend
growing<00:01:25.570> ruby<00:01:25.990> red<00:01:26.170> is<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.590> it's<00:01:26.770> just<00:01:27.009> so

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
growing ruby red is that it's just so

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.150 
growing ruby red is that it's just so
easy<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.700> grow<00:01:27.940> them<00:01:28.500> they're<00:01:29.500> very<00:01:29.740> disease

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
easy to grow them they're very disease

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.030 
easy to grow them they're very disease
resistant<00:01:30.729> they<00:01:31.420> produce<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:32.080> lot<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.800> are

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
resistant they produce a lot and are

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.680 
resistant they produce a lot and are
easy<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.490> maintain<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.149> taste<00:01:34.840> very<00:01:35.140> nice<00:01:36.690> one

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
easy to maintain and taste very nice one

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.690 
easy to maintain and taste very nice one
thing<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:37.990> do<00:01:38.050> want<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.470> talk<00:01:38.649> about<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:39.370> Swiss

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
thing I do want to talk about a Swiss

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.550 
thing I do want to talk about a Swiss
chard<00:01:39.970> as<00:01:40.180> we<00:01:40.390> are<00:01:40.479> harvesting<00:01:40.659> these<00:01:41.170> leaves

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
chard as we are harvesting these leaves

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.560 
chard as we are harvesting these leaves
is<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:43.200> Swiss<00:01:44.200> chard<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.770> mostly<00:01:45.570> harvested

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
is that Swiss chard is mostly harvested

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.350 
is that Swiss chard is mostly harvested
for<00:01:46.750> its<00:01:46.930> greens<00:01:47.400> so<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.520> kind<00:01:48.729> of<00:01:48.850> fertilizer

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
for its greens so the kind of fertilizer

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.940 
for its greens so the kind of fertilizer
that<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.720> need<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.020> use<00:01:50.170> for<00:01:50.200> swiss<00:01:50.470> chard

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
that you need to use for swiss chard

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.130 
that you need to use for swiss chard
needs<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.610> be<00:01:51.729> either<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:52.060> balanced<00:01:52.630> fertilizer

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
needs to be either a balanced fertilizer

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.390 
needs to be either a balanced fertilizer
or<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.940> fertilizer<00:01:54.940> that's<00:01:55.330> high<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:55.869> nitrogen

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
or a fertilizer that's high in nitrogen

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.399 
or a fertilizer that's high in nitrogen
that's<00:01:57.400> going<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.729> give<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.000> nice<00:01:58.299> big<00:01:59.020> leaves
