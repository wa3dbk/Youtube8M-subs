00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
is still pretty cheap and so I got this

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.740 
is still pretty cheap and so I got this
from<00:02:11.380> Spore<00:02:12.120> originally<00:02:13.120> trying<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> find<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
from Spore originally trying to find a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.640 
from Spore originally trying to find a
face<00:02:13.930> brush<00:02:14.970> typically<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.239> like<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:17.140> handle

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
face brush typically I like the handle

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.319 
face brush typically I like the handle
it's<00:02:17.860> very<00:02:19.079> they<00:02:20.079> handle<00:02:20.440> film<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:21.280> wanna<00:02:22.150> say

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
it's very they handle film I wanna say

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.050 
it's very they handle film I wanna say
necessarily<00:02:22.630> like<00:02:23.590> plastic<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.579> does<00:02:24.790> feel

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
necessarily like plastic it does feel

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.630 
necessarily like plastic it does feel
like<00:02:25.090> plastic<00:02:25.720> but<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.709> feels<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.220> something

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
like plastic but it feels like something

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.039 
like plastic but it feels like something
that<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.880> have<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.180> put<00:02:28.390> your<00:02:28.540> whole<00:02:28.750> weight

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
that you have to put your whole weight

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.059 
that you have to put your whole weight
into<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:30.299> in<00:02:31.299> order<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:32.019> it<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.530> break<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
into it in order for it to break the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.280 
into it in order for it to break the
handle<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.760> do<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.359> how<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.540> comes<00:02:34.930> with<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
handle I do like how it comes with a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.309 
handle I do like how it comes with a
little<00:02:35.410> cap<00:02:35.799> so<00:02:36.639> you<00:02:36.700> can<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.389> close<00:02:38.049> if

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
little cap so you can just close if

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.500 
little cap so you can just close if
people<00:02:38.530> want<00:02:38.680> any<00:02:38.859> bacteria<00:02:39.579> to<00:02:39.880> get<00:02:40.150> onto<00:02:40.299> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
people want any bacteria to get onto the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.370 
people want any bacteria to get onto the
brush<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:41.069> basically<00:02:42.069> use<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.670> night<00:02:43.660> time<00:02:44.019> to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
circular motion working it in

circular motion working it in
my<00:03:06.549> face<00:03:06.790> now<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.920> in<00:03:09.640> circle<00:03:10.090> motion

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
my face now going in circle motion

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.960 
my face now going in circle motion
behind<00:03:10.720> your<00:03:11.439> over<00:03:12.129> the<00:03:12.250> back<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.610> your<00:03:12.730> hand

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
it doesn't feel that rough it feels

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.880 
it doesn't feel that rough it feels
actually<00:03:15.579> saw<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:16.930> when<00:03:17.200> applying<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.739> to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
actually saw but when applying it to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.220 
actually saw but when applying it to
your<00:03:17.920> face<00:03:18.280> for<00:03:18.670> me<00:03:18.879> it<00:03:19.209> feels<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.810> little<00:03:19.989> bit

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
your face for me it feels a little bit

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.750 
your face for me it feels a little bit
rough<00:03:20.530> I'm<00:03:20.769> not<00:03:20.980> sure<00:03:21.159> if<00:03:21.370> that's<00:03:21.610> how<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
rough I'm not sure if that's how the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.390 
rough I'm not sure if that's how the
brush<00:03:22.120> supposed<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:23.049> or<00:03:23.470> if<00:03:23.799> it's<00:03:24.010> my<00:03:24.189> face

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
brush supposed to be or if it's my face

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.849 
brush supposed to be or if it's my face
this<00:03:24.609> is<00:03:24.760> just<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.090> little<00:03:25.239> bit<00:03:25.450> too<00:03:25.599> sensitive

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
this is just a little bit too sensitive

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.890 
this is just a little bit too sensitive
so<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:27.159> can't<00:03:27.579> really<00:03:27.670> take<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.329> roughness<00:03:28.720> of

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
so it can't really take the roughness of

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.380 
so it can't really take the roughness of
this<00:03:29.109> it<00:03:29.439> is<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:32.590> can<00:03:32.859> use<00:03:33.189> it<00:03:33.400> daily<00:03:33.640> it's<00:03:34.090> not

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
this it is you can use it daily it's not

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.920 
this it is you can use it daily it's not
like<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:35.010> Clarisonic<00:03:36.239> where<00:03:37.239> you<00:03:37.450> use<00:03:37.689> it<00:03:37.900> a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
like the Clarisonic where you use it a

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.449 
like the Clarisonic where you use it a
couple<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:38.170> times<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:38.650> all<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.159> sudden<00:03:39.370> you

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
couple of times and all of a sudden you

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.690 
couple of times and all of a sudden you
break<00:03:39.700> out<00:03:39.909> because<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.420> kind<00:03:40.629> of<00:03:40.690> exploding

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
break out because it kind of exploding

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.750 
break out because it kind of exploding

your<00:04:01.989> face<00:04:02.790> which<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:04.450> doesn't<00:04:04.870> break<00:04:05.109> out

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
your face which it doesn't break out

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.559 
your face which it doesn't break out
your<00:04:05.560> face<00:04:05.829> and<00:04:06.250> that's<00:04:06.909> what<00:04:07.180> you're<00:04:07.359> kind<00:04:07.510> of

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
your face and that's what you're kind of

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.619 
your face and that's what you're kind of
questioning<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.230> do<00:04:09.010> like<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.150> has<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.299> cap

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
questioning I do like that it has a cap

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.089 
questioning I do like that it has a cap
so<00:04:10.870> it's<00:04:10.989> good<00:04:11.199> so<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.590> don't<00:04:11.769> want<00:04:11.949> any

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.490 
size I like the handle it fits great
into<00:04:40.150> my<00:04:40.270> hand<00:04:40.510> since<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:40.810> have<00:04:40.960> small<00:04:41.229> hands

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
into my hand since I have small hands

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.580 
into my hand since I have small hands
and<00:04:41.889> it<00:04:42.729> doesn't<00:04:43.240> stop<00:04:43.659> it<00:04:43.900> takes<00:04:44.169> off<00:04:44.380> my

and it doesn't stop it takes off my
makeup<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.099> noticed<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.789> my<00:04:46.120> skin<00:04:46.150> has<00:04:47.020> been<00:04:47.050> a

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
makeup I noticed that my skin has been a

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.430 
makeup I noticed that my skin has been a
little<00:04:48.039> bit<00:04:48.190> more<00:04:48.430> clearer<00:04:49.090> since<00:04:50.050> I've<00:04:50.260> been

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
little bit more clearer since I've been

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.680 
little bit more clearer since I've been
using<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:50.949> whip<00:04:51.250> also<00:04:51.760> my<00:04:51.880> face<00:04:52.090> wash<00:04:52.360> that's

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
using this whip also my face wash that's

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.960 
using this whip also my face wash that's
helped<00:04:52.900> being<00:04:53.530> my<00:04:53.770> skin<00:04:54.039> a<00:04:54.070> little<00:04:54.250> bit<00:04:54.370> so

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
helped being my skin a little bit so

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.350 
helped being my skin a little bit so
without<00:04:55.960> my<00:04:56.110> face<00:04:56.289> wash<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.800> without<00:04:57.159> this<00:04:57.460> my

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
without my face wash and without this my

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.450 
without my face wash and without this my
skin<00:04:58.419> will<00:04:58.900> probably<00:04:59.289> be<00:04:59.409> the<00:04:59.560> same<00:04:59.740> but<00:05:00.430> I

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
skin will probably be the same but I

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.730 
skin will probably be the same but I
noticed<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.330> take<00:05:01.659> this<00:05:01.990> brush<00:05:02.409> takes

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
noticed that it take this brush takes

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.820 
noticed that it take this brush takes
off<00:05:02.979> more

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
off more

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.939 
off more
then<00:05:04.129> what<00:05:04.460> my<00:05:04.669> makeup<00:05:05.090> wipes<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.810> my<00:05:06.379> makeup

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
then what my makeup wipes and my makeup

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.240 
then what my makeup wipes and my makeup
remover<00:05:07.430> would<00:05:08.060> do<00:05:08.240> on<00:05:08.599> its<00:05:08.780> own<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.379> I<00:05:09.680> notice

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
remover would do on its own so I notice

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.600 
remover would do on its own so I notice
a<00:05:10.430> change<00:05:10.460> in<00:05:11.000> my<00:05:11.180> skin<00:05:11.599> and<00:05:11.870> in<00:05:12.470> my<00:05:12.650> taking<00:05:13.490> off

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
a change in my skin and in my taking off

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.629 
a change in my skin and in my taking off
my<00:05:13.819> makeup<00:05:14.030> routine<00:05:14.470> I<00:05:15.470> know<00:05:15.770> that<00:05:16.099> this<00:05:16.280> brush

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
my makeup routine I know that this brush

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.119 
my makeup routine I know that this brush
takes<00:05:16.970> off<00:05:17.150> way<00:05:17.389> more<00:05:17.690> than<00:05:18.020> what<00:05:18.620> my<00:05:18.830> makeup

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
takes off way more than what my makeup

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.450 
takes off way more than what my makeup
wipes<00:05:19.370> would<00:05:19.729> do<00:05:19.940> so<00:05:20.720> I<00:05:21.050> would<00:05:21.560> go<00:05:22.220> and

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
wipes would do so I would go and

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.850 
wipes would do so I would go and

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
where you know you're getting all that

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.950 
where you know you're getting all that
makeup<00:05:30.860> off<00:05:31.129> and<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.639> are<00:05:31.669> knowing<00:05:32.240> that<00:05:32.780> you

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
makeup off and you are knowing that you

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.809 
makeup off and you are knowing that you
are<00:05:32.990> getting<00:05:33.259> all<00:05:33.500> that<00:05:33.620> makeup<00:05:33.889> off<00:05:34.069> then<00:05:34.669> go

are getting all that makeup off then go

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.680 
are getting all that makeup off then go
ahead<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.180> buy<00:05:36.050> this<00:05:36.110> brush<00:05:37.030> all<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:38.090> can<00:05:38.449> say

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
ahead and buy this brush all I can say

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.990 
ahead and buy this brush all I can say
is<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:39.139> downside<00:05:39.680> of<00:05:39.710> this<00:05:40.039> is<00:05:40.340> that<00:05:40.400> it<00:05:40.699> feels

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
is the downside of this is that it feels

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.540 
is the downside of this is that it feels
rough<00:05:41.479> on<00:05:41.750> my<00:05:41.930> skin<00:05:42.259> I<00:05:42.500> don't<00:05:43.069> know<00:05:43.190> if<00:05:43.400> you

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
rough on my skin I don't know if you

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.490 
rough on my skin I don't know if you
will<00:05:43.699> feel<00:05:43.909> rough<00:05:44.150> on<00:05:44.300> yours<00:05:44.569> it<00:05:44.900> doesn't<00:05:44.930> mine

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
will feel rough on yours it doesn't mine

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.499 
will feel rough on yours it doesn't mine
so<00:05:46.039> that's<00:05:46.159> the<00:05:46.340> only<00:05:46.490> downside<00:05:46.789> about<00:05:47.270> this

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
so that's the only downside about this

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.469 
so that's the only downside about this
but<00:05:48.169> other<00:05:48.440> than<00:05:48.620> that<00:05:48.710> it<00:05:49.099> kind<00:05:49.940> of<00:05:49.969> foams<00:05:50.210> up

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
but other than that it kind of foams up

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.149 
but other than that it kind of foams up
nicely<00:05:50.810> you<00:05:51.259> just<00:05:51.469> go<00:05:51.590> into<00:05:51.710> a<00:05:51.830> circular

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
nicely you just go into a circular

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.610 
nicely you just go into a circular
motion<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.759> can't<00:05:53.750> really<00:05:53.900> get<00:05:54.139> it<00:05:54.259> into<00:05:54.379> the

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
motion I can't really get it into the

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.619 
motion I can't really get it into the
corner<00:05:54.919> of<00:05:54.949> my<00:05:55.129> nose<00:05:55.370> because<00:05:55.819> it's<00:05:56.330> a<00:05:56.509> little

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:56.629 
corner of my nose because it's a little
