00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.340
 painted people will realize that the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.580
 from a certain moment in the class 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.580
 the nose starts to run when gunsmith 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.330
 this means that it does not start 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.680
 skidding on the opposite side degrades 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.680
 aircraft performance 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.070
 from that moment onwards the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:42.239
 curve to the right and from the moment in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 column will begin to leave the nose 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.780
 should be on this side run 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.780
 careless 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:59.079
 already has the nose on the left side 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.489
 from there it will start to 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.489
 reverse the curve to the left 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.270
 and there it will have the inclination to the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.050
 left side when you should have the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.310
 right side and nose 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.509
 pointing to the left when it should 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.660
 turn right 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.780
 she was skidding on the wrong side 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.140
 this generated a great loss of energy 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.560
 with this she was descending to no 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.130
 she could keep this time in the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 page 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.890
 Hey 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.470
 but in the end the attitude more and more 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.830
 appeals to guarantee up to being the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.380
 speed was falling so far in 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.680
 I like a loss of control of 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.680
 impact
