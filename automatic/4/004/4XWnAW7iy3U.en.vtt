00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
take then the body of your cup and just
kind<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.130> work<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.070> nice<00:01:59.250> circle

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.110 

when<00:02:03.650> you've<00:02:03.800> got<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.070> just<00:02:04.370> about<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.000> way

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
when you've got it just about the way

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.440 
when you've got it just about the way
you<00:02:05.180> want<00:02:05.510> it

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
you want it

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.190 
you want it
push<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.570> down<00:02:08.690> time<00:02:10.720> then<00:02:11.720> if<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.990> want<00:02:12.140> to

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
push it down time then if you want to

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.490 
push it down time then if you want to
use<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.440> same<00:02:12.680> cupcake<00:02:13.130> cup<00:02:14.090> for<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.500> you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
use the same cupcake cup for that you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.980 
use the same cupcake cup for that you
certainly<00:02:15.860> can<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.430> like<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.030> vary<00:02:17.270> my<00:02:17.540> patterns

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
certainly can I like to vary my patterns

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.290 
certainly can I like to vary my patterns
so<00:02:18.710> I'm<00:02:18.890> going<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.100> take<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.460> one<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:20.180> this

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
so I'm going to take this one but this

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.970 
so I'm going to take this one but this
one<00:02:20.360> I'm<00:02:20.690> going<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.870> cut<00:02:21.140> down<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.950> little

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
one I'm going to cut down just a little

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.240 
one I'm going to cut down just a little
bit<00:02:22.370> shorter<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.600> come<00:02:24.080> up<00:02:24.110> fast<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.860> little<00:02:25.010> bit

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
bit shorter so come up fast a little bit

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.130 
bit shorter so come up fast a little bit
farther<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.270> will<00:02:26.540> layer<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:27.110> a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
farther so that it will layer in a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.530 
farther so that it will layer in a
little<00:02:27.590> bit<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.670> again<00:02:29.030> we're<00:02:29.240> going<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.390> take

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
little bit and again we're going to take

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.670 
little bit and again we're going to take
our<00:02:29.720> hot<00:02:29.930> glue<00:02:29.960> go<00:02:30.500> around<00:02:35.140> bring<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.320> around

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
our hot glue go around bring this around

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.930 
our hot glue go around bring this around
this<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.220> probably<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.580> toughest<00:02:37.910> part

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
this is probably the toughest part

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.530 
this is probably the toughest part
getting<00:02:38.360> used<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.810> maneuvering<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.180> you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
getting used to maneuvering this and you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.270 
getting used to maneuvering this and you
want<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.840> bring<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.380> tighter<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.070> have

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
want to bring it in tighter so you have

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.820 
want to bring it in tighter so you have
a<00:02:43.310> little<00:02:43.640> bit<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.880> an<00:02:44.060> edge<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.290> your<00:02:45.530> bottom

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
a little bit of an edge so your bottom

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.400 
a little bit of an edge so your bottom
layer<00:02:45.980> shows<00:02:46.340> through<00:02:47.020> when<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:48.110> get<00:02:48.260> that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
layer shows through when you get that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:03:00.070 
layer shows through when you get that
into<00:02:48.620> position<00:02:51.310> push<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.459> down<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:59.840> more

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
into position push it down just one more

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.770 
into position push it down just one more
quick<00:03:00.290> layer<00:03:00.560> here<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:03.850> take<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:04.880> little<00:03:05.269> bit

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
quick layer here and take a little bit

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.870 
quick layer here and take a little bit
more<00:03:06.280> Audia<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.160> probably<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.519> toughest

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
more Audia this is probably the toughest

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.190 
more Audia this is probably the toughest
layer<00:03:14.090> trying<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.540> get<00:03:14.690> this<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:17.200> really

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
layer trying to get this one in really

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.710 
layer trying to get this one in really
tight<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.280> actually<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.120> pull<00:03:20.360> these

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
tight but it actually you can pull these

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.190 
tight but it actually you can pull these
are<00:03:20.930> waxy<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.010> can<00:03:22.310> pull<00:03:22.640> them<00:03:22.820> up<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.540> a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
are waxy so you can pull them up and a

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.259 
are waxy so you can pull them up and a
lot<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.470> times<00:03:24.680> they<00:03:24.890> won't<00:03:25.040> even<00:03:25.280> rip<00:03:25.700> from

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
lot of times they won't even rip from

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.920 
lot of times they won't even rip from
the<00:03:26.390> hot<00:03:26.540> glue<00:03:27.760> set<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.239> push<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.230> down

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
the hot glue set that and push that down

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.690 
the hot glue set that and push that down
that<00:03:32.930> cute<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:35.860> then<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:36.890> just<00:03:37.220> use<00:03:37.430> these

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
that cute and then I just use these

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.060 
that cute and then I just use these
cheap<00:03:38.000> little<00:03:38.209> blings<00:03:38.600> that<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.140> get<00:03:39.290> a
