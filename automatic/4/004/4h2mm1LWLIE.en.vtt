feeding cap and the trigger rod guide
now<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> definitely<00:00:35.790> need<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:37.320> piece

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
now you definitely need this this piece

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.459 
now you definitely need this this piece
here<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.010> goes<00:00:38.399> inside<00:00:38.579> I've<00:00:39.149> had<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
here this goes inside I've had to you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.170 
here this goes inside I've had to you
can<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.710> I've<00:00:40.829> played<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> couple<00:00:42.000> times

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
can see I've played with a couple times

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.490 
can see I've played with a couple times
and<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> hole<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.960> hole<00:00:43.520> small<00:00:44.520> enough

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
and make the hole the hole small enough

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.440 
and make the hole the hole small enough
because<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.820> feeding<00:00:48.180> disc

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
because you don't want the feeding disc

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.010 
because you don't want the feeding disc
in<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.110> case<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.030> milk<00:00:51.660> bottle<00:00:52.610> to

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
in this case the top of a milk bottle to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.819 
in this case the top of a milk bottle to
to<00:00:55.020> go<00:00:55.170> past<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.770> edge<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.180> hopper<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> if

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to go past the edge of the hopper so if

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.000 
to go past the edge of the hopper so if
it<00:00:58.920> comes<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.219> too<00:00:59.489> far<00:00:59.730> like<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.010> obviously

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it comes out too far like that obviously

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.070 
it comes out too far like that obviously
all<00:01:02.340> your<00:01:02.520> food<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.270> rush<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> other

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
all your food is going to rush the other

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.899 
all your food is going to rush the other
side<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> stay<00:01:07.580> just<00:01:08.580> inside

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
side so you want it to stay just inside

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.859 
side so you want it to stay just inside
the<00:01:09.060> edges<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.340 

okay<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> put<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> together<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:16.140> need<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
okay so put it together you need to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
okay so put it together you need to
place<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> guide<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.229> bottom<00:01:23.000> obviously

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
place the guide in the bottom obviously

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
place the guide in the bottom obviously
that<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.350> stuck<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.470> properly<00:01:28.520> then

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that would be stuck in properly then

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.980 
that would be stuck in properly then
place<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.390> trigger<00:01:30.689> rod<00:01:32.630> down<00:01:33.630> through<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
place the trigger rod down through the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.469 
place the trigger rod down through the
center<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.670> sits<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> middle<00:01:36.619> like<00:01:37.619> so

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
center so it sits in the middle like so

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.630 
center so it sits in the middle like so
and<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.780> right<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> bottom<00:01:42.560> okay

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
and as you're right at the bottom okay

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.600 
and as you're right at the bottom okay
next<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.540> need<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> put<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> cap<00:01:46.350> okay<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
next you need to put the cap okay so the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.560 
next you need to put the cap okay so the
case<00:01:47.790> I'll<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:47.939> drill<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> hole<00:01:48.420> just

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
case I'll just drill the hole just

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.500 
case I'll just drill the hole just
slightly<00:01:48.899> smaller<00:01:51.290> onto<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> trigger<00:01:52.500> on

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.930 

so<00:01:56.290> caps<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.980> caps<00:01:57.190> on<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.370> trigger<00:01:57.610> rod<00:01:57.760> as

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
so caps the caps on the trigger rod as

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
you can see when I move it it doesn't go

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.570 
you can see when I move it it doesn't go
past<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.500> edge<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.630> edge<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:04.990> feeder

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580
