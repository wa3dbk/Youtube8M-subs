00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.720 

this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.319> my<00:00:01.469> third<00:00:01.680> organ<00:00:02.040> it's<00:00:02.310> not<00:00:02.520> quite

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
this is my third organ it's not quite

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.039 
this is my third organ it's not quite
finished<00:00:02.909> yet<00:00:03.120> but<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.510> wanted<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.840> go<00:00:03.959> ahead

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
finished yet but I wanted to go ahead

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.260 
finished yet but I wanted to go ahead
and<00:00:04.259> make<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:05.069> still<00:00:05.850> need<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.089> make

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
and make a video I still need to make

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.970 
and make a video I still need to make
the<00:00:06.390> decorative<00:00:06.810> panels<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:07.470> will<00:00:07.620> fill<00:00:07.830> in

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the decorative panels that will fill in

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.980 
the decorative panels that will fill in
these<00:00:08.130> areas<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.090> need<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.360> add<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.690> tuning

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
these areas and I need to add the tuning

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.600 
these areas and I need to add the tuning
mechanism<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> top<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> open<00:00:11.400> pipes

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
mechanism to the top of the open pipes

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.940 
mechanism to the top of the open pipes
right<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:12.750> they're<00:00:12.960> just<00:00:12.990> cut<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.440> length<00:00:13.590> so

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
right now they're just cut to length so

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.359 
right now they're just cut to length so
the<00:00:14.070> tuning<00:00:14.400> isn't<00:00:14.730> perfect<00:00:15.650> this<00:00:16.650> organ<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
the tuning isn't perfect this organ is a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.029 
the tuning isn't perfect this organ is a
two-stop<00:00:18.270> one-ranked<00:00:18.990> continuo

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
two-stop one-ranked continuo

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.830 
two-stop one-ranked continuo
and<00:00:20.279> what<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.850> means<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.359> there's<00:00:21.630> one

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and what that means is that there's one

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.410 
and what that means is that there's one
set<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.140> pipes<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.830> there's<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.820> transmission

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
set of pipes and there's a transmission

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.089 
set of pipes and there's a transmission
which<00:00:24.600> allows<00:00:24.869> those<00:00:25.140> pipes<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.619> play<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> both

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
which allows those pipes to play to both

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.419 
which allows those pipes to play to both
eight<00:00:26.400> foot<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.939> four<00:00:27.240> foot<00:00:27.480> pitch<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:29.130> organ

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
eight foot and four foot pitch the organ

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.849 
eight foot and four foot pitch the organ
has<00:00:29.699> stopped<00:00:30.660> pipes<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.349> bottom<00:00:31.710> two

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
has stopped pipes for the bottom two

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.620 
has stopped pipes for the bottom two
octaves<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> rest<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> pipes

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
octaves and then the rest of the pipes

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.700 
octaves and then the rest of the pipes
are<00:00:33.899> open<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:35.700> organ<00:00:36.090> comes<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.110> two<00:00:37.290> units

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
are open the organ comes in two units

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.430 
are open the organ comes in two units
the<00:00:38.129> bottom<00:00:38.460> unit<00:00:38.640> contains<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.899> reservoir

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the bottom unit contains the reservoir

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
the bottom unit contains the reservoir
and<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> blower<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.309> everything<00:00:41.910> else<00:00:42.059> in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and the blower and everything else in

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.420 
and the blower and everything else in
the<00:00:42.420> top<00:00:42.629> unit<00:00:43.050> which<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:43.950> lifted<00:00:44.129> off

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the top unit which can be lifted off

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.729 
the top unit which can be lifted off
during<00:00:44.789> transportation<00:00:45.350> there<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.469> some

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
during transportation there will be some

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
during transportation there will be some
retractable<00:00:47.309> handles<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.940> each<00:00:48.390> end<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
retractable handles on each end so the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
retractable handles on each end so the
two<00:00:49.260> people<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:53.190> manual<00:00:53.520> has<00:00:53.789> 51

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
two people can do that the manual has 51
