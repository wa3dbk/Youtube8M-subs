00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.030
 talking staff talking you see the background 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.800
 welcome to plane b 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.350
 I do not know how it's happened, my house has 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.240
 a project but kaka or so much is 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.700
 talk in my house, my life will go 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 show in the house is nice 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.669
 Are you here in denmark? 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 I 'm going to show a little of my 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.360
 residence for you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.329
 Good. Let's start with the boring part. 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:38.180
 So the bathroom has nothing. 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:38.180
 too much is something that is very common 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:56.490
 You can take everything right away. 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:05.549
 here's something interesting too 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:06.390
 that you calibrate the energy gets more 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.960
 cold 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:17.149
 according to your preference too 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.149
 has a regulator to save is like 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.119
 you can force a way to save 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.170
 energy which is very common also a 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.319
 bathroom 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.229
 I really like it is not that the show 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:02:01.499
 shower is connected with the floor of the rest of the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:02:03.509
 bathroom alone but I think we're going here 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:05.130
 To the kitchen, now you can see. 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.099
 it is also not 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.840
 if I 've never seen at least one gas stove 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.800
 all smokers are so are 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.700
 electrical 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.870
 So you throw it here and say it's 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.720
 switched on 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.420
 connected here but you can see at 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.500
 side than the one that is smaller and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.700
 this is the biggest 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 that's how you know when you're 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.920
 end of the year is usually all goals 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.250
 all who came electric and I did not 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.980
 I have the stove only has the heaters you 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.440
 I want to do a good job, but I 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.349
 I have to get down there, I can rent 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.200
 the continuing freedom here has in the sink 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.569
 It has nothing much here is not tap in 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.140
 has has marvada here is that marvada 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.120
 I brought it is that of the oran tic da marvada that 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.720
 transformed the teacher who is Brazilian 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.870
 huh 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.890
 and he will like to get out a lot asked 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.260
 there are things up here you can already see the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.940
 my wonderful cheese bread for everything 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.430
 buy the staff is cheap 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.109
 wonder this here and there upon it has 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.370
 of new pots that my mother 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.989
 wonderful bought me home 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:28.940
 a lot of new things about crying 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:31.889
 team is what gets aaa here 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.169
 under this deal it purifies and 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.310
 money, maybe that's why 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:40.290
 question is not that but ok 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.299
 Geladinho is nothing too much of a goal 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.340
 from here with talent there is nothing much 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.239
 that you then see the hope that the 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.769
 interesting is the Danish waste from 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.590
 generally fall within the 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.079
 closet all our merit of the houses that 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.970
 I've always been like this, there's no trash on top. 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.639
 of the sink in which it is most common 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.629
 we have such a pet aimlessly not 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.819
 has the sink there these things I 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.590
 I only have one cabinet in a spacious no 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.090
 To put on my show to get things done. 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.970
 huh 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.500
 Good to do is to bend everything has to 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.349
 be well organized that you can avoid 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.570
 now by the outcome is even greater 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:21.090
 so when I had to organize 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.949
 It's really going to change a lot here now. 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.050
 An overview here from my room now 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.550
 It looks beautiful in that you can see the tripod 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.470
 It's already mounted, there's a stop for him. 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.860
 I 'll make a video for you, lol. 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.930
 It's also cool and let's go slowly, right? 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.849
 Good here in this little corner that has the bags 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.580
 There is a little light that should be crying. 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.500
 There, this wonderful sofa I can 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.000
 Grace of a friend of mine 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.229
 You will know how you helped me too. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.659
 Furnishing the room is that when I saw that 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:52.650
 when I came to another room and there you can 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:57.090
 show now the tripod little thing 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.990
 underneath on the show line fight show 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.389
 show also a little corner here 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.759
 things and with the blue sollus and odors 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.750
 and I already got a 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:16.280
 division 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:16.280
 I went to train boy and then the club 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:34.520
 here you can see and she opens look there 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:34.520
 on top as if it were a window can 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.380
 open normal 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.710
 You can not see anything, but there. 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:52.809
 is getting wire that is good q tava 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.939
 kind of hot until I get here but then I 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:57.099
 usually I leave it open like this 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:59.110
 get in cool because all the doors 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.849
 here we also social sides 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.039
 so when you close, you hear nothing 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.569
 do not pass the area gets a fucking breath 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.789
 so it's good, right? 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.099
 this curtain sucks the fugitive in the 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.259
 sunny days to finish here my 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.330
 A little something here. 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.699
 Get this chair for free too. 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.050
 will stop what he loves fucking 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:21.699
 until my pc or close here is a little 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.039
 that I have to select 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:29.469
 play outside and what 's this? 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.629
 the big house in the galley if they could see it there 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:34.059
 a humble small house but it is 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:36.370
 dangerous and consequent, so to speak 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:38.499
 and this is where I'm going to spend the days 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.249
 making videos for you that I go 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:44.589
 spend 26 days and I hope you guys 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:46.270
 You liked it and I hope you 

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:49.240
 like these videos showing life 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.330
 here because I do not know, I find it interesting 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.740
 I've already seen videos of foreigners 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.089
 they were always curious how they 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.789
 live how only small ones 

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.810
 differences in daily life depending on 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.149
 Where do you live 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.889
 two fighters have liked it if you liked 

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:06.360
 of what is written below does not 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.360
 it was another video there
