dilute<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:40.120> five<00:02:40.390> parts<00:02:40.780> water<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.260> one<00:02:41.500> part

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
dilute this five parts water to one part

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.980 
dilute this five parts water to one part
of<00:02:41.830> this<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.160> think<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.580> maybe<00:02:43.330> put<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.780> drop

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
of this I think and maybe put in a drop

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.510 
of this I think and maybe put in a drop
of<00:02:44.050> back<00:02:45.660> organic<00:02:46.660> soap<00:02:46.900> if<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.170> can<00:02:47.350> find<00:02:47.530> and
