impersonate<00:02:55.230> Solid<00:02:56.230> Snake<00:02:56.530> from<00:02:56.799> Metal<00:02:57.010> Gear

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
yeah my best advice is to do an

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.320 
yeah my best advice is to do an
impression<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.199> salt<00:05:23.410> snake<00:05:23.740> which<00:05:24.430> is<00:05:24.669> a<00:05:24.910> low

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
impression of salt snake which is a low

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.360 
impression of salt snake which is a low
so<00:05:25.840> growly<00:05:27.960> sort<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.110> sound<00:05:29.500> in<00:05:30.160> your<00:05:30.220> voice

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
so growly sort of sound in your voice

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.650

and<00:05:32.970> while<00:05:33.970> still<00:05:34.300> keeping<00:05:34.479> that<00:05:34.720> growl

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
and while still keeping that growl

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.140 
and while still keeping that growl
change<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.840> pitch<00:05:38.110> in<00:05:38.410> your<00:05:38.560> voice

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
from low to sort of higher and it kind

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.879 
from low to sort of higher and it kind
of<00:05:43.090> goes<00:05:43.240> nasally<00:05:43.780> just<00:05:44.470> a<00:05:44.560> little<00:05:44.770> bit

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
of goes nasally just a little bit

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.640 
of goes nasally just a little bit
nasally<00:05:45.600> I'm<00:05:46.600> naturally<00:05:46.990> very<00:05:47.440> nasally<00:05:49.320> so<00:05:50.320> it

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
nasally I'm naturally very nasally so it

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.360 
nasally I'm naturally very nasally so it
was<00:05:51.130> it's<00:05:51.520> kind<00:05:51.820> of<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:52.090> lot<00:05:52.690> simpler<00:05:53.020> for<00:05:53.139> me<00:05:53.380> so
