I want to give you guys a little bit of
a<00:00:54.090> guide<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> most<00:00:55.620> amount<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.920> kills

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
a guide to get the most amount of kills

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.979 
a guide to get the most amount of kills
in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> game<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.940> either<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
in the game so you can either have to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
in the game so you can either have to
play<00:00:58.260> styles<00:00:58.739> rushing<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.760> playing<00:01:00.180> passive

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
play styles rushing or playing passive

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.119 
play styles rushing or playing passive
now<00:01:00.809> playing<00:01:01.079> passage<00:01:01.530> usually<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:01.949> your

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
now playing passage usually get your

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
now playing passage usually get your
streaks<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.579> lot<00:01:02.820> easier<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> does<00:01:03.780> take

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
streaks a lot easier but it does take

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.990 
streaks a lot easier but it does take
longer<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.589> streak<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:05.790> one

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
longer to get your streak so that's one

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.609 
longer to get your streak so that's one
way<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.510> doing<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> cannot

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
way to go about doing it if you cannot

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.810 
way to go about doing it if you cannot
get<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.890> kill<00:01:08.070> streaks<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.640> you're<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
get your kill streaks but if you're a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.370 
get your kill streaks but if you're a
Russian<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.510> running<00:01:09.840> around<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
Russian you like running around and I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
Russian you like running around and I
think<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> best<00:01:11.040> play<00:01:11.310> style<00:01:11.610> because

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
think that's the best play style because

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.550 
think that's the best play style because
it's<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.600> more<00:01:12.750> fun<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.080> play<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.439> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's just more fun to play like that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
it's just more fun to play like that
it's<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:14.100> more<00:01:14.310> entertaining<00:01:14.880> for

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.490 
maps where people don't really have many
places<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.480> recommend<00:02:30.989> using<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
places to go I recommend using the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.770 
places to go I recommend using the
lodestar<00:02:32.100> than<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> VTOL<00:02:32.790> warship<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
lodestar than the VTOL warship and the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.449 
lodestar than the VTOL warship and the
swarm<00:02:34.080> because<00:02:34.410> those<00:02:34.950> are<00:02:35.069> all<00:02:35.190> pretty<00:02:35.340> much

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
swarm because those are all pretty much

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.130 
swarm because those are all pretty much
air<00:02:35.760> supports<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:36.870> pretty<00:02:37.020> much

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
air supports and they can pretty much

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.510 
air supports and they can pretty much
rain<00:02:37.440> down<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.830> enemy<00:02:38.069> as<00:02:38.190> they<00:02:38.340> don't

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
rain down on the enemy as they don't

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.309 
rain down on the enemy as they don't
have<00:02:38.610> anywhere<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.000> go<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.209> that's<00:02:40.050> what<00:02:40.290> I

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
have anywhere to go so that's what I

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.509 
have anywhere to go so that's what I
would<00:02:40.410> recommend<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.890> with<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.430> that

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
would recommend going with and that

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.550 
would recommend going with and that
works<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.180> good<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.480> drone<00:02:42.810> as<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.019> guys<00:02:43.170> saw<00:02:43.410> i

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
works so good on drone as you guys saw i

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.229 
works so good on drone as you guys saw i
think<00:02:43.769> i<00:02:43.800> was<00:02:43.920> using<00:02:44.069> in<00:02:44.430> my<00:02:44.580> yesterdays<00:02:45.209> game

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
think i was using in my yesterdays game

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.360 
think i was using in my yesterdays game
play<00:02:45.750> i<00:02:45.989> think<00:02:46.350> i<00:02:46.410> was<00:02:46.500> using<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.830> but

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
play i think i was using that but

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.040 
play i think i was using that but
instead<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.790> swore<00:02:48.000> much<00:02:48.150> using<00:02:48.420> dogs<00:02:48.690> which

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
instead of swore much using dogs which

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.660 
instead of swore much using dogs which
isn't<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> bad<00:02:49.709> thing<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.250> was<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> map

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
isn't a bad thing it was on the map

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.979 
isn't a bad thing it was on the map
drone<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.180> there's<00:02:51.330> some<00:02:51.540> buildings<00:02:51.870> that

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
drone and there's some buildings that

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.390 
drone and there's some buildings that
they<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.290> go<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:52.709> basically<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.280> whole

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
they can go on but basically the whole

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.160 
they can go on but basically the whole
point<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.819> dogs<00:02:54.060> why<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.720> would<00:02:54.959> want<00:02:54.989> to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
point of the dogs why you would want to

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.410 
point of the dogs why you would want to
use<00:02:55.230> those<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.890> if<00:02:56.160> there's<00:02:56.430> places<00:02:57.030> where<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
use those is if there's places where the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.729 
use those is if there's places where the
enemies<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.840> hide<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.019> dogs<00:02:58.380> will<00:02:58.530> pretty

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
enemies can hide the dogs will pretty

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.020 
enemies can hide the dogs will pretty
much<00:02:58.830> take<00:02:58.920> them<00:02:59.310> out<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.549> buildings<00:02:59.910> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
much take them out of the buildings and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.370 
much take them out of the buildings and
get<00:03:00.180> them<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.420> spawn<00:03:00.690> trap<00:03:00.989> where<00:03:01.200> your

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
get them in a spawn trap where your

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.990 
get them in a spawn trap where your
swamp<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.860> pretty<00:03:02.040> much<00:03:02.130> rain<00:03:02.459> down<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.700> them

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
swamp can pretty much rain down on them

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.550 
swamp can pretty much rain down on them
as<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.180> guys<00:03:03.330> see<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.690> game<00:03:03.900> play<00:03:04.140> I'm

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
as you guys see in this game play I'm

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.830 
as you guys see in this game play I'm
using<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:05.040> black<00:03:05.340> bear<00:03:05.580> dogs<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.299> then<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
using the black bear dogs and then the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.660 
using the black bear dogs and then the
swarm<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.950> works<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.310> well<00:03:08.430> together

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
swarm and it works really well together

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.520 
swarm and it works really well together
the<00:03:09.150> Blackbird<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.810> not<00:03:09.959> too<00:03:10.110> hard<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.410> get

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the Blackbird it's not too hard to get

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.380 
the Blackbird it's not too hard to get
because<00:03:10.680> lower<00:03:11.400> score<00:03:11.790> streak<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:12.299> get

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
because lower score streak you can get

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.150 
because lower score streak you can get
them<00:03:12.510> pretty<00:03:12.690> fast<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.260> once<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.890> pick<00:03:14.010> up

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
them pretty fast and once you pick up

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.860 
them pretty fast and once you pick up
your<00:03:14.250> blackbird<00:03:14.730> as<00:03:14.880> long<00:03:15.090> as<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.299> play<00:03:15.480> smart

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
your blackbird as long as you play smart

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.449 
your blackbird as long as you play smart
you<00:03:16.080> will<00:03:16.230> pretty<00:03:16.440> much<00:03:16.530> always<00:03:16.769> can<00:03:17.040> get<00:03:17.370> up

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
you will pretty much always can get up

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.340 
you will pretty much always can get up
to<00:03:17.610> swarm<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.239> that's<00:03:18.780> what<00:03:18.959> i<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.320> use

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
to swarm so that's what i like to use

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.890 
to swarm so that's what i like to use
sometimes<00:03:19.769> that's<00:03:20.280> better<00:03:20.579> for<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> map<00:03:21.870> that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
sometimes that's better for a map that

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.750 
sometimes that's better for a map that
has<00:03:22.170> some<00:03:22.709> buildings<00:03:23.010> for<00:03:23.160> people<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.459> go<00:03:23.579> in

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
has some buildings for people to go in

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.490 
has some buildings for people to go in
and<00:03:23.850> then<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.060> call<00:03:24.299> on<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.540> dogs<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.140> swarm

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
and then you call on your dogs and swarm

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.259 
and then you call on your dogs and swarm
usually<00:03:26.190> around<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.519> same<00:03:26.700> time<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.150> what

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
usually around the same time and what

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.210 
usually around the same time and what
will<00:03:27.420> happen<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.870> your<00:03:28.380> dogs<00:03:28.620> will<00:03:28.859> basically

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
will happen is your dogs will basically

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.680 
will happen is your dogs will basically
kill<00:03:29.579> all<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> people<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.329> buildings

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
kill all the people in the buildings

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.090 
kill all the people in the buildings
while<00:03:30.900> you're<00:03:31.049> swarming<00:03:31.530> kills<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.950> people

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
while you're swarming kills the people

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.069 
while you're swarming kills the people
that<00:03:32.400> are<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:32.760> spawning<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.480> they<00:03:33.870> kind

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
that are just spawning in so they kind

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.210 
that are just spawning in so they kind
of<00:03:34.109> work<00:03:34.260> together<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.799> helps<00:03:35.070> out<00:03:35.190> a

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
of work together and it helps out a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.370 
of work together and it helps out a
while<00:03:35.549> really<00:03:35.940> recommend<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.510> guys<00:03:36.660> screw
