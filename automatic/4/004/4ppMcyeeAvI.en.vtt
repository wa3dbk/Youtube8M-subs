00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.599 

I'm<00:00:05.569> the<00:00:05.750> project<00:00:05.960> engineer<00:00:06.649> so<00:00:07.069> I<00:00:07.100> work<00:00:07.399> out

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609 
I'm the project engineer so I work out

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.690 
I'm the project engineer so I work out
the<00:00:07.730> methodology<00:00:08.480> but<00:00:09.139> this<00:00:09.530> is<00:00:09.709> just<00:00:09.920> a<00:00:10.099> flat

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
the methodology but this is just a flat

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.150 
the methodology but this is just a flat
canvas<00:00:11.330> for<00:00:11.540> me<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:12.230> we<00:00:12.380> work<00:00:12.590> out<00:00:12.800> how<00:00:12.980> we're

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
canvas for me and we work out how we're

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.770 
canvas for me and we work out how we're
going<00:00:13.309> to<00:00:13.370> build<00:00:13.580> in<00:00:13.820> it<00:00:13.969> and<00:00:14.150> what<00:00:14.450> the<00:00:14.570> bridge

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
going to build in it and what the bridge

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.299 
going to build in it and what the bridge
is<00:00:14.929> going<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.170> look<00:00:15.320> like<00:00:15.349> so<00:00:15.860> we<00:00:15.980> just<00:00:16.130> have<00:00:16.279> to

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
is going to look like so we just have to

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.470 
is going to look like so we just have to
bridge<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:18.560> valley<00:00:18.800> here<00:00:19.239> we<00:00:20.239> worked

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
bridge the the valley here we worked

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.540 
bridge the the valley here we worked
with<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:20.750> designers<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:21.619> worked<00:00:22.220> out<00:00:22.399> the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
with the designers and worked out the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.929 
with the designers and worked out the
best<00:00:22.790> method<00:00:23.329> in<00:00:23.720> terms<00:00:23.960> of<00:00:24.169> krei<00:00:24.439> needs<00:00:24.939> what

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
best method in terms of krei needs what

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.810 
best method in terms of krei needs what
we<00:00:25.970> had<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.329> work<00:00:26.540> with<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.050> steep<00:00:27.320> terrain

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
we had to work with the steep terrain

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.549 
we had to work with the steep terrain
and<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:29.000> was<00:00:29.149> our<00:00:29.329> job<00:00:29.360> is<00:00:29.869> just<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.200> work<00:00:30.380> out

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:30.559 
and that was our job is just to work out

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.830 
and that was our job is just to work out
programs<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:31.430> if<00:00:31.849> it's<00:00:32.029> going<00:00:32.210> to<00:00:32.300> be<00:00:32.540> cost

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
programs and if it's going to be cost

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.540 
programs and if it's going to be cost
within<00:00:33.590> budget<00:00:34.180> well<00:00:35.180> this<00:00:35.360> is<00:00:35.510> my<00:00:35.690> office<00:00:36.550> on

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
within budget well this is my office on

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.950 
within budget well this is my office on
a<00:00:37.610> daily<00:00:38.060> basis<00:00:38.630> you'll<00:00:38.960> be<00:00:39.770> digging<00:00:40.010> out<00:00:40.310> here

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
a daily basis you'll be digging out here

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.200 
a daily basis you'll be digging out here
filling<00:00:41.960> back<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.320> buddies<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:43.790> breach<00:00:44.030> is

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
filling back to buddies the breach is

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.280 
filling back to buddies the breach is
almost<00:00:44.540> complete

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
almost complete

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.140 
almost complete
but<00:00:45.710> from<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.250> start<00:00:46.490> we<00:00:46.760> built<00:00:47.000> these

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
but from the start we built these

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.750 
but from the start we built these
precast<00:00:47.750> Peas<00:00:48.079> these<00:00:48.829> piers<00:00:49.220> are<00:00:49.400> just<00:00:49.579> like

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
precast Peas these piers are just like

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.880 
precast Peas these piers are just like
Lego<00:00:50.180> they're<00:00:50.780> built<00:00:50.960> on<00:00:51.079> top<00:00:51.290> of<00:00:51.350> each<00:00:51.620> other

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
Lego they're built on top of each other

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.210 
Lego they're built on top of each other
so<00:00:52.790> just<00:00:53.120> imagine<00:00:53.510> stacking<00:00:54.260> some<00:00:54.770> bricks<00:00:55.040> on

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
so just imagine stacking some bricks on

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.710 
so just imagine stacking some bricks on
top<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.489> each<00:00:55.610> other<00:00:55.790> that's<00:00:56.300> what<00:00:56.570> these

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
top of each other that's what these

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.450 
top of each other that's what these
piers<00:00:57.079> are<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.530> that's<00:00:57.620> what<00:00:57.890> holds<00:00:58.070> up<00:00:58.340> the

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
piers are and that's what holds up the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.990 
piers are and that's what holds up the
fruit<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:59.870> is<00:00:59.930> originally<00:01:00.470> a<00:01:00.530> creek<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.670> we

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
fruit this is originally a creek and we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.999 
fruit this is originally a creek and we
filled<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.420> in<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:03.230> occasionally<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:03.770> does

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
filled it in but occasionally it does

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.390 
filled it in but occasionally it does
flow<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.879> Melbourne<00:01:05.449> rain<00:01:06.370> over<00:01:07.370> the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
flow in the Melbourne rain over the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.870 
flow in the Melbourne rain over the
years<00:01:07.760> I've<00:01:08.060> worked<00:01:08.120> on<00:01:08.870> many<00:01:09.110> projects<00:01:09.880> from

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
years I've worked on many projects from

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.920 
years I've worked on many projects from
Melbourne<00:01:11.650> WI<00:01:12.650> up<00:01:13.040> at<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.280> Pilbara

travel and see a wide variety of

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.180 
travel and see a wide variety of
improvements<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.930> mean<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.799> can't<00:01:25.070> get
