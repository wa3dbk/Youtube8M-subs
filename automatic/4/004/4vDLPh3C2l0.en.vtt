00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
presentation what I mean by that is you

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.950 
presentation what I mean by that is you
want<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.920> cash<00:00:45.879> softly<00:00:46.450> so<00:00:46.629> that<00:00:46.750> your<00:00:46.840> fly

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
want to cash softly so that your fly

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.299 
want to cash softly so that your fly
just<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.320> lights<00:00:47.559> on<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:47.829> surface<00:00:48.129> of<00:00:48.219> the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
just the lights on the surface of the

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.130 
just the lights on the surface of the
water<00:00:48.489> you<00:00:49.000> need<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.270> choose<00:00:49.510> your<00:00:49.660> casting

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
water you need to choose your casting

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.529 
water you need to choose your casting
angle<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:51.039> that<00:00:51.250> your<00:00:51.670> line<00:00:51.850> isn't<00:00:52.059> spooking

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
angle so that your line isn't spooking

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:53.970 
angle so that your line isn't spooking
the<00:00:52.600> fish<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.140> also<00:00:53.440> need<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.770> achieve

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
the fish and you also need to achieve

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.130 
the fish and you also need to achieve
what's<00:00:54.370> called<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.640> drag<00:00:54.850> free<00:00:55.120> drift<00:00:55.449> so<00:00:56.020> that

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
what's called a drag free drift so that

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.930 
what's called a drag free drift so that
your<00:00:56.260> fly<00:00:56.410> is<00:00:56.469> naturally<00:00:57.129> drifting<00:00:57.520> down<00:00:57.699> the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
your fly is naturally drifting down the

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.340 
your fly is naturally drifting down the
current<00:00:58.120> just<00:00:58.600> like<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:58.930> was<00:00:59.110> a<00:00:59.140> natural

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
current just like it was a natural

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.560 
current just like it was a natural
insect<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.719> I<00:01:02.109> have<00:01:02.649> this<00:01:02.800> Boulder<00:01:03.160> here<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:03.609> I

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
insect so I have this Boulder here and I

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.200 
insect so I have this Boulder here and I
think<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:04.930> trout<00:01:05.140> is<00:01:05.350> laying<00:01:05.649> just<00:01:06.000> behind<00:01:07.000> it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
think a trout is laying just behind it

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.080 
think a trout is laying just behind it
it's<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.990> good-looking<00:01:08.289> lie<00:01:08.640> I've<00:01:09.640> got<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> nice

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
it's a good-looking lie I've got a nice

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.150 
it's a good-looking lie I've got a nice
soft<00:01:10.360> current<00:01:11.110> where<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.350> Boulder<00:01:11.710> kind<00:01:12.070> of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
soft current where the Boulder kind of

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.490 
soft current where the Boulder kind of
breaks<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.520> current<00:01:12.729> I've<00:01:13.330> got<00:01:13.539> some<00:01:13.750> it's<00:01:14.410> a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
breaks the current I've got some it's a

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.230 
breaks the current I've got some it's a
good<00:01:14.679> place<00:01:14.890> for<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.130> fish<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.459> feed<00:01:15.670> because

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
good place for the fish to feed because

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.760 
good place for the fish to feed because
you<00:01:16.330> got<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.569> fast<00:01:16.840> current<00:01:17.200> coming<00:01:17.500> next<00:01:17.619> to

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
you got that fast current coming next to

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.400 
you got that fast current coming next to
the<00:01:17.890> slow<00:01:18.069> current<00:01:18.429> where<00:01:19.289> insects<00:01:20.289> will

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
the slow current where insects will

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.719 
the slow current where insects will
drift<00:01:20.590> down<00:01:20.770> just<00:01:21.069> like<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.220> little<00:01:21.399> conveyor

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
drift down just like a little conveyor

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.790 
drift down just like a little conveyor
belt<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.179> what<00:01:22.420> I'm<00:01:22.539> gonna<00:01:22.720> try<00:01:22.929> to<00:01:22.990> do<00:01:23.170> is

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
belt and what I'm gonna try to do is

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.040 
belt and what I'm gonna try to do is
cast<00:01:24.190> right<00:01:24.910> up<00:01:25.090> onto<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.330> conveyor<00:01:25.780> belt

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
cast right up onto that conveyor belt

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.020 
cast right up onto that conveyor belt
and<00:01:26.470> allow<00:01:26.679> my<00:01:26.860> fly<00:01:27.099> to<00:01:27.160> just<00:01:27.429> drift<00:01:27.670> into<00:01:27.940> the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
and allow my fly to just drift into the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.139 
and allow my fly to just drift into the
fish's<00:01:28.300> viewing<00:01:28.599> window<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.340> first<00:01:30.580> thing<00:01:30.849> I

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
fish's viewing window the first thing I

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.749 
fish's viewing window the first thing I
need<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.750> do<00:01:31.990> make<00:01:32.709> sure<00:01:32.740> I'm<00:01:32.920> casting<00:01:33.429> from

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
need to do make sure I'm casting from

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.510 
need to do make sure I'm casting from
the<00:01:34.270> right<00:01:34.479> angle<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.920> I've<00:01:36.099> chosen<00:01:36.280> a

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
the right angle here I've chosen a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.999 
the right angle here I've chosen a
downstream<00:01:37.060> position<00:01:37.569> so<00:01:38.050> that<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.440> just<00:01:38.830> off

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
downstream position so that and just off

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.219 
downstream position so that and just off
to<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.280> side<00:01:39.459> so<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:39.880> when<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.030> cast<00:01:40.360> my<00:01:40.989> fly

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
to the side so that when I cast my fly

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.830 
to the side so that when I cast my fly
line<00:01:41.440> isn't<00:01:41.590> spooking<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.099> fish<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.450> second

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
line isn't spooking the fish the second

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.570 
line isn't spooking the fish the second
thing<00:01:43.959> I'm<00:01:44.080> going<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.229> do<00:01:44.380> make<00:01:45.190> sure<00:01:45.220> when<00:01:45.550> I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
thing I'm going to do make sure when I

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.020 
thing I'm going to do make sure when I
cast<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.300> stop<00:01:46.929> high<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:48.069> that<00:01:48.220> my<00:01:48.369> fly<00:01:48.640> just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
cast I stop high so that my fly just

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.850 
cast I stop high so that my fly just
just<00:01:49.569> a<00:01:49.810> lights<00:01:50.020> on<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.349> surface<00:01:50.679> of<00:01:50.800> the

just a lights on the surface of the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
water rather than splashing down I want

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.449 
water rather than splashing down I want
to<00:01:53.110> make<00:01:53.229> sure<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.560> my<00:01:53.709> fly<00:01:53.920> line<00:01:54.130> fully

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
to make sure that my fly line fully

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.639 
to make sure that my fly line fully
extends<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:55.569> that<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.869> I<00:01:56.050> don't<00:01:56.229> get<00:01:56.349> a<00:01:56.380> sloppy

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
extends so that it I don't get a sloppy

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.520 
extends so that it I don't get a sloppy
cast<00:01:57.069> and<00:01:57.369> scoop<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.700> fish<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:59.050> order<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.380> do

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
cast and scoop the fish in order to do

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.520 
cast and scoop the fish in order to do
that<00:01:59.709> all<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:01.810> going<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:01.959> do<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.170> make<00:02:02.349> sure<00:02:02.380> I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
that all I'm going to do is make sure I

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.800 
that all I'm going to do is make sure I
stop<00:02:02.830> high<00:02:03.069> so<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.489> line<00:02:03.700> extends<00:02:04.690> out

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
stop high so the line extends out

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.559 
stop high so the line extends out
normally<00:02:05.289> and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.700> once<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.030> fly<00:02:07.209> hits<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
normally and then once the fly hits the

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.499 
normally and then once the fly hits the
water<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:08.110> just<00:02:08.800> allow<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.489> drift<00:02:09.789> naturally

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
water I just allow it to drift naturally

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.830 
water I just allow it to drift naturally
through<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> fish's<00:02:11.890> viewing<00:02:12.220> window<00:02:12.840> just

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
through the fish's viewing window just

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.979 
through the fish's viewing window just
like<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.970> there<00:02:15.970> are<00:02:16.060> many<00:02:16.239> ways<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.690> achieve<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
like so there are many ways to achieve a

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.170 
like so there are many ways to achieve a
drag<00:02:17.290> free<00:02:17.530> drift<00:02:17.830> one<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.550> them<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.790> mending

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
drag free drift one of them is mending

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.790 
drag free drift one of them is mending
which<00:02:19.330> we'll<00:02:19.510> talk<00:02:19.660> about<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.200> then<00:02:20.650> in

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
which we'll talk about and then in

which we'll talk about and then in
another<00:02:20.920> segment

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
another segment

another segment
the<00:02:22.480> way<00:02:22.630> I've<00:02:22.810> chosen<00:02:23.140> here<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:24.070> just<00:02:24.310> my

the way I've chosen here it's just my

choosing my casting position wisely

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.370 
choosing my casting position wisely
because<00:02:27.100> I'm<00:02:27.630> presenting<00:02:28.630> from<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.900> downstream

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380

through the current without any drag if
I<00:02:38.800> had<00:02:38.920> chosen<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.459> different<00:02:39.880> angle<00:02:40.030> say<00:02:40.570> a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
I had chosen a different angle say a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.780 
I had chosen a different angle say a

cross stream or upstream my fly might
drag<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.300> current<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:43.900> the

drag in the current but in the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730

on<00:02:45.910> my<00:02:46.030> fly<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.570> can<00:02:47.080> present<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.590> with<00:02:47.709> the
