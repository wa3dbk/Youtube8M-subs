00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.280 

so<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.790> next<00:00:06.000> thing<00:00:06.690> I'm<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.020> look<00:00:07.109> at

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
so the next thing I'm going to look at

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.669 
so the next thing I'm going to look at
is<00:00:07.440> how<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.710> go<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:08.010> slicing<00:00:08.730> your<00:00:08.849> files

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
is how you go about slicing your files

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.900 
is how you go about slicing your files
now<00:00:10.679> you've<00:00:10.800> really<00:00:10.980> got<00:00:11.099> two<00:00:11.309> choices<00:00:11.580> here

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
now you've really got two choices here

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.060 
now you've really got two choices here
you<00:00:12.240> can<00:00:12.420> use<00:00:12.660> make<00:00:12.990> aware<00:00:13.290> which<00:00:13.469> comes<00:00:13.830> from

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
you can use make aware which comes from

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.180 
you can use make aware which comes from
MakerBot<00:00:14.750> or<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.109> use<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.590> open<00:00:16.920> source

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190

replicator<00:00:17.910> G<00:00:18.380> now<00:00:19.490> make<00:00:20.490> aware<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> product

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
replicator G now make aware is a product

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.720 
replicator G now make aware is a product
that's<00:00:21.840> designed<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.560> simplify<00:00:22.980> everything

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
that's designed to simplify everything

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.420 
that's designed to simplify everything
so<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.539> put<00:00:25.470> your<00:00:25.500> organise

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
so that you can just put your organise

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.630 
so that you can just put your organise
your<00:00:27.080> parts<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.260> print<00:00:28.529> them<00:00:28.650> whereas

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
your parts and print them whereas

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.939 
your parts and print them whereas
replicated<00:00:30.269> G<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.050> more<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.500> something<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
replicated G is more of something that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.910 
replicated G is more of something that
you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.279> tweak<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.210> experience<00:00:33.920> make

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920

aware<00:00:35.570> allows<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.260> reliably<00:00:38.129> print<00:00:39.500> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
aware allows you to reliably print and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.990 
aware allows you to reliably print and
slice<00:00:40.980> quickly<00:00:42.079> medium<00:00:43.079> resolution<00:00:44.000> objects

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
slice quickly medium resolution objects

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.810 
slice quickly medium resolution objects
so<00:00:45.570> even<00:00:45.809> using<00:00:46.110> miracle<00:00:46.590> grew<00:00:46.800> down<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.370> say

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
so even using miracle grew down to say

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.610 
so even using miracle grew down to say
about<00:00:48.079> 0.15<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.500> mil<00:00:51.590> or<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.460> 0.2<00:00:54.180> is

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
about 0.15 of a mil or you know 0.2 is

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.750 
about 0.15 of a mil or you know 0.2 is
quite<00:00:55.620> acceptable<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.340> you'll<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.550> good

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
quite acceptable and you'll get good

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670 
quite acceptable and you'll get good
results<00:00:57.239> it'll<00:00:57.449> slice<00:00:57.750> quickly<00:00:58.230> it'll<00:00:58.440> print

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
results it'll slice quickly it'll print

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.240 
results it'll slice quickly it'll print
well<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.980> down

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
well but if you want to get right down

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.469 
well but if you want to get right down

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.860 
I've got some profiles online where
we're<00:02:22.710> getting<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.280> close<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.610> getting

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
we're getting pretty close to getting

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.180 
we're getting pretty close to getting
the<00:02:24.870> kind<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.140> results<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.620> work<00:02:25.920> for

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the kind of results that work for

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.540 
the kind of results that work for
everybody<00:02:27.890> once<00:02:28.890> you've<00:02:29.010> got<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> dialed<00:02:29.459> in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
everybody once you've got a dialed in

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.160 
everybody once you've got a dialed in
you<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.910> don't<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> change<00:02:30.840> very

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you really don't have to change very

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.770 
you really don't have to change very
much<00:02:31.230> other<00:02:31.590> than<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.220> filament<00:02:32.760> diameter<00:02:32.970> so

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
much other than the filament diameter so

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.910 
much other than the filament diameter so
one<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.080> things<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.350> said<00:02:34.530> earlier<00:02:34.860> of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
one of the things I said earlier of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.230 
one of the things I said earlier of
course<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.520> filament<00:02:36.030> diameter

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
course is that the filament diameter

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.680 
course is that the filament diameter
really<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.050> just<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.530> starting<00:02:38.040> point<00:02:38.690> you've

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
really is just a starting point you've

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.300 
really is just a starting point you've
really<00:02:39.930> got<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.200> be<00:02:40.380> able<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.830> look<00:02:41.040> at<00:02:41.190> your

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
really got to be able to look at your

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.390 
really got to be able to look at your
print<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.530> look<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> quality<00:02:44.250> that's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
print and look at the quality that's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.940 
print and look at the quality that's
coming<00:02:44.790> out<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> diagnose<00:02:45.690> whether<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
coming out and diagnose whether the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.050 
coming out and diagnose whether the
diameter<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.130> measured<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.730> entered

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
diameter that you measured and entered

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.670 
diameter that you measured and entered
is<00:02:51.180> actually<00:02:51.630> right<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.140> you're<00:02:52.320> putting<00:02:52.500> out

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
is actually right if you're putting out

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.160 
is actually right if you're putting out
too<00:02:52.890> much<00:02:53.070> plastic<00:02:53.370> you'll<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.690> increase

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
too much plastic you'll have to increase

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.580 
too much plastic you'll have to increase
the<00:02:55.410> diameter<00:02:55.620> slightly<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.590> by

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the diameter slightly and it can be by

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.670 
the diameter slightly and it can be by
small<00:02:58.920> amounts<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.459> point<00:02:59.760> O<00:03:00.320> two<00:03:01.320> of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
small amounts like point O two of

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.310 
small amounts like point O two of
millimeter<00:03:02.270> can<00:03:03.270> make<00:03:03.480> quite<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.840> difference

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
millimeter can make quite a difference

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.199 
millimeter can make quite a difference
in<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> print<00:03:04.890> qualities<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.910> quite

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
in the print qualities it's quite

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.690 
in the print qualities it's quite
amazing<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.830> if<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.070> really<00:03:08.370> out<00:03:08.489> you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
amazing and if it's really out you

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.840 
amazing and if it's really out you
probably<00:03:09.000> need<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.270> go<00:03:09.390> like<00:03:09.570> 0.05<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.610> mil

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
probably need to go like 0.05 of a mil

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.670 
probably need to go like 0.05 of a mil
in<00:03:12.150> order<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> correct<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.930> serious<00:03:13.440> problem

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
in order to correct a serious problem

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680 
in order to correct a serious problem
with<00:03:13.920> too<00:03:13.980> much<00:03:14.220> plastic<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.209> what<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.390> tend

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
with too much plastic and so what I tend

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.840 
with too much plastic and so what I tend
to<00:03:15.750> do<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.170> once<00:03:16.799> I've<00:03:17.010> got<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> setting<00:03:17.700> I'll

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
to do is once I've got a setting I'll

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.080 
to do is once I've got a setting I'll
actually<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.600> that's<00:03:18.870> working<00:03:19.140> for<00:03:19.590> me<00:03:19.769> for

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
actually that that's working for me for

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.259 
actually that that's working for me for
a<00:03:21.090> particular<00:03:21.510> reel<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.320> PLA<00:03:23.000> I've<00:03:24.000> got<00:03:24.239> a

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
a particular reel of PLA I've got a

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.289 
a particular reel of PLA I've got a
paint<00:03:24.690> marker<00:03:25.530> which<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.519> here<00:03:27.000> which<00:03:27.150> will

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
paint marker which is here which will

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.650 
paint marker which is here which will
write<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.080> about<00:03:28.170> anything<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.630> I

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
write on just about anything and so I

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.820 
write on just about anything and so I
write<00:03:31.500> on<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.769> reel<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:33.230> dimensions<00:03:34.230> that

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
write on the reel the dimensions that

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.949 
write on the reel the dimensions that
work<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.459> if<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.640> now<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.630> was<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
work and if it's now if that was the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.720 
work and if it's now if that was the
measured<00:03:37.320> dimension<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:37.980> it's<00:03:38.100> no<00:03:38.280> good<00:03:38.519> and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
measured dimension and it's no good and

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.610 
measured dimension and it's no good and
I<00:03:38.760> actually<00:03:38.910> need<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.209> correct<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.750> I'll<00:03:39.870> cross

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
I actually need to correct it I'll cross

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.039 
I actually need to correct it I'll cross
that<00:03:40.829> out<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.610> write<00:03:42.360> on<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.630> corrected

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
that out and and write on the corrected

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.960 
that out and and write on the corrected
one<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:45.019> when<00:03:46.019> I'm<00:03:46.170> printing<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:47.610> don't

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
one so that when I'm printing I don't

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.090 
one so that when I'm printing I don't
have<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.150> keep<00:03:48.360> stuffing<00:03:49.350> around<00:03:49.680> trying<00:03:50.010> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
have to keep stuffing around trying to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.789 
have to keep stuffing around trying to
actually<00:03:50.220> find<00:03:50.700> though<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.360> actual<00:03:51.900> diameter

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
actually find though the actual diameter

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.220 
actually find though the actual diameter
that<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.310> should<00:03:53.519> be<00:03:53.670> using<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.810> order<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.079> get

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
that I should be using in order to get

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.190 
that I should be using in order to get
reliable<00:03:55.470> prints<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.329> you've<00:03:57.450> got<00:03:57.630> parts

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
reliable prints so if you've got parts

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.660 
reliable prints so if you've got parts
that<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.190> want<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.489> print<00:03:59.790> regularly<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:01.670> you

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
that you want to print regularly and you

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.310 
that you want to print regularly and you
want<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.940> print<00:04:03.180> them<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.480> different<00:04:03.690> colors

one of the problems you're going to run

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.060 
one of the problems you're going to run
into<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.570> of<00:04:06.750> course<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.260> you've<00:04:07.709> got<00:04:07.950> to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
into is of course that you've got to

would<00:04:24.150> figure<00:04:24.720> out<00:04:24.840> what<00:04:25.260> your

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
would figure out what your

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.790 
would figure out what your
seek<00:04:26.150> filament<00:04:27.150> diameters<00:04:27.689> are<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:28.199> in<00:04:28.620> the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
seek filament diameters are in in the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800 
seek filament diameters are in in the
filament<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.400> you've<00:04:29.550> got<00:04:29.819> so<00:04:30.270> mine<00:04:30.539> for

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
filament that you've got so mine for

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.469 
filament that you've got so mine for
instance<00:04:30.900> are<00:04:31.319> about<00:04:31.789> 1.8<00:04:34.009> 1.75<00:04:35.009> and<00:04:35.280> 1.7<00:04:36.270> that

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
instance are about 1.8 1.75 and 1.7 that

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.249 
instance are about 1.8 1.75 and 1.7 that
pretty<00:04:37.169> much<00:04:37.289> covers<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.919> range<00:04:39.229> what<00:04:40.229> I

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
pretty much covers the range what I

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.230 
pretty much covers the range what I
would<00:04:40.500> do<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:41.189> I<00:04:41.460> would<00:04:41.490> export<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.599> x3g<00:04:43.469> file

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
would do is I would export the x3g file

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.059 
would do is I would export the x3g file
slice<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.629> each<00:04:45.780> one<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.110> those<00:04:46.289> diameters<00:04:46.949> and

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
slice to each one of those diameters and

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.390 
slice to each one of those diameters and
actually<00:04:47.430> add<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:47.669> number<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.569> the<00:04:48.930> filename

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
actually add that number to the filename

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.670 
actually add that number to the filename
so<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.520> when<00:04:50.639> you<00:04:50.759> pull<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.180> up<00:04:51.270> in<00:04:51.539> on<00:04:52.469> the

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
so that when you pull it up in on the

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.800 
so that when you pull it up in on the
MakerBot<00:04:53.569> you<00:04:54.569> can<00:04:54.919> choose<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.250> right<00:04:56.810> file

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
MakerBot you can choose the right file

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.709 
MakerBot you can choose the right file
to<00:04:58.259> run<00:04:58.439> for<00:04:59.069> the<00:04:59.219> particular<00:04:59.550> filament<00:05:00.330> that

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
to run for the particular filament that

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.980 
to run for the particular filament that
you've<00:05:00.900> currently<00:05:01.289> got<00:05:01.500> loaded<00:05:02.990> otherwise

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
you've currently got loaded otherwise

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.439 
you've currently got loaded otherwise
you've<00:05:04.409> got<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.710> basically<00:05:05.279> run<00:05:05.819> at<00:05:05.969> each<00:05:06.090> time

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
you've got to basically run at each time

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.889 
you've got to basically run at each time
which<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:07.080> think<00:05:07.349> can<00:05:07.529> get<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> bit<00:05:07.860> annoying
