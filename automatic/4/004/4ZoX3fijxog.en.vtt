 called vs dollar old man i 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.980
 used two different sizes 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.250
 principle, you can do with one size 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.930
 what you get and wide sticks 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.440
 we are 15 cm by 1.7 cm for small 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.490
 sticks of their size is not written but clean 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.130
 visually and not see and shorter and two 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.960
 times already 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.810
 we also need either moment glue 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.380
 either here is such a hot glue with 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.910
 a gun and if you want furniture 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.190
 paint then you will also need 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.860
 acrylic paints but i didn't paint 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.700
 defended everything just wooden at first 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.720
 we make a table I take 6 wide large 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.659
 my sticks and glue them small 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.370
 thin chopsticks across so that 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.100
 turned out the tabletop 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.130
 soot dolls trying on at what height and 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.710
 I make the table this height and do 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.690
 table legs for that I take such 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.670
 here are the sticks you can use the same 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.060
 the very sticks that we did 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.740
 countertop I take separately tidy 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.270
 measuring sticks I need height and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 cutting off can break their hands because 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 that they are pretty thin 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.890
 or you can use such nippers and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.060
 the flat side where it is exactly sawed off 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.810
 100 leave to stand on the floor and stick 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.610
 gonna be jagged edge to the tabletop and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.709
 now I will glue with hot glue 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.540
 all four sticks are symmetrical exactly and i 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.060
 I will make an additional crossbar q to 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.200
 legs did not disperse and also hot 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:37.239
 glue glue another wand at the very 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.610
 the grounds are all a table ready now we will 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.130
 do a high chair I did two high chairs 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.920
 first chairs did eye on the doll 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.440
 2 already measured at the finished 100 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.440
 boy first we do the back of the chair 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.080
 and here it is, I have seven bases 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.910
 half centimeters i.e. we measure 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.410
 Xia centimeters from the flames I snapped 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.630
 I cut these sticks with scissors 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.690
 now to make the back and stick 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.209
 sticks on this here and I have 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.350
 they will be of different heights to create 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.350
 such effect of a chair 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.870
 if you want to 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.390
 and chopsticks was super smooth style 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.250
 then mark in pencil where you want 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.770
 stick each stick 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.080
 either on the eyes 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.960
 first glue the edges then the center and already 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.180
 then the remaining sticks still to back 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.960
 I somehow did not move and sticks 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.990
 held out better I still did the transverse 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.940
 stick already glued hot glue and 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.910
 that's how it looks back is ready 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.950
 now make a seat for this i 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.140
 I cut two more sticks along the splines 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.960
 centimeters and stick them 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.930
 perpendicular to the back of the chair and then 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.260
 already on top as a shop so one for 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.120
 another glue six more sticks and 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.300
 6 again 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.190
 same 70 centimeters too for 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.400
 to paste here directly 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.010
 Seats where the doll will sit that's all 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.950
 now i need to make legs i take two 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.340
 sticks and stick them like this 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.209
 I cross - measure beforehand 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.290
 doll what height chair do I want and 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.560
 in a certain way at what angle 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.650
 make this cross and paste everything 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.930
 the main thing is that this type of christ is two 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.510
 cross for can be absolutely 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.850
 identical at one angle absolutely 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.800
