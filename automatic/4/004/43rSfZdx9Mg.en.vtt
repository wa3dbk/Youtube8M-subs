00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.660
 hi everyone so here mister x 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.850
 what 77 that will introduce you to a base 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.610
 so that means I do not stop 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.410
 the videos I thought stop but seen 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.270
 that youtube did not do anything I stop 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.800
 not so so here is a small base so 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.070
 that I wanted to film it quickly because 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 I have an idea in mind so I want 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.280
 to quickly destroy it to make it a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.329
 another so I'll quickly you filmed 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.910
 Christmas then I have a little money 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.770
 I have not used it yet I have just 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.880
 bought a new office 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.460
 so my office is much bigger 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.680
 that is, it is a plate more 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.480
 just bought a plate in fact that's it and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.280
 then it goes beyond that on both sides 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.960
 so my office becomes a lot more 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.810
 large much longer 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.790
 so that's to say that before 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.729
 I was on three plates one two three 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.810
 now I am on four plates 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.909
 that is, I now have the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.299
 beige 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.549
 that is to say here is the ag of beige 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.689
 so I used all monbeig before 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.280
 I did not use falling I could do 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.899
 a small drop but good now I 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 am everyone is for the four 4 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.369
 pages bought I think I think go 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.579
 at rigaud store of the eu the valois father 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.450
 and next week so here is so 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.139
 we will start a spider droid the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.240
 tank so always but the same beam 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:46.439
 a droid that landed the other 8 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.729
 so this battle of the nabot so there 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.920
 a small drop of derb end of 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.950
 foliage all I like it makes it makes 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.579
 although a small drop of land as 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.240
 great that I go to the ground 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.310
 this ship that I never put the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.450
 jelly me with barcamps feeds more 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.399
 his droids the daury battles that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.829
 come down from behind finally for a 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.440
 Once I have a little change we we going to the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.190
 droid his battlefield and droid 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.790
 my missile launcher had a funny spear 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.459
 rockets 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.260
 a second reigned who lost his 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.439
 paw 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.390
 so fucked up a little brothel underneath 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:29.980
 here is the taunt droid with a small 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:33.769
 military a second like that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.620
 destroyed then after we pass there is more 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.940
 nothing there so I left a space when 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.159
 even quite important but spa budget of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.019
 spaces are almost glued are in 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.510
 anyway the same but peeled isa 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.720
 people it comes back so we get done in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.459
 my filming space so that's short I 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.609
 mean I left a big space 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.310
 before base it to Taiwan from far enough 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.760
 I think have left a bigger the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.980
 next time so there are two clones of which 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.310
 kg behind a motorcycle everything was reversed on the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.670
 cloud piloting who died clones 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:13.840
 who come out of the base with the jedi the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:18.970
 legate target chip with cody soldiers 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:23.239
 here's a pilot clown after a wall 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.199
 like these all along and the belgian 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.669
 because I wanted to change a little 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.000
 sounded but everything is ok I put a little 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.790
 Belgian 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.739
 it's a spider so the two 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.640
 dead six dead a clown who shoots a 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.470
 dying the salt worker 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.310

 amateur vehicles it's white like 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:58.430
 you can see it 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.840
 this is the first time I think yes that I wanted 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.819

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.370
 in there so little guen who is 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.520
 going out a strong like 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.640
 it was the sliding you tried 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.380
 until the end I find it pretty good 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.510
 succeeded after I put beige like that 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.630
 you do not bg I put small 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.240
 grids and in fact one is put on my

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.150
 I want to admire him for 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.150

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.630
 here I put a wall up to 3 a 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.320
 little thing like that 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:45.400
 colors of the grids these details a 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.750
 little with a double climb from the wall to 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.640
 inside and then after bah it's the 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:54.150
 plate directly 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:55.570
 so here is the ship with heart 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:02.770
 this is my day 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:05.080
 a ship with bottles of 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.640
 Clooney arf trooper I cross and his 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.470
 comic book any kind I use it 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.970
 sniper ghosn that resulted in 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.190
 computers at inter I put nobody 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.510
 inside very small at my post in 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.670
 do it's a forward and it's just 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.870
 history of control and cannons for 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.750
 for the purposes of the outpost a track two 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.240
 feet and often does it's a kind of 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.630
 garage to tidy the ships be a 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.900
 before attacked post is a girl the 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:35.950
 stuff for gasoline 1 for a motorcycle 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.860
 jet little droid that gilles in the 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.250
 advent calendar 2013 I find it 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.440
 well then beauvau there when I made the 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:49.750
 turn so I wanted to say before we get 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.090
 leave it is that I had I ordered 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.100
 at Christmas so my new office I had 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.560
 money I'm going to remake a body 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.690
 gaberic since you saw my office nor 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.250
 there is no plate but I could 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.490
 still space in my thunes so 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.600
 I bought plates why I 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.540
 do two boxes like that 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.620
 it's past that actually if you want 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.540
 I had plates 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.770
 that's how they are not at all 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.480
 aesthetic it's platters that goes up 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.770
 So I have suddenly bought out 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.690
 plates because there is a plate of 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.860
 roots and I covered everything in white 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.180
 because I wanted it to be gray but 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.540
 it's my road signs this opens 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:27.890
 is not aesthetic at all so I have 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:30.350
 redeemed plates bought it bus I 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:34.490
 believe to be his in who was packed 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.340
 oddly fingered but otherwise that's so 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.280
 that's twelve slams 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:44.770
 So here we are, thank you for listening to me 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.770
 who I tell you next time
