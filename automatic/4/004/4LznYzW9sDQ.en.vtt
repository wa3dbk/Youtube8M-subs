00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.500
 cassez martín here taking the measure 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.420
 it's not like we're going to make a glove 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.840
 shaker so let's see the list 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.840
 of materials 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.980
 for the shaken glove we need 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:27.190
 felt yarn needle yarn and today it goes to 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.040
 be a success 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.870
 you have to patent the good we're going to 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.660
 upload them to facebook also the mold and 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.280
 if not good, it's not a science thing 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.470
 complicated in fact the one we had 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.410
 seen after square but we 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.700
 We decided to add more cream to our 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.280
 I'm going to cut it a bit more 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.320
 small because it is very big 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.629
 so that I can mark it simple from a 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.760
 crack because if not our hand is going 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.920
 to enter 90 there is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.129
 it is here 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.129
 we have to make three like the gloves 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.110
 for kitchen that we once did 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.060
 as well 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.910
 and remember to take advantage of all the material 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.780
 that they have from the edge we 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.280
 we are to spend less is to give you the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.660
 say what has to be a little bit 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.230
 bigger because at the time of the 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.230
 cut 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.470
 fold in three and we cut it or 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.040
 double also not to be 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.880
 it's like that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.880
 there is 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:42.580
 to give you the different destinations by 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:44.550
 there yes please no yes but no these are 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.180
 as 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.510
 Kindergarten really what 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.620
 need if they are here is to say the 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.620
 brand but why 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.410
 because the idea is that we're going to do as 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.230
 if it was a sandwich with 32 loaves and the 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.850
 middle part will go just 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.870
 this is what will help us shake 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.599
 that is this part of the ribbon 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.909
 then we are going to make a glove more than 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.459
 is going to go inside and in it we are going to paste or 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.260
 they can be can be between them go 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.049
 hitting this we no longer need with the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.670
 another one of the two options if 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.250
 they want it more I need it for that from 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.090
 the shake and this rúa because if you put 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.590
 the previous one and you do not want your more 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.569
 we can paste it in that and nothing else 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.390
 we put and hit if what we're going 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.209
 doing is what I'm going to do this one more 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.340
 thin to stick them in this and nothing 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.190
 more I do not know how we covered it with what 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.569
 that you did martín goes of látex now 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.510
 in tunisia but to put 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.150
 I'm going to hit on the good ones because 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.580
 they have the good things but I 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.850
 I think for him 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.580
 I'm going to cut into pieces 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.960
 the stamen were already waiting for them 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.270
 same position staying here and then you 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.850
 we put over nothing before doing to 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.540
 so it is more 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.700
 He went high tougher and look I'm going 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.730
 to put silicone and the sign again 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:30.360
 shake shake shake the town that has 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.360
 sand is not wind 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.680
 I keep cutting him because so that 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.650
 shake well you have to have 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.470
 substances 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.980
 he has to have enough crime 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.840
 this hunger because here with gift 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.600
 donated if the little eye fell off the king 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.150
 the king of the album we are going to make a 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.820
 contest to see who of the staff but not 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.070
 I did not see it, do not wait because 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.070
 band for like in the top 3 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.430
 rené pérez is not an innocent 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:23.790
 God's plan to be incapable of not 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.790
 has cochambres is a good samaritan 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.350
 because millán 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.200
 man 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.200
 I'm going to ibai, let's go bushy 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.699
 is very nice is very useful because for 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.280
 have it in the car and without being a 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.680
 little wool in the corner goes to another 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.690
 situation where as some exact what 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.529
 they can wash and you can watson 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.519
 'workshop' with its glove 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.519
 Now this 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.500
 come on I help you to hit so that it comes 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.830
 has come to be smaller the 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.350
 more longest guys of all as you 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.360
 want 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:19.810
 to you when you like the level 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:22.990
 men is not what wave 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.580
 what were you thinking then let's see the 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.849
 step by step it 's early for those 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.849
 questions 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.820
 way of processing with the help of 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.950
 clay draws the glove mold over the 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.140
 Felt folded as you can 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.640
 get three pieces and cut out with the 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.860
 stamen forms many strips of 10 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.450
 centimeters that cut out the already 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.430
 that you have with two pieces that will form 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.020
 the glove begins to put the slats 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.020
 between them and one of the possible 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.930
 now so let's shake with the 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.930
 hairy hand 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:03.490
 of the horror stories today mommy ay 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:07.150
 mamita mamita is and we already sealed since 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:11.490
 fast, how fast easy are the 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.490
 cleaning tools that creative 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.779
 to do it with intensity 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.350
 and we are going to cover with this one that 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.810
 cover it on this side that was like the 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.970
 many others and nothing we can 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.120
 approach screaming but you will see with my 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.520
 face with another color no if it could be 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.330
 but since we only have red red 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.330
 where will it be 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.540
 they have been left of the craft 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:55.320
 Christmas 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:07:00.210
 but after santaclós for the cover 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:02.240
 from the bathroom of santa clos for santa 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.240
 claus 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.550
 Now if you go, come what has dust 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.200
 so there is no fault since this one 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:21.570
 here the table like to stay a little bit 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.570
 it's a good shake please quote 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:30.100
 but then there they put all their things 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:32.680
 I do not know what I can move him and what not 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.060
 not that I do not know less big but good 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.860
 while I keep cleaning the forum that 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.150
 you think we're going to a cut 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.150
 commercial and we come back with more
