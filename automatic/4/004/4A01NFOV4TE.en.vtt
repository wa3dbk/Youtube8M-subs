ingrained in our family culture and then

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.460 
ingrained in our family culture and then
when<00:01:03.000> medical<00:01:03.420> school<00:01:03.809> started<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
when medical school started it was a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899 
when medical school started it was a
little<00:01:04.589> bit<00:01:04.769> harder<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> stay<00:01:05.339> connected<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
little bit harder to stay connected to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.090 
little bit harder to stay connected to
that<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.420> once<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.869> got<00:01:06.990> into<00:01:07.170> residency<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
that but once I got into residency and I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
that but once I got into residency and I
did<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.400> sports<00:01:08.780> rotation<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.080> when<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
did my sports rotation that's when I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
did my sports rotation that's when I
thought<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.070> kind<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.369> marry<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
thought I can kind of marry the two I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
thought I can kind of marry the two I
still<00:01:12.900> loved<00:01:13.080> sports<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> couldn't

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
still loved sports but I couldn't

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.969 
still loved sports but I couldn't
participate<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> used<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.950> but<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
participate the way I used to but I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
participate the way I used to but I
could<00:01:17.220> practice<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.909> practice<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
could practice it practice it and so I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.539 
could practice it practice it and so I
thought<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> great<00:01:19.920> way<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> keep

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
different in that I am a mother and I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.170 
different in that I am a mother and I
was<00:01:58.500> an<00:01:58.619> athlete<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.369> I<00:02:00.860> can<00:02:02.000> understand<00:02:03.000> what

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
was an athlete and I can understand what

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.639

helps them it puts them at ease and that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.889 
helps them it puts them at ease and that

they do have a physician that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.559 
they do have a physician that
understands<00:02:10.679> them<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.129> little<00:02:11.970> bit<00:02:12.180> different

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
understands them a little bit different

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.260 
understands them a little bit different
than
