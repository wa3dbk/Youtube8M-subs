the side on both sides open that back up

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.639 
the side on both sides open that back up
okay<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> other<00:00:34.260> side<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
okay and then do the other side the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.560 
okay and then do the other side the
exact<00:00:35.219> same<00:00:35.640> step

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
exact same step

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.010 
exact same step
those<00:00:37.410> two<00:00:37.620> diagonal<00:00:38.190> folds<00:00:38.570> open<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
those two diagonal folds open it up and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.380 
those two diagonal folds open it up and
flip<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> over<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.489> there<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.760> color<00:00:42.030> side

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
flip it over so there now the color side

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
flip it over so there now the color side
up<00:00:42.420> or<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.829> book<00:00:44.100> fold<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.700> book

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
together so that all four corners are

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
together so that all four corners are
going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> come<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.270> touch<00:01:21.479> each<00:01:21.689> other

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
going to come up and touch each other

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.499 
going to come up and touch each other
right<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> top<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.420> ahead

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and flatten that down to make the square

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.870 
and flatten that down to make the square
base<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.770> we're<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.220> gonna<00:01:29.369> make<00:01:29.520> any<00:01:29.579> new

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
base and we're not gonna make any new

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.249 
base and we're not gonna make any new
creases<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.720> using<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.110> the

nothing new is happening we're just
making<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> new<00:01:37.229> orientation<00:01:37.729> for<00:01:38.729> how<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
making a new orientation for how all the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940 
making a new orientation for how all the
flaps<00:01:39.390> pull<00:01:39.689> together<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.560> sure<00:01:40.799> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
flaps pull together and make sure you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
flaps pull together and make sure you
have<00:01:41.070> two<00:01:41.280> flaps<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.909> side<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.390> two<00:01:42.930> flaps

have two flaps on one side and two flaps

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
have two flaps on one side and two flaps
on<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> other<00:01:43.680> instead<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.340> having<00:01:44.520> three<00:01:44.909> on

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
on the other instead of having three on

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.639 
the bottom of the model we're gonna do
two<00:02:01.509> kite<00:02:01.780> folds<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.200> go<00:02:02.320> ahead<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.470> take

into the middle of the paper and it's

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.589 
into the middle of the paper and it's
gonna<00:02:08.860> line<00:02:09.099> up<00:02:09.130> right<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.789> that<00:02:10.060> middle<00:02:10.420> line

here we're gonna want to spread out so

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.220 
here we're gonna want to spread out so
go<00:03:06.790> ahead<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.060> put<00:03:07.389> your<00:03:07.420> finger<00:03:07.750> inside<00:03:07.900> of

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.770 
go ahead and put your finger inside of
them<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.560> could<00:03:08.680> squash<00:03:09.100> them<00:03:09.459> down<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.720> we

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
them so you could squash them down so we

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.490 
them so you could squash them down so we
can<00:03:10.870> flatten<00:03:11.410> them<00:03:11.560> down<00:03:13.139> and<00:03:14.139> then<00:03:14.260> once

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
can flatten them down and then once

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.550 
can flatten them down and then once
they're<00:03:14.680> nice<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:14.889> flat

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.110 

and<00:03:18.070> pick<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.310> up<00:03:18.460> and<00:03:18.580> look<00:03:18.700> at<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.910> that's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
and pick it up and look at it and that's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.380 
and pick it up and look at it and that's
the<00:03:22.360> easy<00:03:22.540> origami<00:03:22.840> flower
