so the main point against all that is

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.150 
so the main point against all that is
because<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.280> cars<00:01:34.520> rarely<00:01:35.120> in<00:01:35.210> one<00:01:35.390> piece<00:01:35.660> so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
because the cars rarely in one piece so

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.920 
because the cars rarely in one piece so
it's<00:01:37.160> been<00:01:37.280> built<00:01:37.520> overnight<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.570> which<00:01:38.750> one

it's been built overnight and which one

it's been built overnight and which one
I<00:01:38.960> check<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.500> all<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.710> systems<00:01:39.890> are<00:01:40.280> far<00:01:40.490> as
