00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.010 
really wasn't anything that rocket could
do<00:04:41.930> in<00:04:42.710> that<00:04:42.800> situation<00:04:43.130> they<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:44.419> don't<00:04:44.930> say

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
do in that situation they I don't say

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.689 
do in that situation they I don't say
they<00:04:45.139> lost<00:04:45.349> in<00:04:45.620> picks<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.070> bans<00:04:46.099> but<00:04:46.580> they

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
they lost in picks and bans but they

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.909 
they lost in picks and bans but they
just<00:04:46.880> didn't<00:04:47.240> execute<00:04:47.470> what<00:04:48.470> they<00:04:48.650> had

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
just didn't execute what they had

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.379 
just didn't execute what they had
planned<00:04:48.949> I<00:04:49.810> think<00:04:50.810> they<00:04:50.900> picked<00:04:51.080> a<00:04:51.229> calm<00:04:51.470> which

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
planned I think they picked a calm which

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.670 
planned I think they picked a calm which
was<00:04:53.389> fairly<00:04:53.659> difficult<00:04:53.930> for<00:04:54.289> them<00:04:54.349> to<00:04:54.440> play

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
was fairly difficult for them to play

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.710 
was fairly difficult for them to play
especially<00:04:55.400> again<00:04:55.789> if<00:04:55.909> they<00:04:56.030> didn't<00:04:56.389> do<00:04:56.510> well

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
especially again if they didn't do well

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.500 
especially again if they didn't do well
in<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.930> laning<00:04:57.169> phase<00:04:57.820> because<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.210> cyan

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
in the laning phase because the cyan

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.570 
in the laning phase because the cyan
picking<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.199> the<00:05:00.320> mark<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.770> repeat<00:05:01.159> on<00:05:01.280> one<00:05:01.430> out

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580

gonna<00:05:03.800> be<00:05:03.979> a<00:05:04.010> lot<00:05:04.130> more<00:05:04.190> useful<00:05:04.520> compared<00:05:05.449> to

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
gonna be a lot more useful compared to

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.570 
gonna be a lot more useful compared to
