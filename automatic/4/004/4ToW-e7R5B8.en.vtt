strategy at the beginning because the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.459 
strategy at the beginning because the
beginning<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.579> me<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.329> most<00:00:48.629> important

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
beginning for me it's the most important

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.529 
beginning for me it's the most important
one<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.360> probably<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.809> most<00:00:52.050> dangerous<00:00:52.469> one

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539

like so why I'm telling you I'm gonna

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.080 
like so why I'm telling you I'm gonna
explain<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.470> why<00:02:09.619> because<00:02:09.860> if<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.820> do<00:02:10.970> it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
explain you why because if you do it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.700 
explain you why because if you do it
there<00:02:11.300> when<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.750> kill<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.110> zombies<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.590> know

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
there when you kill the zombies you know

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.920 
there when you kill the zombies you know
they<00:02:12.980> could<00:02:13.160> come<00:02:13.370> from<00:02:13.550> that<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.690> know<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
they could come from that you know the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.280 
they could come from that you know the
windows<00:02:15.200> downstairs<00:02:15.410> or<00:02:15.830> upstairs<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:17.290> you

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
windows downstairs or upstairs and you

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.110 
windows downstairs or upstairs and you
cannot<00:02:18.740> really<00:02:19.070> know<00:02:19.340> where<00:02:19.730> they<00:02:19.910> going<00:02:20.060> to

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
cannot really know where they going to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.110 
cannot really know where they going to
come<00:02:20.270> from<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.780> if<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.560> shoot<00:02:21.770> them<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.340> that

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
come from and if you shoot them on that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.020 
come from and if you shoot them on that
spot<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.630> said<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.230> not<00:02:24.709> do<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.760> oh<00:02:25.790> my

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
spot that I said to not do it the oh my

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.270 
spot that I said to not do it the oh my
let's<00:02:26.870> take<00:02:27.050> for<00:02:27.200> example<00:02:27.260> if<00:02:27.770> they<00:02:27.920> come<00:02:28.130> from

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
let's take for example if they come from

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.490 
let's take for example if they come from
upstairs<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.120> know<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.600> zombie<00:02:30.200> will<00:02:30.320> might

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
upstairs you know the zombie will might

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.520 
upstairs you know the zombie will might
land<00:02:30.770> on<00:02:30.980> your<00:02:31.190> back<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.720> know<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.320> could

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
land on your back and you know you could

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
land on your back and you know you could
just<00:02:33.680> get<00:02:33.890> stuck<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.190> died<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:37.330> that's<00:02:38.330> the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
just get stuck and died so that's the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.610 
just get stuck and died so that's the
reason<00:02:38.540> why<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.620> there<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:41.350> wrap<00:02:42.350> them<00:02:42.530> up

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
reason why so there is wrap them up

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.680 
reason why so there is wrap them up
again<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.610> know<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.790> do<00:02:44.000> get<00:02:44.209> some<00:02:44.360> drops

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
again and you know you do get some drops

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.570 
again and you know you do get some drops
and<00:02:45.110> drops<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.860> know<00:02:45.980> sometimes<00:02:46.400> they're

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
and drops you know sometimes they're

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.250 
and drops you know sometimes they're
very<00:02:46.790> dangerous<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:47.600> like<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.230> a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
very dangerous just like here is a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.229 
very dangerous just like here is a
perfect<00:02:48.680> example<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:49.370> get<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.910> death<00:02:50.090> machine

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
perfect example I get the death machine

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.110 
perfect example I get the death machine
here<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.410> I'm<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.890> oh<00:02:52.190> my<00:02:52.489> god<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.940> was

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
here and I'm just like oh my god I was

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.449 
here and I'm just like oh my god I was
sort<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.660> regretting<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.380> but<00:02:54.739> I'm<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.100> okay

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
sort of regretting it but I'm like okay

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.840 
sort of regretting it but I'm like okay
I<00:02:55.489> made<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.450> need<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:58.070> know<00:02:58.820> I

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
I made it you need and you know I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.750 
I made it you need and you know I
believe<00:02:59.290> insta-kill<00:03:00.290> has<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.100> be<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> very<00:03:01.640> good

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
believe insta-kill has to be a very good

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.729 
believe insta-kill has to be a very good
one<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:04.130> know<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.870> Capone<00:03:06.350> there

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
the nuke is also a very great one but

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.070 
the nuke is also a very great one but
now<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.790> get<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.180> guys<00:03:11.330> gonna<00:03:11.480> see<00:03:11.780> here

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
go around and maybe grab that that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.150 
go around and maybe grab that that
machine<00:03:37.640> but<00:03:38.260> they're<00:03:39.260> spotting<00:03:39.709> too<00:03:39.860> quick

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
machine but they're spotting too quick

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.180 
machine but they're spotting too quick
and<00:03:40.370> watch<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:41.299> part<00:03:41.570> here<00:03:41.989> we<00:03:42.799> gotta<00:03:42.950> go<00:03:43.100> on

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
and watch this part here we gotta go on

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.250 
and watch this part here we gotta go on
slow<00:03:43.459> motion<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.090> watch<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.989> carefully

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
slow motion and watch this carefully

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.840 
slow motion and watch this carefully
look<00:03:45.709> at<00:03:45.799> that<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.130> zombie<00:03:46.400> comes<00:03:46.580> out<00:03:46.730> of
