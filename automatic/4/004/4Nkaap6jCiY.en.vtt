00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.940 
know that you owe a super star press X
to<00:02:02.729> shoot<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.210> star<00:02:03.689> projectile<00:02:04.290> press<00:02:04.530> B<00:02:04.740> when

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to shoot a star projectile press B when

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
to shoot a star projectile press B when
it's<00:02:05.070> close<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> deflected<00:02:05.939> electing<00:02:06.479> four

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it's close to deflected electing four

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
it's close to deflected electing four
times<00:02:07.310> deflecting<00:02:08.310> four<00:02:08.489> times<00:02:08.700> makes<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
times deflecting four times makes it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.029 
times deflecting four times makes it
grow<00:02:09.420> larger<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.080> do<00:02:10.200> more<00:02:10.349> damage<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> try

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
grow larger and do more damage to try

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.470 
grow larger and do more damage to try
and<00:02:11.129> keep<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.310> little<00:02:11.489> rhythm<00:02:11.640> there

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and keep a little rhythm there

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.660 
and keep a little rhythm there
and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.770> guys<00:02:13.860> my<00:02:14.129> opted<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.459> go<00:02:14.640> with

as she can bring some orbs down from the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.640 
as she can bring some orbs down from the
sky<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:02.599> like<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.720> sound<00:03:03.959> effects<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.470> makes

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
sky I like the sound effects it makes

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.539 
sky I like the sound effects it makes
it's<00:03:04.890> kind<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.220> like<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:07.590> like<00:03:07.769> fireworks<00:03:08.250> or

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
it's kind of like so like fireworks or

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.770 
it's kind of like so like fireworks or
something

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.050 

and<00:03:10.900> then<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.410> third<00:03:11.710> attack<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.490> spinning

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
and then a third attack is the spinning

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.900 
and then a third attack is the spinning
attack<00:03:13.510> which<00:03:13.990> will<00:03:14.770> actually<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.460> actually

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
attack which will actually you actually

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.940 
attack which will actually you actually
use<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.450> hit<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:17.320> orbs

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
use that to hit the orbs

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.710 
use that to hit the orbs
so<00:03:18.070> here's<00:03:18.310> let<00:03:18.850> me<00:03:18.970> see<00:03:19.090> if<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.240> get<00:03:19.300> reflected

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
so here's let me see if I get reflected

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.440 
so here's let me see if I get reflected
orb<00:03:20.080> back<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.880> little<00:03:22.060> tricky<00:03:22.330> when

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
orb back it's a little tricky when

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.180 
orb back it's a little tricky when
there's<00:03:22.600> no<00:03:22.690> bad<00:03:23.050> guys<00:03:23.380> reflecting<00:03:24.070> these

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
there's no bad guys reflecting these

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.870 
there's no bad guys reflecting these
orbs<00:03:24.520> back<00:03:24.730> there<00:03:25.060> we<00:03:25.150> go<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.250> can<00:03:27.580> see<00:03:27.760> the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
orbs back there we go so you can see the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.790 
orbs back there we go so you can see the
orb<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.390> getting<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.990> little<00:03:29.110> bigger<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.710> more

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
orb is getting a little bigger and more

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.660 
orb is getting a little bigger and more
powerful<00:03:30.810> with<00:03:31.810> time<00:03:32.110> so<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.070> idea<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.550> that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
powerful with time so the idea is that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.550 
powerful with time so the idea is that
if<00:03:33.790> there's<00:03:33.970> bad<00:03:34.150> guys<00:03:34.420> around<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:35.110> stay<00:03:35.410> in

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
if there's bad guys around I stay in

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.200 
if there's bad guys around I stay in
place<00:03:35.860> or<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.250> come<00:03:36.400> over<00:03:36.580> around<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.940> orb<00:03:37.090> will

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
place or I come over around the orb will

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.960 
place or I come over around the orb will
find<00:03:37.900> me<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:39.010> then<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.220> kind<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.490> smack<00:03:39.790> the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
find me and then you kind of smack the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.730 
find me and then you kind of smack the
orb<00:03:40.290> at<00:03:41.290> them<00:03:42.630> I'm<00:03:43.630> gonna<00:03:43.810> let<00:03:44.020> it<00:03:44.050> die<00:03:44.350> and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
orb at them I'm gonna let it die and

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.900 
orb at them I'm gonna let it die and
then<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.890> could<00:03:45.070> do<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.280> same<00:03:45.459> thing<00:03:45.520> with

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
then you could do the same thing with

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.510 
then you could do the same thing with
the<00:03:46.060> orbs<00:03:46.770> coming<00:03:47.770> down<00:03:47.920> from<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.160> sky<00:03:48.459> you

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
the orbs coming down from the sky you

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.280 
the orbs coming down from the sky you
can<00:03:48.850> kind<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.120> stand<00:03:49.330> in<00:03:49.510> one<00:03:49.600> place<00:03:49.660> and

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
can kind of stand in one place and

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.670 
can kind of stand in one place and
ricochet<00:03:51.250> them<00:03:51.430> off<00:03:52.080> or<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.230> can<00:03:53.350> just<00:03:53.470> blast

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
ricochet them off or you can just blast

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.590 
ricochet them off or you can just blast
the<00:03:53.890> orbs<00:03:54.220> over<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:54.760> over<00:03:54.940> like<00:03:55.090> that

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
the orbs over and over like that

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.449 
the orbs over and over like that
and<00:03:55.690> if<00:03:56.320> an<00:03:56.440> enemy<00:03:56.560> gets<00:03:56.890> close<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.340> could

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
and if an enemy gets close you could

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.160 
and if an enemy gets close you could
