00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.700 
competition we knew a bit tough test and
it<00:00:16.049> would<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.170> something<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.500> would<00:00:16.590> really

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710

in that squad who have a massive amount
of<00:01:25.040> potential<00:01:25.660> it's<00:01:26.660> just<00:01:26.840> about<00:01:27.080> realizing

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
of potential it's just about realizing

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.320 
of potential it's just about realizing
that<00:01:27.830> now<00:01:27.980> and<00:01:28.160> helping<00:01:28.490> them<00:01:28.610> get<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.300> best

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
that now and helping them get the best

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.600 
that now and helping them get the best
out<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:30.230> each<00:01:30.410> other<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.890> keep<00:01:31.070> driving<00:01:31.250> on

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
out of each other and keep driving on

out of each other and keep driving on
their<00:01:31.730> own<00:01:31.820> standards<00:01:32.300> but<00:01:32.450> i<00:01:32.720> think<00:01:33.170> if<00:01:33.380> we

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
their own standards but i think if we

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.230 
their own standards but i think if we
continue<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.130> share<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.460> same<00:01:34.670> attitude

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
continue to share the same attitude

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.810 
continue to share the same attitude
they've<00:01:36.170> all<00:01:36.320> got<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.890> massive<00:01:37.460> amount<00:01:37.790> of

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
they've all got a massive amount of

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.610 
they've all got a massive amount of
talent<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.210> hopefully<00:01:38.660> will<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.500> i'm

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620
