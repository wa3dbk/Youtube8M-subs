00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
time but it's just getting to that point

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.230 
time but it's just getting to that point
where<00:06:46.860> everything<00:06:47.610> is<00:06:47.670> China<00:06:47.880> getting

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
where everything is China getting

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.520 
where everything is China getting

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
that point but it's getting more at the

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.640 
that point but it's getting more at the
point<00:06:51.750> where<00:06:51.840> it's<00:06:51.960> kind<00:06:52.080> of<00:06:52.110> repetitive<00:06:52.350> and
