now<00:01:54.329> let's<00:01:54.540> take<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> look<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.439> prime

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
now let's take a look at the prime

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
now let's take a look at the prime
Center<00:01:56.369> speaker<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.090> their<00:01:57.210> around<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> back

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
Center speaker and their around the back

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.910 
Center speaker and their around the back
of<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> obviously<00:01:58.350> we've<00:01:58.530> got<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> same

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
of this obviously we've got the same

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.280 
of this obviously we've got the same
connections<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.700> your<00:01:59.759> speaker<00:02:00.180> wires<00:02:00.390> but

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
connections for your speaker wires but

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
connections for your speaker wires but
instead<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> having<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.100> single<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.670> point

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
instead of having a single one point
