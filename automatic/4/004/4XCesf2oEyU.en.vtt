people<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.760> think<00:04:54.120> that<00:04:54.570> bath<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.170> beyond

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
people so I think that bath and beyond

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.350 
people so I think that bath and beyond
the<00:04:55.650> one<00:04:55.800> store<00:04:56.100> is<00:04:56.310> more<00:04:57.030> than<00:04:57.150> good<00:04:57.210> enough
