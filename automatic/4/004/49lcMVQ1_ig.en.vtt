 to me because the truth of the
matter<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:55.050> soon<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.620> solid<00:00:55.860> state

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
matter is as soon as I get a solid state

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.040 
matter is as soon as I get a solid state
hard<00:00:56.190> drive<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.670> might<00:00:56.850> replace<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
hard drive it might replace it so that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.189 
hard drive it might replace it so that
my<00:00:58.289> my<00:00:59.039> music<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.270> program<00:01:00.449> will<00:01:00.870> float

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
my my music and the program will float

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.460 
my my music and the program will float
up<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.609> that<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.210> anyway<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.409> I'm

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
up like that so anyway that's what I'm

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.690 
up like that so anyway that's what I'm
using<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.799> course<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.670> tractor
