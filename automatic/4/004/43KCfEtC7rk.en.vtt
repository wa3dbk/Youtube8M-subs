00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.790 
I kind of feel bad for the axe when it
actually<00:04:25.440> doesn't<00:04:25.800> go<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:26.820> as<00:04:27.810> planned<00:04:28.350> I

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
actually doesn't go like as planned I

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.680 
actually doesn't go like as planned I
felt<00:04:29.220> bad<00:04:29.340> for<00:04:29.370> them<00:04:29.639> in<00:04:29.910> about<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.240> year<00:04:30.539> or<00:04:30.570> two

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
felt bad for them in about a year or two

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.009 
felt bad for them in about a year or two
perhaps<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.289> keep<00:04:31.500> at<00:04:31.650> this<00:04:31.830> you
