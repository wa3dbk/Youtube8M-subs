00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.250 
let's have a look there's a little
plastic<00:03:48.959> seal<00:03:49.959> just<00:03:50.530> on<00:03:50.769> there<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.930> basically

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
plastic seal just on there so basically

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.170 
plastic seal just on there so basically
just<00:03:53.950> use<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:54.099> penny<00:03:54.370> for<00:03:54.579> this<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.060> just

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
just use a penny for this and just

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.099 
just use a penny for this and just
turned<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.750> anti-clockwise<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:57.340> then<00:03:58.109> let's

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
turned it anti-clockwise and then let's

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.130 
turned it anti-clockwise and then let's
see<00:03:59.410> if

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
see if

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.370 
see if
just<00:04:00.319> drops<00:04:00.560> out<00:04:00.770> okay<00:04:01.960> so<00:04:02.960> that's<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.230> whole

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
just drops out okay so that's the whole

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.309 
just drops out okay so that's the whole
few<00:04:03.650> batteries<00:04:04.069> and<00:04:04.370> that's<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.670> little

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
few batteries and that's the little

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.680 
few batteries and that's the little
stainless<00:04:06.319> steel<00:04:06.770> cap<00:04:07.190> goes<00:04:07.670> over<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.060> top<00:04:10.690> so

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
stainless steel cap goes over the top so

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:19.500 
stainless steel cap goes over the top so
let's<00:04:13.300> get<00:04:14.300> our<00:04:14.420> batteries<00:04:14.900> going<00:04:17.560> takes<00:04:18.560> free

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
let's get our batteries going takes free

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.500 
let's get our batteries going takes free
double-a<00:04:20.510> batteries<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:26.090> there<00:04:26.240> isn't

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
double-a batteries and there isn't

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.610 
double-a batteries and there isn't
really<00:04:26.600> any<00:04:28.450> instruction<00:04:29.450> s<00:04:29.570> exactly<00:04:30.290> which

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
really any instruction s exactly which

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.570 
really any instruction s exactly which
way<00:04:30.950> these<00:04:31.160> going<00:04:31.640> so<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:33.290> don't<00:04:34.130> there<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:34.460> go

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
way these going so I don't there we go

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.530 
way these going so I don't there we go
there<00:04:34.940> is<00:04:35.380> there's<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.470> small<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:38.030> can<00:04:38.330> see

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
there is there's a small you can see

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.170 
there is there's a small you can see
that<00:04:38.570> small<00:04:39.020> diagram<00:04:39.530> there<00:04:39.800> showing<00:04:40.700> you<00:04:40.940> all

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
that small diagram there showing you all

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.150 
that small diagram there showing you all
the<00:04:41.330> batteries<00:04:41.480> going<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:43.280> same<00:04:43.550> way<00:04:44.919> so<00:04:45.919> they

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
the batteries going the same way so they

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.590 
the batteries going the same way so they
just<00:04:46.340> drop<00:04:46.550> in<00:04:49.090> like<00:04:50.090> so<00:04:51.430> put<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.600> stainless

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
just drop in like so put a stainless

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.090 
just drop in like so put a stainless
steel<00:04:54.730> cap<00:04:55.730> back<00:04:55.940> up<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:57.620> can<00:04:57.770> just<00:04:57.919> twist

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
steel cap back up you can just twist

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.840 
steel cap back up you can just twist
that<00:04:58.220> with<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.550> film<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.200> then<00:05:00.580> if<00:05:01.580> we<00:05:01.700> just

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
that with the film and then if we just

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.170 
that with the film and then if we just
put<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.150> penny<00:05:02.990> in<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:03.850> just<00:05:04.850> turn<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.120> on

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
put the penny in and just turn it on

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.330 
put the penny in and just turn it on
turn<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.870> clockwise<00:05:06.080> sorry<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:06.979> that<00:05:07.160> just

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
turn it clockwise sorry and that just

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.460 
turn it clockwise sorry and that just
clicks<00:05:08.120> in<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.970> on<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.570> right-hand<00:05:11.780> side<00:05:12.020> of

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
clicks in and on the right-hand side of

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.860 
clicks in and on the right-hand side of
the<00:05:12.890> cylinder<00:05:13.460> shape<00:05:13.880> there's<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.270> power

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
the cylinder shape there's a power

the cylinder shape there's a power
button<00:05:15.080> there<00:05:15.410> so<00:05:16.310> if<00:05:16.370> we<00:05:16.400> just<00:05:16.580> click<00:05:16.820> that

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
button there so if we just click that

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.520 
button there so if we just click that
and<00:05:19.220> let<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.580> light<00:05:19.790> comes<00:05:20.090> on<00:05:20.380> just<00:05:21.380> doing

the<00:05:21.710> cake<00:05:21.919> that<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.190> keyboards<00:05:22.790> switched<00:05:23.630> on

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
the cake that the keyboards switched on

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.969 
the cake that the keyboards switched on
and<00:05:24.710> also<00:05:24.979> your<00:05:26.050> caps<00:05:27.050> lock<00:05:27.169> key<00:05:27.290> it's<00:05:27.830> not

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
and also your caps lock key it's not

and also your caps lock key it's not
working<00:05:28.340> just<00:05:28.610> yet<00:05:29.060> just<00:05:29.960> while<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.260> connects

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.020 

there<00:05:34.910> we<00:05:35.000> go<00:05:35.830> I'm<00:05:36.830> just<00:05:37.190> just<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.640> compare<00:05:37.970> it

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
there we go I'm just just to compare it

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.990 
there we go I'm just just to compare it
to<00:05:38.180> my<00:05:38.450> existing<00:05:39.130> wired<00:05:40.130> keyboard<00:05:40.520> that<00:05:40.970> I

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
to my existing wired keyboard that I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.420 
to my existing wired keyboard that I
have<00:05:41.150> for<00:05:41.300> my<00:05:41.419> imac<00:05:41.840> I'll<00:05:42.560> just<00:05:42.710> bring<00:05:43.039> that<00:05:43.280> in

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
have for my imac I'll just bring that in

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.940 
have for my imac I'll just bring that in
now<00:05:44.440> in<00:05:45.440> terms<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:45.919> size<00:05:46.669> comparison<00:05:47.650> this<00:05:48.650> is

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
now in terms of size comparison this is

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.240 
now in terms of size comparison this is
the<00:05:49.840> standard<00:05:50.840> wired<00:05:51.110> keyboard<00:05:51.440> with<00:05:51.919> number
