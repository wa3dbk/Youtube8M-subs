opposition<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.860> this<00:04:09.070> I<00:04:09.220> mean<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.459> fact<00:04:09.610> is

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
opposition to this I mean the fact is

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.220 
opposition to this I mean the fact is
I've<00:04:10.299> got<00:04:10.480> read<00:04:10.600> this<00:04:10.720> today<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.049> I<00:04:11.080> thought

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
I've got read this today and I thought

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.350

it<00:04:11.350> was<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.470> good<00:04:11.680> comparison<00:04:12.250> it's<00:04:13.030> like<00:04:13.239> if

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
it was a good comparison it's like if

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.670

wanted to build something in Trenton

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.560 
wanted to build something in Trenton

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
when you were actually evicted because

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.330 
when you were actually evicted because

so so center every does so far we and
there's<00:04:25.000> no<00:04:25.150> connection<00:04:25.450> other<00:04:26.230> than<00:04:26.260> the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
there's no connection other than the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.690 
there's no connection other than the

fact this is a local issue that's been

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.600 
fact this is a local issue that's been
going<00:04:27.850> on<00:04:28.120> for<00:04:28.510> about<00:04:28.690> twenty<00:04:29.260> years<00:04:29.470> plus<00:04:30.340> I

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
going on for about twenty years plus I

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.150 
going on for about twenty years plus I
know<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.660> know<00:04:31.750> Alexander<00:04:32.710> this<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:32.980> just

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
know you know Alexander this is just

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.800 
know you know Alexander this is just
gotten<00:04:33.610> really<00:04:33.730> ugly<00:04:33.970> it's<00:04:34.240> gotten<00:04:34.480> really<00:04:34.600> to

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
gotten really ugly it's gotten really to

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.030 
gotten really ugly it's gotten really to
mean<00:04:34.960> that's<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.260> idea<00:04:35.530> that<00:04:35.590> there<00:04:35.800> were<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
mean that's the idea that there were the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.620 
mean that's the idea that there were the
point<00:04:36.340> guns<00:04:36.580> at<00:04:36.790> each<00:04:36.880> other<00:04:37.120> yeah<00:04:37.360> absolutely

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
point guns at each other yeah absolutely

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.180 
point guns at each other yeah absolutely
and<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.020> think<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.380> that's<00:04:38.410> actually<00:04:38.920> why<00:04:39.040> we

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
and I think that that's actually why we

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.890 
and I think that that's actually why we
haven't<00:04:39.460> seen<00:04:39.640> any<00:04:39.820> Republican<00:04:40.450> leaders<00:04:40.690> way

haven't seen any Republican leaders way

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.960 
haven't seen any Republican leaders way
it<00:04:41.050> on<00:04:41.170> this<00:04:41.380> because<00:04:41.680> while<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.520> is<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.640> states

right rights issue which is typically
very<00:04:44.710> popular<00:04:45.310> with<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.490> Republican<00:04:46.000> base<00:04:46.180> it

has gotten so out of hand I mean there

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.760 
has gotten so out of hand I mean there

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
here obviously but I mean this is a drop

in<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.090> bucket<00:05:22.210> for<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.720> federal<00:05:22.990> government

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
in the bucket for the federal government

why<00:05:23.500> are<00:05:23.650> we<00:05:23.770> having<00:05:23.920> this<00:05:24.070> confrontation<00:05:24.700> why

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
why are we having this confrontation why

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.430 
why are we having this confrontation why
doesn't<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:25.150> just<00:05:25.210> play<00:05:25.570> out<00:05:25.750> in<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.050> courts

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
doesn't it just play out in the courts

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.990

if they want to get their money if they

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.030 
if they want to get their money if they
think<00:05:28.660> this<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:28.990> something<00:05:29.380> that<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.770> federal

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
think this is something that the federal

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.950 
think this is something that the federal
government's<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.490> pursue<00:05:30.790> there's<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.330> civil

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
government's to pursue there's a civil

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.480 
government's to pursue there's a civil
there's<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.290> justice<00:05:32.680> system<00:05:32.710> that<00:05:33.010> we<00:05:33.250> can<00:05:33.400> all

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
there's a justice system that we can all

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.130 
there's a justice system that we can all
check<00:05:33.730> what<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.060> think<00:05:34.330> is<00:05:34.480> very<00:05:34.630> telling<00:05:34.960> that

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.560 
check what I think is very telling that
you<00:05:35.350> did<00:05:35.560> see<00:05:35.710> some<00:05:35.890> criticism<00:05:36.460> of<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.120> BLM

you did see some criticism of the BLM
you<00:05:37.720> didn't<00:05:37.990> see<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.770> you<00:05:39.490> didn't<00:05:39.760> see<00:05:39.880> them

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
you didn't see the you didn't see them

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.510 
you didn't see the you didn't see them
actually<00:05:40.620> defending<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.830> Bundys<00:05:42.130> you<00:05:42.310> saw

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
actually defending the Bundys you saw

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.920 
actually defending the Bundys you saw
them<00:05:42.730> say<00:05:42.970> that<00:05:43.210> there<00:05:43.360> there<00:05:43.540> was<00:05:43.660> some<00:05:43.750> heavy

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
them say that there there was some heavy

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.840 
them say that there there was some heavy
handedness<00:05:44.440> on<00:05:44.650> behalf<00:05:45.310> of<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.610> federal

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
handedness on behalf of the federal

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.550 
handedness on behalf of the federal
government<00:05:46.360> so<00:05:46.600> I<00:05:46.630> think<00:05:46.810> there's<00:05:47.230> they're
