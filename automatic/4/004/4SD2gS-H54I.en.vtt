00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.990
You’re watching Doctor Who: The Fan Show,
yummy.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.320
Missy has quickly become a favourite amongst
the fans, what do you think it is about her

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.150
that people love or, love to hate?

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.350
I think it’s the fact that she get’s to
say and be-

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.290
Sort of, it’s not just - I mean she says
some unbelievable things but it’s the way-

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.610
It’s her demeanour. I think there’s a
kind of swag to her that’s kind of fun and

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.040
her and she is like the villain that you love
to hate.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.420
But you can kind of relate to her too because
like any you know like any friendly, loveable

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.829
psychopath

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.940
You know she’s very deluded in her madness
because she doesn’t think she’s mad at

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.649
all and I think people can kind of relate
to her because

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.539
She says things that you wouldn’t ever dare
to say to anybody and she gets to just delete

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.199
people if they just annoy her

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.249
Most people do annoy her

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.659
So you’ve followed in the footsteps of some
great incarnations of the Master. Did you

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.129
look at any of these performances when preparing
to play Missy

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.180
or did you want your version to be something
completely new?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.370
Because I’m such a fan of the show, when
the Master was offered to me I couldn’t

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.250
speak for about a week.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.471
And I still can’t quite believe that I’m
the Master. But you know, I tend to get a

00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:23.830
little intimidated by other people’s genius

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.170
So I was a bit nervous about going back and
having a look at the other incarnations

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.790
I definitely wanted to just-

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.920
The fact that the Master was going from male
to female was somehow, was kind of irrelevant

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.390
to me in a way

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.070
I approached it like I do most things. Blindly.
And hope that something would happen on the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.630
day.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.380
You know, it’s all in the writing and obviously
is you’re wearing that costume it’s kind

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.670
of hard to act out of it.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.340
It was all kind of there for me, there for
the taking really.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.610
And you just hope that it would work.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.080
If Missy could meet and presumably snog any
of the Doctor’s previous incarnations, which

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.209
would you choose?

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.239
If I – if Missy.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.769
If I! Woah! It’s a fine line there. Um,
steady on I am married.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.140
If Missy could snog any of the other Doctors
is the question there.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.040
Well I wouldn’t really because actually
she wasn’t the one doing the snogging.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.110
I think you’ll find if you play that back
he was hanging on for grim life. He just can’t

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.709
get enough of old Missy there.

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:46.590
So nom I wouldn’t be snogging anybody. I
would be batting them off with a stick.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.590
[LAUGHING]

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.590
Amazing.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.569
Now this one is a good Missy question. Say
something nice please?

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.569
No.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.310
And now over to our resident Who historian,
Luke Spillane.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.799
Over the last 44 years, the Master has been
many things - male, female, even a gross and

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.950
crispy cadaver.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.610
But one thing has remained constant - a clear
identity or “Master brand”.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.849
For those of you aspiring to take over the
universe, here are some key learnings from

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.219
her story. A “Master class”, if you will.

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.219
Who are you?

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:25.220
Oh you know who I am. I’m Missy.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.919
Always dress for the occasion. Invest in an
array of costumes and prosthetics to really

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.709
confuse your arch nemesis.

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.969
Over the years, the Master’s pretended to
be a Mobile Intelligence Systems Interface,

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.150
a paramedic, and even spent a brief period
as a vicar.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.730
Changing gender and become infinitely more
fabulous is also highly recommended.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.510
Become British Prime Minister and swamp the
Earth with killer inter-dimensional beings.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.239
Fill St Paul’s Cathedral with Cybermen made
from dead people. Tear Gallifrey open to restart

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.510
your regeneration cycle.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.239
Nothing is impossible - think big, or go home.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.400
When you’ve run out of regenerations and
your old body’s wearing a bit thin, just

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.799
get yourself a new one!

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.099
All you need is either a sticky TARDIS trap,
a dedicated cult of fanatical disciples or

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.669
a weird serpent thing that scoots down your
throat.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.459
Keep it fresh.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.470
Some days life brings gives lemons. Big, time
destroying lemons.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.280
But rather than make awful temporal lemonade,
get yourself a Chameleon Arch and hide as

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.389
a simple human being.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.199
Just don’t forget who you really are. You
might just accidentally end up helping people.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.520
Urgh.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.960
Finally, take a peep at the Untempered Schism
and turbo charge your inner crazy.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.750
Kill people with plastic chairs, interfere
with the signing of the Magna Carta - just

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.750
because.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.960
Give your enemy a Cyber Army as a present,
rather than some socks like last year.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.860
Be creative with it.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:57.990
Well, I hope that’s helped you develop your
“Master plan” for universal domination.

And don’t forget to see what bananas stuff
she gets up to in Series 9’s two-part opener.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.880
And finally

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.060
Well, Christel isn’t around

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.000
Here’s this week’s Who Tube annotation
attack

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.720
Hey Luke! That’s my thing!

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.409
See ya!
