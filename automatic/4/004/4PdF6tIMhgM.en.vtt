00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000
 my name is katrina i am a lecturer 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.710
 at the hohner conservatory and teach 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.540
 harmonica I have it myself 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.580
 started harmonica at the age of eight 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.920
 I have a lot to play about that 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.410
 done years later and later taught for 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.210
 studied elementary school and am now in 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.820
 between the conservatory and 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.110
 but also at primary school 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.670
 the difference between children and 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.200
 Adult playing with harmonica 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.700
 This is often very much the case with children 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.410
 goes faster because she of course very much 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.480
 thoughtlessly as an instrument and 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.340
 Usually one starts with children 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.530
 always on a number font 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.350
 to learn harmonica that is the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.480
 Learning success very fast as you can 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.170
 already after an hour already in the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.910
 play song 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.679
 I think that the children are essential 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.649
 have to practice less than the adults 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.850
 also show a lot of breathing 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.489
 automatically correct 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.559
 So you can with the harmonica 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.230
 beginning with the sp the harmonica it 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.960
 there is a ride because you can 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.780
 already play from four years and the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.760
 children learn a color practically 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.590
 each with bubbles and pull and 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.800
 then play at the beginning just after this 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.470
 data writing special feature at the sp 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.470
 The harmonica is that they are very 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.540
 has big holes and that the gaps 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.159
 between the holes very big 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.020
 then the children are right from the beginning 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.640
 to actually play a kill 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.070
 So yes, here we have the four 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.590
 colors and the first hole in the arrow 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.140
 going up is called larsen if the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.030
 arrow goes down and pull the 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.649
 Children then practically jump depending on 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.649
 tone of barbie for color 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.150

 typical 1 beginner instrument at 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.150
 Harmonica instruments and used

 have started with the melody there 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.610
 The special feature of the melody is there 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.380
 that you have virtually channel openings here 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.739

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.450
 No, the melody can be played 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.000
 star has eight channels so twice as 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.580
 many like the harmonica sound construction 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.130

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
 u 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.750
 the melody star is also suitable 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.129
 therefore as a beginner instrument she is 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.400
 easy to play but it is natural 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.409

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.150
 instrument 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.170
