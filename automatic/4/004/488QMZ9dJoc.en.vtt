a white dress shirt and this was the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.300 
a white dress shirt and this was the
summer<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.840> learned<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.560> how<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.860> tie<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> tie

because<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.149> every<00:01:57.930> single<00:01:58.350> day<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> way<00:01:58.950> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
because I every single day on the way to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.370 
because I every single day on the way to
work<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.790> tying<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.390> thing<00:02:00.630> taking<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
actually see me right about this there

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.510 
actually see me right about this there
are<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.690> types<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.860> can<00:02:53.010> try<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.250> match

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
are not types that you can try to match

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.060 
are not types that you can try to match
with<00:02:53.970> certain<00:02:54.660> types<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.990> shirt<00:02:55.230> collars<00:02:55.590> so

with certain types of shirt collars so

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.920 
with certain types of shirt collars so
right<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.550> I've<00:02:56.730> got<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.180> medium<00:02:57.510> spread

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
right here I've got a medium spread

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.680 
right here I've got a medium spread
collar<00:02:58.520> technically<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.550> could<00:02:59.730> be<00:03:00.180> wearing<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
collar technically I could be wearing a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.900 
collar technically I could be wearing a
half<00:03:01.170> windsor<00:03:01.470> or<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.830> windsor<00:03:02.220> because<00:03:02.700> those

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
half windsor or a windsor because those

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.720 
half windsor or a windsor because those
are<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.209> fill<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.870> top<00:03:04.110> space<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.740> bit

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
are going to fill up the top space a bit

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.820 
are going to fill up the top space a bit
better<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.780> still<00:03:07.200> like<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.440> way<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
better but I still like the way the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.890 
better but I still like the way the
foreign<00:03:08.130> hand<00:03:08.370> looks<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.850> don't<00:03:09.570> think<00:03:09.750> it's

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
foreign hand looks I don't think it's

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.620 
foreign hand looks I don't think it's
overwhelmed<00:03:10.470> by<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.709> size<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.580> tie<00:03:12.300> space

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
of hair on that larger head as well they

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.720 
of hair on that larger head as well they
need<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.440> large<00:03:22.800> knot<00:03:23.160> for<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.610> look

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
need a large knot for it to look

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.750 
need a large knot for it to look
proportions<00:03:24.830> proportional<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.160> that's

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
proportions proportional so that's

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.520 
proportions proportional so that's
probably<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.330> key<00:03:27.630> thing<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.930> want<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.350> think

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
probably the key thing you want to think

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.350 
probably the key thing you want to think
about<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.890> what<00:03:29.280> knot<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.820> going<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.150> look

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
about is what knot is going to look

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.330 
about is what knot is going to look
proportional<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:31.470> if<00:03:31.620> you've<00:03:31.800> got<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.010> really

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
proportional so if you've got a really

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.390 
proportional so if you've got a really
small<00:03:32.820> thin<00:03:33.630> head<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.290> want<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.739> small<00:03:35.130> knot

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
small thin head you want a small knot

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.150 
small thin head you want a small knot
because<00:03:35.730> if<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.030> wear<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.590> Windsor<00:03:37.590> knot<00:03:37.860> and

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
because if you wear a Windsor knot and

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.860 
because if you wear a Windsor knot and
if<00:03:38.489> it's<00:03:38.790> something<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.209> you've<00:03:39.450> got<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.660> very

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
if it's something that you've got a very

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.979 
if it's something that you've got a very
thick<00:03:40.019> tie<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:41.220> knot<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:42.300> comparison<00:03:42.930> with

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
thick tie that knot in comparison with

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:43.970 
thick tie that knot in comparison with
your<00:03:43.170> head<00:03:43.320> it's<00:03:43.440> just<00:03:43.470> going<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.739> make<00:03:43.830> your

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
your head it's just going to make your

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.340 
your head it's just going to make your
head<00:03:44.100> look<00:03:44.130> smaller<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:45.239> think<00:03:45.870> about<00:03:46.019> that

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
head look smaller so think about that

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.410 
head look smaller so think about that
and<00:03:46.830> be<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.250> know<00:03:47.280> also<00:03:47.850> at<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.120> end<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
and be you know also at the end of the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.220 
and be you know also at the end of the
day<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.600> want<00:03:48.840> something<00:03:49.140> you're

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
day you want something you're

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
day you want something you're
comfortable<00:03:49.470> wearing<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.489> if<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:50.790> put<00:03:51.000> it

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
comfortable wearing so if you put it

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.580 
comfortable wearing so if you put it
into<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> knot<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.720> you've<00:03:52.080> never<00:03:52.260> worn

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590
