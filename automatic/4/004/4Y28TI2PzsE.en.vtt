00:00:03.334 --> 00:00:06.373
Today I'll talk about supplements.

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:11.798
Supplements is considered as one of the most important topics within our sport.

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:18.754
For me though, I consider it as a minor topic. Nutrition first, supplements next.

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:25.845
To make use of supplements, you require proper nutrition at first.

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:28.744
Supplements allow for small improvements.

00:00:29.047 --> 00:00:42.940
Even best supplements don't compensate bad nutrition. Don't expect that!

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:47.811
Supplements are great but focus on your daily nutrition first of all!

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.895
At the moment I consume a rice protein.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:58.200
Very easy to handle, I just add it to my oat flakes breakfast.

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:05.569
Also, I use creatine throughout the whole year.

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:12.619
Sometimes I may exlude it though, simply to take a break or because I don't require it at that time.

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:20.970
Usually I consume 5g per day and also just add it to my breakfast once more.

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:28.715
I weigh out 5g creatine, mix it with some water and drink it in the morning.

00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:32.457
Next is a vitamin and mineral supplement.

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:38.528
It consists of herbs, berries and seaweed. The ingredients are crushed and merged as one.

00:01:38.888 --> 00:01:48.434
I also add it to my daily breakfast, normally to oat flakes. Tastes good!

00:01:48.757 --> 00:02:07.101
Since I'm vegan, taking supplements ensures I don't miss any nutrients I otherwise could.

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:15.652
I have a balanced nutrition already but supplements guarantee I get everything my body needs.

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:31.538
Trainingsbooster.. Well, many of you may use them already and I know people who use it daily. Don't!

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:44.122
These are not meant to be used as a motivator every training, you don't enjoy working out if you do.

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:55.694
Use a booster if you're lazy and unmotivated but still want to work out. Consider it as a joker.

00:02:56.287 --> 00:03:08.215
Also helps if you're working out very late. Overall I do support booster but don't abuse them.

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:16.339
At last, well it's not an actual supplement but anyway, I want to mention the 'raw bite'!

00:03:16.672 --> 00:03:25.580
It's a bar consisting of nuts and dry fruit.. not much more really.

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:33.175
I always carry some of them with me.

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.905
Let's say I'm giving a personal training and didn't have much time to eat in between.

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:43.179
In that case, I'll just eat a 'raw bite' to gain energy fast.

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:56.026
This way I keep power and concentration until I have time to prepare or eat a real meal.

00:03:56.564 --> 00:03:58.202
I hope I could help you!

00:03:58.654 --> 00:04:10.783
Once you eat properly, balanced and regularly plus once you work out hard, make use of supplements.

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:17.192
I wish you the very best and see you soon, yours Conny!
