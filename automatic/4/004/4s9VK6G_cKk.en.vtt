00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.550
 so for a start you will bend 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.220
 your sheet in half like these 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:34.989
 has besides it's everything you 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:34.989
 speak is forgotten well then bouveret 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.100
 you are going to take the angles and 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.940
 republish such as one on the other 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 and you have obtained 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.700
 like for lost 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 I'm going out almost aggression peak you 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.010
 see then 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.660
 you see like that we saw you as 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.379
 it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.850
 I went to take that other angle 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.090
 you fold it the same on the mini 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090
 6 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.640
 here 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.430
 rates for ns 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.060
 normally for their health their growth 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.860
 it is 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.890
 so listen to me because it's 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.140
 becomes more complicated there your point 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.240
 here you will learn art bend 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.950
 while staying on the sort the fair to 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.710
 bowls 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.710
 see like that or sheet of 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.770
 digress from here to bad if you 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.570
 come to pleasure by paying attention to this 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.149
 who's waiting for them and I 'm doing well attractive 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.640
 but supported by manga because that 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.580
 hop remains not tell you is 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.649
 now you have that you've got it 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.810
 becomes a little harder you press there 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.560
 and there you see on the point 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.049
 of intersection just here and there you 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.440
 press with your fingers like this here 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.099
 you are going to take and you are going to live 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.590
 is not folded 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:29.680
 see by that you have this now your 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.650
 friends look well since there is 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.630
 really very complicated to teach you 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.680
 you're going to bend it like that 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.680
 you see in the interior 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.940
 well folded next here as we want 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.560
 open 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.230
 you see it's like that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.440
 you have the triangles from there then 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.540
 it's nothing so we have to go close 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.470
 so that it makes a wing there 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.880
 be careful when you 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.319
 closed to close them this team 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.950
 offered herself a tiny one there 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.849
 see you close the sail has 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.830
 seduces a wing like this on the other side 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.640
 see it like that on a little 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.820
 this is her second there you have you from 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.820
 zealous 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.290
 see like that 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.150
 ok it's not safe 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.219
 once you have that now 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.909
 becomes a little bit harder 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:36.780
 you will make wings run off 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:40.109
 leptin weak and raise a little bit 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.109
 the same from the other 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.540
 here 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.300
 and then the problem of the internships 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.010
 that he tends to see my 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.320
 god he will have to do is make a 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.860
 if this is where you go 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.080
 there you will support a little bit for 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.080
 that like that 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.980
 to do this 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.230
 Yes 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.230
 here is your support 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:24.190
 so that's how you did it 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.479
 your that it gives you that you're gonna 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.270
 anyway December where are you going here 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.680
 had to do a little ripples and 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.080
 like this to do something 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.660
 like that simple double come in there is 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.240
 arrived the side 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.980
 and there it is normally good that you 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.210
 give that 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.690
 and that's how to make a plane from 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.690
 paper hunt 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.800
 thank you 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.800
 look at how these rallies 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:56.050
 that's going to what we do in the 18 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.050
 day
