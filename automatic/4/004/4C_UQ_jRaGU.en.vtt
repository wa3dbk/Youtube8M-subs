00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
accessible we also have like a sort of

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.090 
accessible we also have like a sort of
stand<00:00:53.690> on<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.020> back<00:00:54.200> which<00:00:54.530> is<00:00:54.560> useful<00:00:54.890> for

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
stand on the back which is useful for

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.910 
stand on the back which is useful for
filming<00:00:55.520> gameplay<00:00:56.140> so<00:00:57.140> here<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:57.530> is<00:00:57.649> in<00:00:57.770> action

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
filming gameplay so here it is in action

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.680 
filming gameplay so here it is in action
and<00:00:58.399> hopefully<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.850> can<00:00:58.970> tell<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.510> the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
and hopefully you can tell that the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.450 
and hopefully you can tell that the
stand<00:01:00.050> has<00:01:00.230> actually<00:01:00.470> helped<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:00.860> raise<00:01:01.220> the

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
stand has actually helped to raise the

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.850 
stand has actually helped to raise the
3ds<00:01:01.820> off<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.210> ground<00:01:02.480> without<00:01:03.079> changing<00:01:03.739> its

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
3ds off the ground without changing its

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.859 
3ds off the ground without changing its
level<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.399> 3ds<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:04.820> still<00:01:05.119> perfectly<00:01:05.570> flat

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
level so the 3ds is still perfectly flat

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.350 
level so the 3ds is still perfectly flat
but<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.710> raised<00:01:07.040> on<00:01:07.850> top<00:01:08.000> of<00:01:08.119> that<00:01:08.180> this

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
but it is raised on top of that this

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.149 
but it is raised on top of that this
case<00:01:08.600> actually<00:01:08.810> helps<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.470> just<00:01:09.770> keep<00:01:09.950> it

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
case actually helps you to just keep it

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.680 
case actually helps you to just keep it
very<00:01:10.370> steady<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.360> means<00:01:11.479> you're<00:01:11.600> not

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
very steady and it means you're not

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.390 
very steady and it means you're not
going<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.900> move<00:01:12.020> around<00:01:12.200> during<00:01:12.560> gameplay<00:01:12.890> so

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
going to move around during gameplay so

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.800 
going to move around during gameplay so
you<00:01:13.460> know<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.820> makes<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.150> easier<00:01:14.540> for<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
Pad Pro now this is probably the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350 
Pad Pro now this is probably the
accessory<00:01:59.400> you're<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.730> be<00:01:59.790> most<00:02:00.000> aware

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
accessory you're going to be most aware

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.610 
accessory you're going to be most aware
about<00:02:00.480> because<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.080> there's<00:02:01.260> a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.470> of

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
about because I know there's a lot of

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.900 
about because I know there's a lot of
sort<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:01.860> hype<00:02:02.100> about<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.580> when<00:02:02.760> it's

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
sort of hype about this when it's

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.690 
sort of hype about this when it's
released<00:02:03.440> I<00:02:04.440> mean<00:02:04.800> there<00:02:04.980> are<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:05.160> few<00:02:05.310> problems

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
released I mean there are a few problems

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.580 
released I mean there are a few problems
with<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:05.910> mean<00:02:06.060> first<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.480> really<00:02:06.780> bulky<00:02:07.350> I

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
with that mean first it's really bulky I

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.010 
with that mean first it's really bulky I
mean<00:02:08.400> the<00:02:08.760> benefits<00:02:09.210> probably<00:02:09.510> do<00:02:09.660> outweigh

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
mean the benefits probably do outweigh

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.450 
mean the benefits probably do outweigh
that<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:10.380> know<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:10.680> it<00:02:10.830> gives<00:02:10.980> you<00:02:11.070> l2
