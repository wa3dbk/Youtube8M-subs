about<00:02:25.560> getting<00:02:25.709> into<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.129> material<00:02:26.430> onto<00:02:26.970> best

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
about getting into a material onto best

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.090 
about getting into a material onto best
member<00:02:28.530> school<00:02:28.769> program<00:02:29.159> is

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
member school program is

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.880 
member school program is
what<00:02:30.340> would<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.580> suggest<00:02:30.760> there<00:02:31.270> would<00:02:31.840> you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.059 

I'm<00:02:35.430> an<00:02:35.880> old<00:02:36.030> school<00:02:36.360> guy<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.110> with<00:02:37.650> regard

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
I'm an old school guy and so with regard

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.740 
I'm an old school guy and so with regard
to<00:02:38.160> gaining<00:02:38.490> strength<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.120> think<00:02:39.330> first<00:02:39.600> you

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
to gaining strength I think first you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.660 
to gaining strength I think first you
have<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.170> foundational<00:02:40.980> strength<00:02:41.340> I

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
have to have foundational strength I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.790 
have to have foundational strength I
don't<00:02:42.240> think<00:02:42.300> there<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.569> any<00:02:42.930> peer<00:02:43.260> exercise

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
don't think there is any peer exercise

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.300 
don't think there is any peer exercise
to<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.220> back<00:02:44.400> squat<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.380> know<00:02:46.590> power

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
to the back squat so you know power

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.940 
to the back squat so you know power
playing<00:02:47.700> wii<00:02:47.940> back<00:02:48.209> squat<00:02:48.660> bench<00:02:49.230> press<00:02:49.590> we<00:02:49.770> do

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
playing wii back squat bench press we do

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.699 
playing wii back squat bench press we do
a<00:02:49.980> lot<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.220> component<00:02:50.850> movements<00:02:51.330> in

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
a lot of component movements in

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.100 
a lot of component movements in
variation<00:02:52.709> movements<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.280> those<00:02:53.459> exercises

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
variation movements of those exercises

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.240 
variation movements of those exercises
so<00:02:55.110> i<00:02:55.140> think<00:02:55.260> that's<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.709> first<00:02:55.950> thing<00:02:56.070> you

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
so i think that's the first thing you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.830 
so i think that's the first thing you
have<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.459> do<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.910> get<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.120> developer<00:02:57.660> a

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
have to do is you get a developer a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.560 
have to do is you get a developer a
foundation<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.770> prime<00:02:59.070> movers<00:02:59.490> you<00:03:00.390> have

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
foundation in the prime movers you have

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.480 
foundation in the prime movers you have
to

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
to

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.840 
to
balance<00:03:02.300> your<00:03:02.420> work<00:03:02.630> with<00:03:02.840> each<00:03:02.990> join<00:03:03.320> area

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
balance your work with each join area

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.390 
balance your work with each join area
with<00:03:04.850> our<00:03:05.030> program<00:03:05.540> we<00:03:05.570> spent<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.080> lot<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.260> time

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
with our program we spent a lot of time

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.800 
with our program we spent a lot of time
developing<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.880> hamstrings<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.540> glutes

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
developing the hamstrings and glutes

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.390 
developing the hamstrings and glutes
because<00:03:09.230> those<00:03:09.590> are<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.770> muscle<00:03:10.070> groups<00:03:10.250> to

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
because those are the muscle groups to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.370 
because those are the muscle groups to
put<00:03:10.550> forcing<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.120> ground<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:12.080> help<00:03:12.260> to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
put forcing the ground and help to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.200 
put forcing the ground and help to
propel<00:03:12.740> your<00:03:12.860> hips<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.250> year<00:03:13.550> need<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.850> Strad

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
propel your hips you year need a Strad

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.200 
propel your hips you year need a Strad
length

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
length

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.930 
length
so<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.800> that's<00:03:17.160> what<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.520> have<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.700> be

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
so I think that's what you have to be

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.520 
so I think that's what you have to be
first<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.390> get<00:03:18.600> your<00:03:18.780> numbers<00:03:19.140> up<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
first to get your numbers up in the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.570 
first to get your numbers up in the
primary<00:03:20.040> movements<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:21.750> start<00:03:22.110> lifting<00:03:22.580> for

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
primary movements but start lifting for

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.950 
primary movements but start lifting for
technique<00:03:24.200> safety<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.470> then<00:03:26.370> make<00:03:26.970> small

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
technique safety and then make small

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.280 
technique safety and then make small
incremental<00:03:28.830> gains<00:03:29.070> as<00:03:29.460> you<00:03:29.790> go<00:03:30.290> maintaining

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
incremental gains as you go maintaining

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.650 
incremental gains as you go maintaining
perfect<00:03:31.740> technique<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.640> maintain<00:03:33.120> safety

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
perfect technique and maintain safety

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.320 
perfect technique and maintain safety
and<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:35.100> know<00:03:35.190> everybody<00:03:35.490> with<00:03:35.910> regard<00:03:36.270> to

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
and you know everybody with regard to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.450 
and you know everybody with regard to
bench<00:03:36.600> press<00:03:36.720> wants<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.470> try<00:03:37.680> bench<00:03:38.010> press<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
bench press wants to try bench press the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.600 
bench press wants to try bench press the
hall<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.060> two<00:03:39.240> months<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.770> I<00:03:41.190> think<00:03:41.370> you

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
hall in two months and so I think you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.740 
hall in two months and so I think you
have<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.880> take<00:03:42.090> your<00:03:42.240> time<00:03:42.480> with<00:03:42.720> that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
have to take your time with that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.000 
have to take your time with that
movement<00:03:43.200> take

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
movement take

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.319 
movement take
eat<00:03:44.220> your<00:03:44.400> crepes<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:46.140> then<00:03:46.560> with<00:03:47.329> exercises

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
eat your crepes and then with exercises

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.960 
eat your crepes and then with exercises
such<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:48.540> squat<00:03:49.019> power<00:03:49.409> clean<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:50.069> lot<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.760> times

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
such as squat power clean a lot of times

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.550 
such as squat power clean a lot of times
people<00:03:51.180> aren't<00:03:51.540> lifting<00:03:51.689> heavy<00:03:52.049> enough<00:03:52.349> to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
people aren't lifting heavy enough to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.390 
people aren't lifting heavy enough to
make<00:03:52.739> progress<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:54.980> bottom<00:03:55.980> line<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.280> you

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
make progress so bottom line is you

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.220 
make progress so bottom line is you
gotta<00:03:56.549> work<00:03:56.760> hard<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.239> got<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.840> sound

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
gotta work hard and got have a sound

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.860 
gotta work hard and got have a sound
program<00:03:58.739> Jack<00:03:59.730> you<00:04:00.420> know

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
program Jack you know

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.570 
program Jack you know
things<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.200> face<00:04:01.409> also<00:04:01.830> doing<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.190> baseball

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
things I face also doing the baseball

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.990 
things I face also doing the baseball
player

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
player

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.580 
player
and<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.390> old-school<00:04:04.780> mentality<00:04:04.900> there's<00:04:05.440> the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
and the old-school mentality there's the

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.470 
and the old-school mentality there's the
baseball<00:04:05.740> players<00:04:06.010> shouldn't<00:04:06.400> attend<00:04:06.820> and<00:04:07.180> I

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
baseball players shouldn't attend and I

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.060 
baseball players shouldn't attend and I
try<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.720> explain<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.380> fact<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.740> they<00:04:08.920> go

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
try to explain the fact that they go

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.209 
try to explain the fact that they go
through<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.310> ton<00:04:09.490> of<00:04:09.550> volume

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:12.219 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.220 

that<00:04:13.219> with<00:04:13.459> it

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
that with it

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.670 
that with it
feldman<00:04:15.040> foundation<00:04:15.670> will<00:04:15.790> strengthen

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
feldman foundation will strengthen

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.030 
feldman foundation will strengthen
and<00:04:16.829> their<00:04:17.009> success<00:04:17.370> on

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.140 

baseball<00:04:22.040> teams<00:04:22.280> one<00:04:22.490> of<00:04:22.580> our<00:04:22.670> artists<00:04:23.000> work

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
baseball teams one of our artists work

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.450 
baseball teams one of our artists work
with<00:04:23.330> teams<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:23.930> we<00:04:24.560> certainly<00:04:24.800> do<00:04:25.130> string

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
with teams and we certainly do string

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.900 
with teams and we certainly do string
through<00:04:25.700> anyway<00:04:26.710> we<00:04:27.710> don't<00:04:27.830> do<00:04:28.100> quite<00:04:28.550> as<00:04:28.700> much
