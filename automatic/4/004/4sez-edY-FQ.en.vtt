00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.279
How can you say that you love God, whom you
donâ€™t see? 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.640
If you do not love your neighbor whom you see

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.360
I was hungry and you gave me to eat. 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.360
Hungry not only for bread, hungry for love

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.899
For that tender concern of somebody

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.340
Naked, I was naked and you clothed me. 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.800
Not only with a piece of cloth

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.460
Nakedness is that loss of that beautiful human dignity.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.140
The dignity that has been created to love
and to be loved

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.520
I was homeless and you took me in. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.040
Not only for a house made of bricks

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.520
A life homeless, unwanted, unloved. A throwaway
of society.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.240
But today we have, right here in our country.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.080
Are we there? To be that love, that kindness,
that thoughtfulness to them.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.640
And share with them that terrible pain. The
terrible feeling of terrible loneliness.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.880
Be somebody to somebody.
