looking at death from above here Blass
and<00:00:34.630> Sinestro's<00:00:35.500> might<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:37.510> have<00:00:37.780> some<00:00:38.050> cards

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
and Sinestro's might we have some cards

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.020 
and Sinestro's might we have some cards
here<00:00:38.470> at<00:00:38.770> one<00:00:39.100> card<00:00:39.430> here<00:00:39.640> we're<00:00:39.820> going<00:00:39.940> to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
here at one card here we're going to

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.600 
here at one card here we're going to
upgrade<00:00:40.180> that<00:00:40.660> and<00:00:41.110> we<00:00:41.770> have<00:00:41.980> some<00:00:42.160> upgrades

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
upgrade that and we have some upgrades

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.460 
upgrade that and we have some upgrades
here<00:00:42.790> we<00:00:42.910> can<00:00:43.090> upgrade<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:44.080> we<00:00:44.170> can<00:00:44.350> use

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
here we can upgrade that so we can use

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.740 
here we can upgrade that so we can use
it<00:00:44.650> so<00:00:45.430> we're<00:00:45.760> going<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:46.000> dive<00:00:46.210> right<00:00:46.240> into

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
it so we're going to dive right into

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
it so we're going to dive right into
battle<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.470> check<00:00:48.160> out<00:00:48.370> his<00:00:48.700> moves

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
battle and check out his moves

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.510 
battle and check out his moves
personally<00:00:51.760> I<00:00:52.270> think<00:00:52.830> Sinestro's<00:00:53.830> moves<00:00:54.250> are

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
personally I think Sinestro's moves are

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.110 
personally I think Sinestro's moves are
weak<00:00:54.760> but<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.530> know<00:00:56.650> I<00:00:56.920> think<00:00:57.610> it's<00:00:57.880> one<00:00:58.090> of

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
weak but you know I think it's one of

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.010 
weak but you know I think it's one of
the<00:00:58.300> beginner<00:00:58.720> cards<00:00:59.230> that's<00:01:00.010> my<00:01:00.220> opinion<00:01:01.020> so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
the beginner cards that's my opinion so

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.450 
the beginner cards that's my opinion so
we're<00:01:02.170> going<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.380> be<00:01:02.440> fighting<00:01:02.680> Green<00:01:03.010> Lantern
