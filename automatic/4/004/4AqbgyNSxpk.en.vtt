00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:10.349
 Hello, my nickname in the game classes 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.330
 Tomorrow Alexey so that arrow video 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.400
 morazor 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.300
 did tells things or three things 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.580
 which i don't agree for example want 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.410
 singing from wargaming wants to not 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.890
 great way into the system which 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.640
 pronounced bad players and good 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.739
 players and bad players to play with 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.649
 bad players in random and good with 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.750
 good such a wall was made in 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.910
 team battle mode but this mode is not 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.500
 tell him not interested that's why 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:54.059
 not interested in the question most likely someone 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.370
 watched video games wargaming leagues finale 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.559
 video where 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.100
 put were so high that neither 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.460
 one of the teams did not dare to go 1 to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.880
 reduced tanks because the feature 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.880
 world of tanks 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.030
 Audrey Hepburn is what you get at you 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.909
 the sight is reduced that is, you do not spend three 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.159
 seconds to reduce in 3 seconds 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.140
 destroy this here in other games this 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 a little bit different there is africa 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.290
 normal here this was not information in 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.070
 the tanks then the fighting principle was country 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.659
 very so fast that's worth a month 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.840
 and what is religion 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.549
 only the latest fights of the highest 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.240
 the pillar on the lan final were 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.400
 another sedentary are of little interest this 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.259
 all the fights before were very interesting 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.729
 active and just completed 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.720
 pleasure wave I opened part 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.750
 just crazy things here but there is one 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.670
 the feature is that if you move away from 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.470
 randomizers will come in command 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.750
 the battle will come to all 42 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.180
 then and from them not to leave an empty space 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 quite simply 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:08.970
 Murazor is talking about some kind of game 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.060
 team communication things that are in the hospital 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.430
 principle absent naturally 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.720
 interaction and team 1 and communication and so 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.640
 further so on joke spends but 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.620
 skill is so low that you have random 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.050
 only play with weak holes in 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.730
 randomness of strong players there do not even have those 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.550
 who say what we are there style what in 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.430
 randomness is all here but weak because 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.260
 even really strong players 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.420
 maternity hospital plays worse than usual because 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.530
 that degree of concentration is another importance 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.860
 the match is different 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.950
 and and by such not so much here 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.069
 so those who want to play strong 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.959
 players just go to tournaments 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.970
 Come to the USSR 2 to play and command 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.549
 fight and you will have fun 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.810
 rowing friends I personally do not play Rada 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.819
 because there is so much no mode 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.720
 not interesting that is what beat this 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.760
 strain strain better why 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.870
 strain with battles that nothing 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.730
 then let's say in random when you can 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.510
 have to bo yak it means something which 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.160
 I can ask you to give in the hospital there 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.209
 used to swing those just now this 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.799
 properties gone gone because who 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.069
 swing equipment you slowly swing 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:32.840
 appliances will already be new that's why I 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.569
 urge i urge not hundred percent 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.019
 trust the theme will finish that you there 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:43.670
 signed it is not always and generally in this 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:45.290
 topic but if you don't need to sing from 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.900
 developers what to do to do it 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.639
 so dad is not an officer stupidly oil is this 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:56.269
 all nonsense developers are maintained because 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:58.549
 what did the girl say you did this to her 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.079
 bend everything else that's not this 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.290
 it was necessary to do absolutely and art not 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.940
 mistakes start 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.670
 what if you just don't build something 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.950
 either go to another game or you go 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.950
 in another decided you will be ordered by another mode 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.000
 come and play there when it comes 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.970
 maternity hospital 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.730
 such skill balance is unknown as 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.850
 will determine the skills of the morazor is burning the skill is 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.490
 I filled damage by 48 winning percentage, I stuffed 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.340
 damage damage if your team lost 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.370
 nothing means ural means down 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.090
 the team won protect me 100 and if 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.260
 you filled the damage mc water lost this your 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.360
 Damage can be created place because from 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.250
 neither cold nor hot it would be better 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.950
 did something different to win then 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.390
 rose captured covered his comrades 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:53.600
 my body on the efficiency has changed all water makers such 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.419
 Here are the speakers say in a random 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.610
 damage I finish my mouth for 10 400 thousand 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:02.060
 replay lie damage will not kill 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.000
 bushes and shoots sheep there still go 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.150
 without such here they shoot 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.720
 here I am a cool player this is not you cool 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.660
 a player is all dudes go there Hodor 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.440
 just crawls out for you and it all does 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.180
 all this nonsense is complete this damage your all 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.240
 want to win i play believe for 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.520
 pleasures than not winning 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:32.290
 eyes are you here buck are turning that models 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.970
 everyone is cunning everyone wants to win just 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.680
 live say i don't feel like it 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.550
 make an effort something learn to play 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.830
 think before verse immediately to be recognized 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.190
 good it seems to me very 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.900
 big mistake so but it is purely mine 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.669
 opinion that is, I did not want to offend anyone 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.860
 nothing therefore so if something 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:59.110
 still will worry write down vidos can 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.110
 be say something come on .
