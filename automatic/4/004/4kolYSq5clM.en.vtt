00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 ah 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.380
 hello everyone at levels to this new 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.180
 video - Austin Gamer and from the most 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.550
 big live this channel like we are 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.440
 with the third chapter of this series 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.720
 that I really like to do today we are going to 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.820
 be doing the good one less 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.160
 quite weird a quite different menu 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.620
 to all files fredys because I'm going to 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.280
 be using for a menu picture 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.770
 different from what there is normally defined 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.710
 is fredys de es coll d'en freddy and 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.330
 As you can see there is a change to golden phantom 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:56.620
 front as you see is normal and then 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:58.839
 normal and pas ok missing a goal from fred and 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.600
 more or less and if they want to know how 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.839
 do more or less this I think I made a 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.440
 video and if I did not do it I 'm sorry but of 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.830
 doing freddy going down to freddy ok 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.420
 then they can learn how to do 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.400
 any animatronic in this way I 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.280
 it was pretty enough but names of 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.799
 game as you see is the delfinato fredys 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.690
 of number 3 and as you see I have the 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.480
 name for the new 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.920
 fang in the third part of my daughter 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.080
 funding the years later of the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.300
 animatronics that is to call the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.190
 animatronic lost but I do not know if it is 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.160
 I do not know if I'm going to do a prequel 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.840
 or is going to be a sequel the new button 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.120
 game that takes it from an image of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.680
 Juanes is Felix just like the Bati game 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.470
 although for the world we are going to need 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.540
 only that and a static is 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.820
 static and now get out of there god what 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.980
 it's static I took it out of a forum 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.680
 fayette of ladies fans are not going to 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.960
 find another static in no other 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.140
 place said come here is the static 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.370
 here it is and then first of all we are going to 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.980
 start with static in background 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.860
 we still other cameras 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.140
 then easier mainly than 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.180
 we need at the moment you can create 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.250
 the objects are created here with this 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.830
 blue bar if they did not know they will arrive 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.960
 the objects of the gif image and that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.020
 is going to have then I have put a 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.820
 which song is our song 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.060
 mind the menu on the page 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.730
 fredys 1 so is the cinema happy 1 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.459
 pretty good that unfortunately not 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.860
 He had a lot of knowledge in this 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.349
 define tro fredys how to put the song 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.209
 so let's go the create level when 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.470
 this object is created when it is created 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.760
 Well, I also know when we created the song 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.450
 let's go min 1 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.519
 assange and print sound and we choose the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.709
 that menu and for it to repeat itself and 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.959
 repeat then we give ok where it says 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.060
 false truck because as it says in the 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.830
 video what we give him I did not want anymore 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.150
 had an indication 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.370
 here in the name it will not have 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.140
 nothing so true here in Golden 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.410
 freddy will have a depth of 1 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.200
 same as the button just like the button 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.120
 new girl and the name is going to have all the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.840
 depth of a few menu blocks by 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.760
 its depth 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.090
 because here we will choose as we go 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.390
 to choose the spr name of the game 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.569
 here equal with goal of fred and we are going to 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.730
 nothing nothing else has visible and profound and 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.260
 it would be everything with the moment it took everything 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.180
 We can have the same as the name 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.170
 of the game but now we 're going here to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.120
 telvent mouse the pocket like menem 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.370
 there is no stain the top 10 other 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.709
 video to we're not going to go to one and you 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.230
 let's give here this that says nets room 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.700
 we add it and we're going to not put a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.430
 transition that you want me to 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.380
 this case I put the funk I say that 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.599
 it's about eating personals with which you 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.430
 darkens on a screen and started it on 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.019
 game is the best that can be 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.720
 chosen for these only for the 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.430
 button of the new game that the static I 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.530
 I put static cam because it is also 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.819
 of the camera and it will not have anything is not going 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.519
 to have depth no more than being 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.329
 visible and will have then that lose 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.220
 static ok so they know and now the 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.079
 menu what dimensions does it have then 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.180
 the same dimensions as camera 2 and 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.709
 Well, we put the names where 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.150
 you want but he's going to tell us how 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.210
 the static is put on camera 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.670
 but as you see here it says more or less 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.440
 below where it says that the object that 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.240
 we select says more or less here about 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.130
 commands that we can grab then 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.530
 what are we going to use then let's grab the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.670
 static and still test maintaining 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.180
 the left button, we're going to 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.950
 drag to here and then not because then 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.140
 would be everything and we put it equal to this 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.760
 another static to the size of this person 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.490
 and we do not have complications where there 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.010
 complications here as you see we are by 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.660
 up and the static goes up more than 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.540
 because then the only thing we're going to 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.060
 do and we're going to crush this again and 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.520
 now alt and as we see with him we can 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.140
 move it towards us we are then 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.840
 we are going to render the project and now 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.450
 you know in ibi guys how are ya seeing 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.460
 started the game and how they see how I am 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.100
 giving with the cangas and then animation 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.750
 it looks super slow but you should 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.950
 then to leave is super fast 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.610
 animation and as you see it says 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.500
 bainet a freddy 20 years later the anima 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.480
 lost technician and as you see is 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.280
 showing golden freddy but 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.960
 it's not going to be Fred's goal and the 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.080
 animatronic that is lost then 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.440
 we bet you we give click to new game 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.070
 because I in your new game for you 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.100
 can give is whole space and as you can see 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.630
 we spent at least this game first 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.320
 and as good by God you proportion 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.560
 because the menu is at the level of the 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.540
 camera ok and as you see here is the rule 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.860
 static and I think in the room 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.020

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.270

 more the dolphins are fredys test and the 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.330
