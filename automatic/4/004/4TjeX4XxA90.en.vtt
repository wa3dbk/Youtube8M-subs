00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.700
 to grill weather and we want them 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.750
 give tips today by the professional 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.179
 we are here at the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 fleischerei Prussian in ostpreußen 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.309
 prepared two plates what do we have 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 because here everything yes I want the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.820
 opportunity to use a few products 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.760
 imagine introducing 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.640
 that would be among other things the high one 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.260
 bratwurst and gebrüder bratwurst since 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.400
 are actually the classics the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.949
 actually in every specialized trade 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.960
 should be available my assortment 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.020
 then expands to a good one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.860
 bratwurst or a traffic that is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.399
 this french prince bratwurst 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.270
 spicy 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.910
 then, among other things, I have a new one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 grill rod of Provence as 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.930
 a brewed bratwurst of herbs 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.910
 provence also a very strong one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 Maybe not for every taste 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.789
 child suitable but for adults 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.399
 always and as a new in the range have 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.530
 i have a round bratwurst here i have 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.019
 similar to how herbal 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.510
 provence, therefore, from the optics 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.640
 therefore is a protein-thumb can be 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 You can have a good meal with barbecue 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.780
 a bit simply taste strong 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 also due to the beef 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.270
 still fry or art roman 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.500
 what is that now the roaster roast the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.229
 maybe many people know about this 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 holiday that is again meat cheese 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.009
 it is said to roast roasted 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.729
 meatloaf so what's great 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.369
 Grill in the toast bread for a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.770
 child sold as hamburger in the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.009
 Kind tastes very hearty is also very 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.570
 delicious 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.409
 then you can times the meat during 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.890
 meat we have different with us 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.140
 sorts 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.009
 that would be once from the pork 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.710
 the marinated paprika steaks or the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.110
 marinated herring steaks around ours 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.060
 it is natural to extend the offer 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.979
 you also need that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.500
 to the women thinks of the people thinks 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.060
 who might live a bit too 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.030
 we have a lean ground in the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.220
 offer as well as two three weeks new 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.220
 such small boats have to happen 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.190
 in between times a bit 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.110
 have the baguette in one hand and the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.060
 another hand and then off you go 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.430
 used a gas grill here now 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.650
 they are a special condition 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.830
 especially for gas you prefer gas or 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.630
 Charcoal or as it says that 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.730
 so for me it is now in this 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.970
 moment practical because the grill area 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.130
 bigger is certainly one grills you too 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.250
 Four or five are enough for a smaller one 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.590
 charcoal grill off for me it is now 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.630
 the practical certainly a 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.780
 charcoal grill is just as suitable 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.010
 everyone like his likes everyone 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.950
 also has his own preferences when 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.080
 to grill and that should also do what 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.730
 you should pay attention to the barbecue 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.140
 yes, many people agree that let that 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.120
 maybe robs too long and that is 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.209
 then dead fried what would they do for that 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.040
 give tips by the special feature 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.709
 my steaks by that I the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.820
 steaks before citizens can the marinade 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.890
 move in better 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.680
 the butcher is torn and the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.900
 Steaks remain softer overall 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.350
 this is similar to the effect of the schnitzel 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.390
 Knocking as you know from the past 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.829
 This is of course this time 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.660
 much shorter it is just important 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.060
 in my opinion to see that one 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.150
 The steaks are not three four times on the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.000
 Grill really turns it on 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.980
 noise at the beginning of this star must there 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.170
 then you know the grill is hot 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.350
 Enough and then you should be quiet times 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.569
 12 minutes are not equal 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.269
 then start to turn turn then turn 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.470
 when they close the pores first and 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.470
 then the steak will only have 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.100
 b 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.170
 so far we have a steak 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.820
 turned then you realize when it's time 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.820
 is that to turn 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.820
 i can recommend this to you as soon as you leave 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.050
 note that on the top of the page 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.780
 not yet grilled 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.790
 such moisture will emerge a bit 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.980
 to turn the steak 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.870
 then you can know below that 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.410
 pores closed the moisture must 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.480
 somewhere 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.560
 now it's going up, so down 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.810
 to accept that 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.450
 the steak is through now i take 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.560
 just there it is already nice in 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.690
 the consistency is not so 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.240
 spongy and drews just number and 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.130
 you can see the page would be ready 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.290
 is were 1 to 2 minutes 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.060
 the other side again so much and 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.740
 then you can eat while you see 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.900
 the bratwurst still needs one 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.710
 Mute is a lot of protein in it 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.150
 that's why alves low also very fast 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.280
 are also the good things essential 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.780
 rather than a bratwurst thing 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.820
 You should especially with bratwurst 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.760
 So pay close attention to this rough one 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.380
 and and that is the brewed 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.260
 certainly something of the matter for me 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.220
 I prefer to cut my advice 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.590
 always a little bit 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.760
 in my opinion, the 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.620
 distribute heat better 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.760
 the bratwurst stretches better 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.190
 is easier 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.640
 you can turn it better it will not 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.110
 such a grilled sausage and you see 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.720
 then on this page 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.460
 that the startup process a lot 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.370
 more even than just one 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.010
 but place over the whole sausage 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.890
 I would now agree that 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.010
 steak is ready grilled it is still 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.860
 juicy is still soft and that 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.590
 guaranteed roads 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.400
 a tip maybe in front of me me 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.580
 prefer 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.700
 After grilling, the meat quietly 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.690
 to rest for two minutes 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.180
 you can then get any 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.759
 take commercial containers 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.009
 then to put the meat in there 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.190
 and as long as maybe lying in it 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:00.070
 leave until the other grillgut 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.990
 then the meat juice has finished 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.669
 evenly distributed in the meat 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.500
 bleed the juice is not equal 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.850
 out and that stays juicy longer 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.060
 the flesh what do you think of it? 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.729
 if this method with beer to extinguish 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.520
 the flames are coming up i think that 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.320
 if you have to quench beer with the 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.860
 Grill did not burn properly 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.479
 let a charcoal grill should 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.910
 To be determined when the charcoal knows 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.400
 is this douse this with beer 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.789
 actually only arises when this fat 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.860
 from the sausage or from the meat in 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.479
 the flames defies the fat inflamed 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.169
 and then you have to burn it 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.570
 clear course 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.520
 but I think if you are a bit 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.789
 It's nice to grill like I do 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.099
 shown here is not necessary with 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.259
 we cancel as if it were natural 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:49.090
 Just try it and love them 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.330
 spectators we wish a lot of fun 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.330
 grilling 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:58.349
 I think I did quite well
