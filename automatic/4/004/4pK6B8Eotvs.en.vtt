00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
filter that it has but I believe it's a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.209 
filter that it has but I believe it's a
little<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.430> more<00:01:56.909> appropriate<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.810> dry<00:01:58.740> skin

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
properties so that's it then

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.130

looks like this and on my skin it looks

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.880 
looks like this and on my skin it looks
like<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.150> as<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.390> can<00:02:23.540> see<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.380> not<00:02:24.590> my

like this as you can see this is not my
skin<00:02:25.370> tone<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.260> very<00:02:27.470> very

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
skin tone but this is very very

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.300 
skin tone but this is very very
blendable<00:02:28.370> as<00:02:28.640> well<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.480> very<00:02:29.780> sheer<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.680> I'm

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
blendable as well and very sheer so I'm

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.080 
blendable as well and very sheer so I'm
just<00:02:31.550> going<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.709> blend<00:02:33.709> this<00:02:34.010> into<00:02:34.370> my<00:02:34.640> skin

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
just going to blend this into my skin

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.820 
just going to blend this into my skin
and<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.640> see<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.540> didn't<00:02:39.140> leave<00:02:39.530> that

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
and as you can see it didn't leave that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.479 
and as you can see it didn't leave that
really<00:02:40.280> really<00:02:40.959> dark<00:02:41.959> color<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.890> blend<00:02:43.280> it

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
really really dark color it blend it

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.900 
really really dark color it blend it
into<00:02:43.970> my<00:02:44.120> skin<00:02:44.510> tone<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:45.140> perfectly<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.610> I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
into my skin tone like perfectly so I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.050 
into my skin tone like perfectly so I
guess<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.720> shade<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.769> fits<00:02:49.100> like

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
guess this is the shade that fits like

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.900 
guess this is the shade that fits like
all<00:02:50.720> skin<00:02:51.170> types<00:02:51.470> because<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:52.340> won't<00:02:52.670> really

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
all skin types because it won't really

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.810 
all skin types because it won't really
give<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.140> lot<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.380> coverage<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.640> lot<00:02:55.790> of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
give you a lot of coverage and a lot of

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.840 
give you a lot of coverage and a lot of
color<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:57.410> one<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.709> again<00:02:58.190> very<00:02:58.220> very

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
color this one is again very very

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.350 
color this one is again very very
nourishing<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.580> use<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.970> in

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
nourishing and I like to use it in

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.170 
nourishing and I like to use it in
winter<00:03:02.720> time<00:03:03.140> when<00:03:03.440> when<00:03:04.010> my<00:03:04.190> skin<00:03:04.610> has<00:03:05.150> a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
winter time when when my skin has a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.050 
winter time when when my skin has a
little<00:03:05.600> bit<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:05.989> dry<00:03:06.410> area<00:03:06.769> on<00:03:07.220> my<00:03:07.430> forehead

and I don't really need to worry about
my<00:04:35.889> sun<00:04:36.220> protection<00:04:36.639> because<00:04:37.150> this<00:04:37.389> already

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
but it gives the best coverage of all

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.709
