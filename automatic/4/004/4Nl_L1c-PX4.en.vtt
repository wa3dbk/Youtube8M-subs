00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
I have these two edges already folded

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.630 
I have these two edges already folded
over<00:01:03.290> next<00:01:04.290> thing<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.070> fold

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
over next thing I'm going to do is fold

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.020 
over next thing I'm going to do is fold
it<00:01:05.760> again<00:01:05.880> clockwise<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.930> repeat<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.640> folding

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it again clockwise and repeat so folding

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.240 
it again clockwise and repeat so folding
it<00:01:09.150> over<00:01:09.390> again<00:01:09.510> about<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> quarter<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.130> inch

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

and<00:01:11.780> pressing<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:12.990> place<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and pressing that in place here it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.560 
and pressing that in place here it
really<00:01:14.369> helps<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.000> starch<00:01:15.299> because

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
really helps to have some starch because

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.850 
really helps to have some starch because
it<00:01:15.689> will<00:01:15.780> help<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> fabric<00:01:16.350> lay<00:01:16.650> nice<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it will help the fabric lay nice and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
it will help the fabric lay nice and
flat<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.549> without<00:01:17.700> having<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.240> use<00:01:18.390> any

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
flat for you without having to use any

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:30.350 
flat for you without having to use any
pins<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:21.420> repeat<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:23.310> third<00:01:23.670> side

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.760 

after<00:01:31.360> you're<00:01:31.509> done<00:01:31.540> doing<00:01:31.899> that<00:01:32.200> one<00:01:32.500> time

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
after you're done doing that one time

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.310 
after you're done doing that one time
fold-over<00:01:33.310> for<00:01:33.759> all<00:01:33.909> four<00:01:34.240> sides<00:01:34.479> next<00:01:35.170> thing

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
fold-over for all four sides next thing

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.539 
fold-over for all four sides next thing
you<00:01:35.380> want<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.560> do<00:01:35.649> is<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:35.950> continue<00:01:36.159> in<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
you want to do is just continue in the

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.429 
you want to do is just continue in the
same<00:01:36.759> clockwise<00:01:37.149> rotation<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.930> do<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.290> same

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
same clockwise rotation and do the same

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.800 
same clockwise rotation and do the same
thing<00:01:38.649> again<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.280> that's<00:01:40.119> how<00:01:40.299> we<00:01:40.360> create<00:01:40.689> that

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
thing again so that's how we create that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.749 
thing again so that's how we create that
simple<00:01:41.200> hem<00:01:41.350> once<00:01:41.740> you're<00:01:41.950> doing<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.340> double

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
simple hem once you're doing this double

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.789 
simple hem once you're doing this double
fold<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.720> can<00:01:43.869> see<00:01:44.049> what<00:01:44.200> happens<00:01:44.530> when<00:01:44.649> I<00:01:44.680> get

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
fold you can see what happens when I get

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.770
