00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.070

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.110
 secret sauces and some magical touches 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.700
 that we seem to have hit the nail for 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.619
 the taste of our customers and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.409

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.299
 natural the English that contain the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.610
 cakes today an allusion was made 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.220
 to the day of the dead which is a tradition 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.990
 here in the country that is celebrated on the day of 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.000
 dead the first of November we see 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.649
 that everyone brings costumes today 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.690
 that you will practice to see the vision 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.149
 of the california angels how it came about 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.520
 this idea we really wanted to give you another 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.159
 image the business has about four 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.750
 years when the common idea of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.670
 those who collaborate here to give you a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.740
 more special touch to the business so that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.500
 every day that we celebrate here in Mexico 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.179
 be more highlighted by us by 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.920
 example now on the day of the dead all 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.600
 the collaborators the waiters by 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.259
 example have directly to our 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.420
 public 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.030
 disguised particularly of some 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.819
 there is some character allusive to the night of 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
 witches and so at each time of the year is it 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.750
 makes an allusion to the day that is 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.420
 celebrating and this has also brought the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.310
 people's attention and feel more 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.690
