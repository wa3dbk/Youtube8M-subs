00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
four degrees outside so I don't think

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.509 
four degrees outside so I don't think
I'm<00:03:17.560> gonna<00:03:17.650> be<00:03:17.739> riding<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:20.010> anytime<00:03:21.010> soon

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
already on I think the gear stuff is

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.479 
already on I think the gear stuff is
already<00:03:39.549> set<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.560> I'm<00:03:44.560> gonna<00:03:44.709> get<00:03:45.400> it

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
already set and so I'm gonna get it

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.440 
already set and so I'm gonna get it

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
together well here it is it's all put

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.470 
together well here it is it's all put
together<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:51.190> got<00:03:51.370> up<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.579> 15<00:03:52.090> degrees

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
together and it got up to 15 degrees

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.379 
together and it got up to 15 degrees
today<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.230> did<00:03:53.709> take<00:03:54.099> it<00:03:54.280> out<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.699> ride<00:03:55.150> it

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
today so I did take it out and ride it

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.309 
today so I did take it out and ride it
and<00:03:55.629> it<00:03:56.290> rode<00:03:56.560> very<00:03:56.919> well<00:03:57.250> rolls<00:03:58.209> good<00:03:58.629> shifted

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
and it rode very well rolls good shifted

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.039 
and it rode very well rolls good shifted
good<00:04:00.389> stopping<00:04:01.919> these<00:04:03.359> cheaper<00:04:04.359> side<00:04:04.660> pull

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
good stopping these cheaper side pull

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.740 
good stopping these cheaper side pull
brakes<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:07.510> pads<00:04:07.780> are<00:04:08.910> not<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.180> great

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
brakes the pads are not that great

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.990 
brakes the pads are not that great
I<00:04:10.780> think<00:04:11.199> the<00:04:11.319> brakes<00:04:11.590> they'll<00:04:12.220> work<00:04:12.430> fine<00:04:12.669> if

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
I think the brakes they'll work fine if

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.159 
I think the brakes they'll work fine if
you<00:04:13.150> get<00:04:13.599> some<00:04:13.810> new<00:04:13.959> pads<00:04:14.199> and<00:04:14.470> put<00:04:14.650> those<00:04:14.829> on

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
you get some new pads and put those on

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.320 
you get some new pads and put those on
but<00:04:17.169> as<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.739> is<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:19.090> better<00:04:19.389> plan<00:04:19.750> your<00:04:19.780> stops

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
but as it is you better plan your stops

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.510 
but as it is you better plan your stops
so<00:04:22.330> there's<00:04:23.050> nothing<00:04:23.380> hard<00:04:23.590> about<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:24.070> just

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
so there's nothing hard about that just

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.689 
so there's nothing hard about that just
be<00:04:25.300> mindful<00:04:25.720> of<00:04:25.840> what<00:04:26.139> you're<00:04:26.289> doing<00:04:26.699> you're

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
be mindful of what you're doing you're

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.939 
be mindful of what you're doing you're
not<00:04:27.880> going<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.120> be<00:04:28.270> coming<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:29.110> halt<00:04:29.530> yeah

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
not going to be coming to a halt yeah

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.610 
not going to be coming to a halt yeah
well<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.490> know<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:31.080> you're<00:04:32.080> not<00:04:32.260> going<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.470> be

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
well you know you you're not going to be

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.709 
well you know you you're not going to be
skidding<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.340> tires<00:04:33.639> or<00:04:34.150> anything<00:04:34.390> like<00:04:34.659> that

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:34.719 
skidding the tires or anything like that

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.080 
skidding the tires or anything like that
or<00:04:35.080> locking<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.590> up<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.610> really<00:04:36.789> probably

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
or locking it up and you really probably

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.140 
or locking it up and you really probably
don't<00:04:37.419> want<00:04:37.630> to

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
don't want to

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.409 
don't want to
but<00:04:40.540> $120<00:04:41.540> I've<00:04:41.990> seen<00:04:42.290> these<00:04:43.060> going<00:04:44.060> higher

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
but $120 I've seen these going higher

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.439 
but $120 I've seen these going higher
someplace<00:04:45.110> else<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:46.729> ones<00:04:46.940> that<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.210> saw

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
someplace else and the ones that I saw

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.780 
someplace else and the ones that I saw
going<00:04:47.840> higher

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
going higher

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.719 
going higher
they<00:04:49.790> had<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.060> Shimano<00:04:50.570> derailleur<00:04:51.290> and<00:04:51.729> they

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
they had a Shimano derailleur and they

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.090 
they had a Shimano derailleur and they
had<00:04:54.820> side<00:04:55.820> pole<00:04:56.120> brakes<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.590> think

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
had side pole brakes that I think

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.290 
had side pole brakes that I think
they're<00:04:58.250> called<00:04:58.460> Lennear<00:04:58.910> and<00:05:01.060> they<00:05:02.060> look

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
they're called Lennear and they look

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.060 
they're called Lennear and they look
like<00:05:02.479> higher<00:05:02.750> quality<00:05:03.380> brakes<00:05:03.680> than<00:05:03.889> what

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
like higher quality brakes than what

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.670

not gonna be all that difficult not a

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.800 
not gonna be all that difficult not a
big<00:06:27.590> deal<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:27.979> me<00:06:28.150> I'll<00:06:29.150> probably<00:06:29.389> wind<00:06:29.690> up

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
big deal to me I'll probably wind up

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.990 
big deal to me I'll probably wind up
getting<00:06:30.139> a<00:06:30.229> LED<00:06:30.889> light<00:06:31.160> set<00:06:31.520> for<00:06:31.849> it<00:06:31.940> and<00:06:32.949> just

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
getting a LED light set for it and just

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.779 
getting a LED light set for it and just
to<00:06:35.000> make<00:06:35.150> it<00:06:35.180> more<00:06:35.389> visible<00:06:36.190> especially<00:06:37.190> for

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
to make it more visible especially for

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:40.150 
to make it more visible especially for
the<00:06:37.880> rear<00:06:38.090> one<00:06:38.270> I<00:06:38.300> think<00:06:38.449> that<00:06:38.870> getting<00:06:39.650> one<00:06:40.039> of

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
the rear one I think that getting one of

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.850 
the rear one I think that getting one of
the<00:06:40.220> flashing<00:06:40.789> rear<00:06:41.419> LEDs<00:06:42.169> is<00:06:42.440> probably<00:06:42.770> a

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
the flashing rear LEDs is probably a

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.730 
the flashing rear LEDs is probably a
very<00:06:42.889> good<00:06:43.190> idea

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
very good idea

very good idea
it's<00:06:45.740> got

cheap plastic pedals on it again not a

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.320 
cheap plastic pedals on it again not a
big<00:06:51.820> deal

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
big deal
