00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.230
There are lots of ways to cook a meal.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.870
An oven, a stove, inside.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.870
Those are all great.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.400
But let's talk about something that's a lot
more fun: Moving outside and doing a barbecue

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.420
meal.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.189
How do you plan a menu for a summer barbecue?

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.580
There are two types of barbecues that I want
to talk about.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.899
Something quick and fast for your family.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.840
This could be something like doing some chicken
breast, doing some shish kebabs, a couple

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.210
sides, nothing better in the summer then grilled
corn, maybe some coleslaw, maybe a baked potato.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.360
Really fabulous way to come home from work
and in less than an hour put a really great

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.059
meal on the table.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.620
Not have to heat the house up with the stove.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.179
Not have to get the oven going.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.769
But a really quick delicious meal.

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.449
Now how you plan a barbecue menu for a larger
group?

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.780
You know, if you're talking 15, 20 25, even
a hundred people, there's two pieces of meat

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.780
that we recommend.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.190
The first is a pork butt.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.449
The second is a brisket.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.570
It's a really affordable way to cut cook for
a lot of people.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.710
You can take a brisket and probably cook for
20 people with one brisket.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.590
A pork butt probably 15 people.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.980
Some great sides, coleslaw, beans, again corn
is also really great in the summer.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.500
It's very quick.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.630
There's not really a lot of prep.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.530
You just soak in some water, thrown on the
grill, 20 minutes later, you've got some great

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.530
corn.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.750
The most important thing is to be creative.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.990
Have some fun.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.619
One of the things that we suggest when doing
a barbecue is for you to do than meat but

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.369
invite the people that are coming to bring
their favorite side.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.120
This is going to allow you to focus on the
star of the meal and allow your friends to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.780
bring the supporting cast which is going to
save you a lot of time in the kitchen and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.109
at the grill.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:52.170
Have fun with it.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.730
There's lots of stuff you can do in planning
a barbecue meal.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.760
It's really just up to your own imagination.
