can just be walked across just to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.270 
can just be walked across just to
compact<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> turf<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> soil<00:00:49.320> below<00:00:49.530> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
compact the turf into the soil below so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.979 
compact the turf into the soil below so
when<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> starts<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.969> root<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.449> establish<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
when it starts to root and establish it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.720 
when it starts to root and establish it
takes<00:00:52.199> nice<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> quickly<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.879> turf<00:00:55.399> is<00:00:56.399> very

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
takes nice and quickly the turf is very

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.689 
takes nice and quickly the turf is very
important<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.920> edges<00:00:59.309> nice<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
important to get the edges nice and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.750 
important to get the edges nice and
tight<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.239> there's<00:01:00.750> no<00:01:00.870> gaps<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.410> all<00:01:01.760> because

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
tight so there's no gaps at all because

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.479 
tight so there's no gaps at all because
if<00:01:03.329> there's<00:01:03.600> gaps<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.110> turf<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.530> dry<00:01:04.739> out<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
if there's gaps the turf can dry out and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
if there's gaps the turf can dry out and
can<00:01:05.670> create<00:01:05.939> problems<00:01:06.450> whilst<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.260> growing

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
can create problems whilst it's growing

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.280 
can create problems whilst it's growing
and<00:01:07.710> establishing<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> turf<00:01:09.990> in

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and establishing so you get the turf in

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.270 
and establishing so you get the turf in
a<00:01:10.470> nice<00:01:11.040> tight<00:01:11.930> version<00:01:13.909> pushing<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> in

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
a nice tight version pushing it in

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
a nice tight version pushing it in
unrolling<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.720> then<00:01:18.720> possibly<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.380> moving

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
unrolling and then possibly just moving

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.490 
unrolling and then possibly just moving
out<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.280> go

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
out as you go

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
out as you go
possibly<00:01:22.500> remove<00:01:22.860> any<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.970> bits<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
possibly remove any little bits of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.899 
possibly remove any little bits of
debris<00:01:24.650> or<00:01:25.650> grass<00:01:25.950> or<00:01:26.130> soil<00:01:26.369> might<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.790> the

debris or grass or soil might be on the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.469 
debris or grass or soil might be on the
surface<00:01:27.979> it's<00:01:28.979> important<00:01:29.490> also<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.909> bend<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
surface it's important also to bend the

surface it's important also to bend the
edges<00:01:30.570> over<00:01:31.100> at<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> end<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.049> tie<00:01:34.259> in

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
edges over at the end so it can tie in

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340 
edges over at the end so it can tie in
nicely<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> next<00:01:36.600> turf<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.170> lay

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
nicely with the next turf that you lay

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.830 
nicely with the next turf that you lay
and<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.579> second<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.560> again<00:01:40.560> unroll<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
and on to the second one again unroll it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
and on to the second one again unroll it
getting<00:01:42.840> into<00:01:43.049> position

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
getting into position

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.440 
getting into position
I'm<00:01:45.210> flapping<00:01:45.690> so<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.350> gaps<00:01:46.620> at<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.450> push

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I'm flapping so don't gaps at all push

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.130 
I'm flapping so don't gaps at all push
them<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.950> nice<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.190> tightly<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.690> then<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> roll

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
them in nice and tightly and then I roll

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380 
them in nice and tightly and then I roll
the<00:01:58.320> turf<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.100> time<00:01:59.340> making<00:01:59.940> sure<00:02:00.060> you're

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
can create a problem with the edges

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.830 
can create a problem with the edges
drying<00:02:22.709> up<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.819> make<00:02:24.000> sure<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.480> all<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
drying up to make sure that all the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.630 
drying up to make sure that all the
joints<00:02:25.080> are<00:02:25.440> staggered<00:02:26.959> such<00:02:27.959> as<00:02:28.140> this

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
joints are staggered such as this

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
joints are staggered such as this
they're<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> middle<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.180> turf<00:02:30.450> so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
they're in the middle of the turf so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.860 
they're in the middle of the turf so
that<00:02:31.380> no<00:02:31.890> areas<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.580> dry<00:02:32.849> up<00:02:32.880> quickly<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:33.690> they

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
that no areas can dry up quickly if they

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.540 
that no areas can dry up quickly if they
dry<00:02:34.080> up<00:02:34.110> then<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.739> create<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.010> problem<00:02:35.400> with

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
dry up then it can create a problem with

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.259 
dry up then it can create a problem with
the<00:02:35.670> turf<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.989> if<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.769> can<00:02:37.920> leave<00:02:38.269> somewhere

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
the turf so if you can leave somewhere

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.789 
the turf so if you can leave somewhere
between<00:02:39.510> 18<00:02:40.349> inches<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.160> 2<00:02:41.700> feet<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:43.500> joins

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
between 18 inches to 2 feet on the joins

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.940 
between 18 inches to 2 feet on the joins
like<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.750> turf<00:02:45.930> doesn't<00:02:46.319> dry<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
like this so the turf doesn't dry up and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.110 
like this so the turf doesn't dry up and
then<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:49.319> will<00:02:49.500> establish<00:02:49.650> again<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.580> lot

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
then it will establish again a lot

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.710 
then it will establish again a lot
quicker<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.910> lot<00:02:54.030> better<00:02:54.239> without<00:02:54.360> any

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
quicker and a lot better without any

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.559 
quicker and a lot better without any
issues<00:02:55.079> at<00:02:55.200> all<00:02:55.849> once<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.030> turf<00:02:57.239> has<00:02:57.390> been

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
issues at all once the turf has been

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.830 
issues at all once the turf has been
laid<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.150> move<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.480> guy<00:03:00.660> off<00:03:00.720> a

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
laid you can then move this guy off a

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.940 
laid you can then move this guy off a
little<00:03:01.019> cross<00:03:01.579> hook<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:02.790> over<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:06.420> again<00:03:06.950> so

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
little cross hook it over and again so

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.890 
little cross hook it over and again so
you're<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.160> position<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.730> next<00:03:08.760> turf<00:03:09.120> at

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
you're in position for the next turf at

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.860 
you're in position for the next turf at
the<00:03:09.989> same<00:03:10.230> time<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:11.099> compacting<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.000> turf

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
the same time as compacting the turf

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.900 
the same time as compacting the turf
