00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.860 
you can use the same six ingredients in
two<00:01:36.400> completely<00:01:36.909> different<00:01:37.150> dishes<00:01:37.479> but<00:01:37.750> if

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
two completely different dishes but if

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.719 
two completely different dishes but if
you<00:01:37.960> cook<00:01:38.170> them<00:01:38.380> slightly<00:01:38.950> differently<00:01:39.430> in<00:01:39.580> a

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
you cook them slightly differently in a

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.280 
you cook them slightly differently in a
different<00:01:40.060> order<00:01:40.240> they<00:01:40.510> taste<00:01:40.780> completely

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
different order they taste completely

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.440 
different order they taste completely
different<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.670> know<00:01:42.790> what<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:42.940> wanted<00:01:43.300> to

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
different you know what I wanted to

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.450 
different you know what I wanted to
create<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.810> really<00:01:44.380> really<00:01:44.650> accessible<00:01:45.220> book

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
create a really really accessible book

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.060 
create a really really accessible book
and<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:46.420> wanted<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:46.990> feel<00:01:47.110> as<00:01:47.530> if<00:01:47.740> when<00:01:47.979> you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
and I wanted it to feel as if when you

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.410 
and I wanted it to feel as if when you
read<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.700> when<00:01:48.760> you<00:01:48.880> were<00:01:49.030> going<00:01:49.210> through

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
read it and when you were going through

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.880 
read it and when you were going through
the<00:01:49.600> recipes<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.080> was<00:01:50.229> almost<00:01:50.380> like<00:01:50.650> me

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
the recipes it was almost like me

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.260 
the recipes it was almost like me
sitting<00:01:51.190> there<00:01:51.460> talking<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:51.909> through<00:01:51.970> and

in<00:01:54.460> choice<00:01:54.670> food<00:01:54.909> isn't<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.360> difficult<00:01:55.570> to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
in choice food isn't that difficult to

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.860 
in choice food isn't that difficult to
cook<00:01:56.110> it's<00:01:56.409> just<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:57.120> you<00:01:58.120> use<00:01:58.420> slightly

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
cook it's just that you use slightly

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.390 
cook it's just that you use slightly
different<00:01:59.140> ingredients<00:01:59.950> but<00:01:59.979> there's

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
different ingredients but there's

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.830 
different ingredients but there's
slightly<00:02:00.640> different<00:02:01.060> disciplines<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.720> they

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
slightly different disciplines and they

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.810 
slightly different disciplines and they
behave<00:02:02.170> slightly<00:02:02.350> differently<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.340> once<00:02:03.700> you

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
behave slightly differently and once you

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.460 
behave slightly differently and once you
understand<00:02:04.299> all<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.840> becomes<00:02:05.110> really

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
understand all of that it becomes really

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.620 
understand all of that it becomes really
really<00:02:05.710> easy<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:06.430> experience<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.450> going<00:02:07.570> to

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
really easy so experience is going to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.690 
really easy so experience is going to
make<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:07.930> better<00:02:08.229> agent<00:02:08.709> cook<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.549> way
