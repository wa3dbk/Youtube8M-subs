00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.420
 hello thank you for watching now let's do 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:09.459
 some delicious mussels baked with 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.280
 a special senior sauce that 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:15.639
 I will show how to make it used 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.330
 much in sushi wars' on the seas of 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.390
 sushi 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.290
 here we have the mussels normally 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.350
 these already come like this get them already 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.080
 Cooked come frozen in boxes 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.599
 but if you buy them raw they come 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.390
 closed of course and 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.149
 and only puts them boil 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.430
 water and when they are opened they are removed 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.860
 cool and they're ready they're like this 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.030
 Well now what we are going to do is 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.030
 clean we remove them from here 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.980
 and what we are going to remove is this black 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.040
 which has next 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.230
 this is not good to eat it they do not take it away 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.879
 in some places but I always 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.320
 clean and I birther it in half so that 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.510
 it is easier to eat it 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.360
 we have clean also if it enters a 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.110
 kind of hair you have to take this off 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.110
 they did not bring it 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.289
 we put in an aluminum depends on the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 amount that it's going to be can then 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.659
 be a fret we have to put a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.409
 aluminum 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.659
 we already have the hob can not be a 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.500
 toaster or in an oven but what 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.049
 we use is the heat that comes from 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.329
 up and down does not have to be 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.420
 below and above only from above to 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.420
 down 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.530
 Now what we are going to do is our 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:48.409
 special sauce with mayonnaise our 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.409
 sauce they call marzos pod 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.930
 arshavin anita 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.510
 popular in their bars 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.660
 and we are going to put this is a cup of 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.660
 Mayonnaise 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.259
 and we're going to put two teaspoons of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.330
 kappelin roe 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.330
 it is very well known as more something 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.010
 and here we are going to put it well 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:26.330
 a teaspoon of sesame oil 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.330
 this gives it a lot of flavor 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.940
 and as in this case we want it spicy 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.210
 let's put some hot sauce 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.420
 of bottle in this case we use a 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.230
 very popular that is called gerard ya 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.230
 Vietnam 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.130
 we already return all the heat 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.160
 and we put them up 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.160
 we make good 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
 Y 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.180
 and we are going to put them in our blog 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.970
 until they are heard it sounds like thunder 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.580
 how the kappelin roe thunders and 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.430
 Now I'm going to show you when it's 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.159
 it gets 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.920
 as gold to line after five or 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:49.689
 six minutes we already have them as the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.689
 can see are 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.510
 thundering 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.549
 and there are brown landmarks above 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.549
 they are ready we are going to take them out 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.950
 you have to be careful because they are 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.700
 hot we hope a little bit that 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.700
 cool we arrange them as we look 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.270
 on a plate with any decoration that 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.270
 like you 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.000
 the amount of mayonnaise we made 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.970
 achieves 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.080
 about a dozen of these 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.080
 clams or mussels 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.730
 the passing new zealand clams are 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.730
 the green ones 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:05.430
 we are going to put 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.430
 Optional slices of avocado 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.500
 the same without the avocado 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.090
 my hands are clean that's why I 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.360
 I dare to touch 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.449
 the avocado with your hands here we're going 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.750
 to put is also optional sauce 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.750
 Eel or you can use teriyaki sauce 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.100
 and do 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.550
 a bit of toasted sesame goes very 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.550
 all right 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.009
 have to put a few drops of the sauce 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.039
 so that it gives equal color 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.039
 to the plate 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.199
 believe me they are delicious 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.199
 and I hope you enjoy them, thank you for watching
