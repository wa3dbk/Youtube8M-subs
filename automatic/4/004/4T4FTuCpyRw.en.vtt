 hands 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.789
 urgent need to walk the first rocket 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.500
 use this method while parents 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.149
 sleep come and alarm for an hour later 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.100
 so you will oversleep the first lessons 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.079
 get explanatory and remember what 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 skipping school is not good school 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.260
 frequency classmates believe your pens 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.239
 so that this does not happen change 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.559
 I think a little post red pen on blue 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.610
 someone from your class 1 on suddenly 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.610

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.920
 phone school take advantage of it 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.150
 method put him in flight mode so 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.670
 you disable all wireless interfaces 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.100
 and by the exit you will have about 60 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.210
 percent 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.680
 quite often you need to read something in 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.450
 books for the last time they are some 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.979
 uncomfortable to read more conveniently 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.960
 take a hanger with clips into it 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.740
 hold the book this way read be 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.740
 more comfortable 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.999
