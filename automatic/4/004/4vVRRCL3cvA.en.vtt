actually<00:00:12.490> a<00:00:12.520> bio<00:00:12.790> surfactant<00:00:13.540> works<00:00:13.840> by

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
actually a bio surfactant works by

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.260 
actually a bio surfactant works by
changing<00:00:14.050> water<00:00:14.650> surface<00:00:15.190> tension<00:00:15.580> reducing

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
changing water surface tension reducing

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.390 
changing water surface tension reducing
it<00:00:16.360> over<00:00:16.570> 70%<00:00:17.320> it<00:00:17.439> allows<00:00:17.680> water<00:00:18.010> to<00:00:18.220> penetrate

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
it over 70% it allows water to penetrate

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.670 
it over 70% it allows water to penetrate
through<00:00:19.150> and<00:00:19.779> the<00:00:19.869> theory<00:00:20.110> is<00:00:20.260> simple<00:00:20.500> if<00:00:20.590> you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
through and the theory is simple if you

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.290 
through and the theory is simple if you
put<00:00:20.950> water<00:00:21.100> between<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.610> surface<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.180> what's

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
put water between the surface and what's

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.820 
put water between the surface and what's
on<00:00:22.480> it<00:00:22.630> and<00:00:22.900> remove<00:00:23.200> the<00:00:23.320> friction<00:00:23.710> so

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
on it and remove the friction so

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.470 
on it and remove the friction so
everything<00:00:24.130> slides<00:00:24.430> right<00:00:24.640> off<00:00:24.700> and<00:00:25.180> give<00:00:25.390> you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
everything slides right off and give you
