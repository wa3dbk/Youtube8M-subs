work<00:00:03.570> smarter<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.680> while<00:00:05.220> back<00:00:05.460> my<00:00:05.640> wife<00:00:05.850> bought

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
work smarter a while back my wife bought

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.670 
work smarter a while back my wife bought
me<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.359> curved<00:00:06.690> making<00:00:07.049> jig<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.529> think

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
me this curved making jig and I think

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.900 
me this curved making jig and I think
this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.010> first<00:00:08.250> project<00:00:08.519> where<00:00:08.880> I

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
this is the first project where I

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.700 
this is the first project where I
actually<00:00:09.120> haven't<00:00:09.480> used<00:00:09.719> for<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.380> allows

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
actually haven't used for it it allows

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.830 
actually haven't used for it it allows
you<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.160> dial<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.820> occur<00:00:12.090> by<00:00:12.330> sending<00:00:12.719> this

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
you to dial and occur by sending this

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.360 
you to dial and occur by sending this
piece<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.170> metal<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.620> then<00:00:14.009> once<00:00:14.250> you're

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
piece of metal and then once you're

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.860 
piece of metal and then once you're
happy<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:14.700> your<00:00:14.820> curve<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.420> locked

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
happy with your curve you just locked

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.029 
happy with your curve you just locked
down<00:00:16.080> these<00:00:16.320> knobs<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:18.590> traced<00:00:19.590> out<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> curve

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
down these knobs I traced out the curve

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.029 
down these knobs I traced out the curve
onto<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.400> piece<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.640> scrap<00:00:21.090> pine<00:00:21.420> 2x4<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.560> this

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
onto a piece of scrap pine 2x4 and this

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.859 
onto a piece of scrap pine 2x4 and this
is<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> serve<00:00:23.609> as<00:00:23.880> my<00:00:24.269> template<00:00:24.660> later

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
is going to serve as my template later

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:48.900 
is going to serve as my template later
after<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> cut<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> out<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> pants<00:00:26.130> off

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.639 

by<00:00:49.910> using<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.300> template<00:00:50.690> I<00:00:50.870> traced<00:00:51.140> out<00:00:51.379> one

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
by using the template I traced out one

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:14.550 
by using the template I traced out one
side<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.129> tongs<00:00:52.370> on<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.910> piece<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.420> walnut

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.170 

it<00:01:15.560> looks<00:01:15.740> like<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.980> tongs<00:01:16.250> curved<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.910> little

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
it looks like the tongs curved a little

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.120 
it looks like the tongs curved a little
bit<00:01:17.300> too<00:01:17.510> much<00:01:17.750> in<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.110> direction<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:18.920> at<00:01:19.040> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
bit too much in this direction so at the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.040 
bit too much in this direction so at the
table<00:01:19.430> saw<00:01:19.580> on<00:01:19.760> this<00:01:19.970> come<00:01:20.150> cut<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.630> little<00:01:20.840> off

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
table saw on this come cut a little off

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.850 
table saw on this come cut a little off
at<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:21.320> end

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
at the end

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.380 
at the end
I<00:01:24.070> need<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.160> tops<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.580> both<00:01:25.700> pieces<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.270> be

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
I need the tops of both pieces to be

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.910 
I need the tops of both pieces to be
nice<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:26.780> flat<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.320> when<00:01:27.470> they<00:01:27.560> come<00:01:27.770> together

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
nice and flat so when they come together

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:44.480 
nice and flat so when they come together
they<00:01:28.250> form<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.670> nice<00:01:28.910> joint

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 

in<00:01:44.880> order<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.390> make<00:01:45.570> holding<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.049> Thomas<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
in order to make holding the Thomas a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.140 
in order to make holding the Thomas a
little<00:01:46.680> easier<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.130> went<00:01:47.400> ahead<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.610> traced<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
little easier I went ahead and traced a

00:01:48.150 --> 00:02:04.140 
little easier I went ahead and traced a
curve<00:01:48.420> onto<00:01:48.780> each<00:01:49.080> side<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> top

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.210 

on<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.230> end<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.440> each<00:02:05.560> tone<00:02:05.830> I'm<00:02:06.040> going<00:02:06.160> to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
on the end of each tone I'm going to

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:16.370 
on the end of each tone I'm going to
draw<00:02:06.400> a<00:02:06.430> radius<00:02:06.880> on<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.240> end<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.600> each<00:02:07.750> side

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.540 

next<00:02:17.380> thing<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:17.620> want<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.830> do<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.040> take<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> piece

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
next thing I want to do is take a piece

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.510 
next thing I want to do is take a piece
of<00:02:18.580> Paducah<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.300> put<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.470> between<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
of Paducah and put it in between the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.460 
of Paducah and put it in between the
tanks<00:02:22.120> at<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.330> top<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:22.900> going<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.200> do<00:02:23.320> two

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
tanks at the top this is going to do two

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.620 
tanks at the top this is going to do two
things<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.190> make<00:02:24.520> these<00:02:24.760> times<00:02:25.090> a

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
things it's going to make these times a

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.670 
things it's going to make these times a
little<00:02:25.960> bit<00:02:26.080> more<00:02:26.230> visually<00:02:26.650> interesting

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
little bit more visually interesting

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.760 
little bit more visually interesting
with<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.700> different<00:02:28.240> color<00:02:28.750> wood<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.260> it's

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
with the different color wood and it's

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.230 
with the different color wood and it's
also<00:02:29.950> going<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> open<00:02:30.370> up<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.820> end<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
also going to open up the end of the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.880 
also going to open up the end of the
tongue<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.780> you're<00:02:32.080> able<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.350> grab<00:02:32.560> more

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
tongue so that you're able to grab more

00:02:32.890 --> 00:03:06.690 
tongue so that you're able to grab more
food<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.510> could<00:02:34.660> put<00:02:34.840> more<00:02:35.020> food<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.530> my<00:02:35.680> goal

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.760 

so<00:03:07.180> i<00:03:07.240> standed<00:03:07.569> everything<00:03:07.870> down<00:03:08.020> to<00:03:08.200> 220<00:03:08.740> grit

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
so i standed everything down to 220 grit

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.710 
so i standed everything down to 220 grit
and<00:03:09.220> i<00:03:09.310> finished<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.880> with<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> coat<00:03:10.510> of

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
and i finished it with a coat of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.020 
and i finished it with a coat of
Millie's<00:03:11.110> tung<00:03:11.440> oil<00:03:11.470> finish<00:03:12.099> which<00:03:12.819> is<00:03:12.849> a

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
Millie's tung oil finish which is a

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.809 
Millie's tung oil finish which is a
mixture<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.660> tung<00:03:13.959> oil<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.560> beeswax<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.550> it's

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
mixture of tung oil and beeswax and it's

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.380 
mixture of tung oil and beeswax and it's
food<00:03:16.030> safe<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:16.569> there's<00:03:17.099> no<00:03:18.099> worries<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:19.180> only

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
food safe so there's no worries the only

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.660 
food safe so there's no worries the only
thing<00:03:19.569> left<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.870> do<00:03:20.020> now<00:03:20.050> is<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.650> try<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:20.980> out<00:03:21.130> so

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
thing left to do now is to try it out so

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.360 
thing left to do now is to try it out so
let's<00:03:21.849> see<00:03:21.940> how<00:03:22.030> well<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.300> works
