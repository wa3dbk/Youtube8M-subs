reliable one unique feature it does

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
offer which we really

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.970 
offer which we really
stumbled<00:02:06.270> upon<00:02:06.390> was<00:02:07.200> its<00:02:07.410> self-draining

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
stumbled upon was its self-draining

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.590 
stumbled upon was its self-draining
facility<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.090> terms<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.510> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
facility so in terms of the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.320 
facility so in terms of the
winterization<00:02:10.320> of<00:02:10.740> birth<00:02:11.190> showerhead<00:02:11.850> it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
winterization of birth showerhead it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330 
winterization of birth showerhead it
meant<00:02:12.660> we<00:02:13.050> didn't<00:02:13.320> need<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.500> disconnect<00:02:13.980> it

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
meant we didn't need to disconnect it

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.860 
meant we didn't need to disconnect it
and<00:02:14.400> store<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.820> separately<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> water

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and store it separately to the water

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
and store it separately to the water
system<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.470> could<00:02:16.560> just<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.830> left<00:02:17.010> Institute

during<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.700> winter<00:02:20.970> period<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.870> it's

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
during the winter period so it's

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.660
