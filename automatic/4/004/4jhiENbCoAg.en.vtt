00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.760
 you people are letting go 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.410
 we find ourselves for a glitch that you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.240
 allow for skewed swell 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 what wall solo so all alone hazard to 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.010
 thanks to the help of anyone all thanks 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.160
 at teleport tingwick so you have 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.110
 choose a map so me uh I took 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.820
 again it can be any 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 Anyway you'll see this later 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.329
 in the video for you to them 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.559
 select place the doors english and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.760
 dense who carry him the cleach you 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.800
 will change the settings of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.899
 reappearance so reappearance force and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 you go m you go the nickname master 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.050
 so once that makes you launched 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.969
 the part 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.239
 but before that you will put yourself 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.250
 in the team if he so I explain 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.520
 explains a little the principle of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.439
 blick 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.939
 so the principle is going to be from you 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.220
 place near a ceiling is to do the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.229
 next manipulation his two irons 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.229
 start go in mercenary choose a 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.479
 class go we 'll choose a class 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.330
 and you go into the ceiling in out of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.520
 mac or so you want there I you 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.900
 showed it all in details so the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.939
 part this lens here so I'm going to 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.259
 to move towards a ceiling at which its 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.070
 on this map 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.159
 so it is on the vc of the amap so 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.689
 you went up on this piece of furniture on this 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.649
 bookshelf in vo fulfilling you go 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.899
 watch the ceiling do start 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.700
 you will go in mercenary choose 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.189
 a class builds on square you go 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.100
 go in eas to choose a supported class 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.540
 on square and there you will be in ceiling 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.729
 with your weapon and your insertion 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.229
 tactical so there you can ask your 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.030
 insertion you can do what you 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.020
 want once you're in out of pop 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.969
 it's really a huge glitch and more 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.450
 you can do that solo so it's 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.069
 really impressive as technical 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.709
 it's really not bad so after there is 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.959
 another method is to make a 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.640
 plunge is so double breach the dying 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.629
 so for that you 're going to put yourself on 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.280
 barracks in talking about change of equipped 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.500
 in the start menu 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420
 you will remove you did a 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
 dive and you are going to make change 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.819
 equipped at the same time to do the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.519
 plunge so you're going to dive 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.099
 start-3 believe so once that's it 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.140
 do you go go you do not have 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.760
 choose your class you are going to go 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.920
 sleep this nerve you will choose your 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.470
 case if you are going to press square so 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.880
 there you will break it as if 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.250
 you did the woleu breche method 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.739
 for ceilings however in the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.650
 video I forget to say that if you 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.989
 die meanwhile at the beginning of the game 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.660
 banovic is fucked because it will not detect 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.129
 more the teleporte english 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.569
 so that's it then this glitch works 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.150
 really for all the maps there are 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.519
 really full of spots to find I 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.560
