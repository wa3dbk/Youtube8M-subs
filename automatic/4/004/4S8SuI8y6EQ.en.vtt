recommend this option if you can do that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.270 
recommend this option if you can do that
over<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.110> actual<00:02:56.380> remote<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.800> comes<00:02:56.980> with

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
over the actual remote that comes with

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.080 
over the actual remote that comes with
the<00:02:57.400> Apple<00:02:57.700> TV

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
the Apple TV

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.750 
the Apple TV
so<00:02:58.660> airplay<00:02:59.170> as<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.590> now<00:02:59.709> only<00:02:59.980> does<00:03:00.280> audio<00:03:00.610> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
so airplay as of now only does audio the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.490 
so airplay as of now only does audio the
idea<00:03:01.060> behind<00:03:01.269> that<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.660> can<00:03:01.870> take<00:03:01.900> music

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
idea behind that is you can take music

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.559 
idea behind that is you can take music
or<00:03:02.709> videos<00:03:03.100> which<00:03:03.970> doesn't<00:03:04.300> work<00:03:04.420> at<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569
