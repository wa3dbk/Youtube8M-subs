of<00:00:26.519> plastic<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:28.609> marker<00:00:29.609> pen<00:00:29.640> easier<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.720> then

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
of plastic a marker pen easier and then

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.069 
of plastic a marker pen easier and then
just<00:00:30.990> pump<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.769> flywheel<00:00:32.540> put<00:00:33.540> your<00:00:33.690> finger

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
just pump the flywheel put your finger

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.299 
just pump the flywheel put your finger
over<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.550> exhaust<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.880> pinch<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> fuel<00:00:36.930> line

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
over the exhaust or pinch the fuel line

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.500 
over the exhaust or pinch the fuel line
so<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> three<00:00:38.700> basic<00:00:38.910> ways<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so there the three basic ways of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
so there the three basic ways of
stopping<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:40.020> night<00:00:40.260> or<00:00:40.500> vehicle<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> i'll

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
stopping your night or vehicle and i'll

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.619 
stopping your night or vehicle and i'll
show<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.980> two<00:00:43.980> ways<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.550> priming<00:00:45.480> your

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
show you two ways of priming your

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.490 
show you two ways of priming your
natural<00:00:46.050> vehicle<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.870> priming<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:49.260> off

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
natural vehicle so priming it take off

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.750 
natural vehicle so priming it take off
the<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.270> mean<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> back<00:00:51.600> pressure<00:00:51.860> what<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the I mean the back pressure what the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
the I mean the back pressure what the
back<00:00:53.910> pressure<00:00:54.149> pipe<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.890> blow<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
back pressure pipe and you can blow in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.619 
back pressure pipe and you can blow in
that<00:00:56.539> well<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.690> your<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.199> because

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
that well what your that way because

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.180 
that well what your that way because
sometimes<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.379> accidentally<00:01:01.800> suck<00:01:02.039> on

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
sometimes you can accidentally suck on

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.330 
sometimes you can accidentally suck on
it<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.890> toxic<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.860> put<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:07.950> finger

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it and it's toxic so put your finger

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.030 
it and it's toxic so put your finger
over<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.090> exhaust<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.439> took<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
over the exhaust and just took on the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.600 
over the exhaust and just took on the
full<00:01:11.280> start<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> few<00:01:11.820> signs<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> Alec<00:01:16.170> right

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
full start a few signs so it Alec right

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
full start a few signs so it Alec right
so<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:18.030> hold<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.810> car<00:01:19.049> down<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.680> just

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
so just hold your car down and then just

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
i'll tell you if it's primed you'll just

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.109 
i'll tell you if it's primed you'll just
know<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:26.479> yes<00:01:27.479> sounds<00:01:27.720> primed<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> now<00:01:29.909> get

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
know it yes sounds primed so now get

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.899 
know it yes sounds primed so now get
your<00:01:30.329> lost<00:01:30.750> data<00:01:31.070> glory<00:01:32.070> igniter<00:01:32.400> whatever

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
your lost data glory igniter whatever

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.510 
your lost data glory igniter whatever
you<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> call<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.780> stick<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:34.979> 45

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you want to call it stick it in 45

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.130 
you want to call it stick it in 45
seconds<00:01:36.110> but<00:01:37.110> before<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.310> any<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
seconds but before you do any of that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
seconds but before you do any of that
turn<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.530> transmitter<00:01:41.360> make<00:01:42.360> sure

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
turn you on your transmitter make sure

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.889 
turn you on your transmitter make sure
everything's<00:01:43.020> green<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.369> receiver

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
everything's green then your receiver

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.120 
everything's green then your receiver
make<00:01:45.899> sure<00:01:45.930> everything's<00:01:46.560> working<00:01:46.649> properly

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
make sure everything's working properly

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.960 
make sure everything's working properly
now<00:01:47.430> each<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.939> set

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
now each of this and then you can set

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.090 
now each of this and then you can set
your<00:01:51.270> idle<00:01:51.689> speed<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.290> element<00:01:53.840> so

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
your idle speed on your element so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.880 
your idle speed on your element so
that's<00:01:56.100> about<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.780> if<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:58.170> idle<00:01:58.469> speed<00:01:58.740> is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that's about right if your idle speed is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
that's about right if your idle speed is
going<00:01:59.009> too<00:01:59.219> fast<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.759> started<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.899> turn

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
going too fast when it started just turn

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.190 
going too fast when it started just turn
it<00:02:01.170> down<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.390> you're<00:02:03.390> noisy<00:02:03.540> still<00:02:03.960> flat

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it down and then you're noisy still flat

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.590 
it down and then you're noisy still flat
across<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> wheels<00:02:04.740> or<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.009> spinning<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.479> now

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
across the wheels or be spinning so now

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.949 
across the wheels or be spinning so now
you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:06.990> ahead<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:09.360> by<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
you can go ahead and do it and by the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.470 
you can go ahead and do it and by the
way<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.470> anyone<00:02:10.709> thinks<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
way if anyone thinks that this is

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.850 
way if anyone thinks that this is
already<00:02:12.870> warm

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
already warm

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.330 
already warm
think<00:02:14.400> again<00:02:14.550> because<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:16.500> holding<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:17.070> hands

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
think again because I'm holding my hands

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.450 
think again because I'm holding my hands
on<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.290> that's<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.800> split<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.280> can

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
on it and that's the one we split it can

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:42.620 
on it and that's the one we split it can
get<00:02:20.580> back<00:02:20.820> three

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
