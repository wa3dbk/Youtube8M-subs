00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
across this and what makes it even more

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.280 
across this and what makes it even more
impressive<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.140> shallow<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.770> work

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.650 

you<00:01:16.040> can<00:01:16.220> see<00:01:16.400> just<00:01:16.640> how<00:01:16.760> relaxed<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.360> pair<00:01:17.570> of

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
you can see just how relaxed the pair of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.160 
you can see just how relaxed the pair of
them<00:01:17.810> are<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.560> this<00:01:19.070> can<00:01:19.280> continue<00:01:19.790> for<00:01:20.330> one

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
them are and this can continue for one

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.080 
them are and this can continue for one
or<00:01:21.290> two<00:01:21.320> hours<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:22.190> then<00:01:22.340> eventually<00:01:22.640> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
or two hours and then eventually the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.690 
or two hours and then eventually the
female<00:01:23.540> will<00:01:23.690> come<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:24.050> rest<00:01:24.460> somewhere<00:01:25.460> on

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
female will come to rest somewhere on

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.480 
female will come to rest somewhere on
the<00:01:25.790> bottom<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:27.410> then<00:01:27.650> joined<00:01:27.920> by<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.190> male

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.190 

I've<00:01:31.490> only<00:01:31.760> been<00:01:31.940> lucky<00:01:32.510> enough<00:01:32.540> to<00:01:32.840> film<00:01:33.050> this

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
I've only been lucky enough to film this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.740 
I've only been lucky enough to film this
two<00:01:33.380> or<00:01:33.470> three<00:01:33.500> times<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:35.240> is<00:01:35.390> by<00:01:35.540> far

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
two or three times and this is by far

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.450 
two or three times and this is by far
the<00:01:35.810> best<00:01:36.050> example<00:01:36.620> I<00:01:36.680> have<00:01:42.010> later<00:01:43.010> on<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.370> the

too far up in the dark there and this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.479 
too far up in the dark there and this
particular<00:02:20.750> cuttlefish<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.769> simply<00:02:22.190> called<00:02:22.370> a
