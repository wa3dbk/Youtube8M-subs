really<00:03:19.829> dug<00:03:20.069> my<00:03:20.280> finger<00:03:20.609> up<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.000> okay<00:03:21.359> I<00:03:21.600> have

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
really dug my finger up in okay I have

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.449 
really dug my finger up in okay I have
to<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.410> go<00:03:22.500> ahead<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.859> put<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.160> out<00:03:23.250> there<00:03:23.430> I

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
to just go ahead and put it out there I

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.830 
to just go ahead and put it out there I
really<00:03:23.549> wouldn't<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.209> yeah<00:03:24.359> I<00:03:24.420> think<00:03:24.569> it's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
really wouldn't like yeah I think it's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.920 
really wouldn't like yeah I think it's
really<00:03:25.079> really<00:03:25.290> good<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> very<00:03:27.569> thick

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
really really good it is a very thick

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.890 
really really good it is a very thick
consistency<00:03:28.769> butter<00:03:29.040> okay<00:03:29.430> very<00:03:30.359> very<00:03:30.480> thick

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
consistency butter okay very very thick

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.920 
consistency butter okay very very thick
in<00:03:31.109> consistency<00:03:31.430> but<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.730> melts<00:03:33.389> very<00:03:33.660> easily

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
in consistency but it melts very easily

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.960 
in consistency but it melts very easily
you<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:34.590> when<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:34.950> emulsify<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.609> in<00:03:35.819> your

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
you know when you emulsify it in your

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.940 
you know when you emulsify it in your
hand<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.420> expected<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.440> be<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.680> little

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
hand I expected it to be a little

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.809 
hand I expected it to be a little
smoother<00:03:38.609> it<00:03:38.819> has<00:03:39.000> kind<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.359> a<00:03:39.480> gritty<00:03:39.840> um

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
smoother it has kind of a gritty um

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.190 
smoother it has kind of a gritty um
consistency<00:03:41.819> once<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.239> starts<00:03:42.599> to<00:03:42.900> emulsify

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
consistency once it starts to emulsify

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.589 
consistency once it starts to emulsify
it<00:03:43.530> almost<00:03:43.919> so<00:03:44.130> has<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.700> super

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
it almost so has like this super

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.199 
it almost so has like this super
ultrafine<00:03:45.959> greediness<00:03:46.799> it's<00:03:47.160> not<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.459> sand

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
ultrafine greediness it's not like sand

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.770 
ultrafine greediness it's not like sand
but<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.049> like<00:03:49.230> no<00:03:49.980> no<00:03:50.010> just<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.639> tough<00:03:50.940> gritty

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
but it's like no no just a tough gritty

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.440 
but it's like no no just a tough gritty
um<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:53.310> know<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.459> don't<00:03:53.760> know<00:03:53.849> I'm<00:03:54.030> all<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.359> my

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
um you know I don't know I'm all of my

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.240 
um you know I don't know I'm all of my
hair<00:03:54.630> fried<00:03:54.810> as<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.959> store<00:03:55.230> in<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> cool<00:03:55.650> place<00:03:55.919> so

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
hair fried as a store in a cool place so

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.150 
hair fried as a store in a cool place so
I<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:56.519> think

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
I don't think

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.740 
I don't think
it<00:03:57.340> melted<00:03:57.640> in<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:57.940> solidified<00:03:58.390> again<00:03:58.540> or

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
it melted in and solidified again or

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.510 
it melted in and solidified again or
anything<00:03:58.870> like<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.740> just<00:03:59.770> seems<00:04:00.100> like<00:04:00.250> it

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
anything like that it just seems like it

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.460 
anything like that it just seems like it
just<00:04:00.550> naturally<00:04:01.060> has<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.270> great<00:04:01.630> texture<00:04:02.110> to<00:04:02.440> it

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
just naturally has a great texture to it

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.260 
just naturally has a great texture to it
a<00:04:02.620> little<00:04:02.890> it's<00:04:03.220> just<00:04:03.370> like<00:04:03.550> slightly<00:04:04.060> gritty

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
a little it's just like slightly gritty

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.350 
a little it's just like slightly gritty
but<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.800> still<00:04:06.100> works<00:04:06.310> well<00:04:06.520> nonetheless<00:04:06.820> I

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
but it still works well nonetheless I

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.510 
but it still works well nonetheless I
have<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.780> say<00:04:07.990> that<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.860> heavy<00:04:09.220> butter

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
have to say that it is a heavy butter

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.460 
have to say that it is a heavy butter
but<00:04:09.730> it's<00:04:09.850> not<00:04:10.000> too<00:04:10.240> heavy<00:04:10.480> all<00:04:10.810> depends<00:04:11.260> on

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
but it's not too heavy all depends on

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.710 
but it's not too heavy all depends on
how<00:04:11.830> you<00:04:11.890> apply<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:12.970> your<00:04:13.090> hair<00:04:13.450> pretty

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
how you apply it to your hair pretty

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.660 
how you apply it to your hair pretty
much<00:04:13.990> if<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.380> put<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.770> lot<00:04:15.040> it's<00:04:15.310> gonna<00:04:15.580> be

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
much if you put a lot it's gonna be

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.910 
much if you put a lot it's gonna be
rumored<00:04:16.239> evie<00:04:16.450> if<00:04:16.720> you're<00:04:17.230> light<00:04:17.470> handed<00:04:17.890> with

rumored evie if you're light handed with

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.759 
rumored evie if you're light handed with

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
it then it won't be so I like that it's

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.710

easy<00:04:20.980> to<00:04:21.070> apply<00:04:21.400> I've<00:04:21.730> used<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.120> on<00:04:22.210> damp<00:04:22.510> hair

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720

hydrator you know I don't know but I
have<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.990> admit<00:04:38.200> when<00:04:38.530> I've<00:04:38.770> used<00:04:39.040> it<00:04:39.190> on<00:04:39.370> dry

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
have to admit when I've used it on dry

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.810 
have to admit when I've used it on dry
hair<00:04:39.790> just<00:04:40.300> dry<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:41.410> really<00:04:42.250> makes<00:04:42.460> my<00:04:42.640> hair

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
feel hydrated how that happens I don't

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.830 
feel hydrated how that happens I don't
know<00:04:45.160> I'm<00:04:45.370> not<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.580> hair<00:04:45.790> scientist<00:04:46.360> or

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
know I'm not a hair scientist or

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.020 
know I'm not a hair scientist or
anything<00:04:47.020> like<00:04:47.260> that<00:04:47.320> but<00:04:47.950> my<00:04:48.250> hair<00:04:48.460> does<00:04:48.700> feel

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
anything like that but my hair does feel

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.670 
anything like that but my hair does feel
like<00:04:49.060> maybe<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.020> put<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.290> little<00:04:50.410> bit<00:04:50.590> of

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
like maybe I put a little bit of

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.610 
like maybe I put a little bit of
moisture<00:04:51.010> on<00:04:51.070> there<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:53.140> doesn't<00:04:53.380> have

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
moisture on there and it doesn't have

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.280 
moisture on there and it doesn't have
water<00:04:53.920> in<00:04:54.580> here<00:04:55.090> as<00:04:55.300> an<00:04:55.570> ingredient<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.260> I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
water in here as an ingredient so I

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.260 
water in here as an ingredient so I
don't<00:04:56.590> know<00:04:56.680> how<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:56.980> works<00:04:57.220> but<00:04:57.490> my<00:04:58.060> hair

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
don't know how that works but my hair

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.410 
don't know how that works but my hair
does<00:04:58.540> feel<00:04:59.190> moisturized<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:01.030> slightly

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
does feel moisturized and like slightly

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.270 
does feel moisturized and like slightly
hydrated<00:05:02.230> so<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.410> think<00:05:02.470> that's<00:05:02.830> pretty<00:05:03.040> cool

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
hydrated so I think that's pretty cool

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.920 
hydrated so I think that's pretty cool
maybe<00:05:03.550> there's<00:05:03.790> magic<00:05:04.240> up<00:05:04.360> in<00:05:04.480> here<00:05:04.660> I<00:05:04.810> don't

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
maybe there's magic up in here I don't

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.100 
maybe there's magic up in here I don't
know<00:05:05.170> I<00:05:05.700> can<00:05:06.700> say<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.540> moisture<00:05:07.990> of

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
know I can say that the moisture of

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.040 
know I can say that the moisture of
lasts<00:05:08.410> and<00:05:09.010> lasts<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:09.820> less<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.180> less<00:05:10.330> so<00:05:10.750> I

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
lasts and lasts and less and less so I

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.570 
lasts and lasts and less and less so I
can<00:05:11.290> see<00:05:11.470> why<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:11.770> would<00:05:11.980> take<00:05:12.190> somebody<00:05:12.520> a

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
can see why it would take somebody a

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.370 
can see why it would take somebody a
little<00:05:12.790> while<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.419> use<00:05:13.600> this<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:13.990> why<00:05:14.110> 5

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
little while to use this and why 5

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.620 
little while to use this and why 5
ounces<00:05:14.830> should<00:05:15.010> be<00:05:15.160> sufficient<00:05:16.060> for<00:05:16.240> one

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
ounces should be sufficient for one

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.990 
ounces should be sufficient for one
person<00:05:17.080> for<00:05:17.290> a<00:05:17.320> little<00:05:17.530> while<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:18.040> still<00:05:18.820> got

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
person for a little while I still got

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.980 
person for a little while I still got
two<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.630> I'm<00:05:19.810> not<00:05:19.990> getting<00:05:20.260> another<00:05:20.380> one<00:05:20.500> up

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
two and I'm not getting another one up

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.610 
two and I'm not getting another one up
so<00:05:22.990> I<00:05:23.020> can<00:05:23.410> say<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:23.980> it<00:05:24.460> does<00:05:24.700> well<00:05:24.970> now<00:05:25.620> it

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
so I can say that it does well now it

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.190 
so I can say that it does well now it
says<00:05:27.010> stop<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.580> define<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.690> can<00:05:28.870> say<00:05:29.050> that

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
says stop and define and I can say that

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.360 
says stop and define and I can say that
it<00:05:29.320> does<00:05:29.470> give<00:05:29.680> me<00:05:29.710> a<00:05:29.860> pretty<00:05:30.040> good<00:05:30.220> definition

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370
