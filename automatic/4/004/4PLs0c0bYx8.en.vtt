00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.479
 the one who carrying as they are welcome to 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.540
 the morning capsule of the day 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:11.320
 today wednesday something from june 2015 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.619
 I am a kit and we are going to talk about good 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.630
 good good the great game that is batman 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.660
 arkham night 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 Yesterday was launched June 23 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.560
 then today is 24 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.640
 and it turns out that the PC version is not going so 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.890
 well as rocksteady would wait 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.670
 how bad is good at steam is 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.010
 going disgust seemingly only one 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.980
 third of the people has given 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.290
 positive ratings to the game that is 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.570
 only have 30% ratings 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.670
 Positive everything else is very 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.640
 lascaux the main problems are 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.370
 very brutal framerate slumps there are 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.720
 videos on youtube where you can see 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.700
 how it's almost unplayable in 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.420
 game or 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.240
 very bad planet apparently this problem 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.400
 you can compensate a little by modifying 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.680
 a point n file that comes along with 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.600
 the game there is not an option within the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.780
 world of the menu to move the frame rate 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.300
 is fixed at 30 frames per second and this 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.430
 like it's weird already for the time when 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.830
 we are living more coming from a 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.360
 company as big as the box teddy and 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.190
 warner is already aware 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.860
 rocksteady is already aware and what 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.310
 they say a statement from rocksteady 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.190
 is that they are aware of the problem and that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.340
 they will see what it was 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.410
 and then the setbacks they had to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.140
 develop this game because they were not 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.300
 they the pc version was commissioned 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.620
 another company sounds to them 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.390
 again we are having problems of 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.830
 that you do not take care of this and I 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.320
 order to do it in sunny and with 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.420
 function in which it works well has not 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.850
 there were great complaints of fact 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.380
 not heard or read any on the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.780
 console versions of xbox van de 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.780
 playstation 4 only happens with the one of 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.060
 pc and well yes it is very disgusting 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.500
 rocksteady have to answer this for 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.780
 what 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.460
 it is a very dear company is a saga 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.000
 very beloved the whole batman saga 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.010
 arkham 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.180
 but conclude well and it looks so bad 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:29.630
 outs steam recommends that you update your 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.850
 md to md card and its update 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.570
 software specifically for this game 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.190
 so that does not happen at least 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.680
 will lighten 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.290
 roxana 20 a special communication from 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.440
 when will you solve this when 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.300
 will wear the patch or none of this already 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.310
 by itself the game brings a patch of 3.5 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.010
 gigas at the start in console at least 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.080
 then there are several flats out there 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.080
 most anticipated release of a game of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.880
 batman and then let's see how the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.160
 final and I hope it does not impact so much on 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.830
 the perception that people have of this 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.550
 game because the net is one of the most 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.050
 strong this year for console and pc 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.960
 well when I say goodbye I 'm not 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.550

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.650
 had problems of this type then 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.750
 it would be cool that they will comment it to see 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.120
 if there is any possible solution or something 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.730

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.860
