00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:03.132
MAKEUP MONDAY

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.668
I got a lot of requests on my video from last week

00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:21.262
and a lot of people wanted to know what eyeliner I'd recommend.

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:25.871
So I thought I'd do an experiment to see 
 how my eyeliners hold up under pressure!

00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:29.143
I currently have 6 liquid eyeliners

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.866
so I'm going to use these.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:43.790
24 HOUR EXPERIMENT START

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.922
It's 11pm and I'm verrrry sleepy

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:55.211
And I'm about to start my eyeliner experiment 

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:01.679
and find out which one stays on the longest

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.398
K-Palette

00:01:03.904 --> 00:01:04.522
KATE Tokyo

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.470
CANMAKE

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:08.568
K-Palette's limited edition pink-brown 

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:13.724
this one by Ettusais which I use pretty much everyday

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:16.576
and Brow Lash EX which has a felt-tip pen-like applicator. 

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:20.831
Let's test these babies!

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.289
K-Palette black

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.159
KATE black

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.317
Canmake black

00:01:31.177 --> 00:01:32.531
And now for brown

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.176
K-Palette's pink brown

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:37.557
Ettusais

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.830
And lastly Brow Lash EX

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.950
Let's see what happens in the next 24 hours

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.360
12 HOURS LATER

00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:58.660
Good morning

00:01:58.657 --> 00:01:59.620
that's Cinnamon

00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:11.080
Okay, so it's morning now

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.380
TBH they haven't really changed

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.030
except for the one at the bottom, K-Palette in black

00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:21.220
that's come off a bit

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.270
Maybe because I did this in my sleep?

00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:29.110
See you in another 12 hours!

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:31.320
24 HOURS LATER

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:35.600
Okay the time has come, it's 11pm now

00:02:46.112 --> 00:02:48.260
(Naming them again)

00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:58.910
Is this unbelievable or WHAT?

00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:03.800
Japanese liquid eyeliners are the BEST. LOOK AT THIS!

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:04.620
SERIOUSLY

00:03:05.473 --> 00:03:10.330
You can see that the black K-Palette came off a bit

00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:13.240
But I have a feeling that was my fault

00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:18.470
I think because of the placement it rubbed off a bit

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:24.270
And I say that because I've used K-Palette for about 5 years

00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:30.530
And it NEVER looks like this when I apply it to my eyelids

00:03:33.222 --> 00:03:36.860
But in any case I'm super impressed

00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:40.030
This is the photo from 12 hours ago

00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:44.330
And this is the photo from now (a full 24 hours after application)

00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:46.910
HARDLY CHANGES AT ALL WHAT IS THIS WIZARDRY 

00:03:46.912 --> 00:03:48.960
So basically I'm going to recommend to you

00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:52.570
ANY JAPANESE DRUG STORE LIQUID EYELINER

00:03:52.574 --> 00:03:55.630
Seriously they are amazing.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:56.660
Just pick the one YOU like best!

00:03:57.318 --> 00:04:02.560
I just have to say it again...Japanese liquid eyeliners are amaze.

00:04:03.312 --> 00:04:05.220
I'mma see if they rub off

00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:08.090
Kinda hurts!

00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:11.280
And hasn't come off

00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:15.160
Still there...

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:24.170
