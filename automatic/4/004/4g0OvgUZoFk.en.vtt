as photo plankton data where the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.289 
as photo plankton data where the

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
plankton is in the ocean you want to

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.940 
plankton is in the ocean you want to
know<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.450> because<00:01:50.780> plankton<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.649> what

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
know that because plankton is what

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.550 
know that because plankton is what
starts<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.700> life<00:01:53.149> cycle<00:01:53.600> if<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.259> small

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
starts the life cycle if you have small

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.679 
starts the life cycle if you have small
baitfish<00:01:54.799> eating<00:01:55.310> plankton<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:55.999> then<00:01:56.539> the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
baitfish eating plankton and then the

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.029 
baitfish eating plankton and then the
larger<00:01:57.049> predator<00:01:57.439> fish<00:01:57.649> will<00:01:57.829> naturally

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
larger predator fish will naturally

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.649 
larger predator fish will naturally
follow<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:58.999> if<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.210> know<00:01:59.420> where<00:01:59.569> the

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
follow that so if you know where the

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.989 
follow that so if you know where the
plankton<00:02:00.049> is<00:02:00.229> in<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.770> given<00:02:01.069> area<00:02:01.249> you're<00:02:01.909> gonna

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
plankton is in a given area you're gonna

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.539 
plankton is in a given area you're gonna
catch<00:02:02.299> more<00:02:02.539> fish<00:02:02.950> furthermore<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.159> also<00:02:04.189> have

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
catch more fish furthermore we also have

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.910 
catch more fish furthermore we also have

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
and we'll use it to catch more fish so

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.020

can go in and turn on any one of those

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.499 
can go in and turn on any one of those
parameters<00:06:29.219> that<00:06:29.340> we<00:06:29.430> already<00:06:29.580> downloaded

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
parameters that we already downloaded

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.809 
parameters that we already downloaded
and<00:06:30.599> animate<00:06:31.380> them<00:06:31.560> with<00:06:31.710> TZ<00:06:31.919> touch<00:06:32.190> real<00:06:32.610> it's

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
and animate them with TZ touch real it's

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.550 
and animate them with TZ touch real it's
really<00:06:33.150> simple<00:06:33.389> let<00:06:33.900> me<00:06:33.930> just<00:06:34.139> show<00:06:34.259> you<00:06:34.319> real
