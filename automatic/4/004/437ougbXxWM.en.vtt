00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 welcome friends today we will learn to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.960
 make these beautiful bracelets that have 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.630
 several pendants that are very pretty very 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.059
 easy to do and they are in fact very 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.639
 you can put the colors 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.039
 combine what you want and you'll see that 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.529
 you'll love it if you like to stay and see 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.769
 how we do what we will occupy will be a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.410
 clip for costume jewelery that has a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.180
 part to cut a flat and one so 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.760
 as slotted so you can serve us 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.859
 we are going to occupy also chain is the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.710
 they sell by meter how much we're going to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.690
 We will take what we will measure your hand 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.399
 occupy some terminals whether 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.739
 parrots like the ones that we are 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.350
 used to using or ones like these 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.780
 I am going to use these here we are going to occupy 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.210
 also some flat-tipped pins 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.059
 what are these that I have here that are 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.550
 to make earrings or in this case as 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.890
 our bracelets and we will occupy 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.079
 some acrylic beads here I have 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 some you can occupy in the tones 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.170
 you want to start opening here 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.049
 the ring we have 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.110
 to hold it in our chain in one 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.110
 of the extremes in this way and we're going to 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.060
 close again 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.560
 let's also object the other part ok 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.510
 now let's put our pins 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.150
 here at one extreme 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.790
 and to make the next fold we're going to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.540
 cut a part more or less like this 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.240
 and this section will be left 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.190
 now with the slotted part we are going to 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.860
 hold let's take a full turn 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.730
 to our clamp and once you 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.750
 let's have 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.060
 we're just going to fold a little bit to 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.590
 that we stay like this and we can insert it 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.400
 in our bracelet we will do the same with 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.870
 all our pieces we cut 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.170
 the excess of the pin we take a turn 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.360
 complete our clamp 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 and once we have it already only 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.630
 we doubled a little bit and that's it 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.200
 Now the next thing will be to start 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.290
 distribute them throughout our bracelet and 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.200
 we begin to insert in this way 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.810
 now once it's already there and only what 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.010
 we close 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.980
 and we're staying 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.829
 we started doing this with all 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.170
 our pieces and distribute them in such 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.200
 way we like what's left here what 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.129
 I have already finished 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.120
 it's very easy very simple and it's a 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.330
 bracelet then very elegant and you will see something 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.130
 A) Yes 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.130
 will not put so they can see it 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.849
 there is 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.269
 dale click I like and remember that 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.480

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.019
