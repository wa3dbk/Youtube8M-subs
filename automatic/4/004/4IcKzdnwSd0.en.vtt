00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.500
 all youtube here is your vote 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.790
 the background I'll show you today 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.069
 bio loud kempter 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.840
 it's an oven we naturally use 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.550
 Cooking can be done by simple materials 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.710
 which one finds in the woods or wood 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.010
 Everything else can burn everything in there 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.230
 By the way, the oven also produces 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.789
 By the waste heat so much energy that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.100
 is just the special thing about it 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.640
 in the sb consumer can load so cell phones 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.170
 iphones or cameras or anything else here 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 we see the short supply also 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.950
 still a small carrying bag with it 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.950
 the furnace and this unit works 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 the whole thing will simply ignite 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.050
 simply that means you are looking through 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.230
 materials wood very small change 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.450
 a little kink and so on 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.640
 and then out, of course, shortly 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.170
 the wood business burns then you have 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.370
 the possibility of this switch 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.590
 to switch on the fan 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.960
 the energy for the blower takes the 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.690
 oven by the waste heat is not inside 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.490
 charge the batteries or have other 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.770
 also two stages and already applies 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.659
 has happened 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.760
 this year really seething through this 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.720
 fan just 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.190
 blood is properly fanned we will cook 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.900
 Of course, it's the same 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.470
 I'm already 500 milliliters 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.010
 water as well as heat it up 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.690
 that is really fast to 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.310
 cooking i would have been brought 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.350
 estimate about four minutes 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.960
 Here you can see really nice 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.570
 this renate kindled the flames 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.810
 with proper energies are some 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.700
 experienced how the skin out with it one sees 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 the light in the green that is the usb 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.030
 I'm ready for action 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.680
 charger here and then we see that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 iphone is loading and it's off 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.070
 actually load about as fast as possible 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.320
 a socket same small tick 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.780
 So slow that really a super 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.970
 gadget just for the outdoor area 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.560
 if you are on the road where it is not 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.930
 Power supply is because you just the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 possibility to load the iphone by 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 or any other consumer to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.630
 ours also has the water pack 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.630
 in no time 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.299
 reloading is a small problem there 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.829
 you have to get used to it a bit 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.269
 because you just refill from above 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.920
 can 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.950
 you have to be careful that it does not burn 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.989
 but after a short exercise you have that too 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.459
 I have to say I am very 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.650
 Loved the stove I only have 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.730
 ordered to try it now 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.579
 thought that really that great 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.069
 works and the usb connection too 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.290
 really gives that much energy free that 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.599
 you 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.969
 I can hope with this mobile phone 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.909
 you liked the review 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:47.219
 according to camps I put a lot in 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.010
 the video description would be infos 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.269
 I'm glad if you +1 the video 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.849
 or a thumbs up there is you 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.129
 liked and take a look at mine 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.150
 other videos but still on 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.150
 See you next time
