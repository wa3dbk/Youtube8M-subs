00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
function that enables the cameras focus

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.030 
function that enables the cameras focus
to<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.490> shorter<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.810> gives<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.650> again

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
to be shorter so that it gives you again

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.399 
to be shorter so that it gives you again
a<00:01:17.070> sharper<00:01:17.549> image<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.150> properly<00:01:18.780> focus<00:01:19.200> for

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
a sharper image and properly focus for

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.880 
a sharper image and properly focus for
that<00:01:19.560> close-up<00:01:20.009> shot<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that close-up shot and if I don't have a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.460 
that close-up shot and if I don't have a
new<00:01:23.100> Fuji<00:01:23.490> camera<00:01:23.880> what's<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.360> procedure<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
new Fuji camera what's the procedure and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.899 
new Fuji camera what's the procedure and
if<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> new<00:01:26.250> Fuji<00:01:26.549> camera

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
if you don't have a new Fuji camera

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.630 
if you don't have a new Fuji camera
Gregg<00:01:27.150> most<00:01:28.140> cameras<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> macro<00:01:29.400> function

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
Gregg most cameras have a macro function

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819 
Gregg most cameras have a macro function
and<00:01:30.030> normally<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.990> represented<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and normally it's represented with a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.980 
and normally it's represented with a
flower<00:01:32.159> icon<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.030> all<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.869> is

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
flower icon and all you have to do is

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
flower icon and all you have to do is
push<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.409> button<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.220> enables

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
push that button and it actually enables

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.960 
push that button and it actually enables
the<00:01:35.970> macro<00:01:36.329> mode<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.750> make<00:01:37.710> note<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.220> not

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the macro mode now make note that not

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.149 
the macro mode now make note that not
all<00:01:39.030> cameras<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> same<00:01:40.259> macro<00:01:40.619> focus

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
all cameras have the same macro focus

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460 
all cameras have the same macro focus
distance<00:01:41.400> Gregg<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.509> some<00:01:42.869> cameras<00:01:43.320> may

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
distance Gregg right so some cameras may

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.520 
distance Gregg right so some cameras may
be<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.920> close<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.759> centimeter<00:01:45.360> way<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
be as close as one centimeter way that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.410 
be as close as one centimeter way that
you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.860> close<00:01:47.130> up<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> some<00:01:48.000> cameras

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you can get close up to and some cameras

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.240 
you can get close up to and some cameras
can<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.810> far<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.140> 10<00:01:49.350> centimeters<00:01:49.860> away<00:01:49.979> but

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
can be as far as 10 centimeters away but

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
can be as far as 10 centimeters away but
on<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.820> average<00:01:50.939> you're<00:01:51.360> looking<00:01:51.630> between

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
on the average you're looking between

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.020 
on the average you're looking between
those<00:01:52.140> two<00:01:52.380> points<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.490> getting<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
those two points for for getting the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
those two points for for getting the
correct<00:01:54.210> focus<00:01:54.600> okay<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.200> you've<00:01:55.350> got<00:01:55.500> an

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
correct focus okay so if you've got an

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.830 
correct focus okay so if you've got an
auto<00:01:55.829> Scene<00:01:56.189> Recognition<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.540> start

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
auto Scene Recognition and you start

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
auto Scene Recognition and you start
moving<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.170> camera<00:01:58.500> closer<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.340> your

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
moving your camera closer to your

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.760 
moving your camera closer to your
subject<00:01:59.659> the<00:02:00.659> camera<00:02:00.990> automatically

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
subject the camera automatically

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.440 
subject the camera automatically
switches<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.430> macro<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:03.030> good<00:02:03.299> right

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
switches it to macro that's good right

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.010 
switches it to macro that's good right
and<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> normal<00:02:04.920> camera<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.450> move<00:02:06.750> my

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and with a normal camera when I move my

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.160 
and with a normal camera when I move my
camera<00:02:07.950> closer<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.759> subject<00:02:09.300> I'm<00:02:09.750> going<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
camera closer to my subject I'm going to

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.930 
camera closer to my subject I'm going to
get<00:02:10.319> some<00:02:10.530> kind<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.800> warning<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.489> something

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
get some kind of warning or something

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.800 
get some kind of warning or something
when<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.270> too<00:02:12.510> close

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
when I get too close

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.690 
when I get too close
and<00:02:13.050> then<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.650> turn<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.190> macro

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and then I have to turn on the macro

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.280 
and then I have to turn on the macro
setting<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.180> allow<00:02:15.270> me<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.959> extra

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
setting to allow me to get that extra

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.570 
setting to allow me to get that extra
distance<00:02:16.980> closer

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
distance closer

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.040 
distance closer
that's<00:02:17.760> correct<00:02:18.030> great<00:02:18.240> writes<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.750> camera

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
that's correct great writes the camera

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.540 
that's correct great writes the camera
won't<00:02:19.200> allow<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.770> focus<00:02:20.010> unless<00:02:20.310> you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
won't allow you to focus unless you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.170 
won't allow you to focus unless you
switch<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> macro<00:02:21.390> subject<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:23.180> when

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
switch it to the macro subject so when

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.090 
switch it to the macro subject so when
you<00:02:24.270> do<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.780> close-up<00:02:25.080> photography<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:26.040> know

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
you do the close-up photography you know

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.580 
you do the close-up photography you know
look<00:02:26.819> for<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.120> flower<00:02:27.360> icon<00:02:27.870> switch<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.470> on

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
look for that flower icon switch it on

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.979 
look for that flower icon switch it on
okay<00:02:29.190> perfect<00:02:29.640> okay<00:02:29.790> well<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.660> those<00:02:30.930> are

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
okay perfect okay well I think those are

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.690 
okay perfect okay well I think those are
the<00:02:31.140> basics<00:02:31.560> because<00:02:31.890> again<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.370> are<00:02:32.489> talking

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
the basics because again we are talking

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.910 
the basics because again we are talking
about<00:02:32.970> more<00:02:33.390> consumer<00:02:34.020> applications<00:02:34.739> or

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
about more consumer applications or

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.160 
about more consumer applications or
point-and-shoot<00:02:35.550> cameras<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:36.810> many

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
point-and-shoot cameras here I know many

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.710 
point-and-shoot cameras here I know many
of<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.350> hopefully<00:02:37.890> out<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:39.239> digital

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
of you hopefully out there have digital

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.320 
of you hopefully out there have digital
SLR<00:02:40.170> cameras<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.739> some<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.330> principles

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
SLR cameras and some of the principles

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.120 
SLR cameras and some of the principles
are<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.720> little<00:02:43.080> bit<00:02:43.170> different<00:02:43.560> because<00:02:43.680> of

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
are a little bit different because of

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.580 
are a little bit different because of
the<00:02:44.340> type<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:44.940> lenses<00:02:45.450> you're<00:02:45.540> using<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.110> for

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the type of lenses you're using but for

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.229 
the type of lenses you're using but for
the<00:02:46.680> most<00:02:46.860> part<00:02:47.190> with<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.670> point<00:02:48.000> shoot

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
the most part with the point shoot

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.750 
the most part with the point shoot
cameras<00:02:48.860> you've<00:02:49.860> got<00:02:50.070> either<00:02:50.250> cameras<00:02:50.700> that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
cameras you've got either cameras that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.130 
cameras you've got either cameras that
will<00:02:50.880> go<00:02:51.060> into<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.420> mode<00:02:51.780> for<00:02:52.050> you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
will go into this mode for you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.330 
will go into this mode for you
automatically<00:02:52.680> or<00:02:52.830> you'll<00:02:53.070> set<00:02:53.310> it

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
automatically or you'll set it

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.740 
automatically or you'll set it
automatically<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.030> let's<00:02:54.239> talk<00:02:54.450> more<00:02:54.690> about

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
automatically so let's talk more about

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.460 
automatically so let's talk more about
why<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:56.190> do<00:02:56.820> like<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.540> use<00:02:57.569> close-ups<00:02:58.290> and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
why you do like to use close-ups and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.050 
why you do like to use close-ups and
maybe<00:02:58.620> some<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.010> subjects<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.580> some<00:02:59.790> tips

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
maybe some of the subjects and some tips

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.610 
maybe some of the subjects and some tips
in<00:03:00.330> particular<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.080> those<00:03:01.200> types<00:03:01.470> of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
in particular for those types of

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.640 
in particular for those types of
subjects<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.819> one<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> most

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
subjects I know that one of the most

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.460 
subjects I know that one of the most
popular<00:03:04.650> ones<00:03:04.860> for<00:03:05.400> macro<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.230> flowers

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
popular ones for macro is flowers

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.620 
popular ones for macro is flowers
that's<00:03:07.980> correct<00:03:08.160> Greg<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.640> mean<00:03:08.850> even<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
that's correct Greg I mean even the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.080 
that's correct Greg I mean even the
actual<00:03:09.959> feature<00:03:10.860> button<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.459> represented

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
actual feature button is represented

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.199 
actual feature button is represented
with<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.300> flower<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.920> obvious<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.760> when

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
with a flower so it's obvious that when

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.180 
with a flower so it's obvious that when
you<00:03:15.330> have<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.660> mode<00:03:15.900> switched<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.530> that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
you have that mode switched on that

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.250 
you have that mode switched on that
you're<00:03:17.610> most<00:03:18.030> likely<00:03:18.360> taking<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> close-up

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
you're most likely taking a close-up

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.310 
you're most likely taking a close-up
shot<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.700> flower<00:03:20.970> right<00:03:21.269> or<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.810> plant<00:03:22.170> or

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
shot of a flower right or a plant or

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.470 
shot of a flower right or a plant or
anything<00:03:23.100> that's<00:03:23.310> closed<00:03:23.700> off<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.150> sense

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
anything that's closed off in that sense

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.390 
anything that's closed off in that sense
and<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.170> know<00:03:25.260> setting<00:03:25.680> when<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:25.950> do<00:03:26.130> set<00:03:26.370> it

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
and you know setting when you do set it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.479 
and you know setting when you do set it
to<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.670> mode<00:03:26.970> you're<00:03:27.480> basically<00:03:27.810> getting

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
to that mode you're basically getting

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.640 
to that mode you're basically getting
exact<00:03:29.489> focus<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.840> getting<00:03:31.140> right<00:03:31.350> up<00:03:31.380> close

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
exact focus and getting right up close

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.620 
exact focus and getting right up close
to<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:32.250> file<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.790> taking<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.299> close-up

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
to that file and taking that close-up

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.500 
to that file and taking that close-up
shot<00:03:34.019> whether<00:03:34.290> you're<00:03:34.799> looking<00:03:34.890> at<00:03:35.160> details

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
shot whether you're looking at details

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.990 
shot whether you're looking at details
within<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.900> flowers<00:03:37.200> or<00:03:37.620> anything<00:03:38.430> even

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
within the flowers or anything even

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.880 
within the flowers or anything even

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
bugs again you avoid the shadows but

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.480 
bugs again you avoid the shadows but
most<00:04:36.150> importantly<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.810> also<00:04:36.930> avoid<00:04:37.560> scaring

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
most importantly you also avoid scaring

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.770 
most importantly you also avoid scaring
off<00:04:38.639> that<00:04:39.710> okay<00:04:40.710> cool<00:04:41.009> so<00:04:41.220> use<00:04:42.000> telephoto

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
off that okay cool so use telephoto

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.499 
off that okay cool so use telephoto

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
things like that absolute tip okay so

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.040 
things like that absolute tip okay so
you<00:04:53.310> know<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.669> think<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.360> most<00:04:54.600> people<00:04:54.900> when

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
you know I think that most people when

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.600 
you know I think that most people when
they<00:04:55.139> take<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.350> portrait<00:04:55.800> picture<00:04:56.220> they<00:04:56.370> never

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
they take a portrait picture they never

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.840 
they take a portrait picture they never
think<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:56.970> using<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.360> macro<00:04:57.780> mode<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.850> love

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
think of using the macro mode I love

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.000 
think of using the macro mode I love
doing<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.300> myself<00:05:00.449> and<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.080> know<00:05:01.139> you<00:05:01.289> do<00:05:01.560> too<00:05:01.590> so

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
doing it myself and I know you do too so

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.580 
doing it myself and I know you do too so
tell<00:05:02.220> tell<00:05:02.639> our<00:05:02.820> folks<00:05:03.000> out<00:05:03.240> there<00:05:03.600> how<00:05:04.530> you

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
tell tell our folks out there how you

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.140 
tell tell our folks out there how you
would<00:05:04.830> do<00:05:04.979> this<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.430> what<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.729> advantage

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
would do this and what the advantage

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.060 
would do this and what the advantage
might<00:05:06.360> be<00:05:06.539> so<00:05:06.960> one<00:05:07.169> of<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.380> things<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.710> do<00:05:07.770> with

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
might be so one of the things I do with

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.469 
might be so one of the things I do with
with<00:05:08.340> my<00:05:08.490> digital<00:05:08.639> camera<00:05:08.850> when<00:05:09.180> taking

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
with my digital camera when taking

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:10.820 
with my digital camera when taking
pictures<00:05:09.840> sometimes<00:05:10.229> especially<00:05:10.470> with

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
pictures sometimes especially with

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.750 
pictures sometimes especially with
people<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.490> is<00:05:11.639> that<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:13.100> tend<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.250> find<00:05:14.490> that

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
people in it is that I tend to find that

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.560 
people in it is that I tend to find that
in<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.210> macro<00:05:15.810> function<00:05:16.349> of<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:17.250> camera

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
in the macro function of the camera

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.620 
in the macro function of the camera
pictures<00:05:18.570> seem<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:19.190> lot<00:05:20.190> more<00:05:20.250> sharp<00:05:20.729> and<00:05:21.030> they

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
pictures seem a lot more sharp and they

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.629 
pictures seem a lot more sharp and they
just<00:05:21.840> look<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.289> much<00:05:22.320> more<00:05:22.500> stunning<00:05:23.039> just

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
just look so much more stunning just

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.460 
just look so much more stunning just
like<00:05:23.789> what<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.090> would<00:05:24.150> come<00:05:24.389> off<00:05:24.539> of<00:05:25.020> a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
like what you would come off of a

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.469 
like what you would come off of a
digital<00:05:25.740> SLR<00:05:26.160> camera<00:05:26.610> where<00:05:26.759> it<00:05:26.849> has<00:05:27.030> that

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
digital SLR camera where it has that

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.450 
digital SLR camera where it has that
shallow<00:05:27.810> depth<00:05:28.139> of<00:05:28.259> field<00:05:28.320> because<00:05:28.800> one<00:05:29.310> thing

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
shallow depth of field because one thing

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.770 
shallow depth of field because one thing
you<00:05:29.550> need<00:05:29.699> to<00:05:29.729> note<00:05:29.940> is<00:05:30.090> that<00:05:30.120> when<00:05:30.360> you<00:05:30.539> set

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
you need to note is that when you set

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.480 
you need to note is that when you set
the<00:05:30.930> macro<00:05:31.320> function<00:05:31.560> on<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.919> camera<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.400> be

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
the macro function on the camera to be

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.270 
the macro function on the camera to be
on<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:33.419> focus<00:05:33.840> distance<00:05:34.050> is<00:05:34.530> very<00:05:35.010> very

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
on the focus distance is very very

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.310 
on the focus distance is very very
shallow<00:05:35.520> now<00:05:35.910> so<00:05:36.120> anything<00:05:36.539> away<00:05:36.660> from<00:05:36.930> that

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
shallow now so anything away from that

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.860 
shallow now so anything away from that
area<00:05:37.590> becomes<00:05:38.460> out-of-focus<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.539> if<00:05:39.599> you<00:05:39.720> want

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
area becomes out-of-focus so if you want

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.689 
area becomes out-of-focus so if you want
to<00:05:39.960> create<00:05:40.260> that<00:05:40.590> effect<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.370> shallow

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
to create that effect of that shallow

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.189 
to create that effect of that shallow
depth<00:05:42.000> of<00:05:42.120> field<00:05:42.330> like<00:05:42.419> you<00:05:42.539> would<00:05:42.750> find<00:05:42.960> in

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
depth of field like you would find in

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.260 
depth of field like you would find in
wedding<00:05:43.770> photography<00:05:44.430> or<00:05:44.550> sand<00:05:44.789> and<00:05:45.030> even

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
wedding photography or sand and even

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.870 
wedding photography or sand and even
using<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.870> digital<00:05:46.050> SLR<00:05:46.310> set<00:05:47.310> your<00:05:47.490> camera<00:05:47.849> to

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
using a digital SLR set your camera to

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.820 
using a digital SLR set your camera to
the<00:05:48.060> macro<00:05:48.419> function<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:49.020> take<00:05:49.500> up<00:05:49.710> that

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
the macro function and take up that

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.210 
the macro function and take up that
portrait<00:05:50.580> shot<00:05:50.849> now<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.630> in<00:05:51.810> fact<00:05:52.220> portrait

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
portrait shot now and in fact portrait

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.129 
portrait shot now and in fact portrait
doesn't<00:05:53.639> just<00:05:53.820> mean<00:05:54.060> about<00:05:54.630> taking<00:05:54.960> pictures

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
doesn't just mean about taking pictures

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.070 
doesn't just mean about taking pictures
of<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:56.400> know<00:05:56.490> Shoto<00:05:56.909> and<00:05:57.210> up<00:05:57.300> yeah<00:05:57.750> I<00:05:57.780> mean<00:05:57.990> you

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
of you know Shoto and up yeah I mean you

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.899 
of you know Shoto and up yeah I mean you
can<00:05:58.199> get<00:05:58.349> as<00:05:58.590> close<00:05:58.860> as<00:05:59.190> taking<00:05:59.580> pictures<00:05:59.880> of

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
can get as close as taking pictures of

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.330 
can get as close as taking pictures of
kids<00:06:00.270> right<00:06:00.900> up<00:06:01.050> to<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.349> eye<00:06:01.380> I've<00:06:01.919> got<00:06:02.130> I've

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
kids right up to the eye I've got I've

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.219

got some great pictures of my kids when

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.890 
got some great pictures of my kids when
they're<00:06:04.380> much<00:06:04.590> smaller<00:06:04.860> but<00:06:05.250> when<00:06:05.900> literally

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
they're much smaller but when literally

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.200 
they're much smaller but when literally
just<00:06:07.229> various<00:06:07.860> pieces<00:06:08.340> of<00:06:08.669> their<00:06:08.789> face<00:06:08.970> you

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
just various pieces of their face you

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.990 
just various pieces of their face you
know<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:09.360> and<00:06:10.139> using<00:06:11.039> the<00:06:11.130> macro<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:11.729> getting

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
know and and using the macro and getting

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.760 
know and and using the macro and getting
that<00:06:12.090> reflection<00:06:12.570> off<00:06:12.900> their<00:06:13.110> eye<00:06:13.139> and<00:06:13.320> things

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
that reflection off their eye and things

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.870 
that reflection off their eye and things
like<00:06:13.919> that<00:06:13.979> there's<00:06:14.370> so<00:06:14.460> many<00:06:14.550> beautiful

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
like that there's so many beautiful

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.680 
like that there's so many beautiful
things<00:06:15.060> you<00:06:15.389> can<00:06:15.539> do<00:06:16.699> you<00:06:17.699> know<00:06:17.729> I<00:06:18.120> think<00:06:18.360> that

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
things you can do you know I think that

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.330 
things you can do you know I think that
there's<00:06:18.870> also<00:06:19.110> just<00:06:19.349> macro<00:06:20.190> photography

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
there's also just macro photography

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.540 
there's also just macro photography
brings<00:06:21.180> in<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:21.930> whole<00:06:22.199> new<00:06:22.530> concept<00:06:22.889> of<00:06:23.340> just

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
brings in the whole new concept of just

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.399 
brings in the whole new concept of just
looking<00:06:24.000> at<00:06:24.150> things<00:06:24.389> a<00:06:24.539> different<00:06:24.659> way<00:06:24.930> in

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
looking at things a different way in

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:26.930 
looking at things a different way in
another<00:06:25.919> one<00:06:26.070> of<00:06:26.099> our<00:06:26.250> videos<00:06:26.400> we're<00:06:26.760> going<00:06:26.880> to

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
another one of our videos we're going to

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.899 
another one of our videos we're going to
talk<00:06:27.150> about<00:06:27.449> composition<00:06:28.080> but<00:06:28.639> you<00:06:29.639> know<00:06:29.729> just

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
talk about composition but you know just

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:31.790 
talk about composition but you know just
macro<00:06:30.449> in<00:06:30.570> general<00:06:30.930> there's<00:06:31.139> no<00:06:31.260> quicker<00:06:31.650> way

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
macro in general there's no quicker way

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.730 
macro in general there's no quicker way
to<00:06:32.729> bring<00:06:33.060> kind<00:06:33.779> of<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.930> different<00:06:34.320> meaning<00:06:34.710> to

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
to bring kind of a different meaning to

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.999 
to bring kind of a different meaning to
every<00:06:35.070> subject<00:06:35.669> that<00:06:35.729> you

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
every subject that you

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.129 
every subject that you
by<00:06:36.400> taking<00:06:36.669> a<00:06:36.909> close-up<00:06:37.389> view<00:06:37.419> of<00:06:37.659> it<00:06:37.839> so<00:06:37.990> like

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
by taking a close-up view of it so like

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.510 
by taking a close-up view of it so like
that's<00:06:38.259> more<00:06:38.559> of<00:06:38.650> a<00:06:38.710> kind<00:06:38.889> of<00:06:38.919> personal

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
that's more of a kind of personal

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.570 
that's more of a kind of personal
philosophy<00:06:40.479> on<00:06:40.569> macro<00:06:41.319> photography<00:06:41.580> but

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
philosophy on macro photography but

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.969 
philosophy on macro photography but
nonetheless<00:06:43.080> you<00:06:44.080> know<00:06:44.409> when<00:06:44.680> you're<00:06:44.830> when

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
nonetheless you know when you're when

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.519 
nonetheless you know when you're when

to<00:06:50.020> take<00:06:50.199> those<00:06:50.349> close-ups<00:06:50.949> it's<00:06:51.159> often<00:06:51.520> those

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699 
to take those close-ups it's often those

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.450 
to take those close-ups it's often those
pictures<00:06:52.319> that<00:06:53.319> people<00:06:53.619> will<00:06:53.740> stop<00:06:54.069> and<00:06:54.099> look
