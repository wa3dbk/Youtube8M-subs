simply build a bracket or make a bracket

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.490 
simply build a bracket or make a bracket
or<00:03:19.859> buy<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.069> custom<00:03:20.370> bracket<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.870> mounts<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
or buy a custom bracket that mounts the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.949 
or buy a custom bracket that mounts the
alternator<00:03:22.859> up<00:03:23.130> top<00:03:23.370> still<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.630> all<00:03:24.750> they<00:03:24.900> do

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
alternator up top still and all they do

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.949 
alternator up top still and all they do
is<00:03:25.230> mount<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.220> bracket<00:03:26.670> flip<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.600> alternator

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
is mount the bracket flip the alternator

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.170 
is mount the bracket flip the alternator
around<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:29.130> where<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.370> facing<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.850> opposite

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
around to where it's facing the opposite

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.280 
around to where it's facing the opposite
way<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:31.579> it<00:03:32.579> allows<00:03:32.850> them<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.209> clear<00:03:33.480> various

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
way and it allows them to clear various

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.819 
way and it allows them to clear various
parts<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.920> engine<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:39.590> think<00:03:40.590> that's

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
parts on the engine but I think that's

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:41.330 
parts on the engine but I think that's
it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.660 
it
the<00:03:42.319> water<00:03:43.319> pump<00:03:43.590> clears<00:03:43.889> everything<00:03:44.400> clears

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
the water pump clears everything clears

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.420 
the water pump clears everything clears
everything's<00:03:45.060> good<00:03:45.209> there<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:47.160> that's<00:03:47.310> it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
everything's good there so that's it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.180 
everything's good there so that's it
with<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.670> video<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:49.200> else<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.799> was<00:03:49.920> able<00:03:50.069> to

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
with this video the else I was able to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.170 
with this video the else I was able to

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
you'll need to do to the block the valve

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.000 
you'll need to do to the block the valve
cover<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:15.569> back<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.139> intake<00:04:16.560> manifold
