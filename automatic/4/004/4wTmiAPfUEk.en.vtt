00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.460 
instant world today I'm much bigger in
the<00:03:42.760> world<00:03:42.940> today<00:03:43.150> than<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.720> was<00:03:43.750> ten<00:03:44.169> years<00:03:44.200> ago

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
the world today than I was ten years ago

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.860 
the world today than I was ten years ago
I<00:03:44.919> think<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.700> world<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:45.940> much<00:03:46.090> smaller<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.840> I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
I think the world is much smaller so I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.140 
I think the world is much smaller so I
think<00:03:46.989> that<00:03:47.230> for<00:03:47.650> me<00:03:47.859> it's<00:03:48.430> understanding

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
think that for me it's understanding

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.640 
think that for me it's understanding
that<00:03:49.359> an<00:03:49.599> understanding<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:50.260> there<00:03:50.560> is

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
that an understanding that there is

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.909 
that an understanding that there is
opportunities<00:03:51.400> everywhere<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:53.410> me<00:03:53.560> how

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
opportunities everywhere to me how

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.259 
opportunities everywhere to me how

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.839 
of technology the better off i
personally<00:04:48.659> will<00:04:48.779> be<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.590> for<00:04:49.830> me<00:04:49.949> in<00:04:50.069> 2008

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
much bigger and understand the world is

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.240 
much bigger and understand the world is
getting<00:04:54.419> a<00:04:54.629> lot<00:04:54.779> smaller<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.740> I'm<00:04:55.860> one<00:04:56.069> thing

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
getting a lot smaller so I'm one thing

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.029 
getting a lot smaller so I'm one thing
for<00:04:56.460> 2008<00:04:57.300> let's<00:04:57.930> get<00:04:58.139> educated<00:04:58.620> around

for 2008 let's get educated around

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.670 
for 2008 let's get educated around
technology<00:04:59.389> so<00:05:00.389> like<00:05:00.569> I'll<00:05:00.840> say<00:05:01.229> that<00:05:01.409> what

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
technology so like I'll say that what

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.899 
technology so like I'll say that what
