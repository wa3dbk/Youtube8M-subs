00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.490
 hi to all the room i hope you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.529
 okay I'll introduce you this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.150
 which is called the dragons race then 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.590
 its name comes from the fact that seen from afar the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.000
 stand that stands in the middle represents 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.370
 a dragon then you will see the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.780
 race is not perfect she has her 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.120
 small flaws like most 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 others by cons when we made it to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 many there is really a good 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 challenge because in fact the stress 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.730
 can quickly make you miss the dragon 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.840
 so it starts slowly 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.520
 you will see there is a little jump 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.350
 low start that is far from perfect 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.699
 also so if you take it from 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.170
 full face you would take off well 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.530
 high and so you will lose a time 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.449
 crazy 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.789
 so the ideal is either the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.680
 get around either take down as early as 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.110
 the jump so I personally 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 completely failed I put you the link 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 of the race in the description of the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.150
 video and I'm throwing you a little challenge by 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 the same opportunity if you put it in 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 favorite I challenge you to do a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.790
 better time than me what is 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.650
 I did there knowing that well I got 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.229
 messed up at several places so you 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.340
 can do a lot better 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.600
 and once you've done it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.549
 come put the time you have 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.869
 made in the comments even if you 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.360
 do not better not play the game and 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.829
 still put your time while there 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.180
 it's the famous dragon so when you're 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.829
 only it is not too complicated there 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.750
 just do not bother too much and well 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.450
 stay focused when you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.009
 will be many it's not going to be the same 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.960
 so this video is coming to an end 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.740
 I tell you good race to the next 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.740
 ciao
