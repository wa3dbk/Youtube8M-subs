watching<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.750> Netflix<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
watching with Netflix it's not the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
watching with Netflix it's not the
greatest<00:01:53.490> I'd<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.810> video<00:01:55.110> go

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
from your iPhone to your Apple TV and so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.069 
from your iPhone to your Apple TV and so
