00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
together beautifully but not too much

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.970 
together beautifully but not too much
into<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.540> ball<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.110> just<00:02:26.290> want<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.770> be<00:02:26.950> just

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
into a ball you just want it to be just

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.850 
into a ball you just want it to be just
pulled<00:02:27.610> together<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.360> here<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.380> go<00:02:29.530> putting

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
pulled together and here we go putting

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.510 
pulled together and here we go putting
it<00:02:30.040> out<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.610> tray<00:02:31.200> literally<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.410> just

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
it out on the tray literally in just

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.500 
it out on the tray literally in just
little<00:02:33.520> spoonfuls<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:36.510> they'll

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
little spoonfuls like this and they'll

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.860 
little spoonfuls like this and they'll
retain<00:02:37.900> their<00:02:38.170> rough<00:02:38.380> edges<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:39.010> they<00:02:39.220> bake

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
retain their rough edges as they bake

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.200 
retain their rough edges as they bake
this<00:02:40.870> makes<00:02:41.170> probably<00:02:41.740> about<00:02:41.950> 24<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:43.000> 30

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
this makes probably about 24 to 30

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.670 
this makes probably about 24 to 30
scones<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.440> one<00:02:44.770> more<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:47.110> we'll<00:02:47.230> just<00:02:47.440> pop

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
scones so one more and we'll just pop

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.880 
scones so one more and we'll just pop
that<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.100> oven

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.030
