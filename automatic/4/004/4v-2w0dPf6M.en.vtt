00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820

enough power so I thought and I had a
Centurion<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.509> I'm<00:01:51.600> taking<00:01:51.810> apart<00:01:52.110> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
literally on my UCF cam and I thought

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.320 
literally on my UCF cam and I thought
what<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.039> make<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.550> two<00:02:11.790> hours<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.300> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
what can I make in two hours with a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.610 
what can I make in two hours with a
bunch<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.629> scraps

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
bunch of scraps

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
bunch of scraps
and<00:02:13.709> this<00:02:14.280> old<00:02:14.459> gun<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.239> got<00:02:15.420> eBay's<00:02:15.959> all

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and this old gun that I got eBay's all

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.550 
and this old gun that I got eBay's all
scratched<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.920> didn't<00:02:17.730> work<00:02:17.819> very<00:02:17.849> well

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
scratched up and didn't work very well

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.030 
scratched up and didn't work very well
one<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.099> biggest<00:02:20.310> issues<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:21.650> these<00:02:22.650> is

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
one of the biggest issues with these is

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.009 
one of the biggest issues with these is
this<00:02:23.459> tiny<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.150> plunger<00:02:24.629> too<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:24.930> they

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
this tiny little plunger too but they

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.740 
this tiny little plunger too but they
have<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.349> them<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.299> very<00:02:27.450> big<00:02:27.599> so

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
have in them it's just not very big so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.119 
have in them it's just not very big so
you<00:02:27.780> can't<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.080> much<00:02:28.200> air<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:28.980> put

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
you can't get much air and you can put

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.979 
you can't get much air and you can put
it<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.549> zillion<00:02:29.879> Springs<00:02:30.329> in<00:02:30.540> there<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
it like a zillion Springs in there and

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.979 
it like a zillion Springs in there and
try<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.590> cram<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.069> air<00:02:32.220> really<00:02:32.579> fast<00:02:32.989> and

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
try and cram that air really fast and

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.330 
try and cram that air really fast and
you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.349> get<00:02:34.470> some<00:02:34.620> pretty<00:02:34.739> good<00:02:34.829> velocities

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
you can get some pretty good velocities

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.330 
you can get some pretty good velocities
I'm<00:02:35.489> not<00:02:35.640> gonna<00:02:35.760> lie<00:02:36.590> but<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.129> thing<00:02:38.310> is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
I'm not gonna lie but the thing is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.920 
I'm not gonna lie but the thing is
you're<00:02:38.519> smashing<00:02:39.060> up<00:02:39.150> under<00:02:39.420> tube<00:02:39.599> in<00:02:39.750> there

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
you're smashing up under tube in there

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.589 
you're smashing up under tube in there
and<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:41.159> really<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.760> short<00:02:42.239> timeframe

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
and it's really on a short timeframe

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.780 
and it's really on a short timeframe
before<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.349> gonna<00:02:43.409> explode<00:02:43.739> well<00:02:44.670> we're

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
before it's gonna explode well we're

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.160 
before it's gonna explode well we're
gonna<00:02:44.879> Pat<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.329> into<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.510> whole<00:02:45.690> bunch<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.930> fancy

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
gonna Pat it into a whole bunch of fancy

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.650 
gonna Pat it into a whole bunch of fancy
stuff<00:02:46.579> basically<00:02:47.579> what<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.819> did<00:02:47.910> here<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.540> I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
stuff basically what I did here is I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.740 
stuff basically what I did here is I
took<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.859> is<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.340> as<00:02:51.299> you<00:02:51.420> can<00:02:51.510> see<00:02:51.660> it's

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
took this is just as you can see it's

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.900 
took this is just as you can see it's
just<00:02:51.780> conduit<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:54.079> in<00:02:55.079> there<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.680> quickly<00:02:56.640> cut

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
just conduit and in there I quickly cut

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.580 
just conduit and in there I quickly cut
out<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.269> had<00:02:57.480> some<00:02:57.660> 17<00:02:59.000> so<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.209> 17

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
out I had some 17 so this is 17

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.800 
out I had some 17 so this is 17
thirty-second<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.829> it<00:03:02.459> nests<00:03:02.909> into<00:03:03.150> another

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
thirty-second and it nests into another

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.589 
thirty-second and it nests into another
cleat<00:03:04.019> little<00:03:04.230> baby<00:03:04.409> piece<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.859> conduit<00:03:05.159> and

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
cleat little baby piece of conduit and

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.240 
cleat little baby piece of conduit and
on<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.720> Centurion<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.440> actually<00:03:07.859> fits

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
on the Centurion this actually fits

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.180 
on the Centurion this actually fits
perfectly<00:03:08.879> in<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.209> half<00:03:09.359> inch<00:03:09.569> coupler<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.190> I

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
perfectly in a half inch coupler so I

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.190 
perfectly in a half inch coupler so I
just<00:03:11.370> coupled<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.849> in<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.359> screwed<00:03:13.109> it

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
just coupled that in I screwed it

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.599 
just coupled that in I screwed it
together<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.709> didn't<00:03:13.920> pull<00:03:14.099> apart<00:03:14.370> when<00:03:14.519> you

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
together so didn't pull apart when you

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.160 
together so didn't pull apart when you
pull<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.030> wanted<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> come<00:03:15.599> apart<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.140> I

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
pull it it wanted to come apart so I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.830 
pull it it wanted to come apart so I
screwed<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.069> grouped<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.549> as<00:03:17.840> I

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
screwed that in and I grouped it as I

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.569 
screwed that in and I grouped it as I
was<00:03:18.930> going<00:03:19.049> in<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.530> let<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:19.950> kind<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.220> sit<00:03:20.280> on

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
was going in and let it kind of sit on

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.449 
was going in and let it kind of sit on
the<00:03:20.790> cap<00:03:20.970> then<00:03:21.419> I<00:03:21.510> goop<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.900> end<00:03:22.280> put<00:03:23.280> another

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
the cap then I goop the end put another

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.229 
the cap then I goop the end put another
bolt<00:03:23.760> into<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.329> other<00:03:24.569> piece<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:25.099> coupler

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
bolt into that other piece of coupler

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.089 
bolt into that other piece of coupler
into<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.329> coupler<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.840> one<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.950> there's

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.330 
into the coupler and one and there's
like<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> half-inch<00:03:30.410> ish<00:03:31.410> that's<00:03:32.099> doesn't

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340

is<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.109> massive<00:03:55.980> plunger<00:03:56.430> tube<00:03:56.639> it's<00:03:57.269> not<00:03:57.419> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
is a massive plunger tube it's not the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.210 
is a massive plunger tube it's not the
best<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.930> says<00:03:58.109> interesting<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.799> don't<00:03:58.859> fully

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
best it says interesting I don't fully

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.500 
best it says interesting I don't fully
understand<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.609> system<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.269> like<00:04:00.389> it's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
understand the system of it like it's

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.860 
understand the system of it like it's
almost<00:04:00.629> a<00:04:00.750> reverse<00:04:00.959> blender<00:04:01.440> system<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.910> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
almost a reverse blender system but the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.439 
almost a reverse blender system but the
spring<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.590> got<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.190> be<00:04:05.310> about<00:04:05.489> 11<00:04:05.639> inches<00:04:06.090> long

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
spring is got to be about 11 inches long

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.309 
spring is got to be about 11 inches long
like<00:04:06.780> it's<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.019> massive<00:04:07.620> spring<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.639> this<00:04:08.819> thing

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
like it's a massive spring so this thing

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.930 
like it's a massive spring so this thing
right<00:04:10.319> now<00:04:10.349> I'm<00:04:10.919> clocking<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.519> well<00:04:11.730> I'll<00:04:11.819> show

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
right now I'm clocking it well I'll show

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.979 
right now I'm clocking it well I'll show

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.959 
per second when I kept the red dot on
the<00:04:24.479> next<00:04:24.690> five<00:04:24.840> years<00:04:24.870> that's<00:04:25.289> kind<00:04:25.469> of<00:04:25.500> fun
