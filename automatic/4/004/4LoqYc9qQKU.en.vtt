00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.350
 people from bunkers slowly started 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.850
 Reasonable beasts mutated to 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.250
 horror cows with two heads gigantic 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.650
 scorpions and huge flies are the most 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 harmless that you can meet games 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.159
 and here in this post apocalypse we must 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.140
 survive 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.450
 to find water in order not to die 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.369

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.540
 humane 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.460
 and most importantly follow the radiation from they you 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.630
 monster and this is just the beginning and on 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.420
 listing just takes a couple of hours and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.899
 then where to put the fallout in the top 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.899
 simply 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 on the 3rd place is an expensive series 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.910
 games for people living on 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.860
 post- stalker space and and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.230
 as well as fallout, it is not rated by one 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.819
 the game and for a whole series of stalker us 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.600
 tells a story after a terrible 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.580
 the disaster of April 26, 1982 all 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.260
 territory undergoing radiation 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.450
 turned into a living hell on earth 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.819
 terribly mutilated animals people 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.920
 tucked radiation turned the most 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.019
 these animals to kill all who 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.440
 sees on the horizon the essence itself 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.390
 nature destroyed and that very monstrous 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.730
 radiation accident and here we are in the image 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.170
 the main character must survive here we 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.900
 should do the same as in other 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.090
 games of this type look for water and food 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.600
 hide at night from wild beasts or in addition 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.519
 worse 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.799
 must search for weapons by springs for 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.870
 protect your loved one and be sure 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.569
 monitor radiation levels and so on 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.120
 but the atmospheres that are present in 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.459
 this game will envy everyone 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.260
 new bloom will be happy more than 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.750
 if you had found any powerful weapon 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.820
 because no weapon will save you 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.489
 from what happens all night 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.470
 the atmosphere of inevitability oppresses you and you 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.230
 completely immersed in all this horror 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.090
 and fear and for such an atmosphere which is not 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.709
 To put into words the game I earned 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.120
 third place is second 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.760

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.590
 but already a boom in games 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.780
 survival state of decay 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.670
 in this game you have to take under 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.640

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.350
