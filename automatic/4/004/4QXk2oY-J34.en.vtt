00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
so this video could actually be a lot

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.340 
so this video could actually be a lot
shorter<00:00:44.370> than<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:46.039> then<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.370> because<00:00:48.000> I

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
shorter than it then it is because I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.720 
shorter than it then it is because I
screwed<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.860> wasn't<00:00:50.190> doing<00:00:50.550> too<00:00:50.579> well

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
screwed up like I wasn't doing too well
like<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> beginning<00:00:51.989> because

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
like right now in the beginning because

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.860

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you need to get directly right behind

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.000 
you need to get directly right behind
them<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.680> bit

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
in the middle a good tip is just you'll

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.940 
in the middle a good tip is just you'll
always<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.729> his<00:01:05.970> back<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.950> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

have<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.640> fly<00:01:09.270> around<00:01:09.420> his<00:01:09.810> back<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
have to like fly around his back like

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.030 
have to like fly around his back like
he'll<00:01:10.409> do<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> move<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> he'll<00:01:11.909> jump<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.540> a

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
he'll do a move and he'll jump like a

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.469 
he'll do a move and he'll jump like a
thousand<00:01:14.040> feet<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.970> already<00:01:15.240> be

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
thousand feet and then you already be

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.789 
thousand feet and then you already be
behind<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:15.990> standing<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.680> up

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
behind them standing just got to go up

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
behind them standing just got to go up
to<00:01:16.950> him<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.070> give<00:01:17.909> him<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.210> shot<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to him and give him a little shot in the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.030 
to him and give him a little shot in the
back<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:19.049> his<00:01:20.040> moves<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:21.060> strong<00:01:21.450> so

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
back now his moves are pretty strong so

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.530 
back now his moves are pretty strong so
it's<00:01:23.040> good<00:01:23.310> idea<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.729> dodge<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:25.280> be<00:01:26.280> quick<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
it's good idea to dodge them be quick it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.069 
it's good idea to dodge them be quick it
doesn't<00:01:28.320> take<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.650> many<00:01:28.829> hits<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.659> don't

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
know hike wasn't counting how many it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.420 
know hike wasn't counting how many it
took<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.000> didn't<00:01:33.180> take<00:01:33.299> very<00:01:33.329> many<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430
