rode motorcycles and that got me

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.090 
rode motorcycles and that got me
thinking<00:00:32.830> I<00:00:33.480> don't<00:00:34.480> think<00:00:34.900> I<00:00:35.020> would<00:00:35.200> let<00:00:35.440> if<00:00:35.890> I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
thinking I don't think I would let if I

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.610 
thinking I don't think I would let if I
could<00:00:36.400> let<00:00:37.269> that<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:39.100> think<00:00:39.940> I<00:00:40.090> would<00:00:40.300> allow<00:00:41.140> my

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
could let that I think I would allow my

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.029

wife to ride a motorcycle
which<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.820> me<00:00:44.850> thinking<00:00:44.969> why<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:47.809> okay

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
which got me thinking why I do okay

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.599 
which got me thinking why I do okay
granted<00:00:49.230> I'm<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> better<00:00:49.710> rather<00:00:49.920> than<00:00:50.039> she<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
granted I'm a better rather than she is

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.000 
granted I'm a better rather than she is
but<00:00:51.210> when<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.719> started<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.350> worse<00:00:52.739> because

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
but when I started I was worse because

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.119 
but when I started I was worse because
she<00:00:53.280> always<00:00:53.430> rode<00:00:54.210> motorcycles<00:00:54.890> she<00:00:55.890> used<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
she always rode motorcycles she used to

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.329 
she always rode motorcycles she used to
ride<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.629> scooter<00:00:57.629> when<00:00:57.930> she<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.260> younger<00:00:58.949> so

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
ride a scooter when she was younger so

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.579 
ride a scooter when she was younger so
she's<00:01:00.239> got<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> lot<00:01:00.659> more<00:01:00.690> experience<00:01:01.049> on<00:01:01.469> two

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
she's got a lot more experience on two

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.789 
she's got a lot more experience on two
wheels<00:01:01.739> than<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> had<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.519> began

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
wheels than I had when I began

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.069 

so<00:01:05.460> why<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:07.609> okay<00:01:08.609> granted<00:01:09.000> she<00:01:09.179> has<00:01:09.390> little

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
so why not okay granted she has little

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.870 
so why not okay granted she has little
to<00:01:10.350> no<00:01:10.380> skill<00:01:10.859> now<00:01:11.009> and<00:01:11.189> she<00:01:11.310> doesn't<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.729> how

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
to no skill now and she doesn't know how

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.830 
to no skill now and she doesn't know how
to<00:01:11.909> use<00:01:12.210> gears<00:01:12.509> but<00:01:12.719> I<00:01:13.049> didn't<00:01:13.979> either

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
to use gears but I didn't either

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.559 
to use gears but I didn't either
so<00:01:15.840> why<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.829> am<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.399> still<00:01:17.670> fighting<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.240> idea

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:18.569 
so why my am I still fighting this idea

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.240 
so why my am I still fighting this idea
of<00:01:18.840> her<00:01:19.020> riding<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.469> motorcycle

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the right again some from the danger

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.910 
the right again some from the danger

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
example these two guys could have killed

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.200 
example these two guys could have killed
me<00:01:43.479> you<00:01:44.009> need<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.040> be<00:01:45.190> very<00:01:45.790> attentive

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.050 

and<00:01:48.470> granted<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:49.680> wife<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.160> bit<00:01:50.430> distracted

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and granted my wife is a bit distracted

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.810 
and granted my wife is a bit distracted
on<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.270> roads<00:01:51.530> but<00:01:52.530> generally<00:01:53.370> people<00:01:53.580> who

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
on the roads but generally people who

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.940 
on the roads but generally people who
drive<00:01:54.180> cars<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:55.050> distracted<00:01:55.620> on<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.710> road

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
drive cars are distracted on the road

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.990 
drive cars are distracted on the road
because<00:01:56.100> they<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.520> afford<00:01:56.550> two<00:01:57.090> bikes<00:01:57.780> can't

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
because they can afford two bikes can't

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.030 
because they can afford two bikes can't
the<00:02:00.000> penalties<00:02:00.510> bigger<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.350> generally<00:02:01.830> bikes

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the penalties bigger so generally bikes

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.130 
the penalties bigger so generally bikes
aren't<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:04.100> distracted<00:02:05.100> road

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
aren't that distracted road

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.420 
aren't that distracted road
so<00:02:07.740> I'm<00:02:07.890> I'm<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.460> of<00:02:08.600> arguments<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:10.680> literally

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
so I'm I'm out of arguments I literally

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.420 
so I'm I'm out of arguments I literally
argued<00:02:12.060> against<00:02:12.570> myself<00:02:13.020> right<00:02:13.620> up<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> wall

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
argued against myself right up to a wall

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.630 
argued against myself right up to a wall
and<00:02:14.790> still<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.750> would<00:02:16.260> say<00:02:16.290> not<00:02:17.130> rather<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and still I would say not rather you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.790 
and still I would say not rather you
didn't

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
didn't

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.830 
didn't
so<00:02:20.370> yeah<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.630> really<00:02:21.870> tiny<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.320> just

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
so yeah this is a really tiny one just

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.320 
so yeah this is a really tiny one just
explain<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:25.560> yes<00:02:26.250> or<00:02:26.520> if<00:02:26.610> no<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.970> would<00:02:27.150> actually

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
explain if yes or if no I would actually

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.950
