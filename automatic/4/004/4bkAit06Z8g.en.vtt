00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
and voila I've just made my first half

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.960 
and voila I've just made my first half
wig<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:29.729> this<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.210> human<00:04:30.750> hair<00:04:31.250> I've<00:04:32.250> picked

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.430 
wig and this is human hair I've picked
out<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.300> curls<00:04:33.599> just<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.960> little<00:04:34.199> bit<00:04:34.319> because

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
out the curls just a little bit because

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.719 
out the curls just a little bit because
this<00:04:34.860> looks<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:36.409> Shirley<00:04:37.409> Temple<00:04:37.889> ish<00:04:38.009> for<00:04:38.520> me
