cards

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.970 
cards
it's<00:02:13.689> a<00:02:13.840> lot<00:02:13.959> like<00:02:14.200> Lucario's<00:02:14.709> attack

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
it's a lot like Lucario's attack

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.920 
it's a lot like Lucario's attack
corkscrew<00:02:15.519> smash<00:02:15.790> but<00:02:16.299> it's<00:02:16.510> an<00:02:16.599> ability

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
corkscrew smash but it's an ability

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.280 
corkscrew smash but it's an ability
makes<00:02:17.349> that<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> lot<00:02:17.709> faster<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:20.170> only

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
makes that a lot faster but the only

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.160 
makes that a lot faster but the only
downside<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:20.920> low<00:02:21.370> HP<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.750> bad

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
downside is that low HP and that bad

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.550 
downside is that low HP and that bad
attack<00:02:23.640> well<00:02:24.640> Lucario<00:02:25.030> has<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> lot<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.900> HP<00:02:26.110> and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
attack well Lucario has a lot of HP and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.640 
attack well Lucario has a lot of HP and
a<00:02:26.799> brick<00:02:27.250> house<00:02:27.730> attack<00:02:28.379> which<00:02:29.379> is<00:02:29.470> why<00:02:29.620> I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
a brick house attack which is why I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.880 
a brick house attack which is why I
usually<00:02:30.069> use<00:02:30.159> Lucario<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:32.349> but<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.769> my

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
usually use Lucario so but this is my

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.039 
usually use Lucario so but this is my
opinion<00:02:33.099> shaming<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.760> very<00:02:34.180> powerful<00:02:34.659> overall

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
opinion shaming is very powerful overall

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.309 
opinion shaming is very powerful overall
in<00:02:35.260> my<00:02:35.319> opinion<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.360> said<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.750> so
