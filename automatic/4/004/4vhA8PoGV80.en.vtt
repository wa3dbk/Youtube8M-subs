00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.170 
that's what really keeps us going and
one<00:02:41.480> wanting<00:02:42.140> us<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.320> play<00:02:43.250> again<00:02:43.549> it<00:02:43.910> always

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
one wanting us to play again it always

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.870 
one wanting us to play again it always
turns<00:02:44.630> out<00:02:44.780> differently<00:02:45.260> or<00:02:45.590> excited<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:46.730> see

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
turns out differently or excited to see

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.850 
turns out differently or excited to see
what<00:02:47.030> happens

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
what happens

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.210 
what happens
there<00:02:48.640> are<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> few<00:02:49.510> twin<00:02:50.230> jazz<00:02:50.530> musicians<00:02:51.070> out

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
there are a few twin jazz musicians out

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.330 
there are a few twin jazz musicians out
there<00:02:51.280> as<00:02:51.790> far<00:02:52.480> as<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:52.930> seen<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:54.070> are<00:02:54.100> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
there as far as I have seen we are the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.480 
there as far as I have seen we are the
only<00:02:54.460> twin<00:02:54.850> saxophone<00:02:55.600> players<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:57.250> think

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
only twin saxophone players and I think

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.850 
only twin saxophone players and I think
it<00:02:57.820> makes<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.510> good<00:02:58.750> dynamic<00:02:59.290> for<00:02:59.500> our<00:02:59.590> group

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
it makes a good dynamic for our group

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.450 
it makes a good dynamic for our group
because<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.940> alto<00:03:01.300> tenor<00:03:02.070> combination<00:03:03.070> when

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
because the alto tenor combination when

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.460 
because the alto tenor combination when
Ted<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.880> pretty<00:03:04.120> rare<00:03:04.420> that's<00:03:04.930> not<00:03:05.200> done<00:03:05.440> that

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
Ted is pretty rare that's not done that

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.880 
Ted is pretty rare that's not done that
much<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:06.880> think<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.210> makes<00:03:07.360> our<00:03:07.570> group

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:26.490 

you

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.560
