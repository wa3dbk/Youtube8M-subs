00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.590
 Trucks have only a small share of the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.250
 total accident happening in german 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.590
 roads 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.259
 but if it crashes then it is common 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.840
 collision accidents on cars eg at one 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.300
 jamming and they often have bad 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.279
 consequences 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.189
 in this accident constellation truck 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 especially the cars are against cars 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.040
 Inmates very vulnerable and step here 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.550
 Very very fast heaviest 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 life threatening and deadly 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.500
 injuries to about 60 dead are like that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.739
 every year to complain 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.859
 according to the legislator, from 2013 all 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.629
 new truck types from 2015 then all 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.800
 New registrations over 3 5 tons 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.460
 standard with one 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.809
 emergency brake assistants 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 that this is urgently needed 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.059
 shows the adac in its latest 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.239
 Crash test in this experiment, we have 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.000
 A jam simulates two cars standing 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 behind a truck in a jam 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 another truck comes from behind 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.159
 approached and does not respond 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.159
 or much too late 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.700
 the test starts at 55 tons 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.920
 relatively light truck drives 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.620
 highways typical 70 km h on the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.060
 stationary vehicles 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.710
 and even here shows the collision 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.710
 a shocking dimension 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.610
 The result is devastating 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.259
 Inmates the car occupants have here 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.149
 almost no chance of survival 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.340
 they are literally pinched 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.310
 between these two vehicles the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.380
 Vehicles are completely destroyed 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.220
 with an emergency brake assistant this would be 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.899
 does not happen 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.789
 even if it is for technical reasons 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.740
 at present not all coalitions join 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.610
 higher speeds 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.009
 completely prevent 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.720
 the adac is glad that the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.280
 Emergency brake legally 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.750
 is being prescribed right now 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.700
 Commercial vehicles they will not become 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.890
 bought fun there is no unnecessary money 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.110
 These are work tools that are issued 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.610
 that's why it's necessary 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.700
 very important that here is a legal 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.319
 Default comes for the adac, it is very 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.420
 important for this new 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.519
 legislation really stood at the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.769
 That means, that is called engineering 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.840
 a minimal solution that only a very 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.790
 low speed degradation provides 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.560
 it is unacceptable 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.420
 emergency brake assist is an elaborate one 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.580
 system and if such a complex 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.140
 system must be used, too 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.930
 neat with high requirements 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.400
 be implemented and really the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.420
 reduce speed significantly or 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.420
 prevent accidents
