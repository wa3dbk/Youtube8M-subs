00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
there's the coffin and there are the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
there's the coffin and there are the
skeletons<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:09.270> balloons<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.500> fly

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
skeletons with balloons so they can fly

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.210 
skeletons with balloons so they can fly
an<00:01:11.070> attack<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.430> balloon<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.320> really

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
an attack that balloon so this is really

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.359 
an attack that balloon so this is really
awesome<00:01:15.020> noting<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.070> seen

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
awesome noting that like we have seen

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.260 
awesome noting that like we have seen
before<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:19.530> know<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.460> just

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
before and I don't know if this is just

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
before and I don't know if this is just
I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.680> new<00:01:22.920> trap<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.520> all<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.880> not

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I think it's a new trap for all and not

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.499 
I think it's a new trap for all and not
just<00:01:24.390> for<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.520> pumpkin<00:01:26.880> bomb<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
just for like the the pumpkin bomb just

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.100 
just for like the the pumpkin bomb just
for<00:01:27.720> Halloween

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
for Halloween

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.130 
for Halloween
I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.950> ever<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.479> trap<00:01:30.810> looks

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
I think it's for ever so this trap looks

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
I think it's for ever so this trap looks
really<00:01:31.619> awesome<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.460> pretty<00:01:32.670> effective

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
really awesome and it's pretty effective

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.109 
really awesome and it's pretty effective
on<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.570> level<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.170> balloon<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:35.119> but

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
on this level one balloon I think but

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.219 
on this level one balloon I think but
yeah<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> coffin<00:01:37.110> raises<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:40.049> it

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
yeah the coffin raises and you see it

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.800 
yeah the coffin raises and you see it
it's<00:01:40.920> level<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:41.909> level<00:01:42.180> three<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
it's level two and now level three and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's level two and now level three and
it<00:01:42.930> looks<00:01:43.079> deadly

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it looks deadly

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.389 
it looks deadly
and<00:01:44.329> let's<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.509> skeleton<00:01:46.020> cost<00:01:46.470> six<00:01:46.770> thousand

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and let's see skeleton cost six thousand

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
and let's see skeleton cost six thousand
so<00:01:47.549> ambush<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.329> distract<00:01:48.869> unsuspecting<00:01:49.829> foes
