and max can it well max is going to do

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.499 
and max can it well max is going to do
it<00:01:09.299> first<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:12.860> think<00:01:13.860> he's<00:01:14.010> trying<00:01:14.509> there's

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it first I think he's trying there's

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.240 
it first I think he's trying there's
many<00:01:15.900> separate<00:01:16.320> ways<00:01:16.560> um<00:01:17.509> but<00:01:18.770> it's<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
many separate ways um but it's the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.870 
many separate ways um but it's the
easiest<00:01:20.670> our<00:01:20.970> way<00:01:24.080> okay<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.400> get<00:01:26.400> good<00:01:26.640> grip

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
easiest our way okay now get good grip

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.840 
easiest our way okay now get good grip
is<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:28.490> structure<00:01:30.200> grid<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.470> maybe<00:01:32.280> ups<00:01:32.549> like

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
is in structure grid and maybe ups like

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.200 
is in structure grid and maybe ups like
that<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.130> close<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that and you get close to it like that

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.590 
that and you get close to it like that
and<00:01:37.310> basically<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.759> grid<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.119> carrying<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and basically the grid is carrying you

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.670 
and basically the grid is carrying you
right<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
right now so now all you have to do is

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.609 
right now so now all you have to do is
just<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.220> oh<00:01:44.689> wow<00:01:45.689> okay<00:01:46.140> let<00:01:46.380> me<00:01:46.439> try<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
just do that oh wow okay let me try that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.840 
just do that oh wow okay let me try that
again<00:01:47.270> all<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.450> need<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.890> smoke

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
again all you need to do is that smoke

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.410 
again all you need to do is that smoke
really<00:01:51.180> hard<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.820> map<00:01:54.000> but

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
really hard and now you have the map but

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.050 
really hard and now you have the map but
go<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:56.759> here

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
go right to the back of it and go here

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.940 
go right to the back of it and go here
and<00:01:59.420> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.689> some<00:02:00.930> fun<00:02:00.960> exploring<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and you can have some fun exploring that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.160 
and you can have some fun exploring that
put<00:02:02.189> some<00:02:02.340> spawns<00:02:02.640> down<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.020> go

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
put some spawns down and you can go

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.740 
put some spawns down and you can go
exploring<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.790> can't<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.270> higher

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
exploring it but you can't go out higher

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
exploring it but you can't go out higher
than<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.320> you've<00:02:07.530> got<00:02:07.710> no<00:02:07.829> spawns

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
than that if you've got no spawns

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.130 
than that if you've got no spawns
because<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> don't<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> again<00:02:09.110> um
