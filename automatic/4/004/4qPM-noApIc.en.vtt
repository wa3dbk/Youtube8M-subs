00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
this

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.929 
this
for<00:00:28.110> if<00:00:29.110> it's<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.439> Janome<00:00:29.829> brand<00:00:30.189> it<00:00:30.730> will

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
for if it's a Janome brand it will

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.030 
for if it's a Janome brand it will
probably<00:00:31.119> have<00:00:31.509> an<00:00:31.930> F<00:00:32.200> on<00:00:32.439> there<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:34.000> I<00:00:35.040> thought

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
probably have an F on there so I thought

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.470

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
the way that it has a little groove on

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.240 
the way that it has a little groove on
the<00:00:48.040> underside<00:00:48.550> here<00:00:49.829> whereas<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.980> standard

foot doesn't have that groove may be

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.690 
foot doesn't have that groove may be
hard<00:00:54.700> to<00:00:54.820> see<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.890> main<00:00:57.070> purpose<00:00:57.340> for

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
hard to see and the main purpose for

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.319 
hard to see and the main purpose for
this<00:00:57.790> is<00:00:58.090> if<00:00:58.870> you're<00:00:59.140> doing<00:00:59.320> your<00:01:00.329> decorative

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
stitches that are a little bit bulky

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.230 
stitches that are a little bit bulky
like<00:01:03.489> these<00:01:03.730> ones<00:01:03.940> here<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:06.240> certain

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
like these ones here and the certain

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.350 
like these ones here and the certain
stitch<00:01:07.509> foot<00:01:07.720> allows<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:09.210> thread<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:10.329> the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
stitch foot allows the thread in the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.950 
stitch foot allows the thread in the
fabric<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:11.170> go<00:01:11.290> onto<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.649> foot<00:01:11.860> quite<00:01:12.610> easily

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
fabric to go onto the foot quite easily

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.230 
fabric to go onto the foot quite easily
and<00:01:13.960> sometimes<00:01:14.290> I've<00:01:14.950> found<00:01:15.280> if<00:01:15.430> I've<00:01:15.579> been

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
and sometimes I've found if I've been

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.849 
and sometimes I've found if I've been
using<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.689> standard<00:01:17.079> foot<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:17.469> doing<00:01:17.770> a

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
using the standard foot and doing a

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.050 
using the standard foot and doing a
satin<00:01:18.159> stitch<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:19.450> can<00:01:19.600> get<00:01:19.749> stuck<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.159> if

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060

see the fabric and that's coming up
quite<00:02:09.580> clearly<00:02:09.910> whereas<00:02:10.810> if<00:02:10.959> you're<00:02:11.080> using

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
or a little bit blurred so it's not too

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.240 
or a little bit blurred so it's not too
bad<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.900> standard<00:02:17.590> effort<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.130> be

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
bad this this standard effort can be

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.660 
bad this this standard effort can be
used<00:02:18.520> for<00:02:21.720> application<00:02:22.720> toe<00:02:22.870> foot<00:02:23.819> okay
