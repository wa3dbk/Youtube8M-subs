00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.510 
personal opinion pilots from Too Faced
and<00:00:37.470> it<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.350> country<00:00:40.350> Nashville<00:00:41.100> nudes

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.900 
and it is the country Nashville nudes
and<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.199> how<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.470> looks<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.949> this<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and this is how it looks like this is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.750 
and this is how it looks like this is
the<00:00:45.300> pilot<00:00:45.809> itself<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.770> comes<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.400> a<00:00:47.430> very

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the pilot itself it comes with a very

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.229 
the pilot itself it comes with a very
nice<00:00:48.120> box<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.559> safe<00:00:49.949> I<00:00:50.340> usually<00:00:51.059> throw

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
nice box that I'm a safe I usually throw

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.030 
nice box that I'm a safe I usually throw
away<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> boxes<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.170> i<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.470> this<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.860> it's

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
away the boxes but i think this one it's

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.870 
away the boxes but i think this one it's
worth<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.780> nice<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.590> says<00:00:56.220> country

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
worth it's really nice it says country

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.600 
worth it's really nice it says country
and<00:00:57.149> then<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> has<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> little<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
and then it has a little bit of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.150 
and then it has a little bit of
introduction<00:00:59.610> over<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.770> it's<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.010> very

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
introduction over here it's just very

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
introduction over here it's just very
nice<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> reminds<00:01:03.600> me<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.680> Denning

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
nice it kind of reminds me the Denning

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.999 
nice it kind of reminds me the Denning
and<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:07.880> country<00:01:10.399> purples<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:12.560> baby<00:01:13.560> pigs

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
and the country purples and baby pigs

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.520 
and the country purples and baby pigs
that<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.430> use<00:01:14.759> under<00:01:15.539> outfits<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> will

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that they use under outfits if you will

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.630 
that they use under outfits if you will
so<00:01:17.100> let<00:01:17.670> me<00:01:17.850> show<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> palette<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:19.640> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
so let me show you the palette and this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240 
so let me show you the palette and this
is<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:21.119> tin<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.410> two-face<00:01:22.979> has

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
is the tin I think that two-face has

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
is the tin I think that two-face has
moved<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.060> design<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.770> works

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
moved to this design and it just works

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.100 
moved to this design and it just works
awesome<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.569> has<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.720> magnetic

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
awesome because it has a magnetic

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.190 
awesome because it has a magnetic
closure<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.580> need<00:01:29.789> to<00:01:29.940> open<00:01:30.690> close

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
closure so you just need to open close

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
closure so you just need to open close
and<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> palette<00:01:33.840> itself<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:35.360> as

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and this is the palette itself and as

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960 
and this is the palette itself and as
many<00:01:36.750> are<00:01:37.050> I<00:01:37.470> would<00:01:37.860> say<00:01:38.099> as<00:01:38.459> all<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.819> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
many are I would say as all of the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.809 
many are I would say as all of the
pallets<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.959> face<00:01:40.200> usually<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:41.069> just<00:01:41.429> call

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
pallets to face usually would just call

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.440 
pallets to face usually would just call
the<00:01:42.179> looks<00:01:42.630> by<00:01:43.050> row<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.369> first<00:01:44.580> row<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.179> day

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the looks by row so the first row is day

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.279 
the looks by row so the first row is day
the<00:01:45.899> second<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.319> classic<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.550> third<00:01:47.819> is

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
the second is classic and the third is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.770 
the second is classic and the third is
fashion<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> let<00:01:50.550> me<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.849> watch<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.330> on<00:01:51.509> my

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
fashion so let me just watch it on my

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.440 
fashion so let me just watch it on my
head<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.349> my<00:01:52.560> fingers<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.910> see<00:01:54.179> I

don't really want to don't go into the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.740 
don't really want to don't go into the
arm<00:01:57.330> because<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.440> doesn't<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.209> capture<00:02:00.209> in

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
arm because it doesn't really capture in

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.080 
arm because it doesn't really capture in
my<00:02:01.020> camera<00:02:01.880> okay<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.119> let<00:02:03.270> me<00:02:03.300> go<00:02:04.280> one<00:02:05.280> row<00:02:05.849> at<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
warm neutral color it's kind of a flesh

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.880 
warm neutral color it's kind of a flesh

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
this

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.360 
this
is<00:02:26.969> it<00:02:27.829> then<00:02:28.829> you<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.189> your<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:32.040> one

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
is it then you have your and this one

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.250 
is it then you have your and this one
you<00:02:32.609> have<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:33.150> very<00:02:33.389> careful<00:02:33.689> because<00:02:34.079> if

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
you have to be very careful because if

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.309 
you have to be very careful because if
you<00:02:34.680> press<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.010> too<00:02:35.489> much<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.659> notice<00:02:37.139> that

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
you press it too much I just notice that

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.170 
you press it too much I just notice that
there's<00:02:37.499> a<00:02:37.560> lot<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.769> fell<00:02:38.159> out<00:02:38.400> there<00:02:38.760> it's

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
there's a lot of fell out there it's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.250 
there's a lot of fell out there it's
kind<00:02:39.689> of<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:40.400> shimmery<00:02:41.400> almost<00:02:42.209> metallic<00:02:42.719> shade

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
kind of a shimmery almost metallic shade

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.910 
kind of a shimmery almost metallic shade
so<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.159> looks<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.489> me<00:02:44.609> like<00:02:44.639> a<00:02:45.000> pigment<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.959> kind

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
so it looks to me like a pigment so kind

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.379 
so it looks to me like a pigment so kind
of<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.099> pigment<00:02:47.519> with<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:48.060> little

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
of a pigment with all this little

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.229 
of a pigment with all this little
