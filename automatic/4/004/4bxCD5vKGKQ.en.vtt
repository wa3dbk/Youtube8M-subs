00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.680
 so now we are going to continue a second stage where then the 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.789
 Let's not make dessert, let's enjoy it. 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.190
 those groves that we have only been attacking 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.490
 It's like Holland when we do not know what to do so we're going to make a 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.689
 pudding stands there 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.519
 besides it is very easy to make 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.720
 so let's go then we'll get to a point in six whole games 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.399
 a can of condensed milk 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.650
 Saint Martin 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.690
 in a cup of the tail 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.070
 this preference to whom I am using is difficult but can even study a 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.670
 little frost cache 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 we always get a taste of air 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.870
 and there now only in the hand 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.870
 very difficult as we talk, study 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
 It's important to study well. 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.350
 so now, after being well mixed, let's not add 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.930
 fruits the 5th more or less messi wanted 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.410
 gilvan raisins knew that it is also a suggestion of the brand 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.850
 there is just mixing 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 So we're going to use the municipality. 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.540
 to caramelize shape 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.980
 placed in the pudding pan we are going to cook in a 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.050
 approximately 50 minutes and then it is important they inform the cold 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.440
 for who really does not want to cut it and it's delicious 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.370
 so now after 45 to 50 minutes according to bath-water we will inform 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.940
 so now here is a dry disease is a great textures a taste 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.420
 delicious said we made with just peach 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.060
 my suggestion was well made because it has fatally been mahseredjian that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.930
 you like it more 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.440
 So, thank you all, merry christmas, for having spent with us all this year. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.479
 all for your family 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.769
