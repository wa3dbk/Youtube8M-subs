00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.340 
field that's a good tip and I'm going to
go

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
go

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.160 
go
so<00:03:25.220> far<00:03:25.730> with<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:27.400> wa2000<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.780> I'm<00:03:29.870> on<00:03:29.990> to<00:03:30.080> my

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
so far with the wa2000 so I'm on to my

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.810 
so far with the wa2000 so I'm on to my
launcher<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.620> it's<00:03:30.920> not<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.190> good<00:03:31.400> idea<00:03:31.520> to<00:03:31.790> be

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
launcher is it's not a good idea to be

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.550 
launcher is it's not a good idea to be
out<00:03:31.940> in<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.150> open<00:03:32.210> out<00:03:32.510> here<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:33.260> I'm<00:03:33.320> trying

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
out in the open out here so I'm trying

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.460 
out in the open out here so I'm trying
to<00:03:33.830> make<00:03:33.980> my<00:03:34.100> way<00:03:34.160> toward<00:03:34.550> this<00:03:34.700> way<00:03:34.760> but<00:03:35.470> I've

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
to make my way toward this way but I've

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.110 
to make my way toward this way but I've
noticed<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:37.010> lot<00:03:37.040> of<00:03:37.250> times<00:03:37.460> the<00:03:37.610> rockets<00:03:38.030> and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
noticed a lot of times the rockets and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.260 
noticed a lot of times the rockets and
easily<00:03:38.630> do<00:03:38.840> not<00:03:39.020> go<00:03:39.200> straight<00:03:39.260> at<00:03:39.830> all<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.430> so

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
easily do not go straight at all and so

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.670 
easily do not go straight at all and so
I<00:03:41.300> kind<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.600> direct<00:03:41.900> impact<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.320> guy<00:03:42.500> I'll

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
I kind of direct impact this guy I'll

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.600 
I kind of direct impact this guy I'll
take<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.840> definitely<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.350> gun<00:03:45.560> is

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
take that and definitely this gun is

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.000 
take that and definitely this gun is
underpowered<00:03:47.020> way<00:03:48.020> underpowered<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.830> mean

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
underpowered way underpowered I mean

knife and I see the guy quickly and I'm

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.180 
knife and I see the guy quickly and I'm
going<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.640> shoot<00:05:13.880> him<00:05:14.060> in<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.300> ass<00:05:15.130> for<00:05:16.130> the

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
going to shoot him in the ass for the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.320 
going to shoot him in the ass for the
game<00:05:16.880> winner<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.510> ass<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:19.280> I<00:05:19.790> believe<00:05:20.210> the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
game winner in the ass so I believe the

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.500 
game winner in the ass so I believe the
final<00:05:20.690> score<00:05:20.750> is<00:05:21.050> 22<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.950> three<00:05:22.430> let's<00:05:23.360> look

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
final score is 22 and three let's look

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.780 
final score is 22 and three let's look
at<00:05:23.660> that<00:05:23.810> kill<00:05:24.020> cam<00:05:24.230> once<00:05:24.470> again<00:05:24.560> so<00:05:25.520> as<00:05:25.640> you

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
at that kill cam once again so as you

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.060 
at that kill cam once again so as you
can<00:05:25.940> see<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.330> pretty<00:05:26.360> much<00:05:26.750> nails<00:05:27.080> them<00:05:27.350> right

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
can see it pretty much nails them right

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.610 
can see it pretty much nails them right
in<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.220> ass<00:05:29.110> let's<00:05:30.110> look<00:05:30.230> at<00:05:30.350> that<00:05:30.440> from

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
in the ass let's look at that from

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.080 
in the ass let's look at that from
another<00:05:30.860> angle
