00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.439 
task is to insert boards in the front of
this<00:00:34.600> assembly<00:00:35.350> like<00:00:35.559> that<00:00:35.800> as<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:37.120> patient

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
this assembly like that as a patient

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.740 
this assembly like that as a patient
with<00:00:37.839> rails<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.409> styles<00:00:38.979> so<00:00:39.970> at<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.330> assembly

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
with rails and styles so at the assembly

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.360 
with rails and styles so at the assembly
level<00:00:41.110> I<00:00:42.839> insert<00:00:43.839> board<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.620> I'm<00:00:47.769> going<00:00:47.799> to<00:00:48.190> do

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
level I insert board and I'm going to do

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.090 
level I insert board and I'm going to do
the<00:00:48.580> left<00:00:49.000> style<00:00:49.809> first<00:00:50.170> so<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:50.830> grain

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
the left style first so the grain

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.549 
the left style first so the grain
direction<00:00:51.519> is<00:00:51.670> going<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.879> be<00:00:51.940> die<00:00:52.150> and<00:00:52.559> styles

are<00:00:53.739> always<00:00:54.159> this<00:00:54.970> orientation<00:00:55.690> because<00:00:56.140> you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
are always this orientation because you

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.649 
are always this orientation because you
want<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.530> be<00:00:56.769> looking<00:00:57.220> at<00:00:57.369> the<00:00:57.549> surface<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.390> the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
want to be looking at the surface of the

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.960 
want to be looking at the surface of the
material<00:00:59.010> so<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.129> height<00:01:00.339> just<00:01:00.760> take<00:01:00.940> a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
material so the height just take a

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.329 
material so the height just take a
guesstimate<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.570> 12<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.290> width<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:02.739> whatever

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
guesstimate of 12 the width is whatever

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.090 
guesstimate of 12 the width is whatever
you<00:01:03.760> make<00:01:04.269> your<00:01:04.510> styles<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.470> your<00:01:05.619> face<00:01:05.830> frames

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
you make your styles of your face frames

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.240 
you make your styles of your face frames
in<00:01:06.280> terms<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.640> size<00:01:06.880> go<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.509> use<00:01:07.799> solid<00:01:08.799> lumber

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
in terms of size go to use solid lumber

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.139 
in terms of size go to use solid lumber

I hunt so I have my left style clone
slide<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.530> over<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.859> the<00:01:45.039> other<00:01:45.249> end<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.600> I've

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
slide it over to the other end and I've

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:51.330 
slide it over to the other end and I've
got<00:01:46.960> my<00:01:47.140> stocks<00:01:47.469> my<00:01:49.079> rail<00:01:50.079> now<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:50.950> grain

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
got my stocks my rail now the grain

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.239 
got my stocks my rail now the grain
direction<00:01:51.369> changes<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:53.229> be<00:01:53.609> top<00:01:54.609> rail

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
direction changes to be top rail

consistent say width will be 30 and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.070 
consistent say width will be 30 and
again<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.579> guesstimate<00:02:07.060> fitting<00:02:07.659> else<00:02:07.810> stays

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
again to guesstimate fitting else stays

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.369 
again to guesstimate fitting else stays
the<00:02:08.289> same<00:02:09.240> so<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.270> know<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.660> back<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:11.049> this<00:02:11.140> has

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
the same so I know the back of this has

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.880 
the same so I know the back of this has
to<00:02:11.530> be<00:02:11.650> 2<00:02:12.810> putting<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.900> way<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:14.739> though

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
to be 2 putting this way and then though

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
to be 2 putting this way and then though
the<00:02:14.920> top<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.549> has<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.909> be<00:02:16.030> 30

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
the top of this has to be 30

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.020 
the top of this has to be 30
I<00:02:16.940> just<00:02:17.450> have<00:02:17.780> gone<00:02:18.050> through<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.530> exercise

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
I just have gone through that exercise

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.020 
I just have gone through that exercise
this<00:02:20.030> time<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.660> left<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.670> 1.5<00:02:23.200> and

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
this time the left of this is 1.5 and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.830 
this time the left of this is 1.5 and
moving<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.240> this<00:02:26.570> way<00:02:27.010> grab<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.840> left

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
moving that this way grab the the left

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.010 
moving that this way grab the the left
value<00:02:30.140> that's<00:02:30.320> 24<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:32.120> right<00:02:32.300> value<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.840> this

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
value that's 24 the right value of this

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.130 
value that's 24 the right value of this
is<00:02:33.320> going<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.920> be<00:02:34.010> 24<00:02:34.460> let<00:02:34.910> me<00:02:35.090> pack<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.050> do

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
is going to be 24 let me pack up and do

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.350 
is going to be 24 let me pack up and do
that<00:02:36.290> again<00:02:36.610> what<00:02:37.610> it's<00:02:37.730> really<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.150> right

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
that again what it's really the right

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.530 
that again what it's really the right
style<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.530> right<00:02:39.770> style<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.610> left<00:02:41.000> edges<00:02:41.390> at

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
style the right style is left edges at

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.700 
style the right style is left edges at
34<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:43.100> this<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.460> done<00:02:43.670> Matt<00:02:44.090> or<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.110> diagonal

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
34 so this is done Matt or the diagonal

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.160 
34 so this is done Matt or the diagonal
as<00:02:45.920> always<00:02:46.490> that's<00:02:47.180> 34<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:50.180> here<00:02:50.720> just<00:02:50.930> real

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
as always that's 34 so here just real

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.900 
as always that's 34 so here just real
quick<00:02:51.440> say<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.390> bottom<00:02:53.390> value<00:02:53.600> there<00:02:53.990> is<00:02:54.320> 3<00:02:54.910> so

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
quick say the bottom value there is 3 so

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.020 
quick say the bottom value there is 3 so
I<00:02:55.940> turn<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.660> into<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.990> clone<00:02:57.440> operation<00:02:58.030> this

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
I turn this into a clone operation this

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.310 
I turn this into a clone operation this
board<00:02:59.360> has<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.050> top<00:03:00.410> value<00:03:01.240> for<00:03:02.240> this<00:03:02.990> board

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
board has a top value for this board

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.460 
board has a top value for this board
should<00:03:03.620> also<00:03:04.190> have<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.580> top-down<00:03:05.120> 4<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.290> they're

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
should also have a top-down 4 so they're

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.040 
should also have a top-down 4 so they're
flush<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.910> way<00:03:09.610> then<00:03:10.610> patch<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.690> up<00:03:11.750> a

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
flush that way then patch this up a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.950 
flush that way then patch this up a
little<00:03:12.170> bit<00:03:12.470> because<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.790> bottom<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.750> is

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
little bit because the bottom of that is

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.210 
little bit because the bottom of that is
3<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:16.280> bottom<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.350> 2<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.560> half<00:03:18.740> so

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
3 the bottom of this is 2 and a half so

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.670 
3 the bottom of this is 2 and a half so
this<00:03:20.180> will<00:03:20.360> be<00:03:20.510> 2.5<00:03:22.030> changing<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> height

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
this will be 2.5 changing the height

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.110 
this will be 2.5 changing the height
this<00:03:24.680> will<00:03:24.890> be<00:03:25.180> 2.5<00:03:27.220> changing<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.310> height<00:03:29.860> 2.0

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
this will be 2.5 changing the height 2.0

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.660 
this will be 2.5 changing the height 2.0
did<00:03:32.120> not<00:03:32.300> key<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.110> decimal<00:03:33.530> properly<00:03:34.070> so

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
did not key in that decimal properly so

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.600 
did not key in that decimal properly so
