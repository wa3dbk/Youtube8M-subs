i kind of got started on the next step
without<00:02:47.760> pressing<00:02:48.180> record<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.930> we're

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
without pressing record so we're

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.900

version of the 224 since the 226 and you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.259 
version of the 224 since the 226 and you
could<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.709> use<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.190> 217<00:02:56.730> or<00:02:56.940> anything
