00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
like if it's any other room we can do

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.590 
like if it's any other room we can do
that<00:01:45.770> start<00:01:46.340> down<00:01:46.460> here<00:01:46.490> at<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.700> bottom<00:01:46.760> I'm

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
that start down here at the bottom I'm

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.850 
that start down here at the bottom I'm
gonna<00:01:47.720> turn<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:48.200> way<00:01:48.260> so<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.680> see

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
gonna turn it this way so you can see

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.470 
gonna turn it this way so you can see
this<00:01:49.280> also<00:01:49.490> comes<00:01:49.820> off<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:50.180> if<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.300> want<00:01:50.450> to

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
this also comes off so if you want to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.540 
this also comes off so if you want to
lay<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.690> flat<00:01:50.840> as<00:01:51.440> part<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.770> your<00:01:51.860> media<00:01:52.190> center

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
lay it flat as part of your media center

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.300 
lay it flat as part of your media center
we<00:01:53.090> can<00:01:53.210> do<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.660> power<00:01:54.170> cord<00:01:54.470> nice<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.190> have

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
we can do that a power cord nice to have

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.530 
we can do that a power cord nice to have
a<00:01:55.340> reset<00:01:55.700> button<00:01:55.730> in<00:01:56.030> case<00:01:56.150> something<00:01:56.450> goes

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
a reset button in case something goes

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.480 
a reset button in case something goes
wrong<00:01:56.740> there<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:57.950> goes<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.280> router

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
wrong there this goes to the router

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.670 
wrong there this goes to the router

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
on your entertainment center you can lay

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.080 
on your entertainment center you can lay
it<00:02:42.080> down<00:02:42.200> flat<00:02:42.380> like<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.860> but<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.850> antenna

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
it down flat like this but the antenna

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.030 
it down flat like this but the antenna
any<00:02:44.239> way<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:44.660> all<00:02:45.620> right<00:02:45.709> now<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
any way you like all right now so you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.360 
any way you like all right now so you
maybe<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.760> don't<00:02:47.300> want<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.540> lay<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.720> flat<00:02:47.840> like

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
maybe you don't want to lay it flat like

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.320 
maybe you don't want to lay it flat like
so<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.430> don't<00:02:49.670> relate<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.880> flat<00:02:50.060> maybe<00:02:50.269> you

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
so you don't relate a flat maybe you

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330 
so you don't relate a flat maybe you
don't<00:02:50.420> want<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.660> put<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:50.930> its<00:02:51.019> base<00:02:51.470> well

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
don't want to put it in its base well

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.160 
don't want to put it in its base well
you<00:02:52.640> got<00:02:52.760> another<00:02:52.910> option<00:02:53.269> here<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.019> can

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
you got another option here you can

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.040 
you got another option here you can
mount<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.530> on<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.680> wall<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:55.610> like<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:56.050> so

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
mount it on the wall just like that so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.290 
mount it on the wall just like that so
just<00:02:57.230> smack<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.800> on<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.890> wall<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
just smack it on the wall and the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.550 
just smack it on the wall and the
antenna<00:02:59.570> needs<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.840> go<00:02:59.930> up<00:03:00.019> there<00:03:00.170> we<00:03:00.260> go<00:03:00.320> that

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
antenna needs to go up there we go that

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.960 
antenna needs to go up there we go that
looks<00:03:00.590> pretty<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:01.489> know<00:03:01.580> what<00:03:01.670> maybe<00:03:01.820> it's

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
looks pretty you know what maybe it's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.110 
looks pretty you know what maybe it's
over<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.239> way<00:03:02.360> it's<00:03:02.510> kind<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.750> cool

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
