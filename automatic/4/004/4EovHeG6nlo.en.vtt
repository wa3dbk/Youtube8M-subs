handspring<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> big<00:00:13.049> deal<00:00:13.380> for

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
handspring now this is a big deal for

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.140 
handspring now this is a big deal for
cheerleading<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> middle<00:00:14.880> school<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
squads require you to have a back

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
squads require you to have a back
handspring<00:00:19.260> before<00:00:19.920> you're<00:00:20.039> even<00:00:20.160> eligible

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
handspring before you're even eligible

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.390 
handspring before you're even eligible
to<00:00:20.880> tryout<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> lot<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.380> people<00:00:22.859> try<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.100> rush

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to tryout so a lot of people try to rush

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.279 
to tryout so a lot of people try to rush
through<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.910> skill<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.480> very<00:00:24.810> important

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
through this skill it's very important

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.509 
through this skill it's very important
that<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> take<00:00:25.680> your<00:00:25.740> time<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.400> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that you take your time and do it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.400 
that you take your time and do it
correctly<00:00:26.750> because<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.869> not<00:00:28.019> safe

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
correctly because it's not safe

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.359 
correctly because it's not safe
otherwise<00:00:28.880> now<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.060> I'm<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.570> is

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
otherwise now what I'm going to do is

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.229 
otherwise now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.669> sit<00:00:33.380> with<00:00:34.380> my<00:00:34.530> chest<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.309> knees

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
I'm going to sit with my chest up knees

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.500 
I'm going to sit with my chest up knees
slightly<00:00:36.690> bent<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.680> I'm<00:00:38.370> leaning<00:00:38.700> backwards

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
slightly bent and I'm leaning backwards

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.530 
slightly bent and I'm leaning backwards
now<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.620> before<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.640> back<00:00:41.790> handspring

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
now just before I do the back handspring

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.979 
now just before I do the back handspring
I'll<00:00:42.930> feel<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.640> moved<00:00:45.090> any<00:00:45.510> farther

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
I'll feel that if I moved any farther

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.590 
I'll feel that if I moved any farther
back<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.559> would<00:00:46.770> fall<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.399> back<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.850> must<00:00:48.210> jump

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
back I would fall on my back I must jump

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
back I would fall on my back I must jump
in<00:00:48.870> order<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.469> keep<00:00:49.680> myself<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.370> falling

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
in order to keep myself from falling

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
in order to keep myself from falling
backwards<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.559> bit<00:00:52.680> tricky<00:00:52.980> your

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
backwards it's a little bit tricky your

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.160 
backwards it's a little bit tricky your
body<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.760> used<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.300> sensation<00:00:55.050> but

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
body will get used to that sensation but

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810 
body will get used to that sensation but
you're<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> sit<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.219> move<00:00:56.489> backwards

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you're going to sit and move backwards

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.490 
you're going to sit and move backwards
and<00:00:57.300> right<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> moment<00:00:57.989> where<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> feel

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and right at the moment where you feel

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.080 
and right at the moment where you feel
like<00:00:58.620> you're<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> fall<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.730> when<00:01:00.000> we

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
like you're going to fall that's when we

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.540 
like you're going to fall that's when we
know<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.329> jump<00:01:00.840> yourself<00:01:00.989> backwards<00:01:01.770> into<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
know to jump yourself backwards into a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.750 
know to jump yourself backwards into a
back<00:01:02.730> handspring<00:01:03.239> position<00:01:03.799> now<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> hit

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
back handspring position now when I hit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.480 
back handspring position now when I hit
my<00:01:05.909> hands<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.930> mat<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:07.890> important

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
my hands on the mat it's very important

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
my hands on the mat it's very important
that<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.909> keep<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.150> arms<00:01:09.659> nice<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.080> straight

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that I keep my arms nice and straight

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
that I keep my arms nice and straight
again<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.580> tumble<00:01:11.939> track<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> great<00:01:12.960> tool<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
again a tumble track is a great tool to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.410 
again a tumble track is a great tool to
teach<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.880> there's<00:01:15.090> less

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
teach this because there's less

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.899 
teach this because there's less
resistance<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.040> less<00:01:17.310> likely<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
resistance and so you're less likely to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.280 
resistance and so you're less likely to
bend<00:01:18.090> your<00:01:18.240> arms<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.659> hit<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.020> head<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
bend your arms and hit your head and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.340 
bend your arms and hit your head and
hurt<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.890> neck<00:01:20.100> or<00:01:20.460> your<00:01:20.640> head<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:22.140> going

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hurt your neck or your head so I'm going
