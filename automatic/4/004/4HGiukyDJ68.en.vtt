are<00:00:34.770> sensitive<00:00:35.399> people<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.910> they're<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.300> as

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
are sensitive people and they're not as

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
are sensitive people and they're not as
cynical<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.040> many<00:00:38.100> places

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
cynical and it's as in so many places

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.340 
cynical and it's as in so many places
and<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:42.180> will<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.719> will<00:00:42.930> find<00:00:43.230> a
