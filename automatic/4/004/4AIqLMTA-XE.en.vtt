00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.060
 now all welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.130
 teach how to make a sketch and to do 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.279
 a sketch and what we need will be 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.829
 the mold bread we have opted 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.379
 for a mold bread without crust but 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.239
 it would be perfectly possible to do it with 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.699
 a bread mold with rind is a bread of 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.739
 integral mold a multi seeds and 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.530
 even with brioche bread also comes out 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.690
 very very very rich and apart a bechamel 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.610
 You can see in our video how we have 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.920
 done how the bÃ©chamel is made 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.540
 we have made a bechamel with a rut 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.610
 120 per liter of cooked ham milk 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.990
 Cooked york ham we have a strip 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.800
 double 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.860
 and that we have here 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.050
 a Gruyere cheese but you could opt 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.600
 for any cheese that founds and gratine 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.939
 all right 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.549
 the process is very simple there are many 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:16.030
 ways to make a sketch and some 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.900
 choose to put here now a tip of 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.149
 butter and then the bechamel and the 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.390
 cheese and ham york us 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.920
 let's go directly to the bechamel 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.619
 ham and cheese because good 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.960
 we think that it has enough 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.090
 Bechamel butter and pretty 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.610
 fat component the cheese as for 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.799
 give him as to give him more good the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.799
 process is very simple let's catch 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.700
 a slice a slice of bread and in it 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.700
 let's put 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.829
 our 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.229
 Bechamel Stable Ame we've made it already 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.870
 we have scented lightly with walnut 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.480
 nutmeg 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.000
 and white pepper and obviously salt 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.220
 It is important that there is not too much 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.399
 thick and not too liquid 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.079
 because it would fall apart 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.019
 we are going to ride two for that 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.420
 we have here the four 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.599
 slices and well we go with the second 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.060
 this part would form the basis of the 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.819
 cro comet and we're just going 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.650
 spreading all over the surface and that 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.290
 Bechamel is as much as possible 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.260
 at this point 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.409
 let's take the slices of ham 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.099
 cooked ham of york also known and 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.099
 we are going to put it 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:50.980
 the bread on the table 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:54.930
 you see simply it does not matter what about 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.190
 and now let's put a part 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.970
 of this cheese 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.970
 with the enzyme 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.550
 and in the other exactly the same 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.670
 now let's go with 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.470
 the other slice that will constitute the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.560
 cover the top of our 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.200
 progress 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.370
 in it we are going to spread the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.260
 bechamel 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.879
 You will see that there are recipes that is 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.650
 of summer is replaced by a sauce 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.110
 mornay or just a bÃ©chamel or the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.090
 that you add egg yolks so that 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.700
 then the gratin is more accentuated 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.630
 Lets put 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.940
 on 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.910
 the other slice and the same thing we're going to 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.190
 do with the second the amount of 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.370
 Bechamel tastes 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.720
 we must not abuse too much what 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.520
 It is important that the bechamel has 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.020
 a good consistency otherwise 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.780
 then to warm it more then we are 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.780
 could come could we come down 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.370
 and about this one 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.850
 cappa let's put some cheese 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.810
 so that it does not gratine with good foundation 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.850
 well you can see here that we have 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.210
 arranged a tray to which we have 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.820
 put a waxed paper and in it 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.450
 let's deposit our two croc 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.450
 monsieur for 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.180
 immediately put them in the oven 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.130
 we are going to put it in the oven 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.190
 200 degree temperature during 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.320
 approximately 15 minutes at home 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.270
 exactly the same if you have a skater 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.320
 then to the final part the last 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.970
 23 minutes 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.200
 you could light that gratin now or 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.590
 the grill so that the surface takes that 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.750
 golden tone so characteristic of the 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.060
 sketch and then nothing we go to 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.310
 oven right now what I was saying and 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.150
 immediately we show you the result that 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.260
 it is on the other hand spectacular 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.900
 Well, just out of the oven 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.340
 we bring the promisers and we are going to 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.389
 present one 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.389
 until it burns 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.810
 let's remove the rest this would be 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.520
 our commercial pro I will show 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.900
 also that it's always interesting 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.610
 what do you see 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.330
 inside 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.330
 how is it 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.180
 it is totally 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.410
 melted the melted cheese and it's a 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.889
 pleasure for lovers of good 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.910
 sandwiches this is a great way to 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.910
 prepare a contest
