look at what I found here's our oil pin
as<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.119> see<00:00:29.359> that's<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.599> insert<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
as you can see that's the insert for the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.940 
as you can see that's the insert for the
drain<00:00:32.189> plug<00:00:32.870> that<00:00:33.870> used<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
drain plug that used to go there so that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.549 
drain plug that used to go there so that
was<00:00:38.250> busted<00:00:38.700> loose<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:40.110> thing<00:00:40.350> was

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
was busted loose and this thing was

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.029 
was busted loose and this thing was
severely<00:00:41.040> leaking<00:00:42.020> here's<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> drain<00:00:43.440> plug

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:54.380 

that's<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> looks<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:53.239> here's<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that's what it looks like here's the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:07.679 
that's what it looks like here's the
bottom<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> oil<00:00:55.050> pan<00:00:58.910> nice

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.510 

so<00:01:08.689> the<00:01:08.930> auto<00:01:09.290> clearancing<00:01:10.040> worked<00:01:10.280> out<00:01:10.490> a

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
so the auto clearancing worked out a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.679 
so the auto clearancing worked out a
little<00:01:10.670> bit<00:01:10.850> better<00:01:11.000> than<00:01:11.299> he<00:01:11.540> anticipated

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
little bit better than he anticipated

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.499 
little bit better than he anticipated
and<00:01:12.460> started<00:01:13.460> leaking<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.850> significant<00:01:14.390> amount

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
and started leaking a significant amount

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.690 
and started leaking a significant amount
of<00:01:14.630> oil<00:01:14.890> so<00:01:15.890> i<00:01:15.920> went<00:01:16.100> ahead<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:16.310> pull<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.520> oil

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
of oil so i went ahead and pull the oil

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.039 
of oil so i went ahead and pull the oil
pan<00:01:17.030> off<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.540> we<00:01:18.409> found<00:01:18.680> something<00:01:19.070> else

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
pan off and we found something else

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.120 
pan off and we found something else

further<00:02:47.349> review<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:48.280> turns<00:02:48.579> out<00:02:48.909> that<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
further review it turns out that the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.119 
further review it turns out that the
gasket<00:02:51.129> is<00:02:51.569> not<00:02:52.569> just<00:02:53.200> all<00:02:53.379> that's<00:02:53.620> going<00:02:53.980> on

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
gasket is not just all that's going on

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.449 
gasket is not just all that's going on
here<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.579> actually<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> stamp<00:02:55.540> issue<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:57.370> if

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
here it actually is a stamp issue so if

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.059

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:54.670 
purr you got there well I'm sure you
heard<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.549> horrible<00:03:40.120> noise<00:03:45.659> nice

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.740 

there's<00:03:55.680> all<00:03:55.799> machines<00:03:56.220> let's<00:03:57.209> get<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.599> in

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
there's all machines let's get that in

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:06.619 
there's all machines let's get that in
the<00:03:57.840> office<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:05.670> know<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.819> did<00:04:06.090> make<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.299> mess<00:04:06.599> of

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
the office you know I did make a mess of

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:16.129 
the office you know I did make a mess of
the<00:04:06.870> bottom<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.670> hey<00:04:14.720> at<00:04:15.720> least<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.019> know

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
the bottom of it hey at least I know

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.319 
the bottom of it hey at least I know
they're<00:04:16.260> not<00:04:16.410> very<00:04:16.620> shiny<00:04:16.949> parts<00:04:17.370> right<00:04:17.880> yeah

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
they're not very shiny parts right yeah

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:26.420 
they're not very shiny parts right yeah
they're<00:04:18.540> not<00:04:18.630> burying<00:04:19.049> pieces<00:04:24.979> and<00:04:25.979> then<00:04:26.130> this

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
they're not burying pieces and then this

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.890 
they're not burying pieces and then this
is<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.639> roll<00:04:26.940> off<00:04:27.060> your<00:04:27.090> wheel<00:04:27.419> that<00:04:27.600> touched

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
is the roll off your wheel that touched

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.520 
is the roll off your wheel that touched
it<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:29.610> crankshaft<00:04:30.570> trigger<00:04:30.900> wheel<00:04:31.199> on<00:04:31.470> a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
it and the crankshaft trigger wheel on a

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.790 
it and the crankshaft trigger wheel on a
vr6<00:04:32.039> is<00:04:32.699> right<00:04:33.210> here<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:34.199> reluctor<00:04:34.620> wheel

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
vr6 is right here the reluctor wheel

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.500 
vr6 is right here the reluctor wheel
it's<00:04:35.039> like<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.760> 60<00:04:36.270> minus<00:04:36.479> 1<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.680> wheel<00:04:38.100> and

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
it's like a 60 minus 1 to the wheel and

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.879 
it's like a 60 minus 1 to the wheel and
when<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.539> bolted<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.199> new<00:04:40.380> oil<00:04:40.620> pan<00:04:41.010> up<00:04:41.660> it

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
when I bolted the new oil pan up it

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.430 
when I bolted the new oil pan up it
pushed<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.070> wheel<00:04:44.900> reluctor<00:04:45.900> wheel<00:04:46.080> into

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
pushed the wheel reluctor wheel into

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.770 
pushed the wheel reluctor wheel into
here<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.160> then<00:04:47.880> when<00:04:48.030> we<00:04:48.120> started<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.630> engine

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
here and then when we started the engine

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.890 
here and then when we started the engine
it<00:04:49.229> started<00:04:49.770> eating<00:04:50.160> away<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.789> little<00:04:51.630> notch

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
it started eating away a little notch

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.330 
it started eating away a little notch
out<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.010> hump<00:04:53.310> here<00:04:53.550> in<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:53.729> oil<00:04:53.910> pan<00:04:54.240> and

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
out of this hump here in the oil pan and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.980 
out of this hump here in the oil pan and
no<00:04:56.340> we<00:04:56.550> didn't<00:04:56.760> put<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.000> gasket<00:04:57.450> back<00:04:57.630> in<00:04:57.870> it

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
no we didn't put the gasket back in it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.860 
no we didn't put the gasket back in it
he<00:04:58.110> decided<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.650> use<00:04:58.950> pivot<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.720> run<00:05:00.720> without

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
he decided to use pivot and run without

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.390 
he decided to use pivot and run without
a<00:05:01.050> gasket<00:05:01.590> which<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:02.130> know<00:05:02.250> isn't

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
a gasket which you know isn't

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.750 
a gasket which you know isn't
necessarily<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.120> bad<00:05:03.210> idea<00:05:03.599> and<00:05:04.490> we<00:05:05.490> did

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
necessarily a bad idea and we did

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.089 
necessarily a bad idea and we did
measure<00:05:06.360> after<00:05:06.810> i<00:05:06.990> took<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.380> oil<00:05:07.530> pan<00:05:07.830> back

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
measure after i took the oil pan back

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.589 
measure after i took the oil pan back
off<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:09.720> depth<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.710> notch<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.599> the

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
off and the depth of the notch and the

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.839 
off and the depth of the notch and the
reluctor<00:05:12.990> wheel<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.380> everything<00:05:13.470> else<00:05:14.010> was

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
reluctor wheel and everything else was

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.540 
reluctor wheel and everything else was
more<00:05:15.440> actually<00:05:16.440> more<00:05:16.680> than<00:05:16.710> twice<00:05:17.130> as<00:05:17.400> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
more actually more than twice as the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.659 
more actually more than twice as the
amount<00:05:17.849> of<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.570> thickness<00:05:18.930> of<00:05:19.080> this<00:05:19.229> gasket

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
amount of the thickness of this gasket

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.610 
amount of the thickness of this gasket
so<00:05:20.669> even<00:05:20.970> with<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.300> gasket<00:05:21.780> on<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.020> new<00:05:22.349> oil

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
so even with the gasket on the new oil

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.760 
so even with the gasket on the new oil
pan<00:05:22.950> it<00:05:23.729> probably<00:05:24.270> would<00:05:24.660> have<00:05:24.690> had<00:05:25.650> the

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
pan it probably would have had the

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.400 
pan it probably would have had the
reluctor<00:05:26.430> wheel<00:05:26.580> hit<00:05:26.940> anyway<00:05:27.479> and<00:05:27.780> make<00:05:28.380> a

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
reluctor wheel hit anyway and make a

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.219 
reluctor wheel hit anyway and make a
noise<00:05:28.940> albeit<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.240> noise<00:05:30.450> probably<00:05:31.050> would

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
noise albeit the noise probably would

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.409 
noise albeit the noise probably would
have<00:05:31.349> been<00:05:31.639> quieter<00:05:32.639> and<00:05:32.849> a<00:05:33.060> little<00:05:33.300> more

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
have been quieter and a little more

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.990 
have been quieter and a little more
intermittent<00:05:33.900> sounding<00:05:34.669> which<00:05:35.669> probably

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
intermittent sounding which probably

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.920 
intermittent sounding which probably
would<00:05:36.300> have<00:05:36.389> made<00:05:36.570> it<00:05:36.660> harder<00:05:36.900> to

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
would have made it harder to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.250 
would have made it harder to
troubleshoot<00:05:37.530> it<00:05:38.130> was<00:05:38.280> actually<00:05:38.700> pretty<00:05:38.729> easy

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
troubleshoot it was actually pretty easy

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.379 
troubleshoot it was actually pretty easy
to<00:05:40.260> figure<00:05:40.680> out<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:41.550> issue<00:05:41.729> straight<00:05:42.150> away

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
to figure out the issue straight away

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.110 
to figure out the issue straight away
because<00:05:42.630> I<00:05:42.810> could<00:05:43.110> see<00:05:43.380> on<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:44.370> oil<00:05:44.400> pan<00:05:44.880> where

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
because I could see on the oil pan where

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.820 
because I could see on the oil pan where
the<00:05:45.210> notch<00:05:45.450> was<00:05:45.720> being<00:05:45.990> eaten<00:05:46.200> through<00:05:46.620> by<00:05:46.770> the

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
the notch was being eaten through by the

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.490 
the notch was being eaten through by the
motor<00:05:47.210> so<00:05:48.210> we<00:05:48.330> had<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.510> take<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:48.810> oil<00:05:48.840> pan<00:05:49.260> back

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
motor so we had to take the oil pan back

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.129 
motor so we had to take the oil pan back
off<00:05:49.770> i<00:05:50.130> heated<00:05:50.849> this<00:05:51.150> up<00:05:51.330> until<00:05:51.660> it<00:05:51.750> was<00:05:51.840> cherry

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
off i heated this up until it was cherry

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.500 
off i heated this up until it was cherry
smashed<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:52.949> out<00:05:53.070> with<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.310> hammer<00:05:53.550> put<00:05:54.389> it

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
smashed it out with the hammer put it

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.089 
smashed it out with the hammer put it
back<00:05:54.599> together<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:55.139> it<00:05:55.560> was<00:05:55.680> good<00:05:55.860> to<00:05:55.979> go

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
back together and it was good to go

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:11.439 
back together and it was good to go
after<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:58.190> alright<00:05:59.190> hopefully

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.449 

cool
