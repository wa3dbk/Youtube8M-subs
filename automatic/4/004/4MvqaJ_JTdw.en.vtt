00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
all right guys here we have the micro a

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.730 
all right guys here we have the micro a
10<00:00:03.149> I<00:00:03.389> got<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.319> from<00:00:04.529> hobbyking<00:00:04.970> as<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.029> fifth

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
10 I got this from hobbyking as a fifth

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.009 
10 I got this from hobbyking as a fifth
556<00:00:07.740> millimeter<00:00:08.370> wingspan<00:00:09.059> I'd<00:00:09.750> have<00:00:09.900> to

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
556 millimeter wingspan I'd have to

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.509 
556 millimeter wingspan I'd have to
convert<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> inches<00:00:10.980> maybe<00:00:11.190> I'll<00:00:11.340> put<00:00:11.429> an

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
convert that to inches maybe I'll put an

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.520 
convert that to inches maybe I'll put an
annotation<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.809> as<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.080> see<00:00:13.320> this

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
annotation and but as you can see this

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.799 
annotation and but as you can see this
is<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.740> wingspan<00:00:14.340> over<00:00:14.639> here<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.599> not<00:00:15.750> that

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is the wingspan over here it's not that

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.570 
is the wingspan over here it's not that
large<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.920> micro<00:00:17.369> little<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.210> 10<00:00:19.400> you<00:00:20.400> got

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
large it's a micro little a 10 you got

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.769 
large it's a micro little a 10 you got
your<00:00:20.850> main<00:00:21.270> wing<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:21.660> has<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.050> L'Orange<00:00:23.779> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
your main wing which has a L'Orange and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.109 
your main wing which has a L'Orange and
then<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.529> your<00:00:25.560> rudder<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.220> mean<00:00:27.000> your

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
then you have your rudder I mean your

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.439 
then you have your rudder I mean your
elevator<00:00:27.769> you<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.460> rudder<00:00:29.849> you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
elevator you do not have rudder you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
elevator you do not have rudder you
could<00:00:30.599> probably<00:00:30.840> add<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.710> wanted

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
could probably add it on if you wanted

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.630 
could probably add it on if you wanted
but<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.820> rudder<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.570> stationary<00:00:34.489> in<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
but the rudder is just stationary in the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
but the rudder is just stationary in the
box<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.270> instruction<00:00:37.110> manual<00:00:37.500> here

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
box to get your instruction manual here

box to get your instruction manual here
just<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.730> all<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.750> sheet<00:00:40.110> but

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
just that's all it is just one sheet but

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.139 
just that's all it is just one sheet but
it<00:00:40.920> looks<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.160> it'll<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.430> real<00:00:41.640> simple<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it looks like it'll be real simple to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.139 
it looks like it'll be real simple to
build<00:00:42.950> for<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> power<00:00:44.190> system<00:00:44.520> i<00:00:44.730> got<00:00:44.910> two

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
motors in there and they don't have a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
motors in there and they don't have a
connector<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.480> got<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> solder<00:01:03.960> them<00:01:04.170> on

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350

and<00:01:04.670> I've<00:01:05.670> got<00:01:07.130> two<00:01:08.130> hobbyking<00:01:09.119> redbrick<00:01:09.659> 10m

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and I've got two hobbyking redbrick 10m

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.560 
and I've got two hobbyking redbrick 10m
pscs<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.790> i'll<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.970> using<00:01:12.150> them<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.560> then<00:01:17.570> need

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
pscs so i'll be using them and then need

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
pscs so i'll be using them and then need
a<00:01:18.600> couple<00:01:18.869> servos<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.799> need<00:01:19.950> two<00:01:20.130> servos

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
a couple servos you just need two servos

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.359 
a couple servos you just need two servos
it<00:01:20.790> says<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.210> i<00:01:21.240> got<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.799> service<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.009> i<00:01:23.130> had<00:01:23.340> in

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it says so i got a service that i had in

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
it says so i got a service that i had in
some<00:01:23.610> other<00:01:23.670> plane<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.270> rip<00:01:24.600> them<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.020> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
some other plane and rip them out as you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
some other plane and rip them out as you
can<00:01:25.200> see<00:01:25.350> they<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.500> some<00:01:25.710> foam<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.159> them<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
can see they got some foam on them it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.190 
can see they got some foam on them it
says<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.090> need<00:01:27.240> two<00:01:27.390> point<00:01:27.659> five<00:01:27.869> grams

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
says you need two point five grams

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.080 
says you need two point five grams
servos<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:30.000> around<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.390> size

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
servos so this is right around that size

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.230 
servos so this is right around that size
and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:34.009> comes<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.130> its<00:01:35.280> push<00:01:35.520> rods<00:01:35.790> all

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and then comes with its push rods all

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
and then comes with its push rods all
this<00:01:36.450> electronics<00:01:37.110> i<00:01:37.229> bought<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.650> plane<00:01:37.860> just

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
this electronics i bought the plane just

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
this electronics i bought the plane just
came<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> foam<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> push<00:01:39.210> rods<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
came with the foam and the push rods and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.550 
came with the foam and the push rods and
the<00:01:40.500> wheelset<00:01:40.710> i<00:01:42.020> think<00:01:43.020> i<00:01:43.079> said<00:01:43.259> i<00:01:43.290> got<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the wheelset i think i said i got the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.850 
the wheelset i think i said i got the
orange<00:01:43.710> RC<00:01:44.270> expect<00:01:45.270> orange<00:01:45.869> fake<00:01:46.320> spektrum

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
orange RC expect orange fake spektrum

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
orange RC expect orange fake spektrum
receiver<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.240> four<00:01:48.930> channel

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
receiver there it's just a four channel

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.109 
receiver there it's just a four channel
and<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.280> some<00:01:50.430> glue<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:50.880> i<00:01:50.909> want<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and then you get some glue but i want to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.870 
and then you get some glue but i want to
be<00:01:51.240> using<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.750> 15<00:01:52.290> minute<00:01:52.470> epoxy<00:01:52.799> pretty<00:01:53.670> sure<00:01:53.850> i

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
be using a 15 minute epoxy pretty sure i

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.240 
be using a 15 minute epoxy pretty sure i
can't<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.020> should<00:01:55.290> maybe<00:01:55.860> melt

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
can't you see a that should maybe melt

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.010 
can't you see a that should maybe melt
the<00:01:56.549> foam<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.360> i'm<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.659> using<00:01:57.689> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the foam so i'm going to be using this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.520 
the foam so i'm going to be using this
15<00:01:58.649> minute<00:01:58.890> epoxy<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.930> i'll<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.110> using<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
15 minute epoxy and then i'll be using a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.679 
15 minute epoxy and then i'll be using a
four<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.189> five<00:02:02.430> hundred<00:02:02.610> milliamp<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.420> cell

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
four to five hundred milliamp to cell

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
video for probably a couple weeks I was

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.710 
video for probably a couple weeks I was
testing<00:02:23.549> out<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.849> motors<00:02:24.209> which<00:02:24.450> worked

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
testing out the motors which worked

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.220 
testing out the motors which worked
great<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:26.250> first<00:02:26.489> motor<00:02:26.819> i<00:02:26.970> tested<00:02:27.659> i<00:02:27.840> had

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
great but the first motor i tested i had

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.300 
great but the first motor i tested i had
a<00:02:28.260> small<00:02:29.239> 370<00:02:30.239> milliamp<00:02:30.780> 3-cell<00:02:31.560> battery<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
a small 370 milliamp 3-cell battery it

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.280 
a small 370 milliamp 3-cell battery it
was<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.640> small<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.150> tiny<00:02:33.299> i<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:33.930> i<00:02:34.110> just

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
was so small and tiny i was just i just

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.170 
was so small and tiny i was just i just
thought<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.620> was<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.860> TESOL<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> didn't<00:02:35.579> check<00:02:35.909> I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
thought it was a TESOL I didn't check I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.449 
thought it was a TESOL I didn't check I
was<00:02:36.599> too<00:02:36.720> quick<00:02:36.750> about<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:38.040> burned<00:02:38.310> out

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
was too quick about it and I burned out

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.610 
was too quick about it and I burned out
one<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.879> motors<00:02:39.209> by<00:02:39.480> running<00:02:40.379> out<00:02:40.590> of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
one of the motors by running out of

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.399 
one of the motors by running out of
three<00:02:40.890> song<00:02:41.129> for<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> few<00:02:41.610> seconds<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.239> some<00:02:43.019> of

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
three song for a few seconds to some of

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.960 
three song for a few seconds to some of
the<00:02:43.560> other<00:02:43.590> motor<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.129> has<00:02:44.159> two<00:02:44.430> works<00:02:44.640> great

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the other motor it has two works great

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.490 
the other motor it has two works great
feel<00:02:45.329> like<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.510> has<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.720> lot<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> power<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
feel like it has a lot of power the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.720 
feel like it has a lot of power the
eighth<00:02:46.620> time<00:02:46.799> in<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:47.129> air<00:02:47.220> where<00:02:47.489> two<00:02:47.700> of

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
eighth time in the air where two of

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.720 
eighth time in the air where two of
those<00:02:47.970> should<00:02:48.239> be<00:02:48.269> great<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:49.709> look<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.609> in

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
those should be great so look it up in

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.979 
those should be great so look it up in
there<00:02:50.849> for<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.090> guys<00:02:51.209> soon<00:02:51.480> how<00:02:51.810> many

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
building it but it's going to be about

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.699 
building it but it's going to be about
two<00:02:53.940> weeks<00:02:54.120> probably<00:02:54.510> because<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.260> motor<00:02:55.590> i

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
two weeks probably because I the motor i

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.509 
two weeks probably because I the motor i
reordered<00:02:56.280> coming<00:02:57.209> from<00:02:57.359> China<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.409> just<00:02:59.370> a
