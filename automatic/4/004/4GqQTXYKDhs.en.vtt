gonna<00:04:16.699> go<00:04:16.849> I<00:04:16.880> think<00:04:17.030> well<00:04:17.959> obvi<00:04:18.410> spin<00:04:18.650> should

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
gonna go I think well obvi spin should

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.719 
gonna go I think well obvi spin should
be<00:04:18.949> pokemon<00:04:19.250> stadium<00:04:19.430> right<00:04:19.789> ah<00:04:21.370> squawks<00:04:22.370> eh<00:04:22.699> I

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
be pokemon stadium right ah squawks eh I

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.520 
be pokemon stadium right ah squawks eh I
think<00:04:22.970> Fox<00:04:23.180> need<00:04:23.599> some<00:04:23.750> little<00:04:23.990> room<00:04:24.199> so<00:04:24.500> I

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
think Fox need some little room so I

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.390 
think Fox need some little room so I
think<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.830> got<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:24.979> does<00:04:25.159> pretty<00:04:25.280> well

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
think you got it does pretty well

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.270 
think you got it does pretty well
against<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:26.720> seems<00:04:26.930> like<00:04:27.169> think<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:27.949> some<00:04:28.070> rely

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
against it seems like think of some rely

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.370
