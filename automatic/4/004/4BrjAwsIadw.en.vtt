actually<00:00:06.000> more<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.750> tutorial<00:00:07.460> I've<00:00:08.460> been<00:00:08.610> an

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
actually more of a tutorial I've been an

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.540 
actually more of a tutorial I've been an
experience<00:00:09.150> or<00:00:10.070> experiencing<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.250> mean

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
experience or experiencing I mean

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.459 
experience or experiencing I mean
experimenting<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.389> different<00:00:12.750> ways<00:00:13.170> to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
experimenting with different ways to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.390 
experimenting with different ways to
mine<00:00:13.679> effectively<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.410> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:16.859> most

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
mine effectively and this is my most

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.750 
mine effectively and this is my most
efficient<00:00:18.119> way<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.900> my<00:00:19.350> next<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.740> pona<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.460> what

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
efficient way to my next I pona so what

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.230 
efficient way to my next I pona so what
you<00:00:20.910> do<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.630> dig<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.680> tunnel<00:00:23.250> straight

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you do is you just dig a tunnel straight

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.839 
you do is you just dig a tunnel straight
down<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> bottom<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.460> after<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.609> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
down to the bottom and after and you

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.310 
down to the bottom and after and you
place<00:00:27.119> torches<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.769> everyone<00:00:30.320> one

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
place torches what is it everyone one

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.740 
place torches what is it everyone one
two<00:00:32.219> three<00:00:33.030> four<00:00:33.600> five<00:00:33.989> blocks<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.750> then

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
two three four five blocks up and then

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.160 
two three four five blocks up and then
what<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.790> go<00:00:39.239> after<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> mind

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
what you do is I you go after you mind

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.360 
what you do is I you go after you mind
all<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> weight<00:00:40.559> bottom<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.219> your

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
all the weight bottom and get your

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.940 
all the weight bottom and get your
torches<00:00:41.940> placed<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.899> place<00:00:43.170> glass<00:00:43.590> head

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
torches placed you place glass head

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.940 
torches placed you place glass head
every<00:00:44.280> level<00:00:44.579> right<00:00:44.850> above<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> torches<00:00:45.950> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
every level right above the torches and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.430 
every level right above the torches and
then<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.250> allows<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.539> make

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
then what that allows you to do is make

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.090 
then what that allows you to do is make
different<00:00:50.070> levels<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:51.710> mining<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> have

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
different levels of mining so you have

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
different levels of mining so you have
to<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.340> these<00:00:53.489> sub<00:00:53.789> levels<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.020> tell

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
to all these sub levels as you can tell

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.619 
to all these sub levels as you can tell
i<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.590> bunch<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.190> haven't<00:00:57.180> counted<00:00:57.360> them

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
i have a bunch a haven't counted them

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.080 
i have a bunch a haven't counted them
yet<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.859> really<00:00:59.010> cool<00:00:59.280> because<00:00:59.520> once

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
yet but this is really cool because once

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
yet but this is really cool because once
you<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.750> sub<00:01:00.989> levels<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.469> mine<00:01:01.770> in

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you get these sub levels you can mine in

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.340 
you get these sub levels you can mine in
any<00:01:02.160> direction<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.000> you're<00:01:03.629> sure<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.170> not

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
any direction and you're sure to not

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
any direction and you're sure to not
miss<00:01:04.710> any<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.030> resources<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.020> would

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
miss any of the resources that you would

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.830 
miss any of the resources that you would

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
get them so here let me start mining

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.550 
get them so here let me start mining
over<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.720> I'll<00:01:36.869> show<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.079> how<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> do

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you can tell let's just say think it's a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.420 
you can tell let's just say think it's a
four<00:01:45.509> by<00:01:45.659> four<00:01:46.310> yep<00:01:47.310> no<00:01:47.759> fight<00:01:48.119> before<00:01:49.430> yeah

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
four by four yep no fight before yeah

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.520 
four by four yep no fight before yeah
it's<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> five<00:01:50.939> by<00:01:51.210> Fourier<00:01:51.689> than<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> mining

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it's a five by Fourier than a mining

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.359 
it's a five by Fourier than a mining
right<00:01:52.770> now<00:01:52.950> Oh<00:01:54.530> more<00:01:55.530> gold<00:01:55.860> than<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.189> thought

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
right now Oh more gold than I thought

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.580 
right now Oh more gold than I thought
there<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.570> yeah<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.350> five

there was but yeah I think it's a five

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.020 
there was but yeah I think it's a five
by<00:01:58.770> four<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.340> two<00:01:59.610> three<00:01:59.810> four<00:02:01.310> five<00:02:02.310> yeah<00:02:02.549> so

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
by four one two three four five yeah so

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.750 
torch on that second block two blocks in
so<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.990> that's<00:04:23.770> where<00:04:24.040> you<00:04:24.130> get<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.310> only

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
so that that's where you get the only

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.510 
so that that's where you get the only
the<00:04:25.510> two<00:04:25.690> part<00:04:26.050> right<00:04:26.200> away

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
the two part right away

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.180 
the two part right away
then<00:04:26.610> after<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.030> it's<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.449> block<00:04:27.870> in

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
then after that it's just a block in

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.089 
then after that it's just a block in
it's<00:04:29.190> pretty<00:04:30.090> simple<00:04:30.389> i<00:04:30.660> mean<00:04:30.870> like<00:04:31.740> i<00:04:31.860> said<00:04:32.069> i

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
it's pretty simple i mean like i said i

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.020 
it's pretty simple i mean like i said i
was<00:04:32.310> experimenting<00:04:32.789> with<00:04:33.449> different<00:04:34.259> ways<00:04:34.889> to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
was experimenting with different ways to

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.779 
was experimenting with different ways to
mine<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:37.190> efficiently<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.639> is

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
mine and efficiently and this is

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.939 
mine and efficiently and this is
actually<00:04:39.150> really<00:04:39.360> efficient<00:04:40.259> i<00:04:40.379> am<00:04:40.500> surprised

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
actually really efficient i am surprised

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.999 
actually really efficient i am surprised
how<00:04:41.220> efficient<00:04:41.759> this<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.800> like<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:43.949> said

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
how efficient this is and like I said

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.640 
how efficient this is and like I said
you're<00:04:44.490> at<00:04:44.610> every<00:04:44.909> level<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.659> regardless<00:04:46.319> of

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
you're at every level so regardless of

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.140 
you're at every level so regardless of
where<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.860> are<00:04:47.099> at<00:04:47.280> you're<00:04:47.610> always<00:04:47.909> going<00:04:48.090> to

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
where you are at you're always going to

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.230 
where you are at you're always going to
find<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.509> now<00:04:49.169> what<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:49.860> do<00:04:50.009> next<00:04:50.280> is<00:04:50.789> you

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
find and now what you do next is you

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.029 
find and now what you do next is you
just<00:04:51.449> come<00:04:51.629> in<00:04:51.780> from<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.139> angle<00:04:52.669> like<00:04:53.669> so<00:04:53.970> and

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
just come in from this angle like so and

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.580 
just come in from this angle like so and
there<00:04:56.039> you<00:04:56.190> popped<00:04:56.460> out<00:04:56.930> like<00:04:57.930> yeah<00:04:58.169> look<00:04:58.440> out

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
there you popped out like yeah look out

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.890 
there you popped out like yeah look out
we're<00:04:58.800> connected<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.460> anyways<00:05:00.000> I'm<00:05:00.270> not

now I'm on the next sub level and say I
was<00:05:40.440> digging<00:05:40.650> over<00:05:40.919> here<00:05:41.250> broke<00:05:42.029> montage<00:05:42.389> but

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
was digging over here broke montage but

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.890 
was digging over here broke montage but
say<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.740> wasn't<00:05:44.039> torch<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.610> mean<00:05:44.789> hey<00:05:45.270> guys<00:05:45.479> so
