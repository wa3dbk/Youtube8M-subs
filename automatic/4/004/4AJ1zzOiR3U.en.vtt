 these days by your side they taught me that in 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.040

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:46.440
 when there is time determined for 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:50.570
 begin to love I feel something so deep 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.570
 that has no explanation 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.830

 but I started to need you I beg 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.659
 for this song 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.790
 what we use are the chords of 2 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.790
 for more 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.720
 re minor 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.290
 my minor 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.290
 Sun 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.100
 that's for the stanzas good 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 strum 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.630
 we can do something simple for him 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 according to the rhythm of the music be 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.990
 imagine and next to the campfire you can 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.290
 touch it with the inspiration you have in 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.120
 that moment so good the pace that 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.120
 we put x good night 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.190
 Goodnight 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.060
 and then first the receiving begins 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.060
 Goodnight 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.320
 this is a basic ballad story if you 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.110
 you're just learning to touch the 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.280
 guitar and you want to play ballads is the 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.280
 strum you have to know 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.080
 down with all the fingers you go up with 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.080
 the thumb 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.410
 you pay with your fingers putting tearing 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.950
 with your fingers and putting your palm on 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.950
 the guitar 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.500
 with the index finger up 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.500
 again 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.760
 and again down 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 if the sequence goes and then 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.630
 that is a rhythm that I advise you is the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.990
 most used in ballads 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.680
 and the notes because you can take them out 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.709
 the rope dot net 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.640
 the chords I will not leave it a link in 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.580
 the description so you can go there 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.860
 then this song has that rip 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.610
 basically do not remember that torn 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.610
 when 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.440
 to 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.440
 yes 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.720
 and that's basically everything to talk about 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.109
 without touching me something inside went on 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.560
 there we go to mino 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.700
 and me 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.700
 and then again king 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.539
 it was getting late and I forgot the clock 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.539
 there is change only 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.629
 these days served by your side I 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.629
 they taught that they will come 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.080
 no set time to start 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.139
 sea ​​again fa 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.090
 I feel something less' so deep that 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:55.090
 my minor has no explanation 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.260
 the reason and logical re minor 'in my 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:03.270
 heart and alone 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:06.200
 for the choir between my life 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.200
 in the zone 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.180
 what I do in strumming is there not 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.260
 use be turned off but simply 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.090
 between the ibi 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.090
 I open the light 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.380
 again 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.509
 up down down up 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.070
 in the chorus the notes are 2 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:07.680
 the less than in your arms for nights 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:12.940
 deserted only between my life 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:17.090
 I beg you the least 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:21.139
 tecomense for missing that change is 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.680
 fast re minor 'and then I tecomense 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:30.400
 to miss 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:32.420
 but I started needing tea later 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.000
 so 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.090
 if you are just learning a good 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.949
 advice is that 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.780
 I always tried to feel the music and the 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.630
 rhythm of the song that you are 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.540
 listening that you want to get it out as you 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.169
 I say I 'm not there with your friends the 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.940
 campfire maybe some saliva that you have 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.850
 maybe if you want to dedicate it to your girlfriend 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.220
 to your hesitation you are nothing you can 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.740
 say then feeling the music for 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.620
 that is that in this final in this final 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.770
 we make that change that I started with 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:13.379
 miss 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.379
 but I started to need 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.160
 it looks better 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:25.520
 that part who the strum would be if you 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.520
 start by missing but I started 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.520
 need 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.610
 I tell you 

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:41.429
