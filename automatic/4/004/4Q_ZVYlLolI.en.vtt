come you'll see me laying outside the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.219 
come you'll see me laying outside the
sled<00:01:39.700> unconscious<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.630> then<00:01:40.899> this<00:01:41.049> little

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
sled unconscious and then this little

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.770 
sled unconscious and then this little
rolls<00:01:41.500> over<00:01:41.740> on<00:01:42.009> top<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.250> me<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.729> then<00:01:43.570> it's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
rolls over on top of me and then it's

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.649 
rolls over on top of me and then it's
like<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.549> head<00:01:45.729> but<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.060> actually<00:01:46.270> knocked

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
like on the head but it actually knocked

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.109 
like on the head but it actually knocked
you<00:01:46.840> unconscious<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.520> initial<00:01:48.850> hit

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
you unconscious the the initial hit

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.810 
you unconscious the the initial hit
against<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.479> wall<00:01:49.750> I'm<00:01:50.170> doing<00:01:50.350> 135<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.429> so<00:01:51.610> my

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
against the wall I'm doing 135 and so my

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.060 
against the wall I'm doing 135 and so my
head<00:01:52.030> had<00:01:52.149> snapped<00:01:52.450> back<00:01:52.689> and<00:01:53.409> had<00:01:53.649> knocked<00:01:53.890> me

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
head had snapped back and had knocked me

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.399 
head had snapped back and had knocked me
unconscious<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.729> then<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:55.090> was<00:01:55.330> being<00:01:56.140> pulled

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
unconscious to then I was being pulled

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.300 
unconscious to then I was being pulled
out<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.100> led<00:01:57.340> as<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:58.420> sled<00:01:59.020> moved<00:01:59.979> on<00:02:00.159> the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
out of this led as the sled moved on the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.190 
out of this led as the sled moved on the
long<00:02:00.460> straightaway<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.420> finish<00:02:01.780> corner

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
long straightaway in that finish corner

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.440 
long straightaway in that finish corner
this<00:02:02.380> last<00:02:02.679> corner<00:02:03.039> here<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.460> about<00:02:04.000> thirty

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
this last corner here is about thirty

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.499 
this last corner here is about thirty
feet<00:02:04.929> high<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.520> sled<00:02:06.759> move<00:02:07.030> out<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
feet high and the sled move out to the

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.389 
feet high and the sled move out to the
lip<00:02:07.690> there<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.140> then<00:02:08.319> that's<00:02:08.799> literally<00:02:09.160> was

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
lip there and then that's literally was

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.820 
lip there and then that's literally was
trying<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.729> climb<00:02:09.940> whatever<00:02:10.530> yeah<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.560> was

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
trying to climb whatever yeah I was

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.110 
trying to climb whatever yeah I was
actually<00:02:11.950> tearing<00:02:12.459> out<00:02:12.549> a<00:02:12.580> portion<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
actually tearing out a portion of the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.670 
actually tearing out a portion of the
lip<00:02:13.299> back<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.720> those<00:02:13.870> days<00:02:14.080> that's<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.410> natural

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
lip back in those days that's a natural

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.300 
lip back in those days that's a natural
track<00:02:15.340> built<00:02:16.180> straight<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> mountainside

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
track built straight in the mountainside

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.740 
track built straight in the mountainside
and<00:02:18.310> at<00:02:18.549> that<00:02:18.670> time<00:02:18.940> they<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.239> put<00:02:19.420> two<00:02:19.630> by

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
and at that time they just put two by

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.580 
and at that time they just put two by
sixes

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
sixes

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.309 
sixes
to<00:02:20.860> keep<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.220> sled<00:02:21.489> inside<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.330> track<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.110> so

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
to keep the sled inside the track and so

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.509 
to keep the sled inside the track and so
as<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:24.130> result<00:02:25.349> what<00:02:26.349> do<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.500> prefer<00:02:26.650> natural

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
as a result what do you prefer natural

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.280 
as a result what do you prefer natural
track<00:02:27.790> heard<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.330> many<00:02:28.660> times<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.110> natural

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
track heard the many times the natural

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.440 
track heard the many times the natural
tracks<00:02:29.799> were<00:02:30.010> very<00:02:30.310> fast<00:02:30.640> yeah<00:02:31.120> there's<00:02:31.420> only

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
tracks were very fast yeah there's only

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.089 
tracks were very fast yeah there's only
one<00:02:31.690> left<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.319> world<00:02:32.380> that's<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:32.890> st.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
one left in the world that's in st.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.640 
one left in the world that's in st.
Moritz<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.760> they're<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.870> sled<00:02:35.080> goes<00:02:35.319> about

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
Moritz and they're the sled goes about

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.099 
Moritz and they're the sled goes about
148<00:02:36.720> kilometers<00:02:37.720> an<00:02:37.840> hour

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
148 kilometers an hour

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.020 
148 kilometers an hour
so<00:02:38.470> half<00:02:38.650> faster<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.100> thing<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.670> was<00:02:39.790> there

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
so half faster this thing it was there

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.990 
so half faster this thing it was there
they're<00:02:40.660> doing<00:02:40.769> over<00:02:41.769> 150<00:02:42.310> kilometers<00:02:42.880> an

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
they're doing over 150 kilometers an

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.970 
they're doing over 150 kilometers an
hour<00:02:43.090> fastest<00:02:43.720> track<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.290> now<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.470> you're

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
hour fastest track but now you you're

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.830 
hour fastest track but now you you're
not<00:02:45.160> happy<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.609> they've<00:02:45.880> actually<00:02:46.090> softened

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
not happy that they've actually softened

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.050 
not happy that they've actually softened
that<00:02:46.870> track<00:02:47.230> up<00:02:47.470> right<00:02:47.709> well<00:02:48.370> what<00:02:48.640> happened

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
that track up right well what happened

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.270 
that track up right well what happened
was<00:02:49.299> is<00:02:49.630> particularly<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.829> format

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
was is particularly in the format

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.160 
was is particularly in the format
because<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.670> format<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.180> longer<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:53.019> goes

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
because the format is longer and it goes

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.099 
because the format is longer and it goes
faster<00:02:53.890> there<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> corner<00:02:55.480> combination

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
faster there is a corner combination

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.170 
faster there is a corner combination
near<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.350> bottom<00:02:56.500> corner<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:56.980> 13<00:02:57.340> they<00:02:58.030> now

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
near the bottom corner of 13 they now

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.390 
near the bottom corner of 13 they now
call<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.720> 50/50<00:02:59.410> corner<00:02:59.769> yeah<00:03:00.040> because

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
call it the 50/50 corner yeah because

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.150 
call it the 50/50 corner yeah because
the<00:03:01.359> sleds<00:03:01.660> are<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.290> fast<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:03.040> a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the sleds are going so fast in a

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.800 
the sleds are going so fast in a
competitive<00:03:03.519> environment<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.569> there's<00:03:04.720> a

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
competitive environment that there's a

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.599 
competitive environment that there's a
50%<00:03:05.079> chance<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.680> make<00:03:05.799> it<00:03:05.889> through<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:06.190> the

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
50% chance to make it through but the

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.300 
50% chance to make it through but the
drivers<00:03:07.120> have<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.480> be<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:08.109> precise<00:03:08.859> in<00:03:09.190> their

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
drivers have to be so precise in their

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.000 
drivers have to be so precise in their
driving<00:03:09.670> at<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.630> point<00:03:11.019> that<00:03:11.709> if<00:03:11.859> they're

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
driving at that point that if they're

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.059 
driving at that point that if they're
off<00:03:12.220> by<00:03:12.519> even<00:03:12.700> six<00:03:13.180> or<00:03:13.329> eight<00:03:13.540> inches<00:03:13.900> then<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
off by even six or eight inches then the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.449 
off by even six or eight inches then the
slide<00:03:15.280> can<00:03:15.489> go<00:03:15.579> in<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.819> corner<00:03:16.090> too<00:03:16.329> late<00:03:16.569> and

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
slide can go in the corner too late and

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.220 
slide can go in the corner too late and
it<00:03:18.459> puts<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> slide<00:03:18.940> over<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.600> at<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.959> at

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
it puts the slide over and at that at

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.870 
it puts the slide over and at that at
this<00:03:20.410> at<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.950> corner<00:03:21.160> 13<00:03:21.519> you're<00:03:21.670> doing

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
this at that corner 13 you're doing

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.920 
this at that corner 13 you're doing
about<00:03:22.769> 145<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:24.220> 148<00:03:24.819> kilometres<00:03:25.420> an<00:03:25.540> hour<00:03:25.630> so

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
about 145 to 148 kilometres an hour so

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.750 
about 145 to 148 kilometres an hour so
it's<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.650> fastest<00:03:27.010> point<00:03:27.190> in<00:03:27.280> any<00:03:27.370> track<00:03:27.609> in

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
it's the fastest point in any track in

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.160 
it's the fastest point in any track in
the<00:03:27.819> world<00:03:27.850> where<00:03:28.209> you<00:03:28.329> can<00:03:28.450> go<00:03:28.540> over<00:03:28.750> but<00:03:29.019> when

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
it's a nice touch of high speed the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
you're in corners a lot and at the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.930 
you're in corners a lot and at the
bottom<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.140> track<00:03:55.349> it<00:03:55.530> opens<00:03:55.980> up<00:03:56.220> quite<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
bottom of the track it opens up quite a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.059 
bottom of the track it opens up quite a
bit<00:03:57.239> which<00:03:57.510> allows<00:03:58.019> us<00:03:58.260> led<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.620> start<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.920> pick

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
bit which allows us led to start to pick

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.339 
bit which allows us led to start to pick
up<00:03:59.220> speed<00:03:59.550> but<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.180> one<00:04:00.450> specific<00:04:00.959> area<00:04:01.110> you

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
up speed but that one specific area you

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.630 
up speed but that one specific area you
have<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.709> quite<00:04:01.950> precise

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
have to be quite precise

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.759 
have to be quite precise
so<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.299> Europeans<00:04:03.810> came<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.680> what

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
so the Europeans came in and what

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.860 
so the Europeans came in and what
happens<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.670> part<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.330> sport<00:04:06.629> is<00:04:06.750> the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
happens is is a part of the sport is the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.509 
happens is is a part of the sport is the
danger<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.500> sport<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.129> the

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
danger of the sport and the

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.850 
danger of the sport and the
psychological<00:04:08.940> profile<00:04:09.780> required<00:04:10.410> by<00:04:10.799> the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
psychological profile required by the

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.250 
psychological profile required by the
athletes<00:04:11.370> when<00:04:12.060> they<00:04:12.269> know<00:04:12.510> there's<00:04:12.810> there's

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
athletes when they know there's there's

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.530 
athletes when they know there's there's
potential<00:04:14.010> for<00:04:14.280> danger<00:04:14.730> potential<00:04:15.420> for

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
potential for danger potential for

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.170 
potential for danger potential for
physical<00:04:15.959> harm<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:17.100> psychology<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
physical harm the psychology and the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.360 
physical harm the psychology and the
competitiveness<00:04:18.780> it's<00:04:19.410> going<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.739> draw<00:04:20.070> out

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
competitiveness it's going to draw out

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.120 
competitiveness it's going to draw out
tougher<00:04:20.970> competitors<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.690> put<00:04:22.560> away<00:04:22.830> the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
tougher competitors and put away the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.879 
tougher competitors and put away the
weaker<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.790> weaker<00:04:24.090> competitors<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.110> we

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
weaker the weaker competitors and so we

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.490 
weaker the weaker competitors and so we
need<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:27.060> sport<00:04:27.389> it<00:04:27.780> has<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.080> be<00:04:28.169> just

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
need that in the sport it has to be just

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.100 
need that in the sport it has to be just
the<00:04:28.590> right<00:04:28.889> balance<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.750> when<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
the right balance and so when a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.520 
the right balance and so when a
kilometer<00:04:31.680> standing<00:04:32.010> at<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.190> top<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.820> run

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
kilometer standing at the top of the run

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.260 
kilometer standing at the top of the run
and<00:04:34.530> they're<00:04:34.800> thinking<00:04:35.190> well<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.610> need<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.180> have

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
and they're thinking well I need to have

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.020 
and they're thinking well I need to have
faith<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:36.570> trust<00:04:36.930> in<00:04:37.169> my<00:04:37.260> driver<00:04:37.590> then<00:04:38.370> they

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
faith and trust in my driver then they

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.840 
faith and trust in my driver then they
if<00:04:39.930> they're<00:04:40.200> slightly<00:04:40.860> fearful<00:04:41.520> they'll

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
if they're slightly fearful they'll

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.640 
if they're slightly fearful they'll
they'll<00:04:42.419> hold<00:04:42.630> back<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> little<00:04:43.169> bit<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.470> that

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
they'll hold back a little bit and that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.990 
they'll hold back a little bit and that
can<00:04:43.860> affect<00:04:43.979> their<00:04:44.310> overall<00:04:44.430> what

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
can affect their overall what

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.820 
can affect their overall what
performance<00:04:45.479> and<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.900> believe<00:04:46.199> this<00:04:46.380> despite

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
performance and you believe this despite

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.330 
performance and you believe this despite
the<00:04:47.039> video<00:04:47.340> we<00:04:47.550> saw<00:04:47.760> this<00:04:48.720> who<00:04:49.470> nearly<00:04:49.710> died<00:04:50.010> on

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
the video we saw this who nearly died on

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.629 
the video we saw this who nearly died on
the<00:04:50.460> bobsleigh<00:04:50.970> yeah<00:04:51.720> well<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.260> track<00:04:52.800> when

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
the bobsleigh yeah well that track when

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.640 
the bobsleigh yeah well that track when
we<00:04:53.789> went<00:04:54.030> back<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.690> track<00:04:55.139> two<00:04:55.440> years

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
we went back to that track two years

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.529 
we went back to that track two years
later<00:04:55.950> we're<00:04:56.250> in<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.610> position<00:04:56.789> to<00:04:57.180> win<00:04:57.330> the

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
later we're in a position to win the

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.730 
later we're in a position to win the
overall<00:04:57.930> World<00:04:58.229> Cup<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:59.539> so<00:05:00.539> naturally<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.560> had

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
overall World Cup and so naturally I had

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.290 
overall World Cup and so naturally I had
to<00:05:01.800> go<00:05:02.220> through<00:05:02.250> that<00:05:02.490> process<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:03.030> my<00:05:03.150> own

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
to go through that process of my own

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.779 
to go through that process of my own
mind<00:05:03.570> just<00:05:03.840> focus<00:05:04.530> specifically<00:05:05.099> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.520> task

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
mind just focus specifically on the task

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.879 
mind just focus specifically on the task
but<00:05:06.630> might<00:05:06.810> think<00:05:07.080> of<00:05:07.169> my<00:05:07.289> crewmen<00:05:07.590> think

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
but might think of my crewmen think

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.800 
but might think of my crewmen think

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
right there the one we just saw that

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.240 
right there the one we just saw that
slides<00:05:30.630> about<00:05:30.750> 20<00:05:31.110> feet<00:05:31.349> high<00:05:31.380> in<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.860> corner

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
slides about 20 feet high in the corner

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.270 
slides about 20 feet high in the corner
pulling<00:05:32.789> about<00:05:32.880> 5<00:05:33.330> G's<00:05:33.630> now<00:05:34.470> isn't<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.039> whole

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
pulling about 5 G's now isn't the whole

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.159 
pulling about 5 G's now isn't the whole
idea<00:05:35.789> though<00:05:36.000> behind<00:05:36.389> bobsleigh<00:05:36.810> that's<00:05:37.020> why

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
idea though behind bobsleigh that's why

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.719 
idea though behind bobsleigh that's why
it's<00:05:37.289> so<00:05:37.410> popular<00:05:37.650> that's<00:05:38.160> why<00:05:38.310> people<00:05:38.490> love

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
it's so popular that's why people love

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.510 
it's so popular that's why people love
it<00:05:38.849> because<00:05:38.880> there<00:05:39.270> is<00:05:39.419> an<00:05:39.630> element<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:40.400> danger

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
it because there is an element of danger

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.640 
it because there is an element of danger
yes<00:05:41.729> I<00:05:41.970> mean<00:05:42.330> if<00:05:42.750> if<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.229> could<00:05:43.410> do<00:05:43.530> the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
yes I mean if if I could do the

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.529 
yes I mean if if I could do the
bobsleigh<00:05:44.099> nobody<00:05:44.520> would<00:05:44.669> watch<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:44.910> because

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
bobsleigh nobody would watch it because

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.420 
bobsleigh nobody would watch it because
I<00:05:45.750> would<00:05:45.900> only<00:05:46.110> do<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:46.470> if<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.770> was<00:05:46.950> absolutely

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
I would only do it if I was absolutely

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.510 
I would only do it if I was absolutely
safe<00:05:48.110> yeah<00:05:49.110> we're<00:05:49.650> gonna<00:05:49.740> see<00:05:49.919> some<00:05:50.070> action<00:05:50.370> in

especially like I said especially in the

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.659 
especially like I said especially in the
format<00:05:54.419> because<00:05:54.719> it's<00:05:54.870> longer<00:05:55.200> faster<00:05:55.950> but

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669

difficult
in<00:05:59.319> that<00:05:59.469> corner<00:05:59.770> the<00:06:00.249> luge<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.699> the<00:06:00.759> skeleton

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270

in that corner the luge and the skeleton
there's<00:06:01.539> their<00:06:01.870> small<00:06:02.199> enough<00:06:02.469> an<00:06:02.620> object

there's their small enough an object

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:04.739 
there's their small enough an object
that<00:06:03.310> they<00:06:03.490> can<00:06:03.669> work<00:06:04.180> their<00:06:04.389> way<00:06:04.479> through

that they can work their way through
that<00:06:04.780> that<00:06:05.139> corner<00:06:05.469> combination<00:06:06.069> but<00:06:06.249> it's

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
that that corner combination but it's

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.890 
that that corner combination but it's
the<00:06:06.550> thirties<00:06:06.909> like<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.270> bobsleds<00:06:07.719> have<00:06:07.840> a
