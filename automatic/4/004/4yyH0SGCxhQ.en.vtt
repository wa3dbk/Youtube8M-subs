you go into your downloads and yeah it
takes<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:56.010> little<00:03:56.190> bit<00:03:56.370> depending<00:03:56.820> on<00:03:56.910> your

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
takes a little bit depending on your

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.430 
takes a little bit depending on your
internet<00:03:57.239> connection<00:03:57.360> my<00:03:57.959> internet<00:03:58.320> it's

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
internet connection my internet it's

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.180 
internet connection my internet it's
kind<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.680> slow<00:03:59.090> so<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:01.560> mean<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:01.920> kind<00:04:02.130> of

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
kind of slow so I mean it's kind of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.770 
kind of slow so I mean it's kind of
inconsistent<00:04:02.790> with<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.970> megabytes<00:04:03.360> or<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
inconsistent with the megabytes or the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.830 
inconsistent with the megabytes or the
kilobyte<00:04:04.140> kilobytes<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.910> know<00:04:06.000> uploading

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
kilobyte kilobytes you know uploading

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.990 
kilobyte kilobytes you know uploading
but<00:04:07.410> yeah<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.310> what<00:04:08.400> you're<00:04:08.489> gonna<00:04:08.549> do<00:04:08.790> is

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
but yeah so what you're gonna do is

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.380 
but yeah so what you're gonna do is
you're<00:04:09.329> going<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.600> basically<00:04:10.140> download<00:04:11.070> that

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
you're going to basically download that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.030 
you're going to basically download that
now<00:04:12.390> for<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.959> sake<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.139> time<00:04:13.410> I'm<00:04:13.739> just<00:04:13.859> going

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
now for the sake of time I'm just going

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.560 
now for the sake of time I'm just going
to<00:04:14.160> pause<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.549> download<00:04:14.970> I'll<00:04:15.150> probably<00:04:15.419> end

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
to pause the download I'll probably end

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.710
