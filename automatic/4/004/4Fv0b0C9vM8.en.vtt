00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.670
 you see the Nokia c3 1 0 1 which appeared in the first quarter of 2011 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.789
 So this is a brand new device 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.799
 Brand new on the market 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.820
 and not only fresh but also very simple and simple 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.859
 that's why there is only one simple thing about a couple of them, Georg 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.130
 Here we see the device here a few technical data 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.900
 yes, here is the name Nokia 10 1 of the 1 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.939
 I take the money out of the packaging 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.150
 As usual, ca Nokias as always Albarn enough her to the environment 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.769
 and 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.640
 there is the device I take it here is what they used to be 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.960
 is such a protective film on it 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.360
 and that's how it looks 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.480
 If you hold it in your hand then it just falls on it is totally 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.530
 it is easy so it weighs almost nothing 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.690
 That's how Singles felt 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.770
 and what is remarkably quite a lot of plastic has been processed 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.640
 what is also grass over plastic the device is simple and cheap 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.430
 the APK child traveled corresponded at the end of the video 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.800
 that is a very soft one 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.550
 and percent anyway but relatively stable so it is not the court now 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.000
 but it is still compact 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.640
 I think that may fall down one or the other times without that now 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 great what happens 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.870
 Nia down what we see from the outside now 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.520
 Percent, if we ever consider the case here we have 180 millimeters 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.690
 sometimes 45 millimeters 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.430
 14 millimeters at the thickest point and if we already and on top 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.670
 look then here we see a 3 point 5-millimeter jack for headphones 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.850
 Here you can connect your own headphones that is very convenient 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.340
 on the left find nothing 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.800
 except here its solve Phil key chain or if you look 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.500
 discreetly hanging around your neck 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.780
 Here we see impetus for the charger which is a proprietary one 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 Charger from Nokia 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 yes and then we have here the entrance of the make-up for the micro SBK world 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.139
 more that's about a little bit everything 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.329
 MF which I turn around here without a name again around the microphone 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.880
 and we still have a camera that record in VG resolution 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.419
 the occasion is 4 included 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.809
 Scharner Meier 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.729
 there have now first the course 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:30.359
 it is a lithium ion of thousands of billions 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.239
 Mr. hours 8 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.029
 this is the acute beds is still a 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.419
 and that at night 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.449
 the proprietary charger we can see 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.559
 Lander on 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.589
 and then we have headphones here 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.129
 then of course use the chamber around 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.410
 to listen to music 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.249
 but also to make a phone call here with this button 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.260
 with 3com at 5 mm 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.479
 Jack also have it here he lets himself 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.559
 a manual 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:01.609
 so 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.749
 yes, if I want to put in updated now the must here 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.779
 Make cap app 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.889
 and then you come in the SIM card that I'll do it once 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.549
 then there's the tube pushing 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:19.669
 FAQ on it 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:25.079

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.189

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.459
 around the age of 79 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.429
 and according to Nokia, we have a talk time of only ten dollars 6, according to Nokia 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:38.629
 Hours with these Haq in standby mode should keep the acute for the 21 days 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.759
 besides, we have here an internal memory of 64 megawatts expandable 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.779
 this over Maco sd card up to 32 gigabytes 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:49.380

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.969
 now we have the battery 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.399
 Now I tell you how much the device costs the device costs 50 euros 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.019
 That is definitely a good value for money one can 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.849
