00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
Hello people of YouTube.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.420
I ya, I almost didn't make this video .

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.820
I had bought another one of the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.440
Star Wars Metal Earth kits.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.480
I bought the Advanced Tie Fighter.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.720
I wanted to make a video of..

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.680
assembling and review of the kit.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.360
Unfortunately ..

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.520
it's quite a bit more difficult

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.800
Than the Millennium Falcon.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.880
And the instructions aren't clearly set out step by step.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.300
There's a couple of different ways you can go.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.100
And the way I went didn't work.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.640
The directions are not really clear on where to start

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.200
and I decided to start up here.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.520
And it has you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.560
rounding off this piece

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.120
and attaching the sides.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120
I wish I hadn't of done it like that.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360
Because once you've rounded this

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.920
made the circle out of that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.080
getting these two pieces on and twisting the ends

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.680
is nearly impossible.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.260
And I flubbed it.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.380
And I continued on..

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.440
and then later on once of them popped out.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.540
And as you can see this thing is misshapen.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.920
Because I fought with it so much trying to get these pieces on

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
and there's a couple little guns or something that stick out

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.480
that I kept having to stop

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.160
and open 'em back up because they're so tiny

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.500
and so hard to twist the ends that they kept closing.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.060
Till eventually they broke in half.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.620
So both of the guns, even if I had finished this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.000
which I've given up on

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.360
both guns broke.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.600
And once they broke there really outside of glueing them

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.120
was not way of making it work.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.600
I continued on and I made..

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.600
started making the little back part

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.840
and this came out..

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.220
this rounded part came out better than the dish on the Falcon

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.940
because I had done that before.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.300
But trying to get this attached to the back of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.780
here is nearly impossible.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.760
It is above my skill.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.260
There are people out there that ahve done it I'm sure.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.440
And it can be done.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.140
And with some practice probably I could put it together

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.900
but this kit...

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.840
is ruined.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.620
[clears throat]

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.980
These pieces, this is gonna be

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.920
very difficult to put back on.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.720
This center part has been flexed so many times

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.620
it's just a matter before one of them breaks

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.620
because this is thin metal.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.480
And that's what will happen if you keep bending it back and forth

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.620
so I'm disappointed.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.360
The umm, I started with the Millennium Falcon.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.700
And it was a little challenging.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.640
But it was fun and it worked out.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.900
And I enjoyed it and I wanted to do more.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.960
I suggest starting with the Millennium Falcon.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.960
I do not suggest starting with the Advanced Tie Fighter.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.640
I wasn't going to make a video because it went sour

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.020
and I though, well what's the point?

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.780
But I actually kind of got curious

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720
and I went on YouTube and looked for videos

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.980
to see if other people had the same problem as I did

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.220
I couldn't find any.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.600
I found a lot of videos on the Falcon

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.300
I found some of R2D2

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.320
not very much of were people actually put them together.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.880
Didn't find anything on the Darth Vader Advanced Tie fighter.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.540
[clears throat]

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.340
So I thought I would go ahead and make this video to kind of tell others

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.120
if you want to get into these great!

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.160
You need steady hands.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.060
You need some good little tweezers.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.960
I started off using these.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.580
But some of the spaces are so small

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.420
I couldn't get the end of that in there.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.840
I actually had to go buy some tweezers

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.260
but it still wasn't enough.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.940
If I were to do this over..

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.020
i wouldn't have folded this all the way around in a circle.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.600
I would have done these ends

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.460
connected.. folded one end then connected it twisting it

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.320
cause that's the problem you're supposed to twist them.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.920
and it's very difficult to get in there with tweezers and actually successfully twist.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.640
So I would have before folding it all the way around

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.740
I would have put these two pieces on and then finished folding it.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.700
That still wouldn't have solved the problem of getting the other parts on.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.220
So if you've got steady hands and you've got the time and the patience

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.960
definitely go for it but be warned..

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.440
It'ssss not simple.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.080
You know it's simple to understand

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.240
and can be done

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.400
I wished I had steadier hands.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.360
I would.. I ...

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.600
I almost wish I could get another one and do it again but

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.200
It's above me, it's above my skill.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.660
So I'm not going to bother.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.240
I've got the Millennium Falcon.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.440
That one's great.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440
Turned out well.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.960
I had some trouble but I pulled it off.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.420
But I wanted to share.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.060
But thank you for watching.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.100
I'm very sorry to say that I didn't finish it.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.380
It would have looked awesome.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.500
And if you look at the detail..

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.140
that goes into the laser etching

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.140
It would have looked great.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.780
And the Millennium Falcon turned out great.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.700
This is a much more challenging one so be ready.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.100
If you want to do it, go for it, great.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.720
[softly]
But we warned.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.240
Thank you for watching.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.200
If you have any questions or comments leave them down below.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.180
And keep on keeping on.
