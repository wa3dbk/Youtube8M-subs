because the flowers are huge so I needed

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.580 
because the flowers are huge so I needed
something<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.790> know<00:03:52.970> big<00:03:53.270> formal<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:54.380> is

kind<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:54.980> beasts<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.490> think<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.450> size<00:03:56.780> we

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
kind of beasts I think the size we

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.780 
kind of beasts I think the size we
really<00:03:57.980> um<00:03:59.470> be<00:04:00.470> suitable<00:04:01.040> for<00:04:01.100> these<00:04:01.370> flowers

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
really um be suitable for these flowers

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.050 
really um be suitable for these flowers

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
so I could do something with that and

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.490 
so I could do something with that and
let's<00:04:05.510> see<00:04:06.380> how<00:04:06.500> big<00:04:06.800> these<00:04:07.010> frames<00:04:07.400> is<00:04:07.880> huge
