is longer than 24 this is definitely
more<00:03:42.820> than<00:03:42.880> 24,000<00:03:43.870> here's<00:03:44.110> one<00:03:44.440> ladies<00:03:44.860> in<00:03:45.840> 24

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.410 
more than 24,000 here's one ladies in 24

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
usually looks like a 18 on me and this

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.340 
usually looks like a 18 on me and this
is<00:03:49.630> definitely<00:03:51.120> 24<00:03:52.320> if<00:03:53.320> not<00:03:53.680> 26<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:55.080> got<00:03:56.080> say<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
is definitely 24 if not 26 I got say the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.810 
is definitely 24 if not 26 I got say the
only<00:03:56.470> problem<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:56.830> have<00:03:57.010> with<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.370> hair<00:03:57.580> is

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
only problem I have with the hair is

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.420 
only problem I have with the hair is
that<00:03:58.920> it<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:01.480> sheds<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.960> bit<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:03.370> think

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
that it it sheds a bit and I think

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.490 
that it it sheds a bit and I think
that<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:03.850> because<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.390> ends<00:04:04.720> are<00:04:04.990> so<00:04:05.200> dry<00:04:05.650> and

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that is because the ends are so dry and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.340 
that is because the ends are so dry and
damaged<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.740> think<00:04:09.400> once<00:04:09.730> i<00:04:09.940> get<00:04:10.660> those<00:04:11.050> either

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
damaged I think once i get those either

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.030 
damaged I think once i get those either
together<00:04:11.740> or<00:04:12.390> just<00:04:13.390> cut<00:04:14.020> them<00:04:14.080> off<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:14.560> don't

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
together or just cut them off I don't

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.530 
together or just cut them off I don't
think<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.310> shedding<00:04:15.670> will<00:04:15.820> be<00:04:16.000> as<00:04:16.150> bad

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
think the shedding will be as bad

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.449 
think the shedding will be as bad
because<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:16.959> am<00:04:17.080> noticing<00:04:17.410> that<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.040> shedding

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
because I am noticing that the shedding

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.250 
because I am noticing that the shedding
is<00:04:18.609> really<00:04:18.970> coming<00:04:19.239> from<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.870> same<00:04:20.019> as<00:04:20.230> a
