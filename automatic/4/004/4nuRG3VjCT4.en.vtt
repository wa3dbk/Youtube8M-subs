00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.770
 Greetings together how meager from Montanas by Oliver Plaschka I would like 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 Tease you today at least when the on fantastic literature 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.070
 stands thereby intellectually not wanting to be challenged 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.910
 I think that can look very beautiful you can always if you have the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.430
 Throwing his head 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.690
 beyond that is also the book 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.270
 very successful it also has a lot to offer in terms of content 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 and well for the content now I'm good at talking the story is about 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.630
 19 26 in Paris at a Variety marriages Montanas who Harvey and Harvey 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.400
 his assistant Blanc 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.500
 get into mortal danger during a% qoq piece 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980
 and so is just forced 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.820
 to use real Maggie to win and rescue his assistant 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.240
 yes yes you have heard real Maggie because right now is actually one 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 Magician so he can not have them anymore this Taschensertrick Strauss and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.110
 has clearly visibly clean 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.700
 Sarah does not like that in the wizarding future, that is 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.960
 not only partners but also prohibited 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.160
 and that's why Roddick lives in a time warp from then on 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.480
 However, this time loop only gets something to all magical beings 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.210
 the percent normal people 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.310
 just wants to go through the same day again and again without them 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.060
 actually remember 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.930
 there are already one or the other of the Hatter solar roofs like 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.940
 There are already something strange there were only some read know 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.790
 yes these days that it repeats on Sunday and they have confessed 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.219
 now has to liberate itself against the loop showing off this time 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.090
 there was one or the other had so I had like 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.099
 then who comes here because something was funny were only some read know 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.269
 yes these days that it repeats itself on Sunday and confidently 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.109
 Japan now has to free itself from the time warp 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.289
 I have in which opponents it radii and to do if this at the 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:37.789
 Association that over Alemannia so watch and take care that you never 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:42.289
 Use magic that has noticed that and now some 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.779
 her year's strongest representative 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.489
 to clarify this matter 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.459
 and if he manages to get out of this loop and Lorsch out of this 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.799
 Traunsteiner namely that you can sleep in borsch all the time since 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:54.729
 this day 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.809
 I also do not want to go into that if he does that 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:02.329
 also happened to clarify whether he also liberate himself and running free 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.579
 you have to find out yourself from this form more rigidly 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.549
 "I'm not going to continue the story just a bit 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.280
 on 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.109
 Labor construction of the book 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.809
 the book is written from the i-perspective but not from the 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.989
 I-perspective of a single person but from the perspective of 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.509
 seven people and that the seven protagonists of the book 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.489
 each chapter just replaces the codename of the character from its perspective 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.209
 is described 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.569
 Of course that means that I am 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.649
 It is not uncommon for Pakistan to happen that situation 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:44.279
 a situation an events from besides prospects is described 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:49.159
 This in turn means that, of course, not in consistently one percent 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.289
 Liesen high speed is maintained 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:55.239
 Plendl if you already know the situation just always from the other 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.099
 Perspective, life can light one or the other of you 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.580
 maybe bored 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.080
 Oliver Pocher definitely takes time for his characters and also for the 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.969
 Situation in this book 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.449
 I like that very well that meanwhile I already know that in the 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.749
 Review mentions again and again if that in the book is mistaken the part of the construction 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.609
 what like what Apple as a 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.410
 as the Bentley into the arena 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.870
 there it was not quite as much like many characters as here from the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.370
 I-perspective but already very similar in structure 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.400
 I like that very much 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.950
 important that if that is what you have for you, of course, then sits down 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.340
 know myself I want my god wants it and say or assert nothing 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.160
 that the book is boring is not at all but also if we like to hold 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.969
 yes as well as a no 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.279
 Percent action scene in the other in the map then he shows 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.099
 most likely with this book 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.240
 Ball sports 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.780
 Towards the end, Plaschka pulls the tempo normal 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.260
 the finale in the catacombs form 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.889
 in Paris is really exciting because I think the pace is then quite high 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.480
 yes and underlined I am saying that 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.689
 Also, definitely not a snack for in between so who's on 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.759
 Percent of light fast and good entertainment is likely 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.419
 whole Europe Council with the book 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.180
 You should take your time for the meager ones of Montparnasse and in the since 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.629
 has earned the book too 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.999
 if it dives right into this story, it will certainly guide you 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.879
 very fast probably in the Paris of the 20s 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.830
 In the end I am even a little bit tired of the characters 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.990
 Say goodbye I felt very well 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.240
 and stuffy Wish you that it follows the same goes 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:38.219
 the Magento Montanas appeared at EHEC ago comes a high prices 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:39.570
 but above all, strong 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.050
 my recommendation papers i am now out here you say in picture and we see 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.470
 We'll be fine again soon
