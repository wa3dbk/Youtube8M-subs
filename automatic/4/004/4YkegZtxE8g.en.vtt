00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.389
 everyone in the world existed and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.760
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.039
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.110
 this trick is to get change the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.420
 color of the creu for about 8 colors 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.939
 different that are colors that are by 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.679
 so to say hidden that do not exist and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.900
 Well, the one I like the most is this 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.230
 the mint color and it is a pretty color 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.600
 handsome and we will teach how it is done 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.340
 does from the crew page that you 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 I'll leave it in the description there you'll have 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.520
 the rockstar social club page and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.070
 good you will have to go there 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 registered in case you are not and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.129
 Well, let's start with the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.809
 tutorial of this trick so good a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.449
 Once we are here we have already created a 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.010
 breeding we will have to put him we have to 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.620
 enter here to the crew part we give 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.329
 here to manage crew and here what 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 we would have to do it is to give the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.809
 right button and give it to inspect 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.149
 element I recommend that we be in the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.039
 Chrome browser because it's better than 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.680
 in firefox to do this kind of 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.260
 things and good because here we will get the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.490
 source code of the page and here what 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.980
 we would have to do is change two 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 values ​​are this one here and the one below 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.610
 what we should do is go to the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 description of this video and copy the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.410
 values ​​that I will leave you there I will leave you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.690
 eight different and you're the one you want 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.430
 I'm going to leave you here all for 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.720
 order and good then I 'm going to try 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.820
 first it is mint color that is this 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.070
 which is the one that I liked the most and what 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 we have to do is copy the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 numbers these vouchers and replace them by 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.410
 the one you're looking up here after 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 we will have to do exactly the same 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.490
 with the one below and once this is done 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.080
 when we have put the number of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.330
 above and below we have 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.250
 replaced and remember that we have to 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.020
 leave the pad and good when 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.420
 when we already have this what we have 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 what to do is click on the page once 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.780
 so that it is saved and even if you do not see 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 that the color really changed 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.570
 has changed because in reality as 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.520
 if it did not exist because they are colors 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.810
 different is not that you go here to the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 sieve you put the color that you 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.750
 You can not do that, you have to 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.450
 do it this way because these 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.070
 horns appear in the color menu 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.650
 what they give you in the crew are colors 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.020
 hidden as it were and well then 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.880
 we close the tab and we give to save 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.100
 in the sieve then good when we are 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.080
 here if we are in the online in the case 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.760
 that we were editing this and the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.709
 once we have the play on or the xbox 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.769
 so I recommend that the pay or that the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.030
 pay and then good directly if 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.500
 you want to close session 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.599
 then you go to the campaign you go back to 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.730
 online and you will have saved what 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.709
 I raise her because sometimes 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.200
 it takes a while to save the changes 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.720
 because when we had done this we will 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.000
 to any custom and here we would have to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 go to paint and when we go to the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.040
 painting the main then the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.599
 secondary we go to the first one if 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.909
 you want and then let's put the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.120
 part of crew and we'll see that we have the 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.859
 color that we have put on the page of 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.019
 I write it is how you see because 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.090
 this one that is the green color this way by 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.310
 well to say it bright or also 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.290
 said as mint and well then we can 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.389
 do this with the eight others that I 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.159
 I will leave therefore good only to teach here of 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.049
 while I'm doing this and good 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.120
 Well basically this would be also 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.859
 you can change the smoke of the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.079
 I write to put it like the one I told you 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.120
 the same is exactly the same 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.340
 change it from the smoke of the sieve to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.230
 wheels and well we can do this 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.269
 with all the people who are in that crew 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.040
 so well, well, this has been 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.660
 everything if you liked the video 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.520

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.320
