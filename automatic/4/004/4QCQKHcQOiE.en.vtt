a<00:00:38.220> whole<00:00:38.730> new<00:00:39.060> lower<00:00:39.510> control<00:00:39.870> arm<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.620> is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
a whole new lower control arm this is

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.979 
a whole new lower control arm this is
very<00:00:41.100> very<00:00:41.489> simple<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.940> remove<00:00:42.239> we've<00:00:42.600> been<00:00:42.870> at

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
very very simple to remove we've been at

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.350 
very very simple to remove we've been at
it<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.550> about<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.730> hour<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.100> that's<00:00:48.059> just

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it for about an hour and that's just

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.810 
it for about an hour and that's just
taking<00:00:48.930> our<00:00:49.020> time<00:00:49.220> using<00:00:50.220> a<00:00:50.280> lot<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> hammers

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
taking our time using a lot of hammers

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.440 
taking our time using a lot of hammers
uh<00:00:52.550> -<00:00:54.290> duct<00:00:55.290> tape<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.550> lower<00:00:57.059> control

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
uh - duct tape to get the lower control

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.680 
uh - duct tape to get the lower control
arm<00:00:57.780> off<00:00:58.430> it's<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:00:59.820> straightforward<00:01:00.230> you

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
arm off it's pretty straightforward you

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
arm off it's pretty straightforward you
can't<00:01:03.690> actually<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.170> anything<00:01:04.909> well<00:01:05.909> that's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
can't actually see anything well that's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.199 
can't actually see anything well that's
like<00:01:06.149> it<00:01:06.240> let<00:01:06.329> me<00:01:06.389> turn<00:01:06.509> this<00:01:06.630> light<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:08.209> okay

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.209 
like it let me turn this light on okay

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.480 
like it let me turn this light on okay
here<00:01:09.389> we<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.509> this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.749> a<00:01:09.869> lot<00:01:10.229> better<00:01:10.499> that's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
here we go this is a lot better that's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.279 
here we go this is a lot better that's

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
this is for the sway bar that's bolted

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.539 
this is for the sway bar that's bolted
to<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> lower<00:01:28.560> control<00:01:28.889> arm<00:01:29.130> undo<00:01:29.490> those<00:01:31.549> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to the lower control arm undo those you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.370 
to the lower control arm undo those you
have<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> piece<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.359> seventeen<00:01:33.990> millimeter

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

bolt right here back that off and over

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.859 
bolt right here back that off and over
here<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.789> haven't<00:01:42.119> completely<00:01:42.569> finished

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
here I haven't completely finished

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.149 
here I haven't completely finished
putting<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.169> back<00:01:43.319> together<00:01:43.469> but<00:01:43.889> you<00:01:44.009> got

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
putting this back together but you got

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.659 
putting this back together but you got
another<00:01:44.429> I<00:01:45.380> think<00:01:47.240> that's<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.389> 19<00:01:48.929> maybe<00:01:49.669> the

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:50.669 
another I think that's a 19 maybe the

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:56.780 
another I think that's a 19 maybe the
wrenches

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.360 

19<00:01:57.790> yes<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.240> 19<00:01:58.770> take<00:01:59.770> that<00:02:00.340> bolt<00:02:00.580> out<00:02:01.440> take<00:02:02.440> the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
19 yes a 19 take that bolt out take the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.160 
19 yes a 19 take that bolt out take the
bolt<00:02:03.610> out<00:02:03.790> here<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:04.510> is<00:02:04.660> actually<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
bolt out here and this is actually the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.590 
bolt out here and this is actually the
other<00:02:05.920> part<00:02:06.370> of<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.550> bracket<00:02:06.970> for<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:07.360> sway

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
other part of the bracket for this sway

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.449 
other part of the bracket for this sway
bar<00:02:07.810> link<00:02:08.050> which<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.649> video<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:09.220> did<00:02:09.399> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
bar link which in a video I just did the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.800 
bar link which in a video I just did the
other<00:02:09.610> day<00:02:09.729> we<00:02:09.910> could<00:02:10.030> display<00:02:10.179> bar<00:02:10.450> links<00:02:10.720> in

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
other day we could display bar links in

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.910 
other day we could display bar links in
this<00:02:10.899> car<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.450> was<00:02:13.600> also<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.930> vertical<00:02:14.050> as

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
this car but it was also a vertical as

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.890 
this car but it was also a vertical as
you<00:02:15.070> can<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:16.030> fits<00:02:16.270> over<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.660> so

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
you can see this this fits over it so

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.840
