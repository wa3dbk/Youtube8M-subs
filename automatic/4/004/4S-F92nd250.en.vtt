to turn this team around this year well
I<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:22.110> think<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:22.350> last<00:02:22.620> year<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.100> just

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
I I just think like last year it's just

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.040 
I I just think like last year it's just
seemed<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:24.180> caught<00:02:24.480> all<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> breaks

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
seemed that they caught all the breaks

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.920 
seemed that they caught all the breaks
and<00:02:25.290> when<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.160> try<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.400> repeat<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.660> get<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and when you try to repeat it to get the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.510 
and when you try to repeat it to get the
Super<00:02:28.350> Bowl<00:02:28.380> you've<00:02:28.770> got<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.070> have<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> lot<00:02:29.490> of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
Super Bowl you've got to have a lot of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.030 
Super Bowl you've got to have a lot of
luck<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:29.910> injuries<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:30.810> seems

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
luck with injuries and it just seems

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.110 
luck with injuries and it just seems
everything<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.130> they're<00:02:32.700> not<00:02:32.880> really

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
