envelope<00:06:58.460> or<00:06:58.960> the<00:06:59.960> part<00:07:00.230> of<00:07:00.350> the<00:07:00.470> cell

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
envelope or the part of the cell

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.800 
envelope or the part of the cell
envelope<00:07:00.919> that<00:07:01.220> is<00:07:01.280> plasma<00:07:02.150> membrane

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
envelope that is plasma membrane

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.530 
envelope that is plasma membrane
similarly<00:07:03.620> in<00:07:03.800> certain<00:07:04.310> prokaryotic<00:07:05.210> cells

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
similarly in certain prokaryotic cells

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.970 
similarly in certain prokaryotic cells
like<00:07:05.780> that<00:07:05.960> of<00:07:08.050> cyanobacteria<00:07:09.050> in<00:07:09.800> which

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:09.980 
like that of cyanobacteria in which

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.680 
like that of cyanobacteria in which
special<00:07:10.250> extensions<00:07:10.910> are<00:07:11.090> present<00:07:11.450> which<00:07:11.570> are

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
special extensions are present which are

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.630 
special extensions are present which are
called<00:07:11.930> as<00:07:12.139> the<00:07:12.320> chromatophores<00:07:13.190> which

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640 
called as the chromatophores which

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.930 
called as the chromatophores which
contains<00:07:14.260> pigment<00:07:15.260> so<00:07:15.950> this<00:07:16.310> is<00:07:16.460> all<00:07:16.640> about

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
contains pigment so this is all about

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.260 
contains pigment so this is all about
the<00:07:17.930> cell<00:07:18.410> envelopes<00:07:18.890> and<00:07:19.100> its<00:07:19.340> modification

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
the cell envelopes and its modification

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.470 
the cell envelopes and its modification
in<00:07:20.690> our<00:07:20.900> next<00:07:21.260> video<00:07:21.410> we<00:07:21.740> will<00:07:21.890> discuss<00:07:22.220> about

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480 
in our next video we will discuss about

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.409 
in our next video we will discuss about
ribosomes<00:07:23.480> and<00:07:24.370> inclusions<00:07:25.370> so<00:07:25.970> for<00:07:26.180> more

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419 
ribosomes and inclusions so for more
