use it for most of my filming it's
really<00:00:50.739> bright<00:00:51.129> but<00:00:51.759> it<00:00:51.879> shows<00:00:52.180> up<00:00:52.360> really

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
really bright but it shows up really

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.530 
really bright but it shows up really
great<00:00:53.049> on<00:00:53.229> camera<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:53.860> it's<00:00:54.400> kind<00:00:55.030> of<00:00:55.180> hard<00:00:55.449> to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
great on camera and it's kind of hard to

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:05.690 
great on camera and it's kind of hard to
look<00:00:55.780> around

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.359 

Rosa

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.530 

30<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.710> my<00:01:11.860> second<00:01:12.460> lamp<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.820> just<00:01:13.090> used<00:01:13.330> it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
30 this is my second lamp I just used it

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.200 
30 this is my second lamp I just used it
as<00:01:13.690> an<00:01:13.930> extra<00:01:14.260> light<00:01:14.440> on<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.740> side<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:16.030> is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
as an extra light on the side and it is

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.940 
as an extra light on the side and it is
broken<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:17.049> that's<00:01:17.229> probably<00:01:17.409> why<00:01:17.650> you<00:01:17.710> see

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
broken so that's probably why you see

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.530 
broken so that's probably why you see
black<00:01:18.190> tape<00:01:18.430> around<00:01:18.790> it<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:20.850> finally<00:01:21.850> my

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
black tape around it and finally my

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.170 
black tape around it and finally my
third<00:01:23.110> lighting<00:01:23.770> I<00:01:23.950> don't<00:01:24.490> have<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.850> have<00:01:25.030> this

third lighting I don't have to have this
in<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.450> background<00:01:25.960> but<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.380> just<00:01:26.530> gives<00:01:26.770> it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
in the background but it just gives it

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.010
