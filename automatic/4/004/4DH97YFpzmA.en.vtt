if<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.850> curve<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:40.110> how<00:00:40.260> they

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
if that's a curve that that's how they

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.639 
if that's a curve that that's how they
work<00:00:40.649> or<00:00:40.920> not<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.719> pretty<00:00:42.719> sure<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.230> pull<00:00:43.620> a
