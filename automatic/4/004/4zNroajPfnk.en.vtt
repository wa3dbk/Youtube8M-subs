00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
well i think it was exciting it was a

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.010 
well i think it was exciting it was a
rebuilding<00:00:02.040> time<00:00:02.250> it<00:00:02.760> was<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> lot<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.210> fun<00:00:03.480> and

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
rebuilding time it was a lot of fun and

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.650 
rebuilding time it was a lot of fun and
I<00:00:04.410> think<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:05.370> all<00:00:05.580> came<00:00:05.970> together<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.480> try<00:00:06.629> to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
I think we all came together to try to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.450

put<00:00:06.930> me<00:00:07.200> on<00:00:07.290> Los<00:00:07.500> Angeles<00:00:07.919> back<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> map

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
and I think we did that when she killed

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.049 
and I think we did that when she killed
came<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.200> Kobe<00:00:10.860> came<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.400> emerged<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.940> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and they take care of that and they'll

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
and they take care of that and they'll
add<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.140> that's<00:01:01.410> that's<00:01:01.620> real

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
add that in because that's that's real

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.200 
add that in because that's that's real
important<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.550> Dallas<00:01:02.789> had<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> lot

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
important that you see Dallas had a lot

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.539 
important that you see Dallas had a lot
a<00:01:03.239> lot<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.510> veterans<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> team<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.339> think

that's what Miami needed to win they

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.390 
that's what Miami needed to win they
needed<00:01:07.290> somebody<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.740> help<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> veteran
