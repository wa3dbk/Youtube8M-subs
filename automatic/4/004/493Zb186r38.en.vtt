00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.300
 for the new apple blog guys 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.730
 here we are again in a very short video man 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.200
 this video will be for another four 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.139
 maximum minutes just because I want to 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.050
 make you see only those who are i 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.039
 tweets compatible or not compatible for 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.960
 the new jailbreak and different 7.1 7.0.1 is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.140
 was offered by a US site a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.060
 file that will be updated as and when 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.009
 new compatibility will be discovered or 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.739
 incompatibility with this new one 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.170
 jailbreak so that everyone 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.610
 cutlery and use them always 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.739
 finally played this way 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 he massages it automatically because I am 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 the owner of this document 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.610
 this site will take care of this 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 work 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 so guys the document is 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.149
 essentially this I put myself on 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.910
 link below in description as vi 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.320
 I had announced it for the new one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.780
 version of this jailbreak and the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.969
 compatibility is not maximum with everyone 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.579
 many tweaks can be completely 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.470
 nothing or it can finally be between 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.530
 compatible as we see here we have gods 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 yes 10 or the tweet is compatible 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.610
 one hundred percent less 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.049
 the tweak is not compatible with the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 explanation of the effects it could have 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.150
 have negative and partially means 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.189
 that some things of the click can 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 buy instead others can turn 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.460
 less or may not work but of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.040
 however, it is usually always written 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.159
 attack what doesn't work to notice 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.380
 also the tweak version that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.740
 we want to install and even if there is the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 64-bit support for the last 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.360
 devices like iphone 5 ipad mini 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.920
 reads display of ipad her face the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 in fact also find how you see the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.720
 box en tested over that was not 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.060
 still tested so you can maybe 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.689
 check but if you see that here and not 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.979
 tested and here instead said no maybe it is 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.960
 better to leave it alone because the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.520
 device really could go into 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.329
 that the skin grows no longer come out of the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 safe mode 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.200
 so guys if you go by mistake 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 to download a tweak that is not 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.990
 compatible 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.149
 most likely it will be blocked 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.009
 device or it will go in safe mode 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.750
 you can make a start but it will be 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.349
 really very complicated to succeed in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360
 fix 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.400
 if you have 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.500
 forced to restore the device 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.930
 so it's a thing I don't recommend if 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.700
 just do something first check 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.460
 well in this list more for example 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.080
 I'm a lover of tweak swipe selection 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.420
 which allows you to select the text 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.240
 quickly move without using 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.610
 let's look at the magnification network 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.680
 here below there should be his selex 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.240
 here it is swipe selection yes it is 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.890
 perfectly compatible there is the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.660
 version and there is none 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.610
 contraindication so I go up 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.530
 succeeding in basic research is stalled 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.650
 swipe selection selection also in 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.200
 this new jailbreak of ios 7.1 was 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.970
 kids this essentially everything 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.070
 let's see if we also talk about 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.660
 something else maybe we talk about 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.390
 the security of this new is the break 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.860
 in the last video I had a fact one 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.080
 written in large while I spoke 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.820
 below the quotas indications that he said 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.040
 that jailbreak is the latest novelty of the 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.230
 famous is that he was assured that the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.760
 one hundred percent sure this thing is 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.489
 real guys actually finally 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.020
 you can safely do this 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.060
 jailbreak and in any device e 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.430
 want me to put all the monsters 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.709
 data you can even restore the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.720
 backup the President of the strong 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.040
 same maybe echo that you had then 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.840
 restored to perform the procedure 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.410
 so that you still have all yours 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.480
 data 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.489
 and it has just been ascertained that there is none 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.200
 you will be hurt you will not do me 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.180
 steal them on a piece of data and they won't come to me 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.670
 confiscated money from your credit card 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.260
 so at least we have this security and 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.090
 maybe those who have more before 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.440
 skeptics now no can now 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.269
 finally throw ourselves into this new one 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.250
 jailbreak is indeed for those not yet 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.530
 he had done it besides having seen the nick 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.330
 maybe description I put the link here 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.610
 to be able to click directly on 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.110
 screen will obviously come new 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.269
 bets of the best cydia tweaks 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.320
 this time updated then 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.140
 compatible with the new darkness 7.1.1 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.000
 obviously I will talk to you later about the 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.380
 the ios upgrades 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.230
 because as we know it is going to be 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.230
 issued in 7.1.2 which could 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.360
 indeed without any doubt it will be like 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.730
 a danger for the jailbreak because with 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.010
 this 7.1.2 can no longer be used 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.860
 the jailbreak indeed 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.020
 this peng goes to use two explore 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.760
 two explorers were used 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.640
 would do weaker than they could 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.100
 maybe work for the next one 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.750
 ios 8 jailbreak so they wanted 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.550
 to do it by force was something that is 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.380
 he could even avoid it because 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.300
 now as they come 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.980
 exploited considering that in mind if 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.780
 increasingly difficult to create and use 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.830
 a jailbreak for the next generations 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.320
 of aids 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.030
 so without any doubt we will not have a 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.800
 hourly jailbreak feels future point 2 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.450
 and later but the next is the break 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.760
 which we have will be directly to 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.590
 September s8 help or car 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.760
 globe takes what they will do 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.070
 jailbreak developers 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.960
 so mine the one I recommend is 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.780
 update as quickly as possible a 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.640
 any 7.1.1 do this jailbreak e 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.050
 wait don't update more than 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.180
 inserted to all the updates that 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.550
 bertoli will be released in the next ones 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.110
 boys live talking about rumors 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.690
 so maybe i'll do an apple news or 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.640
 a bet maybe destined only for one 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.620
 specific device for the rumor 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.510
 maybe because there are so many e 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.400
 I'd like to talk about this visa 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.470
 that you are very interested in these things 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.540
 the rumors indeed given very well ride on 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.760
 serious iphone because he had not seen 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.710
 still as always willing and also below 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.510
 description and for this short video 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.530
 essentially everything I put you anyway 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.540
 also the link if you have n't seen it core has 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.250
 seen of this edition file you can 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.430
 even change it maybe you have 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.380
 tested the application you go to 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.510
 click on where there are those who protest perhaps 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.510
 it has changed in this way you have it 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.310
 modified for you guys for this 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.390
 video is all see you next 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.390
 one greeting and the other
