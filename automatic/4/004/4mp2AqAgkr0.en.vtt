00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.759
 Well this time is it now end I will talk to you. 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:18.920
 First, I wonder if would you say entered November 3 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:20.800
 It was rough that I reflected that November 3 same day that day was that women's each condition on that day 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 But 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 That's right 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.039
 Sweet goal was over the years 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.030
 To say I promoted 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.670
 So don't 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.670
 There was a place called even one year old earlier 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.660
 Match 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.930
 It's been a little later , but it's good that Showa was decided 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.930
 I also thought 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.120
 So much for the whole team 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.800
 How do you gather? 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.550
 Are you management 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.550
 Because it was not 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.530
 It is natural to enter 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.119
 But I will think whether not it was slightly paint 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:21.219
 I'll come back to this Gamba, how about this team 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:23.830
 If you say that while fighting, you will fight like Hayama Osaka Yes this is already one season 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:28.310
 Yes I have been asked for 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.840
 After all I think that especially difficult away is a great atmosphere , but it's fast 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.619
 Well pull a 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.619
 Coming team 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.450
 I will see you later 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.780
 After all there were many 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.230
 I think 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.140
 Harden that defense 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.960
 If protected 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.360
 Also You have a place difficult if not it was also well to take a point 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.590
 It is just counter Toka set play 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.010
 Even when good and Te' beaten one shot 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.659
 The cars coming out of 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:04.740
 If it was a coming development, such store names would be somewhat 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.430
 The Tteyuu Chapter bodied puncture or N or does not work 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.430
 There is 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.520
 If they have the power to attack 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.370
 Everyone gave me confidence that I could do it in nine minutes 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.819
 Of course there were games that could not be broken 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.819
 I will take a lot of points if I go through 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.230
 Become a good attack 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.830
 That 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.830
 Against 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.470
 What comes of more than opponent of motivation 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.710
 I think I might have put out 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.570
 That just June has the idea of the representative 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:50.340
 Of course elected representative of the players entering the Endo players Tteyuu that time Well yes away team 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:53.640
 Though I think that I was worried about saying " Hey" was not good for the team 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.490
 As a result, in retrospect one month and Chapter 4 the most high 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:03.560
 The team got stacked points in a very good way 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:05.810
 Yes there is a feeling that I will do it already when I leave it 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.430
 No Well I et al. 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.850
 I hope you have another member 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.410
 Yui In 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.410
 Only and see the results 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.860
 That 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.870
 In particular, while I was away, I think that a good rhythm was created before this 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.960
 Will 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.440
 I think it is 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.440
 because there was 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.800
 Well there is a line around that 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.700
 I think it is traditional 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.230
 Less draw 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.230
 The has generated a lot of value 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.630
 of 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.630
 I think it's a force 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.550
 Well ordinary 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.620
 Why I Un' bought very much 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:00.170
 Yeah But I was feeling 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:05.000
 Even if you're looking high in Gamba Osaka, it's fun, and now the base is going to continue this week 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:08.130
 Stomach as there is more than once will it color of climbers not there also Burezu even after all are you 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.980
 Also Kenta's Toko Well to do so 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.660
 After all there is an attack girl 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.730
 I have you know the gamma feature point enough 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.500
 If you meet 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.560
 I only have to win 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.240
 I have not bent to tell myself 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.300
 Because there is no thigh 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.800
 After all 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.670
 Lightning sheet available 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.980
 Take a lot of points offensively 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.220
 I think that I want to continue being a team 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:46.020
 Somewhere I can actually do it 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.720
 Also high players but rather the Tteyuu their Tteyuu course fighting gonna Yes season not 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.950
 Everyone 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.950
 Maa's 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.300
 S of another go fallen in year j 2 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.540
 It is to is not all 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.940
 After all 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.660
 Kun I also self-confidence Tteyuu Yareru the women 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.950
 Because I think that everyone has it speaking 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.990
 Just man so easy 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:14.150
 We have a good understanding also say that it is not me to play 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.150
 After all I think that further effort is necessary 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.150
 They are 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.590
 I thought to 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.590
 To stand on the pitch 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.650
 The practice 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.619
 The camp before the opening is very 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:37.539
 q like 

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:37.539
 But I will think whether not it is the target 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.289
 This season 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.950
 1 year 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:50.320
 Also more away of you 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.320
 A lot of people have you support and are really 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.800
 I think I will draw 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.370
 Fasten 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.370
 Final battle 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.569
 Than I think that probably won 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.680
 Gladly 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:08.600
 The game at this year's Expo 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:11.689
 I think I might have nine out next season 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:16.470
 Do you want to return to j 1 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:21.940
 I think there are a lot of very difficult games 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:25.920
 I would like to work hard to get good results 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.249
 There is a person who also next season of plenty 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.510
 If you receive 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:31.320
 I appreciate it 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.130
 Now cv one year 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.130
 Thank you very much
