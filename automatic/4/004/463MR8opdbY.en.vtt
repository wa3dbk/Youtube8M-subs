how<00:00:00.930> do<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.170> compose<00:00:01.770> well<00:00:03.920> I'll<00:00:04.920> start<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.400> off

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
how do I compose well I'll start you off

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.040 
how do I compose well I'll start you off
with<00:00:05.580> some<00:00:07.820> just<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.910> rough<00:00:09.150> idea<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.750> all<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
with some just a rough idea of all the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.410 
with some just a rough idea of all the
different<00:00:10.380> ways<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.980> there<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:11.910> because

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
different ways that there are because

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.970 
different ways that there are because
there's<00:00:12.690> lots<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.139> different<00:00:13.500> ways<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.860> I've

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
there's lots of different ways that I've

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.680 
there's lots of different ways that I've
used<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> past<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:15.299> compose<00:00:15.660> different

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
used in the past to compose different

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.730 
used in the past to compose different
songs<00:00:16.580> it's<00:00:17.900> just<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.050> matter<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:21.390> way<00:00:21.740> that

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
songs it's just a matter of the way that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.720 
songs it's just a matter of the way that
a<00:00:22.769> song<00:00:23.039> comes<00:00:23.279> about<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:25.220> some<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.460> songs

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
a song comes about so some of the songs

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.460 
a song comes about so some of the songs
that<00:00:26.939> I've<00:00:27.119> done<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.449> past<00:00:27.539> might<00:00:28.439> have

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that I've done in the past might have

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.130 
that I've done in the past might have
been<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.310> spontaneous<00:00:29.910> composition<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> start

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
been a spontaneous composition to start

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.029 
been a spontaneous composition to start
off<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.590> might<00:00:31.769> understand<00:00:32.160> play

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:47.389 

start<00:00:38.789> at<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.889 

and<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.700> might<00:00:47.910> become<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.390> main<00:00:48.570> part<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and that might become the main part of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.610 
and that might become the main part of
the<00:00:49.050> song<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.559> I'll<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.610> over<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.120> refine<00:00:51.540> it

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
the song and I'll go over and refine it

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.900 
the song and I'll go over and refine it
just<00:00:52.620> stuff<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.420> now<00:00:55.460> sometimes<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
just stuff like that now sometimes I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970 
just stuff like that now sometimes I
might<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:58.110> a<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.379> nice<00:00:58.589> chord

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
might have a really nice chord

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.139 
might have a really nice chord
progression<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.730> like<00:01:00.469> let's<00:01:01.469> say<00:01:02.149> might

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
progression that I like let's say might

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:19.649 
progression that I like let's say might
be

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.959 

-<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.259> G<00:01:20.590> now<00:01:21.009> I'll<00:01:21.100> show<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.310> what<00:01:21.520> my<00:01:21.549> hands

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
- a G now I'll show you what my hands

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.840 
- a G now I'll show you what my hands
are<00:01:22.030> doing<00:01:22.090> later<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.689> but<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.520> if<00:01:24.640> there's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
are doing later on but so if there's

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.249 
are doing later on but so if there's
enough<00:01:25.090> there's<00:01:25.329> lots<00:01:25.539> of<00:01:25.689> different<00:01:26.020> chord

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
enough there's lots of different chord

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.330 
enough there's lots of different chord
progressions<00:01:26.829> that<00:01:27.189> I've<00:01:27.549> actually<00:01:27.970> used

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
progressions that I've actually used

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.919 
progressions that I've actually used
there<00:01:30.340> might<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.590> many<00:01:32.829> songs<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
there might be so many songs use the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.249 
there might be so many songs use the
same<00:01:35.110> chord<00:01:35.409> progression<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:37.869> think

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
same chord progression so don't think

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.289 
same chord progression so don't think
I've<00:01:38.740> heard<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.009> chord<00:01:39.429> progression<00:01:39.520> before

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
I've heard that chord progression before

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.669 
I've heard that chord progression before
I<00:01:40.329> should<00:01:40.630> use<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.810> different<00:01:40.899> one<00:01:41.319> because<00:01:41.439> if

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
I should use a different one because if

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.080 
I should use a different one because if
there's<00:01:41.829> a<00:01:41.920> particular<00:01:42.100> chord<00:01:42.700> progression

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
there's a particular chord progression

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.279 
there's a particular chord progression
that<00:01:43.179> you<00:01:43.299> really<00:01:43.569> like<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:43.990> you're<00:01:44.110> just

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
that you really like and you're just

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.870 
that you really like and you're just
starting<00:01:44.530> out<00:01:44.799> in<00:01:44.979> composition<00:01:45.310> that's<00:01:45.759> a

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
starting out in composition that's a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.309 
starting out in composition that's a
perfect<00:01:46.270> way<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.450> start<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.960> off

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
perfect way to start it off

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.609 
perfect way to start it off
start<00:01:47.860> with<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.009> quarter<00:01:48.250> like<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.750> then<00:01:49.960> start

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
start with a quarter like and then start

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.699 
start with a quarter like and then start
with<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.770> tune<00:01:51.100> I'll<00:01:51.610> be<00:01:51.759> going<00:01:52.030> over<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.330> in

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
with a tune I'll be going over that in

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.789 
with a tune I'll be going over that in
more<00:01:53.709> detail<00:01:54.959> then<00:01:55.959> I'm<00:01:56.110> also<00:01:56.490> there's<00:01:57.599> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
more detail then I'm also there's the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.460 
more detail then I'm also there's the
composition<00:01:59.799> that<00:01:59.830> you<00:02:00.069> might<00:02:00.280> do<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:02.020> little

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
composition that you might do a little

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.800 
composition that you might do a little
tune<00:02:02.830> might<00:02:03.069> come<00:02:03.280> into<00:02:03.429> your<00:02:03.549> head<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:04.030> might

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
tune might come into your head you might

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.990 
tune might come into your head you might
be<00:02:04.990> whistling<00:02:05.200> away<00:02:07.440> one<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.799> ones<00:02:09.789> in

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
be whistling away one of the ones in

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.479 
be whistling away one of the ones in
particular<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.840> used<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.769> whistle<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.220> tune

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
particular I used to whistle this tune

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:24.780 
particular I used to whistle this tune
all<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.760> time<00:02:22.799> now<00:02:23.799> I<00:02:23.829> used<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.130> whistle<00:02:24.549> that

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
all the time now I used to whistle that

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.340 
all the time now I used to whistle that
all<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> time<00:02:25.239> although<00:02:25.720> I'm<00:02:25.989> not<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> very

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
all the time although I'm not a very

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.259 
all the time although I'm not a very
good<00:02:26.590> Whistler<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.220> was<00:02:27.730> good<00:02:28.060> enough<00:02:28.209> to

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
good Whistler I was good enough to

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.330 
good Whistler I was good enough to
whistle<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.840> little<00:02:29.079> tune<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.650> then<00:02:30.310> I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
whistle the little tune and then I

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.110 
whistle the little tune and then I
thought<00:02:30.609> ah

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
thought ah

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.180 
thought ah
it's<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.840> good<00:02:32.019> little<00:02:32.200> -<00:02:32.440> maybe<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.769> should<00:02:33.010> put

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
it's a good little - maybe I should put

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.340 
it's a good little - maybe I should put
it<00:02:33.310> into<00:02:33.549> a<00:02:33.579> song<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.209> I<00:02:34.450> turned<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.079> into<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
it into a song and I turned it into a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.740 
it into a song and I turned it into a
sort<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.709> an<00:02:35.799> upbeat

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.690 

if<00:02:43.320> you've<00:02:43.470> got<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> particular<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.370> tune

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
if you've got a particular to tune

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.850 
if you've got a particular to tune
that's<00:02:44.910> really<00:02:45.210> good<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.420> might<00:02:45.780> hammer<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
that's really good you might hammer to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.010 
that's really good you might hammer to
it<00:02:46.890> rather<00:02:47.250> than<00:02:47.430> we're<00:02:47.670> singer<00:02:48.000> there's<00:02:48.900> only

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
ways that I compose music so my one of

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.310 
ways that I compose music so my one of
my<00:03:05.460> favorite<00:03:05.970> ways<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> compose<00:03:06.750> music<00:03:06.930> is

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
my favorite ways to compose music is

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:23.839 
my favorite ways to compose music is
just<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.620> play<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.830> piano<00:03:08.190> play<00:03:08.910> anything

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.420 

and<00:03:24.090> then<00:03:24.780> out<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:24.959> those<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.709> playing<00:03:26.010> there

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
and then out of those that playing there

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.030 
and then out of those that playing there
might<00:03:26.579> be<00:03:26.609> specific<00:03:27.420> little<00:03:28.079> parts<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
might be specific little parts that I

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.920 
might be specific little parts that I
think<00:03:29.370> oh<00:03:29.549> that's<00:03:29.849> really<00:03:30.359> nice<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.810> then

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
think oh that's really nice and then

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.170 
think oh that's really nice and then
I'll<00:03:31.049> go<00:03:31.560> over<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.889> in<00:03:32.159> more<00:03:32.310> detail<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.999> try

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
I'll go over that in more detail and try

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.220 
I'll go over that in more detail and try
and<00:03:33.329> work<00:03:33.480> something<00:03:33.749> out

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
and work something out

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.179 
and work something out
and<00:03:34.379> then<00:03:35.659> once<00:03:36.659> you've<00:03:36.870> got<00:03:37.010> particular<00:03:38.010> but

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
and then once you've got particular but

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.629 
and then once you've got particular but
parts<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.909> really<00:03:39.239> like<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.980> might<00:03:41.219> use

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
parts that you really like you might use

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.530 
parts that you really like you might use
some<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.269> your<00:03:42.650> previous<00:03:43.650> knowledge<00:03:43.889> of

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
some of your previous knowledge of

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.020 
some of your previous knowledge of
composition<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.750> how<00:03:45.900> chords<00:03:46.530> work<00:03:46.739> together

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
composition and how chords work together

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.599 
composition and how chords work together
to<00:03:48.030> develop<00:03:48.329> other<00:03:49.200> parts<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.980> add<00:03:50.159> on<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.579> it

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
to develop other parts to add on to it

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.610 
to develop other parts to add on to it
because<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.389> might<00:03:51.569> have<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.840> part<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.379> you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
because you might have a part that you

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.559 
because you might have a part that you
particularly<00:03:53.579> really<00:03:53.879> like<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:54.299> then<00:03:54.450> you

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
particularly really like but then you

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.209 
particularly really like but then you
can't<00:03:54.810> work<00:03:55.169> out<00:03:55.439> something<00:03:55.829> off<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:57.480> fly<00:03:58.219> to

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
can't work out something off the fly to

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.569 
can't work out something off the fly to
go<00:03:59.370> with<00:03:59.609> it<00:03:59.790> so<00:03:59.939> you<00:04:00.120> might<00:04:00.389> think<00:04:00.750> okay<00:04:01.579> go

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
go with it so you might think okay go

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.229 
go with it so you might think okay go
over<00:04:02.790> what<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.959> know<00:04:04.139> put<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.739> few<00:04:05.069> chords<00:04:05.639> that

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
over what you know put a few chords that

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.539 
over what you know put a few chords that
you<00:04:06.389> know<00:04:06.629> that<00:04:06.900> will<00:04:07.049> go<00:04:07.230> with<00:04:07.469> it

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
you know that will go with it

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.869 
you know that will go with it
and<00:04:09.500> that's<00:04:10.500> something<00:04:10.799> that<00:04:11.159> we'll<00:04:11.310> we'll<00:04:11.849> be

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
and that's something that we'll we'll be

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:18.770 
and that's something that we'll we'll be
learning<00:04:12.469> as<00:04:13.469> well<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:16.609> yeah<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.910> think<00:04:17.970> to

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
learning as well and yeah I think to

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.259 
learning as well and yeah I think to
start<00:04:19.019> out<00:04:19.259> with<00:04:19.500> if<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.609> want<00:04:20.849> to<00:04:20.970> really

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
start out with if you want to really

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.719 
start out with if you want to really
start<00:04:21.630> from<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.989> beginning<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:23.460> haven't

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
start from the beginning and you haven't

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.810 
start from the beginning and you haven't
done<00:04:23.849> much<00:04:24.360> composition<00:04:25.110> before<00:04:25.490> we'll<00:04:26.490> start

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
done much composition before we'll start

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.790 
done much composition before we'll start
off<00:04:26.970> with<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.300> simplest<00:04:27.660> way<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.050> composition

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
off with the simplest way of composition

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.659 
off with the simplest way of composition
which<00:04:29.099> is<00:04:30.860> start<00:04:31.860> with<00:04:31.979> a<00:04:32.039> simple<00:04:32.430> chord

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
which is start with a simple chord

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:41.069 
which is start with a simple chord
progression

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:41.079 

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:47.999 

now<00:04:42.079> all<00:04:42.259> our<00:04:42.289> gangs<00:04:42.709> are<00:04:43.069> playing<00:04:43.459> for<00:04:43.759> cause

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.619
