to<00:00:45.420> speculate<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.410> don't<00:00:46.680> kind

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to speculate on it because I don't kind

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
to speculate on it because I don't kind
of<00:00:47.039> live<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.030> no<00:00:48.180> idea<00:00:48.480> what's

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
have no concept of it so uh that was

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.200 
have no concept of it so uh that was
that<00:05:26.860> was<00:05:26.920> interesting<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:27.640> it<00:05:27.880> may<00:05:28.060> have

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
that was interesting and it may have

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.640 
that was interesting and it may have
just<00:05:28.240> been<00:05:28.420> a<00:05:28.540> random<00:05:28.780> troll<00:05:29.140> but<00:05:29.380> this<00:05:29.500> was

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
just been a random troll but this was

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.640 
just been a random troll but this was
this<00:05:29.950> was<00:05:30.010> pre<00:05:30.460> trolling<00:05:30.970> pretty<00:05:31.270> much<00:05:31.510> I<00:05:32.080> mean

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
this was pre trolling pretty much I mean

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.360 
this was pre trolling pretty much I mean
it<00:05:32.830> existed<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:34.270> wasn't<00:05:34.830> was<00:05:35.830> he<00:05:35.860> super

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
it existed but it wasn't was he super

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.870 
it existed but it wasn't was he super
common<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:38.340> really<00:05:39.340> think<00:05:39.490> they<00:05:39.670> took<00:05:39.850> that

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
common and I really think they took that

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.370 
common and I really think they took that
into<00:05:40.150> consideration<00:05:40.240> when<00:05:41.020> they<00:05:41.140> were<00:05:41.230> doing

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
into consideration when they were doing

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.350 
into consideration when they were doing
these<00:05:41.530> renovations<00:05:41.830> because<00:05:42.280> they<00:05:42.940> started

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
these renovations because they started

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.360 
these renovations because they started
it<00:05:43.420> in<00:05:43.510> him<00:05:43.630> I<00:05:43.750> think<00:05:44.110> 2008<00:05:44.860> they<00:05:45.040> started

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
it in him I think 2008 they started

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.530 
it in him I think 2008 they started
doing<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.670> renovations<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.390> they're

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
don't live there but it seems to me like

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.150 
don't live there but it seems to me like
they've<00:07:10.270> probably<00:07:10.540> they've<00:07:11.500> taken<00:07:11.530> something

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
they've probably they've taken something

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.300 
they've probably they've taken something
away<00:07:12.370> from<00:07:12.490> us<00:07:13.470> but<00:07:14.470> it's<00:07:14.560> kind<00:07:14.740> of<00:07:14.770> it's<00:07:15.010> time

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
away from us but it's kind of it's time

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.340 
away from us but it's kind of it's time
that<00:07:15.340> some<00:07:15.700> of<00:07:15.790> these<00:07:15.850> big<00:07:16.090> name<00:07:16.270> spots<00:07:16.570> die

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350 
that some of these big name spots die

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.409 
that some of these big name spots die
off<00:07:17.560> and<00:07:17.680> it<00:07:17.860> sucks<00:07:18.070> to<00:07:18.130> see<00:07:18.450> but<00:07:19.450> it<00:07:19.810> you<00:07:20.680> need

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
off and it sucks to see but it you need

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.840 
off and it sucks to see but it you need
death<00:07:22.419> so<00:07:22.840> there<00:07:23.080> can<00:07:23.200> be<00:07:23.250> regeneration<00:07:24.250> from

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:24.850 
death so there can be regeneration from

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.180 
death so there can be regeneration from
that<00:07:25.090> death<00:07:25.360> and<00:07:25.600> that's<00:07:26.230> that's<00:07:26.650> why<00:07:26.919> I<00:07:26.950> like

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190 
that death and that's that's why I like

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.310 
that death and that's that's why I like
it<00:07:27.520> when<00:07:27.669> skateboarding<00:07:28.240> dies<00:07:28.390> because<00:07:28.660> it<00:07:28.900> it
