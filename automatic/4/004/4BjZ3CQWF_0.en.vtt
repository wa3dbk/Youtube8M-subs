didn't know what that process was going
to<00:01:01.790> look<00:01:01.910> like<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.720> know<00:01:02.840> that's<00:01:03.020> what<00:01:03.199> a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
to look like you know that's what a

made<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.360> decision<00:01:14.810> several<00:01:15.140> years<00:01:15.350> ago<00:01:15.590> to

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
made the decision several years ago to

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.750 
made the decision several years ago to

go directly from na I to Division one

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.670 
go directly from na I to Division one
even<00:01:19.760> he<00:01:19.909> didn't<00:01:20.180> envision<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.990> success<00:01:21.650> that

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
even he didn't envision the success that

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.560 
even he didn't envision the success that
we<00:01:21.920> would<00:01:22.070> have<00:01:22.250> by<00:01:22.670> now<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.060> know<00:01:23.120> he's<00:01:23.360> so

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
we would have by now and I know he's so
