00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
these treatments and they can usually be

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.690 
these treatments and they can usually be
better<00:01:54.020> within<00:01:54.290> hours<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> day<00:01:55.220> or<00:01:55.520> two

treatment but that's not very common
these<00:02:00.560> therapies<00:02:01.159> I<00:02:01.340> believe<00:02:01.820> will<00:02:02.000> be<00:02:02.119> the

these therapies I believe will be the
