I<00:01:32.210> think<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:33.070> at<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.100> point<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.760> part<00:01:34.940> will

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
I think that at this point the part will

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.340 
I think that at this point the part will
automatically<00:01:35.540> be<00:01:35.630> transferred<00:01:35.900> from<00:01:36.260> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
automatically be transferred from the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.540 
automatically be transferred from the
