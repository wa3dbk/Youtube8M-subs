your kitchen fan and then you can go
ahead<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.299> add<00:01:49.479> in<00:01:49.689> your<00:01:49.869> vanilla<00:01:50.020> extract<00:01:54.539> do

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
ahead and add in your vanilla extract do

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.840 
ahead and add in your vanilla extract do
not<00:01:55.750> leave<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.740> pan<00:01:56.979> by<00:01:57.220> itself<00:01:57.549> at<00:01:57.729> this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
not leave the pan by itself at this

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.130 
not leave the pan by itself at this
point<00:01:58.119> because<00:01:58.210> they<00:01:58.420> cook<00:01:58.689> up<00:01:58.840> really

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
point because they cook up really

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.690 
point because they cook up really
quickly<00:01:59.470> you're<00:01:59.770> essentially<00:02:00.280> just<00:02:00.490> kind<00:02:00.640> of

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
quickly you're essentially just kind of

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.179 
quickly you're essentially just kind of
boiling<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.659> sugar<00:02:01.689> from<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.560> maple<00:02:02.860> syrup<00:02:03.100> a

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
boiling the sugar from the maple syrup a

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.059 
boiling the sugar from the maple syrup a
little<00:02:03.340> bit<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:03.819> will<00:02:04.090> harden<00:02:04.450> after<00:02:04.600> and

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
little bit so it will harden after and

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.859 
little bit so it will harden after and
then<00:02:06.069> turn<00:02:06.460> off<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.610> heat<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:07.090> pop<00:02:07.539> them<00:02:07.720> off

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
then turn off the heat and pop them off

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.660 
then turn off the heat and pop them off
the<00:02:08.170> off<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.769> heat<00:02:08.950> when<00:02:08.979> they're<00:02:09.250> done<00:02:09.399> like

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
the off the heat when they're done like

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.160 
the off the heat when they're done like
I<00:02:09.700> said<00:02:09.910> only<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.179> couple<00:02:10.420> minutes<00:02:10.599> on<00:02:10.929> there

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
I said only a couple minutes on there

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.140 
I said only a couple minutes on there
will<00:02:11.380> do<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.799> then<00:02:12.220> I'm<00:02:12.340> gonna<00:02:12.430> transfer<00:02:12.819> them

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
will do and then I'm gonna transfer them

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.440 
will do and then I'm gonna transfer them
onto<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.690> parchment-lined<00:02:14.440> baking<00:02:14.890> pan<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.910> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
onto a parchment-lined baking pan and I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.180 
onto a parchment-lined baking pan and I
use<00:02:16.599> parchment<00:02:16.840> paper<00:02:17.200> because<00:02:17.709> they<00:02:18.040> will

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
use parchment paper because they will

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.400 
use parchment paper because they will
probably<00:02:18.519> stick<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> pan<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.290> will

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
probably stick to the pan and it will

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.410 
probably stick to the pan and it will
just<00:02:20.530> be<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.680> hot<00:02:20.920> mess<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:22.090> makes<00:02:22.299> it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
just be a hot mess so this makes it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.449 
just be a hot mess so this makes it
really<00:02:22.599> easy<00:02:22.690> for<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.319> candied<00:02:23.980> pecans<00:02:24.370> to

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
really easy for the candied pecans to

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:41.100 
really easy for the candied pecans to
cool<00:02:24.760> off<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.120> not<00:02:25.420> stick<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.959> anything

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.540 

after<00:02:42.110> about<00:02:42.260> five<00:02:42.500> minutes<00:02:42.530> or<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.040> there

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
after about five minutes or so there

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.010 
after about five minutes or so there
should<00:02:43.820> probably<00:02:43.850> be<00:02:44.150> all<00:02:44.300> cools<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.900> go

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
should probably be all cools you can go

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.110 
should probably be all cools you can go
ahead<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.230> transfer<00:02:45.890> them<00:02:46.040> into<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.640> little

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
ahead and transfer them into a little

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.480 
ahead and transfer them into a little
jar<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.960> store<00:02:48.260> them<00:02:48.470> honestly<00:02:49.250> they

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
jar so you can store them honestly they

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.160 
jar so you can store them honestly they
don't<00:02:49.610> last<00:02:49.880> very<00:02:50.090> long<00:02:50.510> for<00:02:50.780> me<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.960> store

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170
