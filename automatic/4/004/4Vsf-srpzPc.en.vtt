and over ipsec now so that if we rack my
head<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.710> decapitated<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:24.210> more<00:01:24.510> coffee

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:40.840 

after<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.280> hate<00:01:31.400> these<00:01:31.640> windows

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:49.109 

that's<00:01:41.030> incorrect<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.659> it

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.690 

more<00:01:50.119> weight<00:01:50.330> than<00:01:50.479> we<00:01:50.630> had
