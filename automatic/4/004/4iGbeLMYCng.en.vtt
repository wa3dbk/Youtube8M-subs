00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.460
 Hairstyle tutorial is this semi 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.500
 picked up super easy to do that has 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.230
 a semi molded and that is perfect and very 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.960
 rocker for a year-end look and what 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.019
 I'm going to unify this makeup so 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.900
 intense of dark lips I hope that you 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.239
 like and stay brno for it we are going to 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.890
 need a brush to untangle the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.960
 hair a comb to comb the waves 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.540
 some combs the one you want to make a 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.700
 carded 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.670
 a pair of tweezers to hold the most 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.720
 like metal or plastic a 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.290
 hair protector so as not to damage it 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.850
 your favorite lacquer to fix and our 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.550
 favorite plates to do the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.780
 molded those days that we have the hair 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.510
 that we do not know what to do and what has 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.910
 lost its shape let's do this 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.410
 tutorial so easy the first thing that 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.510
 let's make it enough to bleed the hair 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.240
 to avoid problems with the iron to 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.010
 When making the curl we will do the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.590
 first division leaving a line of 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.960
 hair on the back of the neck and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.120
 we will take the rest with the clamp we will 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.340
 Apply the protector and brush it 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.070
 with the comb so that it deepens well in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.920
 the protector in the hair and we will take 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 our iron that is light on 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.070
 at the right temperature I have caught 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.810
 is because it has a shape that gives 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.160
 a lot of possibility when it comes to moving it 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.920
 because we have to make this movement 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.900
 wrist let's take the iron it 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.970
 we put in the root and we go down with 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.030
 a curl movement 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.890
 and reaches a height we turn around 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.290
 for the curl on the other side and we go back to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.810
 turn around like this until the end of 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.860
 hair what we are going to do is like a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.430
 wavy is light type let's make it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.810
 in all our tufts a few strands 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.270
 small not too thick and well 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.040
 so create the curls that the saints 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.750
 we like with modifying especially the 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.700
 movement the more movement we make 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.209
 more curl will be at least very well 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.459
 we are going more or less wavy will be 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.290
 what you have to keep in mind is that 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.560
 depending on the layer you go 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.420
 making the curls or the waves his 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.200
 would it be that start aysÃ©n different type 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.629
 of movement for example 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.890
 if in the first layer more starting not 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.620
 it started turning from left to 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.300
 right in the second layer we'll start 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.069
 from right to left so you do not 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.459
 do a single wave but so you have 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.280
 different volumes and create 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.860
 the much more natural waves we are going to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.080
 donate all the hair 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.120
 small always first applying the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.400
 protector brushing it and letting 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.610
 incite integrate well in the hair and then 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.640
 doing the wave as you see is in simple 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.640
 Wrist movements and the more 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.040
 you move on the plate more wave is going to 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.340
 we're going to do it all over the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.340
 hair 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.640
 you have to be careful behind because 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.030
 it seems that it is an area that always 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.770
 we forget and it shows a lot when it's a 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.280
 auto hairstyle that the back does not 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.870
 is finished in everything it is interesting that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.860
 You are enter a little attention 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.690
 back to leave it well finished 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.670
 the top part I'm not going to do 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.590
 no division in what is the area of 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.020
 that of the crown I will not do any 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.240
 specific division of any 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.950
 hair partition because I'm going to do 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.080
 a semirecogido if you would like 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.020
 you can make a partition now as 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.290
 want to go adapt the waves to 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.190
 that partition I'm going to make a wavy 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.690
 general and what I'm going to do now is 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.570
 before combing what is the part of 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.570
 below I will give a little bit of volume to 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.240
 the roots loading a little to give 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.850
 more light intensity rocker and give 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.770
 apply a bit of lacquer as you see 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.319
 I undo the waves a little bit with the 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.449
 comb curls to not lose the wave 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.590
 and the next step is going to be 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.630
 our journey for it I'm going to take 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.870
 especially in the most front part I'm going 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.360
 to load enough to create a volume 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.060
 interesting in this part because I want 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.220
 that is not flat 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.630
 then create the volume that you want 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.730
 you apply some fixed lacquer 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.190
 this is to taste as you like it 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.840
 you want can not do it I like 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.540
 have volume in this area and on 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.570
 all in a hairstyle that your little group more 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.870
 rocker and now you look for the form 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.460
 that you like more to pick it up either 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.830
 I 'm doing it as being 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.230
 just a small lock and 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.090
 holding the back or if 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.750
 would you like to make some braid 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.950
 or simply because twisting the hair 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.480
 I'm going to do it a little more 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.370
 light because what I want is that it 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.570
 center especially on the light wavy 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.570
 of the whole hairstyle 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.740
 once we have finished only 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.020
 we have to give the last little ones 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.820
 retouching because the hairs these as the 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.300
 they call the grandparents having them well 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.800
 controlled fix it well give the touch 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.630
 what do you want if you want to give a touch 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.640
 little more than glitter and is now ready 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.340
 this is the final finish as you see it is a 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.200
 sycophantic super light and very natural that 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.410
 It gives a very rocky touch and now 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.760
 let's give it the touch of makeup and 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.230
 this is the end this is what has 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.610
 finished I hope you liked it 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.680
