whatever jump you doing rod should be

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.349 
whatever jump you doing rod should be
easily<00:00:15.800> comfortable<00:00:16.309> with<00:00:16.460> doing<00:00:16.730> it<00:00:16.789> a<00:00:17.000> solid

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
easily comfortable with doing it a solid

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.859 
easily comfortable with doing it a solid
backflip<00:00:17.840> on<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:18.199> and<00:00:18.580> a<00:00:19.580> solid<00:00:19.910> 360<00:00:20.390> on<00:00:20.539> it<00:00:20.690> and

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
backflip on it and a solid 360 on it and

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.599 
backflip on it and a solid 360 on it and
I<00:00:21.199> would<00:00:21.410> say<00:00:21.529> it's<00:00:21.680> easier<00:00:22.010> to<00:00:22.100> over<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.369> bigger

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
I would say it's easier to over a bigger

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.730 
I would say it's easier to over a bigger
jump<00:00:22.880> it<00:00:23.210> might<00:00:23.390> be<00:00:23.539> scarier<00:00:23.930> but<00:00:24.199> probably

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
jump it might be scarier but probably

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.890 
jump it might be scarier but probably
easier<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.220> way<00:00:25.310> I<00:00:25.340> teach<00:00:25.520> people<00:00:25.970> when<00:00:26.840> I

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
easier the way I teach people when I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.359 
easier the way I teach people when I
come<00:00:27.230> up<00:00:27.410> to<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:27.560> lip<00:00:27.800> and<00:00:27.980> think<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.340> I

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
come up to the lip and think of it I

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.769 
come up to the lip and think of it I
think<00:00:28.789> to<00:00:28.880> come<00:00:29.029> off<00:00:29.180> with<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.420> straight

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
think to come off with a straight

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.139 
think to come off with a straight
backflip<00:00:30.320> really<00:00:30.830> slow<00:00:31.099> a<00:00:31.460> lot<00:00:31.849> of<00:00:31.970> people

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
backflip really slow a lot of people

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.849 
backflip really slow a lot of people
when<00:00:32.269> they<00:00:32.300> learn<00:00:32.509> this<00:00:32.689> trick<00:00:32.899> they<00:00:33.109> do<00:00:33.829> a

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 
when they learn this trick they do a

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.619 
when they learn this trick they do a
perfect<00:00:34.280> 360<00:00:34.639> back<00:00:34.789> foot<00:00:35.030> but<00:00:35.210> then<00:00:35.329> they<00:00:35.449> land

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
perfect 360 back foot but then they land

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.569 
perfect 360 back foot but then they land
on<00:00:35.749> their<00:00:35.870> back<00:00:36.019> so<00:00:36.920> what<00:00:37.039> I<00:00:37.069> like<00:00:37.309> to<00:00:37.399> tell

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
on their back so what I like to tell

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.369 
on their back so what I like to tell
people<00:00:37.609> first<00:00:38.030> off<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:38.449> don't<00:00:38.899> be<00:00:39.019> scared<00:00:39.050> to

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
people first off is don't be scared to

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.639 
people first off is don't be scared to
flip<00:00:39.620> really<00:00:40.129> really<00:00:40.429> slow<00:00:40.639> as<00:00:41.260> soon<00:00:42.260> as<00:00:42.440> I

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
flip really really slow as soon as I

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.410 
flip really really slow as soon as I
leave<00:00:42.889> the<00:00:43.039> lip<00:00:43.190> my<00:00:43.370> back<00:00:43.549> tire<00:00:43.850> leaves<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.239> lip

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
leave the lip my back tire leaves a lip

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.319 
leave the lip my back tire leaves a lip
on<00:00:44.659> a<00:00:44.690> straight<00:00:45.229> flip<00:00:45.609> that's<00:00:46.609> one-eyed<00:00:47.030> cork

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
on a straight flip that's one-eyed cork

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.209 
on a straight flip that's one-eyed cork
and<00:00:47.510> look<00:00:47.600> over<00:00:47.719> my<00:00:47.929> shoulder<00:00:48.109> push<00:00:48.829> my<00:00:48.979> arms

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
and look over my shoulder push my arms

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.239 
and look over my shoulder push my arms
out<00:00:49.339> and<00:00:49.399> arch<00:00:50.229> get<00:00:51.229> the<00:00:51.350> Bott<00:00:51.559> bike<00:00:51.920> pinned

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
out and arch get the Bott bike pinned

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.160 
out and arch get the Bott bike pinned
out<00:00:52.459> I<00:00:52.729> think<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.269> easiest<00:00:53.659> way<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.929> learn

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
out I think the easiest way to learn

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.779 
out I think the easiest way to learn
this<00:00:54.319> is<00:00:54.379> into<00:00:54.739> a<00:00:54.769> foam<00:00:55.039> pit<00:00:55.190> couple<00:00:55.639> people

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
this is into a foam pit couple people

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.299 
this is into a foam pit couple people
have<00:00:55.999> learned<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.479> to<00:00:56.839> do<00:00:57.289> a<00:00:57.319> really<00:00:57.889> slow

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
have learned is to do a really slow

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.910 
have learned is to do a really slow
flair<00:00:58.789> into<00:00:59.209> the<00:00:59.449> foam<00:00:59.629> pit<00:00:59.659> so<00:01:00.589> slow<00:01:00.889> that

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
flair into the foam pit so slow that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.769 
flair into the foam pit so slow that
you're<00:01:01.159> going<00:01:01.279> to<00:01:01.309> land<00:01:01.489> on<00:01:01.639> your<00:01:01.729> back<00:01:01.909> so<00:01:02.690> if

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:02.779 
you're going to land on your back so if

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:05.439 
you're going to land on your back so if
you<00:01:02.869> come<00:01:03.079> off<00:01:03.289> you<00:01:04.159> do<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.489> do<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.030> back<00:01:05.180> flip

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
you come off you do the do the back flip

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.590 
you come off you do the do the back flip
180<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:07.280> should<00:01:07.460> be<00:01:07.579> so<00:01:07.880> slow<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.509> the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
180 you should be so slow that in the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.080 
180 you should be so slow that in the
foam<00:01:08.810> pit<00:01:08.990> do<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.740> full<00:01:10.070> 180<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.520> full<00:01:10.820> player

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
foam pit do a full 180 a full player

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.910 
foam pit do a full 180 a full player
when<00:01:11.719> you're<00:01:11.840> actually<00:01:11.990> landing<00:01:12.590> on<00:01:12.740> your

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
when you're actually landing on your

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.490 
when you're actually landing on your
back<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.579> foam<00:01:13.820> pit<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.299> once<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.320> do

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
back in the foam pit and once you do

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.380 
back in the foam pit and once you do
that<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.710> lot<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.100> times<00:01:16.369> in<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.549> foam<00:01:16.729> pit<00:01:16.759> and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
that a lot of times in the foam pit and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.539 
that a lot of times in the foam pit and
get<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.750> speed<00:01:18.049> down<00:01:18.259> of<00:01:18.469> the<00:01:18.590> flip<00:01:18.859> and<00:01:19.399> know

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
get the speed down of the flip and know

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.980 
get the speed down of the flip and know
that<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.789> want<00:01:19.969> to<00:01:20.060> flip<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:20.270> slow<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:20.750> land

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
that you want to flip that slow to land

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.669 
that you want to flip that slow to land
on<00:01:21.109> your<00:01:21.200> back

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
on your back

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.529 
on your back
as<00:01:22.340> soon<00:01:22.490> as<00:01:22.609> you<00:01:22.700> get<00:01:22.789> landed<00:01:23.119> on<00:01:23.240> your<00:01:23.329> back<00:01:23.509> a

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
as soon as you get landed on your back a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.510 
as soon as you get landed on your back a
couple<00:01:23.810> times<00:01:24.049> all<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.259> flair<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.829> next

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
couple times all that flair the next

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.130 
couple times all that flair the next
thing<00:01:25.670> is<00:01:25.789> easy<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.359> get<00:01:26.479> that<00:01:26.659> motion<00:01:26.840> down

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
thing is easy you get that motion down

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.860 
thing is easy you get that motion down
and<00:01:27.380> then

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
and then

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.300 
and then
you're<00:01:29.870> spinning<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.470> that'll<00:01:31.070> put<00:01:31.159> you

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
you're spinning and that'll put you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.560 
you're spinning and that'll put you
right<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:31.850> if<00:01:31.940> you're<00:01:32.060> gonna<00:01:32.180> land<00:01:32.420> right

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
right in so if you're gonna land right

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.380 
right in so if you're gonna land right
here<00:01:32.690> you're<00:01:33.760> gonna<00:01:34.760> be<00:01:34.940> right<00:01:35.150> in

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
here you're gonna be right in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.910 
here you're gonna be right in
it'll<00:01:35.720> keep<00:01:35.869> your<00:01:35.990> flip<00:01:36.260> straight<00:01:36.619> upside

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
it'll keep your flip straight upside

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.820 
it'll keep your flip straight upside
down<00:01:37.360> when<00:01:38.360> I<00:01:38.390> first<00:01:38.659> learned<00:01:38.840> 360<00:01:39.380> backflips

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
down when I first learned 360 backflips

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.130 
down when I first learned 360 backflips
I<00:01:40.100> lost<00:01:41.000> them<00:01:41.180> after<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.570> while<00:01:41.720> learned<00:01:42.020> them

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
I lost them after a while learned them

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.600 
I lost them after a while learned them
in<00:01:42.229> lost<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.500> they<00:01:42.650> turn<00:01:42.800> into<00:01:42.950> seven<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.400> got

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
in lost and they turn into seven I got

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.880 
in lost and they turn into seven I got
really<00:01:43.790> frustrated<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.200> kind<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.530> do<00:01:45.680> that

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
really frustrated then I kind of do that

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.160 
really frustrated then I kind of do that
in<00:01:46.040> my<00:01:46.159> head<00:01:46.340> now<00:01:46.550> exactly<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:47.600> just<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.899> real

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
in my head now exactly that just a real

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.960 
in my head now exactly that just a real
slow<00:01:48.440> flare<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:48.950> then<00:01:49.100> flipped<00:01:49.369> my<00:01:49.520> head<00:01:49.729> and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
slow flare and then flipped my head and

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.760 
slow flare and then flipped my head and
look<00:01:50.540> for<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.840> landing<00:01:51.110> or<00:01:51.200> bring<00:01:51.530> your<00:01:51.649> bike

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
look for the landing or bring your bike

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.700 
look for the landing or bring your bike
right<00:01:52.040> in<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.369> won't<00:01:52.550> be<00:01:52.670> over<00:01:52.850> rotated<00:01:53.710> it'll

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
right in you won't be over rotated it'll

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.320 
right in you won't be over rotated it'll
be<00:01:54.800> perfect<00:01:55.250> man<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.460> you'll<00:01:55.940> be<00:01:56.090> able<00:01:56.180> to

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
be perfect man and you'll be able to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.570 
be perfect man and you'll be able to
judge<00:01:56.600> whatever<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.440> have<00:01:57.619> 360<00:01:58.100> backflip<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
judge whatever I have 360 backflip the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.730 
judge whatever I have 360 backflip the
mega<00:01:58.790> ramp<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.570> sounds<00:01:59.960> crazy<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.320> still<00:02:00.590> know

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
mega ramp it sounds crazy I still know

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.830 
mega ramp it sounds crazy I still know
how<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:00.860> did<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:02.000> reason<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.630> was

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
how I did it but the reason that I was

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.359 
how I did it but the reason that I was
able<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.110> do<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.380> because<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:03.920> judge<00:02:04.160> the

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
able to do it because I can judge the

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.279 
able to do it because I can judge the
speed<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:04.880> with<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.210> flip<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.990> once<00:02:06.170> I

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
speed of it with the flip so once I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.350 
speed of it with the flip so once I
flipped<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.250> know<00:02:07.310> roughly<00:02:07.880> how<00:02:08.090> fast

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
flipped it but I know roughly how fast

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.300 
flipped it but I know roughly how fast
to<00:02:08.509> go<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.690> do<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.899> three<00:02:09.170> flip<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.649> think<00:02:10.160> about

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
to go to do a three flip I think about

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.770 
to go to do a three flip I think about
that<00:02:10.550> flare<00:02:10.789> thing<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.180> then<00:02:11.269> I<00:02:11.360> do<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.630> and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
that flare thing and then I do it and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.940 
that flare thing and then I do it and
once<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.019> do<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.260> couple<00:02:12.380> times<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:12.830> it's

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
once you do it a couple times then it's

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.920 
once you do it a couple times then it's
just<00:02:13.040> like<00:02:13.250> clockwork<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.750> push

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
just like clockwork you just you push

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.780 
just like clockwork you just you push
the<00:02:15.110> three-foot<00:02:15.560> button<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.100> hopefully

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
the three-foot button and it hopefully

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.420 
the three-foot button and it hopefully
it<00:02:17.090> works<00:02:17.300> out<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:17.870> hopefully<00:02:18.830> some<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.310> your

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
it works out so hopefully some of your

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.740 
it works out so hopefully some of your
more<00:02:19.550> advanced<00:02:19.880> dudes<00:02:20.030> out<00:02:20.150> there<00:02:20.209> can<00:02:20.480> get<00:02:20.630> it

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
more advanced dudes out there can get it

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.120 
more advanced dudes out there can get it
I<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.050> lot<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.470> can<00:02:21.650> I've<00:02:21.920> been

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
I know a lot of you can I've been

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.680 
I know a lot of you can I've been
surprised<00:02:22.519> by<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.730> lot<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.060> kids<00:02:23.239> learning<00:02:23.570> I'm

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
surprised by a lot of kids learning I'm

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.160 
surprised by a lot of kids learning I'm
lately<00:02:23.989> so<00:02:24.230> good<00:02:24.950> luck
