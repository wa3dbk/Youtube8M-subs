that<00:00:56.070> weird<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.850> fact<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.239> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.539> is

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
that weird will in fact it kind of is

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.709 
that weird will in fact it kind of is
but<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.800> overall<00:00:59.390> very<00:01:00.390> very

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
but it's just overall very very

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.090 
but it's just overall very very

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that he was playing and very very

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
that he was playing and very very
