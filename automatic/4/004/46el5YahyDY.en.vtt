00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.830
 It started well today, we'll do it. 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.839
 a creamy coffee recipe I go 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 start mixing my ingredients 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.560
 solid 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.980
 I'll put 90 grams of soluble coffee 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.160
 a cup of cooking sweetener tea 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 and two tablespoons of cocoa 100% 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 pure cocoa powder and I will mix the list 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.380
 with all the ingredients is in the box 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.020
 information here from youtube 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.210
 so you can take it there and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.910
 adipex is a recipe 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.920
 released from the cruise phase already 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.289
 that it takes cocoa and caco movement 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.329
 tolerated but if you are in the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.230
 attack or if you do not want to use the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.329
 is it only remove the cocoa and gives to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.239
 make this recipe as usual 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.210
 Good now that I'm mixed too, I'm going 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.189
 put a tablespoon of aroma of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.860
 chocolate and I'll put half a cup of 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.740
 boiling-point milk tea 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.100
 sew to dissolve all 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.100
 Ingredients 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.659
 I already knew I'm going to hit the mixer. 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.350
 until the mass is very soft and creamy 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350
 come on 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.800
 twenty five minutes later our coffee 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.410
 creamy and stay yes I will show 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.000
 consistency for you this 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.740
 consistency 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.770
 you may notice that the mass does not 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.260
 as sweet as creamy coffee 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.760
 with sugar because they will sing all 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.340
 that creaminess but with which he 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.300
 grow but this form of super right 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.800
 also 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.020
 now just put this mixture in the 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.520
 container and take the freezer and it is 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.980
 this will ensure that it stays 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.410
 creamy and this amount yields more or 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.660
 less 15 servings is not required 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.360
 freeze it will not freeze and keep 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.680
 this consistency and when you go 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.710
 have your coffee 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.910
 just mix hot milk with a spoon 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.100

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.460

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.920
 I have hot skim milk 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.830
 I put only Mexican to achieve 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:34.820
 mix or pick up a tablespoon of honey 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:36.980
 cream and now just mix fashion already 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.300
