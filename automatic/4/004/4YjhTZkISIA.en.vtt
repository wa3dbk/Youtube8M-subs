00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.110 
right now but let's check out the rest
of<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.230> device<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.070> quite<00:00:32.369> thin<00:00:32.850> like

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
of this device so it's quite thin like

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.030 
of this device so it's quite thin like
the<00:00:33.270> first<00:00:33.510> iPad<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.200> already<00:00:34.320> said<00:00:34.620> it

feels really good in your hand so let's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.530 
feels really good in your hand so let's
check<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.580> software<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.360> more

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
check out the software a little bit more

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.380 
check out the software a little bit more
and<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.799> see<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.280> maybe<00:01:17.700> not<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.210> it's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and as you can see or maybe not see it's

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.830 
and as you can see or maybe not see it's
Android<00:01:18.930> quite<00:01:19.860> smoothly<00:01:20.280> running<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.330> here

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
Android quite smoothly running on here

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.560 
Android quite smoothly running on here
so<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.920> only<00:01:23.070> 2.3<00:01:23.549> probably<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.360> won't

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
so we have only 2.3 probably that won't

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.070 
so we have only 2.3 probably that won't
be<00:01:24.720> 4.0<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.830> maybe<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.759> otherwise<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.900> can

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
be 4.0 but maybe them otherwise you can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.620 
be 4.0 but maybe them otherwise you can
see<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.250> menu<00:01:30.119> which<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.600> a

see here we have a menu which is a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
see here we have a menu which is a
little<00:01:31.049> bit<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.960> modified<00:01:33.960> by<00:01:34.229> alcatel<00:01:34.920> but

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
little bit and modified by alcatel but

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.940 
little bit and modified by alcatel but
let's<00:01:35.880> start<00:01:36.299> Angry<00:01:36.720> Birds<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.770> will

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
see how fast a 1 gigahertz processor

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.620 
see how fast a 1 gigahertz processor
with<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> 512<00:01:41.009> megabyte<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:42.090> load<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> game

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
with the 512 megabyte can load the game

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.429 
with the 512 megabyte can load the game
up<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.110> how<00:01:43.920> fast<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.479> takes<00:01:45.899> us<00:01:46.229> around

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.209 
brand new angry birds it takes and quite
a<00:01:52.979> way<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.220> load<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.930> aware<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
a way to load we are aware of that and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.340 
a way to load we are aware of that and
that's<00:01:56.640> probably<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.540> reasons<00:01:57.750> we

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's probably one of the reasons we

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.810 
that's probably one of the reasons we
wouldn't<00:01:58.619> buy<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.799> device<00:01:59.310> even<00:01:59.729> though

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
wouldn't buy this device even though

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.179 
wouldn't buy this device even though
it's<00:02:00.000> cheap<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.710> it's<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.920> made<00:02:02.159> for

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
it's cheap because it's not made for

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.490 
it's cheap because it's not made for
multitasking<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.570> probably<00:02:03.930> only<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
multitasking it's probably only a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
multitasking it's probably only a
browser<00:02:04.950> only<00:02:05.369> device<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.090> let's<00:02:06.299> play

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
browser only device but let's play

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.010 
browser only device but let's play
around<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.539> how<00:02:09.569> good<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
around and then you will see how good it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.660 
around and then you will see how good it
is<00:02:10.110> actually<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> camera<00:02:11.430> now

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
is actually you can see the camera now

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.430 
is actually you can see the camera now
on<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.940> top<00:02:12.120> if<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.390> focus<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
on the top if you focus on that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.770 
on the top if you focus on that
but<00:02:13.590> otherwise<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.690> we

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
but otherwise and so we have one that we

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.690 
but otherwise and so we have one that we
loaded<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.560> course<00:02:16.800> once<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.310> are<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
loaded and of course once you are in the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.030 
loaded and of course once you are in the
game<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.050> bad<00:02:19.290> as<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:19.830> see

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
game it's not that bad as you can see

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.830 
game it's not that bad as you can see
you<00:02:20.070> can<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.610> shoot<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.000> birds<00:02:21.210> around<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
you can just shoot the birds around and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.410 
you can just shoot the birds around and
it<00:02:22.260> works<00:02:22.620> quite<00:02:23.250> well<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:25.460> if<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.820> press<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
it works quite well so if you press the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
it works quite well so if you press the
home<00:02:27.600> button<00:02:28.910> somewhere<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> top<00:02:30.600> you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
home button somewhere on the top you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.310 
home button somewhere on the top you
will<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.420> top<00:02:33.630> also<00:02:34.080> some

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
will see we have on the top also some

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.010 
will see we have on the top also some
software<00:02:34.710> buttons<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:36.240> access<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
software buttons and to access the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.040 
software buttons and to access the
android<00:02:37.290> 2.3<00:02:37.680> hardware<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.780> don't

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
android 2.3 hardware and so you don't

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.750 
android 2.3 hardware and so you don't
really<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.530> look<00:02:40.710> for<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:41.580> those

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
