00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
the ball from a hand to hand so it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.500 
the ball from a hand to hand so it
doesn't<00:01:13.430> always<00:01:13.550> work<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.060> great<00:01:14.180> when<00:01:14.450> you

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
Mobile would incorporate that see right

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.080 
Mobile would incorporate that see right
there<00:01:19.010> you<00:01:19.040> tried<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.370> stiff<00:01:19.580> arm<00:01:19.790> let's<00:01:19.970> see

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
there you tried to stiff arm let's see

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.570 
there you tried to stiff arm let's see
if<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:20.240> can<00:01:20.450> oh<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:22.040> would<00:01:22.160> have<00:01:22.220> stiff<00:01:22.400> arm

if I can oh you would have stiff arm
that<00:01:22.730> guy<00:01:22.880> if<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.090> was<00:01:23.240> still<00:01:23.420> running<00:01:23.740> these

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
that guy if I was still running these

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.080 
that guy if I was still running these
guys<00:01:24.950> do<00:01:25.100> not<00:01:25.220> have<00:01:25.340> half<00:01:25.520> packed<00:01:25.730> I<00:01:25.820> have<00:01:25.910> weak

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
guys do not have half packed I have weak

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.490 
guys do not have half packed I have weak
heat<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.510> this<00:01:26.660> is<00:01:26.750> probably<00:01:27.050> gonna<00:01:27.170> be<00:01:27.320> an

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
heat so this is probably gonna be an

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.430 
heat so this is probably gonna be an
easy<00:01:27.860> run<00:01:28.280> right<00:01:28.490> here<00:01:28.640> let's<00:01:28.850> try<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.440> this

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
easy run right here let's try and this

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.960 
easy run right here let's try and this
the<00:01:30.650> skull<00:01:30.920> move<00:01:31.070> button<00:01:31.310> isn't<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.730> greatest

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
the skull move button isn't the greatest

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.400 
the skull move button isn't the greatest
button<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.540> maybe<00:01:32.720> I'll<00:01:32.870> try<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.200> truck

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
button so maybe I'll try and truck

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.050 
button so maybe I'll try and truck
somebody<00:01:33.800> on<00:01:33.920> this<00:01:34.040> next<00:01:34.400> drive<00:01:34.610> down<00:01:34.820> here

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
somebody on this next drive down here

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.640 
somebody on this next drive down here
yeah<00:01:35.240> I'm<00:01:35.420> gonna<00:01:35.540> go<00:01:35.660> for<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.930> truck<00:01:36.170> move

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650
