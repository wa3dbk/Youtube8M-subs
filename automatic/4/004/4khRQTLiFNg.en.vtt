00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
the setup I recommend I'm going to do a

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.340 
the setup I recommend I'm going to do a
specific<00:03:52.370> video<00:03:52.760> on<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.690> microphone<00:03:54.110> I'm

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
specific video on the microphone I'm

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.570 
specific video on the microphone I'm
actually<00:03:54.500> using<00:03:54.709> one<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.070> record<00:03:55.370> my<00:03:55.459> voice

with<00:03:55.820> now<00:03:56.200> I'm<00:03:57.200> going<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.440> do<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.530> specific

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
with now I'm going to do a specific

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.540 
with now I'm going to do a specific
video<00:03:58.130> on<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.489> audio<00:03:58.730> interface<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.650> then<00:04:00.980> we

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
video on the audio interface and then we

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.060 
video on the audio interface and then we
will<00:04:01.670> start<00:04:01.940> building<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.900> track<00:04:03.140> up<00:04:03.380> I'm

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
will start building the track up I'm

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.199 
will start building the track up I'm
going<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.280> do<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.489> all<00:04:04.610> on<00:04:04.790> my<00:04:04.820> own

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
going to do it all on my own

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.380 
going to do it all on my own
so<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:06.260> know<00:04:06.380> it's<00:04:06.590> all<00:04:07.120> perfectly<00:04:08.120> doable

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
so you know it's all perfectly doable

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.690 
so you know it's all perfectly doable
and<00:04:08.930> this<00:04:09.620> can<00:04:09.770> obviously<00:04:09.890> be<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.190> lot<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.430> trial

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
and this can obviously be a lot of trial

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.190 
and this can obviously be a lot of trial
and<00:04:10.760> there<00:04:10.940> on<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.570> don't<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:11.959> set

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
and there on it you don't just set

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.190 
and there on it you don't just set
microphone<00:04:12.739> in<00:04:12.860> one<00:04:13.040> place<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.489> away<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.700> go

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
microphone in one place and away you go

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.289 
microphone in one place and away you go
so<00:04:15.200> hopefully<00:04:15.680> I'll<00:04:16.130> be<00:04:16.160> passing<00:04:16.669> on<00:04:16.790> as<00:04:17.090> many

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
so hopefully I'll be passing on as many

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.000 
so hopefully I'll be passing on as many
tips<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.660> tricks<00:04:17.870> as<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.109> know<00:04:18.169> to<00:04:18.620> try<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.830> help

and<00:04:57.150> myself<00:04:57.479> spent<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.840> little<00:04:58.169> bit<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.379> time

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
and myself spent a little bit of time

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.040 
and myself spent a little bit of time
getting<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.860> levels<00:04:59.220> right<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:00.870> did<00:05:01.020> a

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
getting the levels right and so we did a

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.749 
getting the levels right and so we did a
few<00:05:01.110> little<00:05:01.349> test<00:05:01.620> takes<00:05:01.889> have<00:05:02.250> listened<00:05:02.550> back

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
few little test takes have listened back

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.390 
few little test takes have listened back
just<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.270> levels<00:05:03.629> just<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.930> frequencies<00:05:04.440> and

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
just it levels just the frequencies and

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.219 
just it levels just the frequencies and
then<00:05:05.550> away<00:05:05.729> we<00:05:05.819> went<00:05:05.940> in<00:05:06.509> that<00:05:06.569> recording<00:05:07.139> that

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
then away we went in that recording that

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.110 
then away we went in that recording that
aren't<00:05:07.500> any<00:05:07.650> vocals<00:05:08.039> we<00:05:08.250> only<00:05:08.580> had<00:05:08.819> floor

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
aren't any vocals we only had floor

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.559 
aren't any vocals we only had floor
monitors<00:05:09.539> for<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:09.870> so<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:11.550> vocal<00:05:12.000> fold<00:05:12.360> back

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
monitors for that so the vocal fold back

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.600 
monitors for that so the vocal fold back
was<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.810> little<00:05:13.139> bit<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.979> know<00:05:14.099> didn't<00:05:14.370> cut

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
through in the recording enough so we

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.430 
through in the recording enough so we
chose<00:05:17.129> not<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.340> put<00:05:17.490> them<00:05:17.639> up<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:19.080> there<00:05:19.229> you<00:05:19.319> go

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440
