00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 sweet tooth 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.250
 Honda Salo three of the aliens et yesterday morning fast u3 beach 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.250
 it is not coincidental that he did not happen anyway 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.859
 according to the association 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.949
 we're exactly a week away from the release of Halo Reach that it's without 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.230
 Doubts some say the most important meeting 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.689
 ex-boxer calculating game this year 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.130
 but if you like it or not always must recognize 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580
 I think more important this year by home wins 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.870
 For 3 60 the sea has Microsoft here in Hamburg 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.600
 Once again all the costs and efforts spared a lacy feather of builds 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 and enter into that and animated menus there 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.660
 Wirthmann Halo Reach can test two days here in Hamburg two days 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.390
 through first m 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.910
 and of course or at the start 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.950
 Personally, I am very excited 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.500
 I am 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.700
 nervous 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.140
 but excited 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.490
 so in Vienna 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.190
 in Poland and the Czech Republic from the very first common I believe that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.940
 we are pretty good 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.940
 from the 11 she stays calm 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.170
 Jung and then it was time 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.330
 with a beating heart and Pierre IXIC was announced until very late the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.240
 Logic ste 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.080
 unfortunately will 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.870
 the opponents of not directly from the bully before deductions percent looked at the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.400
 Manufacturer always a bit weird if you do that 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.570
 even if we are not allowed to show you every ethnic scene here 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.200
 "Let me assure you theoretically is one 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.430
 more than for the GEA conclusion of a trailblazing shooter series 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.360
 the first mission days still relatively moderate but at the latest from level 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.630
 3 Put the creators right on Paul Wolff's big battles like that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 Minutes around the ears 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.200
 to clarify the drama the lyrics intentionally all the time to approx 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.120
 absolutely balanced 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 I definitely needed my break 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.930
 the models 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.930
 Cornelsen makes 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.260
 Corner of the South Seas 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.490
 Merck gets you a short break 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.110
 I played Hellmich for a few hours at a time 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.209
 my first impression around 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.429
 Halo's precipitation that's what you always say but ever again 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.799
 I believe that Halo Reach has exactly the same strengths as the others 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.999
 previous Hello parts but maybe they are the same because of us 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.910
 the same weaknesses in me noticed 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.030
 that Italy still has some small dropouts so generally 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.749
 si very good, of course, I have heroically made only girls 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:27.909
 Play still normal 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.790
 um and there makes the vivid pressure so I have some firefighting me 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.169
 I also have a few stops 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.109
 Parmalat was 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.829
 but I have also seen that sometimes you have opponents over 60 70 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.749
 Meter can easily connect and the motionless stand until you drop 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.590
 that's the way things are going since Hello Heinz Niehues and all over 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.679
 what I also extreme he much of mine 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.150
 one of my teammates what's going on UniChem 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.789
 she has to leave again and does not drive 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.420
 not always mostly 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.010
 but sometimes also suffering between two rocks between two trees 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.320
 while eat com 8 million Rand's popular and hunters and then the car 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.410
 only 4 4 took victory and immediately in the air 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.259
 Eat things 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.409
 Tip I do not swim now but it also leaves me what he does not like 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.760
 wanted that is now pretty easy is better 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.160
 on the positive side 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
 yes it is just the bright atmosphere looks cool 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.560
 That's why I like it very much so when it really starts and then comes 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.929
 this the middle track 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.099
 and who this then 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.700
 Atmosphere Bauhof the writing shows that it is now right about the sausage 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.139
 is that the two already very good so that's it 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.790
 that's fun, percent 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.969
 like I said Hey you so I find horny 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.619
 It's also a bit of a fixie for four-legged play not always watching 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.619
 How long can I continue playing until the house is thrown out? 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.129
 right back tactics 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.719
 when gambling on headphones I also noticed that is an old one 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.629
 regrettably condemn sorry again this time 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.649
 the German synchro Zwiesel 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.999
 I know now I break percent I am he sells Rhein-Kreis Neuss 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:59.399
 matching this he clicks is Kassenwart Kegelklubs sec 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.649
 so if you're thinking about or not getting Alu 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.649
 Well does not necessarily have the German version of his 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:08.929
 so they were 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.929
 my first steps on the i 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.799
 Stauch 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.029
 Charges for Chur 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.029
 that were not a first final stormed 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.110
 Not message 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.500
 I have to say that unlike many other colleagues, I understand that now 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.449
 not as a medium so Microsoft has because the mothers Weitefeld here on 2 on 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.969
 have one of us 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.860
 to play the whole game 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.779
 You have a picture you can take 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:42.979
 but not so cool for that 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.099
 Triegel so that it is always possible because the test atmosphere was relaxed 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.009
 quiet either Broder at home 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.830
 Anyone who is respectful is not kidding Zermatt's first impression 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.800
 whoever he says I am just 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 League moderate fanboy 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.249
 make the fish 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.860
 that behind the EHC is simply very good, of course, then also becomes political 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.020
 Hey no you've got started with their precious rains 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.199
 frd with not too bad I've got too I have to admit anything 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.720
 really spectacular new discovered so that can fly with space 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.710
 who might have been surprised if he does not care like months ago 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.700
 showed it to be a minimal one such thing with a surprise i believe 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:21.479
 from that 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.999
 the two Hellmich it is not so many 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:27.639
 So who really has to redefine a mixture of Ghost has with 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.500
 Loggia Suggestions op is just Hello is Halo 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.969
 Halo Reach is, I think, no more and no less than a field said Pofalla 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.249
 Bombastic conclusion of a big series of games 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:40.999
 Personally, it's not enough for me, I expected more », that's what I like 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.369
 not »Angermuende may have Volkskrant» from 11 July Milli 

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:47.220
 more mode multiplayer mode 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.220
 Never before have so many games come out of the 2 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:54.189
 Vizeammann associations Franzke to nine percent more soda going on like that 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:57.189
 Sechseläuten what, yes you know that even as an old Haider expert 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:03.129
 he alone is the competent answer from Undercover for something another year 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.270
 Bayer wants to be some fan of the mid-flow mode whose flames played fast 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.120
 a St 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.120
 So, in principle, June knows everything the same way 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.099
 the percent 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.119
 Hardcore fans might remember never looking for more 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.299
 but personally I am very satisfied I find what the senses had horny 

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:21.719
 that's great fun 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.800
 extremely bombastic so I have to play on the role all the time 

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:28.949
 slammed and what was in the ears the explosion had already played fifth 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.579
 I have never seen any effects and stuff blown up in the air 

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:32.180
 are 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.819
 and it bangs around 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:35.379
 so that would have been that 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.459
 groaning I'm horny again to see if I'm already one of the TVA 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:42.580
 wi-version scrounge and take in the house can hardly imagine what 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.240
 I do not think so 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.580
 if we spend more time with Halo Reach than the Valais communities 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.240
 first of all a weighty one 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.349
 follows to the next 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.520
 run around until he's wasted at the BLE's garbage 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.240
 because feud me and say 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.649
 Until next time 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:02.649
 here Bayer and ours 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:07.189
 what is yours 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:16.049
 who has
