00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
blue on my orange now I that was a

stickers<00:00:33.989> once<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.100> got<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.489> printed<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.270> I

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
stickers once I got this printed out I

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.959 
stickers once I got this printed out I
noticed<00:00:36.630> something<00:00:37.050> else<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.649> really

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
noticed something else that I really

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.340 
noticed something else that I really
think<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> major<00:00:39.450> negative<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.230> these

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
think is a major negative for these

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.600 
think is a major negative for these
stickers<00:00:40.620> there's<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.640> rubix<00:00:42.200> logo<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.610> every

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
stickers there's a rubix logo in every

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.520 
stickers there's a rubix logo in every
corner<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.629> you're<00:00:45.780> gonna<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:46.050> Rubik

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
corner so you're gonna have Rubik

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
written on every side of your picture on

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
every side of your cube I really did not

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.709 
every side of your cube I really did not
want<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> did<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:54.300> hopefully

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 
anyway is the fact that they put the

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.729 
anyway is the fact that they put the
rubix<00:06:16.639> logo<00:06:16.969> and<00:06:17.179> every<00:06:17.360> one<00:06:17.599> so<00:06:18.349> it<00:06:18.469> really
