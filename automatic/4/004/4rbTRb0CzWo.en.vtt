it<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.360> isn't<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:46.219> there<00:00:47.219> is

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
it if this isn't it's like that there is

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.709 
it if this isn't it's like that there is
then<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.079> need<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> tiny<00:00:49.770> rubber<00:00:50.309> band<00:00:50.719> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
then you need a tiny rubber band that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.959 
then you need a tiny rubber band that
from<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.170> paratrooper<00:00:52.980> guy<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> then

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
from this paratrooper guy and then

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.740 
from this paratrooper guy and then
there's<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.270> t-shaped<00:00:58.109> pipe<00:00:58.710> piece<00:00:59.750> it's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
there's the t-shaped pipe piece it's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.110 
there's the t-shaped pipe piece it's
like<00:01:01.020> has<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> small<00:01:01.890> hole<00:01:02.100> through<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so first of all you get your two pieces

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.640 
so first of all you get your two pieces
that<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> introduce<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:13.470> get

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that I introduce to you you get you get

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.859 
that I introduce to you you get you get
either<00:01:14.100> both<00:01:14.460> sides<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
either both sides you put it on top of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.850 
either both sides you put it on top of
each<00:01:15.990> other<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.590> opposite<00:01:17.220> way<00:01:17.810> then<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.590> get

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
each other the opposite way then you get

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
each other the opposite way then you get
the<00:01:21.200> droid<00:01:22.200> army<00:01:22.500> make<00:01:23.340> sure<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> beefy

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the droid army make sure that the beefy

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.980 
the droid army make sure that the beefy
side<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.610> clipped<00:01:26.610> onto<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:28.530> lower<00:01:29.220> side

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
side is clipped onto this lower side

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.700 
side is clipped onto this lower side
then<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:31.890> both<00:01:32.100> sides<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
then do that with both sides then you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
then do that with both sides then you
get<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> t-shaped<00:01:35.700> object<00:01:36.420> once<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
get the t-shaped object once you get the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.490 
get the t-shaped object once you get the
teeth<00:01:37.770> shaped<00:01:38.189> object<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:40.290> both

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
teeth shaped object take it on to both

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.300 
teeth shaped object take it on to both
droid<00:01:40.920> armies<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:43.310> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
droid armies so it's like this and you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.830 
droid armies so it's like this and you
get<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:45.030> piece<00:01:46.280> other<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.880> other<00:01:47.909> joint<00:01:48.540> arm

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
get this piece other the other joint arm

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.969 
get this piece other the other joint arm
make<00:01:49.799> sure<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.460> beefing<00:01:50.970> bit<00:01:51.210> is

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
make sure that the beefing bit is

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.270 
make sure that the beefing bit is
clamped<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> handle<00:01:54.470> then<00:01:55.470> it's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
clamped on to the handle then it's

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.819 
clamped on to the handle then it's
simple<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.030> push<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.719> over<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.560> then

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
simple you just push this over and then

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.430 
simple you just push this over and then
push<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.369> over<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.090> then

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
push this over and then

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.330 
push this over and then
who<00:02:02.400> get<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.910> rubber<00:02:03.120> band<00:02:04.460> put<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.580> over<00:02:07.340> so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
who get the rubber band put it over so

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.310 
who get the rubber band put it over so
then<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:12.780> looks<00:02:12.990> like<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
then it's like this it looks like that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.730 
then it's like this it looks like that
now<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.220> do<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.710> your

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
now now it can do this then you get your

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.340 
now now it can do this then you get your
stud<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.850> put<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.540> between<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.140> rubber

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
stud and put it in between the rubber

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.070 
stud and put it in between the rubber
band<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.010> now<00:02:20.790> you're<00:02:21.270> just<00:02:21.480> ready<00:02:21.810> to

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
band and now you're just ready to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.050 
band and now you're just ready to
catapult<00:02:22.470> away<00:02:23.540> thanks<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.690> watching
