going to show you how to do that let's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.569 
going to show you how to do that let's
start<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.289> shifter<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
start with this shifter this is the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.310 
start with this shifter this is the
right<00:00:32.730> shifter<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.170> got<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
right shifter and it's actually got a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
right shifter and it's actually got a
cable<00:00:34.649> installed<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.579> there<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.910> can't<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
cable installed in there and I can't you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.970 
cable installed in there and I can't you
know<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> cut<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.960> off<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.590> can't<00:00:37.860> get

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
know I cut it off here but I can't get

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.650 
know I cut it off here but I can't get
out<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.280> other<00:00:38.550> side<00:00:38.969> because<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> actually

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
out the other side because it's actually

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.340 
out the other side because it's actually
shifted<00:00:40.079> around<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.760> can't<00:00:42.090> shift<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
shifted around and I can't shift down to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.510 
shifted around and I can't shift down to
where<00:00:43.500> it'll<00:00:43.770> come<00:00:43.950> around<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.250> where<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.370> get

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
where it'll come around to where I get

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.819 
where it'll come around to where I get
the<00:00:44.610> cable<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.379> I'm<00:00:46.379> gonna<00:00:46.469> start<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.680> this

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the cable out so I'm gonna start on this

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.369 
the cable out so I'm gonna start on this
one<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.430> first<00:00:47.640> thing<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.379> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
one the first thing you want to do and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.100 
one the first thing you want to do and
you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.700> bike<00:00:51.110> but

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you can actually do this on the bike but

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.459 
you can actually do this on the bike but
one<00:00:52.199> thing<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.879> careful<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
one thing you want to be careful of is

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.369 
one thing you want to be careful of is
not<00:00:55.469> getting<00:00:55.649> solvent<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.820> hood<00:00:57.379> these

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
not getting solvent on the hood these

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.319 
not getting solvent on the hood these
are<00:00:58.559> off<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> bike<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.550> easier

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
are off the bike so it's actually easier

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.340 
are off the bike so it's actually easier
so<00:01:01.129> what<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:03.260> remove<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.760> hood

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
so what I want to do is remove the hood

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.270 
so what I want to do is remove the hood
from<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.650> shifter<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.520> just

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
from the shifter and that way I can just

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.660 
from the shifter and that way I can just
keep<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.460> nice<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.640> clean<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:19.250> there<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
keep it nice and clean here there and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.149 
keep it nice and clean here there and
when<00:01:21.479> you've<00:01:21.630> got<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.930> hood<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.950> ahead

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
when you've got the hood off go ahead

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.179 
when you've got the hood off go ahead
and<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> aside<00:01:24.680> now<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> next<00:01:25.979> part<00:01:26.159> is

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and put it aside now the next part is

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340 
and put it aside now the next part is
going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.430> messy<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.780> Tupperware

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
going to be messy so I have a Tupperware

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.560 
going to be messy so I have a Tupperware
container<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:29.329> I'm<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> use<00:01:31.549> wd-40<00:01:32.570> as

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
container here I'm going to use wd-40 as

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.690 
container here I'm going to use wd-40 as
solvent<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.439> happens<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.040> there's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
solvent because what happens is there's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.910 
solvent because what happens is there's
these<00:01:36.150> little<00:01:36.479> balls<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.500> there's<00:01:37.619> little

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
these little balls and there's little

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.999 
these little balls and there's little
fingers<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.280> kind<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.670> catch<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> gears<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
fingers that kind of catch the gears and

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.929 
fingers that kind of catch the gears and
the<00:01:41.009> grease<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.820> gets<00:01:42.030> old<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
the grease and there gets old and it the

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.069 
the grease and there gets old and it the
don't<00:01:44.939> move<00:01:45.149> anymore<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.810> don't<00:01:45.840> move

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
don't move anymore they don't move

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.889 
don't move anymore they don't move
freely<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:46.860> they're<00:01:47.040> supposed<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.369> and

then<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> will<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.460> ahead<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> work<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.710> levers

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.110 

and<00:02:16.140> then<00:02:16.320> spray<00:02:16.560> some<00:02:16.740> more<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and then spray some more in there and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:33.790 
and then spray some more in there and
any<00:02:21.660> openings<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.320> get<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.680> there<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.870 

right<00:02:34.800> there<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.130> can<00:02:35.220> hear<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.490> starting<00:02:35.850> to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
right there you can hear it starting to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.630 
right there you can hear it starting to
click<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.120> little<00:02:36.300> bit<00:02:36.480> there<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.950> oh<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.520> now

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
click a little bit there and oh so now

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.950 
click a little bit there and oh so now
it's<00:02:44.850> actually<00:02:45.000> starting<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.480> click<00:02:45.720> there

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
it's actually starting to click there

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.300 
it's actually starting to click there
where<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.380> wasn't<00:02:46.590> clicking<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.040> all<00:02:47.130> before

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
where I wasn't clicking it all before

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.860 
where I wasn't clicking it all before
and<00:02:52.730> see<00:02:53.730> now<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.880> can<00:02:54.120> actually<00:02:54.210> get<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.510> cable

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
and see now I can actually get the cable

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.290 
and see now I can actually get the cable
out<00:02:54.990> there<00:02:55.730> okay<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.760> went<00:02:56.820> ahead<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.090> remove

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
the cable just kind of get it out of the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.180 
the cable just kind of get it out of the
way<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.010> then<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.550> go<00:02:59.700> ahead<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.390> spray<00:03:01.230> and

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
continue flooding this in and just try

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.530 
continue flooding this in and just try
to<00:03:06.030> get<00:03:06.630> all<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.830> grease<00:03:07.980> out<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.540> as

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
to get all the grease out of there as

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.630 
to get all the grease out of there as
much<00:03:09.720> as<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.960> can<00:03:10.020> get<00:03:10.860> cleaned<00:03:11.070> up<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.430> see

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
if you have a air compressor go ahead

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.080 
if you have a air compressor go ahead
and<00:03:29.340> blow<00:03:30.680> compressed<00:03:31.680> air<00:03:32.100> through<00:03:32.489> the

and blow compressed air through the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.760 
and blow compressed air through the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
shifter to try to get as much of the

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.490 
shifter to try to get as much of the
wd-40<00:03:35.370> out<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.910> there<00:03:36.180> as<00:03:36.450> possible<00:03:37.550> if<00:03:38.550> not<00:03:39.500> go

ahead and just dry this things off and
just<00:03:43.500> try<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.739> let<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:45.019> wd-40<00:03:46.910> kind<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:47.970> dry

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
just try to let the wd-40 kind of dry

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.900 
just try to let the wd-40 kind of dry
out<00:03:48.570> or<00:03:49.050> drip<00:03:49.709> out<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.430> thing<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.730> try<00:03:50.850> to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
out or drip out of the thing and try to

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.670 
out or drip out of the thing and try to
get<00:03:51.030> as<00:03:51.120> much<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.570> out<00:03:51.720> as<00:03:51.959> possible<00:03:54.650> okay<00:03:55.650> I

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
get as much of it out as possible okay I

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.470 
get as much of it out as possible okay I
blew<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.190> thing<00:03:56.220> out<00:03:56.550> with<00:03:56.820> compressed<00:03:57.180> air

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
blew the thing out with compressed air

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.890 
blew the thing out with compressed air
now<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.170> need<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.650> lube<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.900> I'ma

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
now I need to lube it and I'ma

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.050 
now I need to lube it and I'ma
lubricates<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.590> shifter<00:04:02.040> using<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.760> try<00:04:03.269> flow

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
lubricates the shifter using a try flow

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.300 
lubricates the shifter using a try flow
wd-40<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.090> really<00:04:06.510> not<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:07.019> lubricant<00:04:07.500> it's

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
wd-40 is really not a lubricant it's

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.370 
wd-40 is really not a lubricant it's
actually<00:04:08.640> WD<00:04:09.090> stands<00:04:09.300> for<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:10.110> water

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
actually WD stands for like water

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.220 
actually WD stands for like water
displacer<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.540> it's<00:04:12.540> more<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.900> solvent

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
displacer and it's more of a solvent

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.380 
displacer and it's more of a solvent
with<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> little<00:04:13.920> bit<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.070> oil<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:14.850> it

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
with a little bit of oil in it so it

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.250 
with a little bit of oil in it so it
doesn't<00:04:15.720> make<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> good<00:04:16.049> long-term

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
doesn't make a good long-term

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.020 
doesn't make a good long-term
lubricant<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:18.640> use<00:04:19.180> try<00:04:19.510> flow<00:04:19.780> anima<00:04:20.620> flood

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
lubricant so use try flow anima flood

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.820 
lubricant so use try flow anima flood
the<00:04:22.030> inside<00:04:22.720> workings<00:04:23.290> with<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:24.580> try<00:04:24.820> flow

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830

the inside workings with the try flow
and<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.970> will<00:04:28.120> also<00:04:28.270> help<00:04:28.630> clean<00:04:29.050> out<00:04:29.080> some

and this will also help clean out some

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.300 
and this will also help clean out some
of<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:30.220> old<00:04:30.370> gunk<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.850> if<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:32.220> flooding<00:04:33.220> up

in there and again go ahead and work the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.060 
in there and again go ahead and work the
shifter<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:39.060> try<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.120> get<00:04:40.240> that<00:04:40.420> all<00:04:41.070> worked

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
shifter I try to get that all worked

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.580 
shifter I try to get that all worked
into<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.790> mechanism<00:04:43.510> in<00:04:43.630> there<00:04:46.350> now<00:04:47.350> take<00:04:47.560> a

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
into the mechanism in there now take a

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.730 
into the mechanism in there now take a
clean<00:04:47.860> towel<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.690> dry<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.750> off<00:04:49.960> as<00:04:50.290> best<00:04:50.350> you

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
clean towel and dry it off as best you

clean towel and dry it off as best you
can<00:04:50.980> because<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.550> would<00:04:51.640> be<00:04:51.730> kind<00:04:51.880> of<00:04:51.910> oily<00:04:52.360> and

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
can because it would be kind of oily and

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.560 
can because it would be kind of oily and
just<00:04:54.490> try<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.610> clean<00:04:54.820> up<00:04:54.850> as<00:04:55.060> best<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.660> can<00:04:57.570> now

I'm ready to reinstall the hood one
thing<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.080> might<00:05:02.230> use<00:05:02.560> is<00:05:02.890> a<00:05:02.920> little<00:05:03.130> bit<00:05:03.220> of

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
thing you might use is a little bit of

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.690 
thing you might use is a little bit of
alcohol<00:05:03.510> if<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:05.340> squirt<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.400> little<00:05:06.550> bit<00:05:06.640> of

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
alcohol if you squirt a little bit of

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.660 
alcohol if you squirt a little bit of
alcohol<00:05:06.820> on<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.420> inside<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.440> rubber<00:05:09.340> hood

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
alcohol on the inside of the rubber hood

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.670 
alcohol on the inside of the rubber hood
it'll<00:05:10.240> slide<00:05:10.510> on<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:10.720> little<00:05:10.990> bit<00:05:11.140> easier<00:05:11.650> I

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
it'll slide on a little bit easier I

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.580 
it'll slide on a little bit easier I
could<00:05:11.890> use<00:05:12.070> that<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:13.110> remove<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.260> hood<00:05:14.410> as

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
could use that to remove the hood as

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.930 
could use that to remove the hood as
well<00:05:14.620> but<00:05:15.040> I<00:05:15.130> didn't<00:05:15.400> think<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:15.730> at<00:05:15.790> the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
well but I didn't think of it at the

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.690 
well but I didn't think of it at the
time<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:19.110> it'll<00:05:20.110> slide<00:05:20.500> right<00:05:20.710> on<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.400> when

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
time and it'll slide right on and when

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.880 
time and it'll slide right on and when
