00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
from the city if you want to use the new
branch<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> escalator

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
branch you have to get the escalator

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
branch you have to get the escalator
down<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> same<00:00:47.520> level<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.239> Jubilee

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
down to the same level as the Jubilee

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.010 
down to the same level as the Jubilee
Line<00:00:48.690> train<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:50.460> down<00:00:50.700> again<00:00:51.059> walk

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
Line train and then down again walk

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.229 
Line train and then down again walk
under<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> new<00:00:52.559> extension<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
under the new extension and then up the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.260 
under the new extension and then up the
steps<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> new<00:00:55.020> path

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
steps to the new path

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750 

so<00:00:57.810> we're<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.050> platform<00:00:58.710> 2<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.400> is<00:00:59.610> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so we're now on platform 2 which is the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.480 
so we're now on platform 2 which is the
Stratford<00:01:00.210> international<00:01:00.710> platform<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.950> we

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
Stratford international platform and we

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.870 
Stratford international platform and we
were<00:01:02.610> up<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.300> top<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> DLR<00:01:04.880> coming

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
were up the top there on the DLR coming

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.950 
were up the top there on the DLR coming
down<00:01:06.030> because<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.330> were<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.540> actually

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
down because you were now actually

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.090 
down because you were now actually
parallel<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.580> underground<00:01:09.180> track<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
parallel to the underground track so the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310 
parallel to the underground track so the
platform<00:01:11.550> 2<00:01:11.940> runs<00:01:12.390> alongside<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
platform 2 runs alongside the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.980 
platform 2 runs alongside the
Underground<00:01:14.150> Underground<00:01:15.150> trains<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.630> indeed

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
Underground Underground trains do indeed

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.100 
Underground Underground trains do indeed
run<00:01:16.260> alongside<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.950> DLR<00:01:17.370> in<00:01:17.610> fact<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
run alongside the DLR in fact if you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.840 
run alongside the DLR in fact if you
were<00:01:19.260> traveling<00:01:19.470> between<00:01:19.800> Canning<00:01:20.370> Town<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
were traveling between Canning Town and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.530 
were traveling between Canning Town and
Stratford

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
Stratford

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600 
Stratford
it's<00:01:21.870> simply<00:01:22.290> quicker<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.860> take<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.160> Jubilee

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.810 
it's simply quicker to take the Jubilee
Line<00:01:24.290> surely<00:01:25.290> you'd<00:01:25.500> only<00:01:25.710> take<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.100> DLR<00:01:26.490> if

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
Line surely you'd only take the DLR if

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.400 
Line surely you'd only take the DLR if
you<00:01:26.970> wanted<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> stop<00:01:27.660> at<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.230> new
