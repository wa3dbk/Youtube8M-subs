as<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.670> know<00:02:03.910> compression<00:02:04.900> helps<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.260> during

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
as you know compression helps you during

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.080 
as you know compression helps you during
the<00:02:05.650> race<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:06.070> helps<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.460> win<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:06.790> it<00:02:06.970> also

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
the race it helps you to win but it also

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.090 
the race it helps you to win but it also
helps<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.540> recover<00:02:07.780> afterwards<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
helps you to recover afterwards so the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.889 
helps you to recover afterwards so the
question<00:02:09.399> is<00:02:09.550> how<00:02:09.970> do<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.119> deliver<00:02:10.330> more

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
question is how do we deliver more

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.750 
question is how do we deliver more
compression<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:12.220> problem<00:02:12.610> with<00:02:12.730> that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
compression to you the problem with that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.060 
compression to you the problem with that
is<00:02:13.210> that<00:02:13.270> if<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:13.570> just<00:02:13.900> squeeze<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.290> harder<00:02:14.710> it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
is that if we just squeeze you harder it

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.310 
is that if we just squeeze you harder it
reduces<00:02:15.400> your<00:02:15.520> mobility<00:02:15.850> your<00:02:16.600> dynamic<00:02:17.140> and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
reduces your mobility your dynamic and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.780 
reduces your mobility your dynamic and
we<00:02:17.440> want<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.709> keep<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.130> way<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
we want to keep you that way the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.190 
we want to keep you that way the
breakthrough<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.240> we've<00:02:19.450> had<00:02:19.660> with<00:02:19.870> carbon

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
breakthrough that we've had with carbon

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.770 
breakthrough that we've had with carbon
Pro<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.950> introduce<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.430> carbon<00:02:21.790> cage<00:02:22.060> this

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
Pro is to introduce a carbon cage this

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.510 
Pro is to introduce a carbon cage this
locks<00:02:23.110> down<00:02:23.380> only<00:02:23.830> when<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.220> where<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.490> need

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
locks down only when and where you need

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.580 
locks down only when and where you need
it<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.480> when<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.630> require<00:02:26.080> extra

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
it so that when you require extra

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.410 
it so that when you require extra
compression<00:02:26.830> it's<00:02:27.280> delivered<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.150> when<00:02:28.330> you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
compression it's delivered and when you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.170 
compression it's delivered and when you
need<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.720> mobility<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.830> mobility

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.240 

the<00:02:34.180> quest<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> best<00:02:34.810> as<00:02:35.410> we've<00:02:36.010> been

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
the quest for the best as we've been

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.300 
the quest for the best as we've been
about<00:02:36.580> too<00:02:36.850> many<00:02:37.180> feet<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.410> cooperation<00:02:39.100> with
