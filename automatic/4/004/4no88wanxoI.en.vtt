00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.139 
part on there can also bend out this
much<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.340> actually<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> arms

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
much so you can actually have the arms

much so you can actually have the arms
go<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> way<00:01:45.689> out<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.950> shoulder

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
go all the way out and get that shoulder

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.800 
go all the way out and get that shoulder
part<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.820> despite<00:01:48.180> being<00:01:48.360> skidding<00:01:48.689> up

at<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> nice<00:01:49.170> 45-degree<00:01:49.950> angle<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.939> herbs<00:01:51.119> are

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
at a nice 45-degree angle the herbs are

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
at a nice 45-degree angle the herbs are
gonna<00:01:51.360> rotate<00:01:51.540> around<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.470> bend

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
gonna rotate around and the bend

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590 
gonna rotate around and the bend

I<00:05:57.930> think<00:05:58.350> that's<00:05:58.590> gonna<00:05:58.830> look<00:05:58.919> pretty<00:05:59.370> alright

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
I think that's gonna look pretty alright

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.090 
I think that's gonna look pretty alright
especially<00:06:00.479> if<00:06:00.690> you<00:06:01.110> fix<00:06:01.380> up<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.680> color<00:06:01.890> of

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
especially if you fix up the color of

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.610 
especially if you fix up the color of
that<00:06:02.130> blade<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:03.870> needle<00:06:04.140> guns<00:06:04.320> not<00:06:04.500> gonna

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
that blade the needle guns not gonna

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.920 
that blade the needle guns not gonna
have<00:06:04.860> as<00:06:04.950> much<00:06:04.979> visual<00:06:05.430> infested<00:06:06.360> like<00:06:06.600> it<00:06:06.810> to

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
have as much visual infested like it to

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.260 
have as much visual infested like it to
have<00:06:07.140> but<00:06:07.530> again<00:06:07.800> just<00:06:08.100> the<00:06:08.250> dynamic<00:06:08.760> dashing

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
have but again just the dynamic dashing

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.210 
have but again just the dynamic dashing
poses<00:06:09.660> that<00:06:09.780> you<00:06:09.870> can<00:06:10.050> make<00:06:10.590> with<00:06:10.860> this<00:06:10.979> guy

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
poses that you can make with this guy

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.930 
poses that you can make with this guy
are<00:06:11.910> all<00:06:12.090> gonna<00:06:12.240> add<00:06:12.450> to<00:06:12.840> his<00:06:13.229> overall

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
are all gonna add to his overall

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.409 
are all gonna add to his overall
impressiveness<00:06:14.940> and<00:06:15.330> it's<00:06:15.780> not<00:06:16.020> all<00:06:16.290> that<00:06:16.320> bad

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
impressiveness and it's not all that bad

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.190 
impressiveness and it's not all that bad
somewhat<00:06:18.419> disappointed<00:06:18.870> that<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.020> legs

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
somewhat disappointed that the legs

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.320 
somewhat disappointed that the legs
don't<00:06:19.380> come<00:06:19.650> up<00:06:19.800> any<00:06:20.040> higher<00:06:20.190> than<00:06:20.760> that

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
don't come up any higher than that

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.300 
don't come up any higher than that
even<00:06:21.720> though<00:06:21.810> that<00:06:21.930> is<00:06:22.080> pretty<00:06:22.290> good<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:23.160> fact

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
even though that is pretty good the fact

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.650 
even though that is pretty good the fact
that<00:06:23.460> these<00:06:23.610> needle<00:06:23.970> guns<00:06:24.150> though<00:06:24.330> are<00:06:24.479> down

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
that these needle guns though are down

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.600 
that these needle guns though are down
so<00:06:24.930> low<00:06:25.110> really<00:06:25.530> does<00:06:25.890> detriment<00:06:26.460> their

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
so low really does detriment their

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.610 
so low really does detriment their
visibility<00:06:27.330> in<00:06:27.600> terms<00:06:27.840> of<00:06:28.020> just<00:06:28.200> showing<00:06:28.350> off

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
visibility in terms of just showing off

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.710 
visibility in terms of just showing off
but<00:06:29.310> in<00:06:29.460> a<00:06:29.520> pose<00:06:29.729> like<00:06:29.910> this<00:06:30.030> even<00:06:30.419> with<00:06:30.510> both

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
but in a pose like this even with both

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.210 
but in a pose like this even with both
legs<00:06:30.990> up<00:06:31.169> you<00:06:31.290> can<00:06:31.440> imagine<00:06:31.770> he<00:06:31.860> just<00:06:32.040> ran

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
legs up you can imagine he just ran

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.770 
legs up you can imagine he just ran
circles<00:06:32.490> around<00:06:32.760> somebody<00:06:33.270> in<00:06:33.390> terms<00:06:33.600> of

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
circles around somebody in terms of

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.230 
circles around somebody in terms of
speed<00:06:34.050> and<00:06:34.080> is<00:06:34.860> now<00:06:35.070> offering<00:06:35.550> them<00:06:35.729> a<00:06:35.910> knee

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
speed and is now offering them a knee

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.839 
speed and is now offering them a knee
full<00:06:36.900> of<00:06:37.080> needles<00:06:37.500> I<00:06:37.890> don't<00:06:38.460> know<00:06:38.550> if<00:06:38.669> that's

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
full of needles I don't know if that's

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:39.930 
full of needles I don't know if that's
quite<00:06:39.060> so<00:06:39.300> impressive

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
quite so impressive

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.210 
quite so impressive
from<00:06:40.240> other<00:06:40.480> angles<00:06:43.770> one<00:06:44.770> feature<00:06:45.010> though

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
from other angles one feature though

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.310 
from other angles one feature though
that<00:06:45.400> does<00:06:45.550> seem<00:06:45.760> to<00:06:45.910> get<00:06:46.030> lost<00:06:46.270> in<00:06:46.480> the<00:06:46.570> mix<00:06:46.780> it

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
that does seem to get lost in the mix it

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.720 
that does seem to get lost in the mix it
looks<00:06:47.530> pretty<00:06:47.740> good<00:06:47.920> dashing<00:06:48.400> but<00:06:48.550> these

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
looks pretty good dashing but these

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.580 
looks pretty good dashing but these
thrusters<00:06:49.030> even<00:06:49.600> you<00:06:49.780> open<00:06:50.050> them<00:06:50.170> up<00:06:50.260> it's<00:06:50.500> a

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
thrusters even you open them up it's a

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.990 
thrusters even you open them up it's a
great<00:06:50.710> idea<00:06:51.100> to<00:06:51.190> have<00:06:51.310> them<00:06:51.550> but<00:06:51.670> just<00:06:51.880> the

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
great idea to have them but just the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.670 
great idea to have them but just the
fact<00:06:52.180> that<00:06:52.270> they're<00:06:52.480> doomed<00:06:52.690> to<00:06:52.870> be<00:06:52.990> hidden<00:06:53.560> in

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
fact that they're doomed to be hidden in

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.230 
fact that they're doomed to be hidden in
the<00:06:53.800> back<00:06:53.980> means<00:06:54.700> they're<00:06:54.850> not<00:06:54.880> going<00:06:55.090> to<00:06:55.180> be

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
the back means they're not going to be

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.460 
the back means they're not going to be
that<00:06:55.390> visible<00:06:55.750> unless<00:06:55.930> you<00:06:56.200> bring<00:06:56.350> the

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
that visible unless you bring the

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.140 
that visible unless you bring the
forearm<00:06:56.830> all<00:06:57.070> the<00:06:57.220> way<00:06:57.340> forward<00:06:57.610> to<00:06:57.790> show<00:06:57.970> them

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
forearm all the way forward to show them

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.520 
forearm all the way forward to show them
off<00:06:58.270> and<00:06:58.570> then<00:06:59.050> you're<00:06:59.140> not<00:06:59.260> going<00:06:59.380> to<00:06:59.440> be

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
off and then you're not going to be

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.200 
off and then you're not going to be
getting<00:06:59.680> any<00:06:59.830> aft<00:07:00.190> acceleration

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
getting any aft acceleration

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.540 
getting any aft acceleration
however<00:07:01.870> those<00:07:02.140> running<00:07:02.470> poses<00:07:02.920> are<00:07:03.160> worthy

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
however those running poses are worthy

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.800 
however those running poses are worthy
of<00:07:03.970> the<00:07:04.480> Olympics<00:07:04.930> it<00:07:05.140> seems<00:07:06.600> that<00:07:07.600> will<00:07:07.690> rub

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
of the Olympics it seems that will rub

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.300 
of the Olympics it seems that will rub
them<00:07:07.930> I<00:07:08.050> look<00:07:08.260> at<00:07:08.380> the<00:07:08.440> Mobile<00:07:08.710> Suit<00:07:08.980> so<00:07:09.190> why

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
them I look at the Mobile Suit so why

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.500 
them I look at the Mobile Suit so why
don't<00:07:09.460> you<00:07:09.490> let<00:07:09.670> me<00:07:09.700> know<00:07:09.760> what<00:07:10.090> you<00:07:10.240> think<00:07:10.390> of

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
don't you let me know what you think of

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.240 
don't you let me know what you think of
it<00:07:10.600> with<00:07:10.780> a<00:07:10.810> comment<00:07:11.050> down<00:07:11.290> below<00:07:11.470> and<00:07:11.830> what

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
it with a comment down below and what

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.310 
it with a comment down below and what
you<00:07:12.370> think<00:07:12.550> of<00:07:12.730> this<00:07:12.850> video<00:07:13.120> the<00:07:13.960> spirit<00:07:14.230> was

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320 
you think of this video the spirit was

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.690 
you think of this video the spirit was
certainly<00:07:14.560> grown<00:07:14.800> on<00:07:14.950> me<00:07:15.130> some<00:07:15.460> detrimental

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
certainly grown on me some detrimental

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.790 
certainly grown on me some detrimental
things<00:07:16.270> but<00:07:16.510> a<00:07:16.540> lot<00:07:16.780> of<00:07:16.810> positives<00:07:17.410> so<00:07:17.530> stay

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
things but a lot of positives so stay

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.410 
things but a lot of positives so stay
tuned<00:07:18.010> for<00:07:18.190> the<00:07:18.280> final<00:07:18.580> verdict<00:07:18.850> where<00:07:19.300> you

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.420 
tuned for the final verdict where you

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.790 
tuned for the final verdict where you
can<00:07:19.570> hear<00:07:19.720> them<00:07:19.870> all<00:07:19.930> in<00:07:20.110> one<00:07:20.260> place<00:07:20.470> so<00:07:20.530> that

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
can hear them all in one place so that

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.200 
can hear them all in one place so that
you<00:07:20.920> can<00:07:21.070> make<00:07:21.190> a<00:07:21.220> call<00:07:21.460> as<00:07:21.670> to<00:07:21.790> whether<00:07:21.970> or<00:07:22.060> not

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
you can make a call as to whether or not

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.720 
you can make a call as to whether or not
this<00:07:22.750> is<00:07:22.960> a<00:07:22.990> kid<00:07:23.200> you<00:07:23.320> may<00:07:23.470> want<00:07:23.680> to<00:07:23.740> add<00:07:23.980> to
