00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.359
 efe 4 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:15.929
 same as the fourth 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.710
 arcía 43 in this year 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.169
 that committee was changed 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.169
 rastreator com 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.330
 one hour and six minutes of game 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 and this first set is not over yet 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 Almost angels 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.380
 serra farré that it takes your long time to go think that what is 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.270
 doing 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.700
 the mental freshness is not the same hour 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.030
 obviously at the beginning of the season 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.820
 the points get longer 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.880
 rafa that require 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.709
 use much more to variety state 

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:01.709
 when very predictable always side of the back of choco bits 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.180
 and you have to change directions a lot more 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.380
 0 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.839
 but I think I took 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.779
 I think you have to 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:17.929
 long dots 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.039
 maybe we are wrong sometimes 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.079
 if eta happens that lost 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.149
 trust rafa about all this 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.229
 because she was crazy that she has broken the racket and now the return to the 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.489
 get into the game 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.440
 Rafael will again choose to play solid try to fail as little as possible 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.439
 it is predicted that home as it is 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:53.329
 the angels valued for that now ahead on the scoreboard 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.329
 according to rosa who last country what the product predicted 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.040
 the 7 63 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.459
 I shared telco 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.379
 scioli 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.259
 many also point this out 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:13.249
 united canada 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.169
 in montecarlo 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.169
 of game another ten 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:42.499
 there was a little more on the right wall and threw the water 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:43.959
 recover this hall 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.799
 more free 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.799
 criticizable but 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.489
 what is clear is that rafa nadal has now left these things 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.089
 strange chairs 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.959
 atrincherase founded the track 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.249
 ensure xiii minimize errors ie how much less better 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.279
 luis téllez 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:29.279
 arauco and what is this 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.309
 this is why the services or for him 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:38.309
 balear therefore it is evident that tomic follows 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.710
 I looked 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 the key that is important but not decisive at all 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.629
 ja 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.300
 there they did not reach it 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.610
 but after four and with the 6 5 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.779
 I ordered that you have received now 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.319
 the manacorense is prepared and suitable for this next point also 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.740
 remarkable success that with your serve to find you 5 2 psychological key points 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.460
 as pointed mouse and carbonel 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.130
 and added I see it 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.130
 throughout the day at the bmv 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.659
 but very good so far 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.759
 in that attack looking for the right first possible in the network 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:26.029
 belongs to a group of people who attended the third part is the 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.029
 time to allow it when you have two points of advantage 4 2 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:33.849
 you have to try to go out and find the match 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.999
 for now the important thing is to look for another my free 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.999
 and see it has four set points 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.229
 josé valero 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.349
 bermeo 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:51.110
 if that money is to defeat the Swede now he has four more 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.110
 of the six selections portfolio 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:57.939
 it's important has been the sector 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.569
 because socovil after losing it here we have seen this right 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:06.249
 he has stopped having faith 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.419
 the heir 

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:26.479
 go ahead 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.919
 what the page you are seeing says 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.400
 and what was the rival that would talk to him
