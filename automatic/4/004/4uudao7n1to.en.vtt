I'm just who failed his test he had
seven<00:00:04.859> driving<00:00:05.190> errors<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.759> true<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.540> them<00:00:06.690> were

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
seven driving errors I true of them were

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.560 
seven driving errors I true of them were
serious<00:00:07.319> ones<00:00:07.760> now<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.820> thing<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.090> those<00:00:09.540> two

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
serious ones now the thing is those two

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.200 
serious ones now the thing is those two
serious<00:00:10.139> errors<00:00:10.500> well<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.519> would<00:00:11.790> call<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
serious errors well what I would call a

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.870 
serious errors well what I would call a
stupid<00:00:12.750> mistakes<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:14.340> because<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.759> what

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
stupid mistakes and all because of what

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.570 
stupid mistakes and all because of what
I<00:00:14.910> think<00:00:15.030> was<00:00:15.599> him<00:00:16.410> being<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.010> hurry

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
I think was him being in a hurry

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.790 
I think was him being in a hurry
to<00:00:18.270> actually<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> test<00:00:19.109> done<00:00:19.199> over<00:00:19.650> with

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
to actually get the test done over with

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.130 
to actually get the test done over with
I've<00:00:20.490> actually<00:00:20.670> found<00:00:21.000> out<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.570> lot<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.930> my

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I've actually found out a lot of my

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.740 
I've actually found out a lot of my
fulfills<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.920> their<00:00:23.460> tests<00:00:23.730> they<00:00:24.060> seem<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
fulfills on their tests they seem to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
fulfills on their tests they seem to
have<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.380> idea<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.039> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> get<00:00:26.400> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
have this idea that I want to get this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.839 
have this idea that I want to get this
test<00:00:26.820> over<00:00:26.939> with<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> hurry

test over with so they are in a hurry
there's<00:00:29.849> no<00:00:30.000> reason<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
there's no reason for it

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.950 
there's no reason for it
take<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.250> time<00:00:32.489> whatever<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.570> ask<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the very first time or you're doing a

the very first time or you're doing a
maneuver<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:39.180> need<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:39.600> sure<00:00:39.629> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
maneuver you need to make sure you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.160 
maneuver you need to make sure you
actually<00:00:40.590> look<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.610> around<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.360> say<00:00:42.989> for

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
asked to do there's no reason why you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.560 
asked to do there's no reason why you
need<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> hurry<00:00:47.670> there's<00:00:48.270> no<00:00:48.360> time

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
need to be in a hurry there's no time

need to be in a hurry there's no time
limit<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.800> maneuver<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.149> not

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
limit on the maneuver so if it's not

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.490 
limit on the maneuver so if it's not
safe<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.960> proceed<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.410> the

safe for you to proceed with the

safe for you to proceed with the
maneuver<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.039> need<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> wait<00:00:53.579> until<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.120> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
maneuver they need to wait until it is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.959 
maneuver they need to wait until it is
safe<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.379> same<00:00:55.590> thing<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> junction<00:00:56.820> if

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
safe the same thing with a junction if

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.990 
safe the same thing with a junction if
you<00:00:57.149> imagine<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.579> road<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.789> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you imagine and the road that you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.510 
you imagine and the road that you
imagine<00:01:00.390> into<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.710> clear<00:01:02.039> then

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
imagine into it's not clear then

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.910 
imagine into it's not clear then
obviously<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.930> can't<00:01:04.199> allow<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.500> into<00:01:04.680> their

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
obviously you can't allow it into their

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.899 
obviously you can't allow it into their
own<00:01:05.360> Road<00:01:06.530> what<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> find<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.100> lot<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> times<00:01:08.640> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
own Road what you find a lot of times is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.880 
own Road what you find a lot of times is
that<00:01:09.210> drivers<00:01:09.750> would<00:01:09.990> block<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.439> side<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that drivers would block one side of the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.120 
that drivers would block one side of the
road<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:12.380> see<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.790> other<00:01:15.360> side<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.770> deal

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
road and then see the other side to deal

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.700 
road and then see the other side to deal
with<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> test<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.409> not

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
with them but on the test this is not

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.580 
with them but on the test this is not
acceptable<00:01:20.549> practice<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.930> imagine<00:01:22.170> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
acceptable practice if you imagine you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.380 
acceptable practice if you imagine you
stay<00:01:22.860> into<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> rock<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.759> need<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> stay<00:01:24.210> in

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
stay into the rock you need to stay in

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.870 
stay into the rock you need to stay in
the<00:01:24.509> road<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.500> emerge<00:01:26.430> only

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the road that you're on and emerge only

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
the road that you're on and emerge only
when<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> safe<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:28.020> both<00:01:28.290> side<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> road

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
when it is safe on both side of the road

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.890 
when it is safe on both side of the road
so<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.220> need<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> minimum<00:01:30.090> look<00:01:30.299> right

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
so you need to do a minimum look right

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.100 
so you need to do a minimum look right
left<00:01:31.530> right<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.630> find<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
left right and if then you find out that

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.170 
left right and if then you find out that
there's<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.439> safe<00:01:34.920> gap<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> emerge

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
there's a safe gap then you can emerge

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420 
there's a safe gap then you can emerge
if<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.780> stay<00:01:37.380> where<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.740> until<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
if not stay where you are until it is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
if not stay where you are until it is
safe<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:39.360> allow<00:01:39.630> other<00:01:39.869> road<00:01:40.110> users<00:01:40.140> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
safe don't allow other road users to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.260 
safe don't allow other road users to
pressurize<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.310> they'd<00:01:41.549> rather<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
pressurize you they'd rather know that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
pressurize you they'd rather know that
you're<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> test<00:01:42.899> even<00:01:43.110> say<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.680> knew

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you're on the test even say they knew

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
you're on the test even say they knew
that<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> test<00:01:45.030> they<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.659> care
