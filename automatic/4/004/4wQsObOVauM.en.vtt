00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello I will introduce you to the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.040
 basic recipe for cooking a rib 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.410
 beef in low temperature 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.929
 the setting of the oven must be set on 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.820
 the heating position at the top and in 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.930
 down the rotating heat is not 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.250
 recommended for low cooking 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.890
 temperature 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.450
 then the thermostat at 80 degrees the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 first step is to brown 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.890
 the rib of beef with a little fat 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.470
 in either oil or butter 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.059
 roast it was necessary to put 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.170
 a lot 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.370
 so when sega fat 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.090
 yellow ie it is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.930
 slightly smoking like these have done 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.400
 browning the rib of beef it takes the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.170
 do not fry for too long 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.050
 let's say for a rib of beef like 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 that makes a kilo or a kilo 2 little by little 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.110
 near that is so for 4 people 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.000
 about 80 swimmers we will count in all 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.000
 about 6 7 minutes of wild rice 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.110
 you have 50 years of laughing and the meat of 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:23.720
 all sides in the edges and on the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.580
 cat pooped like this so as to create 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.420
 you realized and make a carapace that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.420
 still dream of last year 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.290
 the pedal the car 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:02:01.950
 to take place 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:01.950
 it's standing next to these 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.810
 and I hope the probe then the probe on 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.550
 inserts it in the center of the meat 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.430
 she's pretty much here in the middle in 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.430
 the thickness and especially without touching the bone 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.450
 foolish people pretty quickly from 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.840
 way because the heat does not go away 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.240
 not once does that do I rule my 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.880
 55 degree electronic thermometer 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.130
 for 50 Â° point cooking 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.460
 would correspond to cooking temperature 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.060
 bleeding and 60 and beyond that would be 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.060
 for a well cooked meat 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.379
 and here is our thermometer indicates 55 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.650
 two winners of the opal coast 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.409
 click she stayed about two 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.450
 and a half hours in the oven and let 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:14.310
 now can cut it off 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:22.260
 hot plates bouffes theater 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:35.989
 avatar the mulled wine company for 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:35.989
 receive the sauce ap cut the rib 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.690
 I will have a nice meal on the dish 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.800
 it only remains to taste it here 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.800
