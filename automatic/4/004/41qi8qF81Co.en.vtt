00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 dumb in this new thing tutorial 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.690
 we will talk in this tutorial we will talk 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.880
 of how to use one of the trucks 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.449
 live highlight package programs 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.640
 that garage band garage band why 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.470
 tell you about garageband well ancient me 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.609
 for example use garageband 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.119
 I'll use it to be precise 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.780
 garageband for my big and music 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.980
 like I did before with the covers 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.920
 simple 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.110
 that is, I made videos cover how to have 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.170
 seen if you have not seen to go to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.329
 see them and then dashboard is a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 very useful and very important program 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.920
 if you don't have it, download it if I can 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.149
 to find a link if you don't already have it 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 on your mac 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.739
 I will let you have it, I can't 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.800
 ensure 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.399
 to various functions we analyze some 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 of the main functions 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.210
 we have new project, my name is on 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.970
 new project and what we do ad 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.970
 example let's go up 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.159
 plan will be written ryan 's name is there 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.960
 written they had written mine again 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.700
 song because I've already tried others 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.700
 so sometimes there are other precedents 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.299
 here we have the possibility of 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.299
 record with our keyboard 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.920
 hear why headphones can 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.409
 be used both with the keys 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.259
 keys but that very boring or with the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.619
 boys keyboard we can we 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.619
 sound like so sanction 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.640
 that is, our data do not think that 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.250
 I do not want to feel so let us mention 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.150
 they are even more so if we see 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.950
 register type our plan we have 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.600
 meanwhile you were caught recording 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.240
 but it is useless he was going to explained 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.650
 we can use the metronome part 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.630
 just let us put it 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.030
 the administration and we can also have 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.660
 a piano type we have immense 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.810
 types of pianos and this that yes 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.900
 it also features very recently 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.180
 that we have an immensity in types 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.390
 of our tools we have at 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.310
 normal piano these little keyboards 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.090
 electrical we have everything that is 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.850
 we can work fully once 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.010
 done this but what happens then if 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.650
 I am a singer I want to engrave a 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.840
 excerpt but a piece engraved on the base 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.340
 so the service can be keyboard like 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.860
 a new visa now but after when 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.709
 I have to do let's go immediately to create 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.200
 a new track because evening will be created 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:07.170
 along with this in this video one 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.660
 new track that will serve to be non 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.810
 superimposed but units to the previous month 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.360
 for example real tool for 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.269
 record audio with a guitar voice 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.660
 low anything and really with a 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.430
 microphone for example now I'm talking 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.280
 and as you see levels here are 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.420
 also raising some voice thanks 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.190
 it sounds incredible but that's why 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.840
 also the band as I said yes 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.470
 characterizes and we can do this 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.690
 I think of infinity therefore for many 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.670
 ways we do n't have a crap this 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.170
 key 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.970
 let's start that worked and what dates 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:52.910
 guys we have the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.240
 pedal boards because this is used 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.270
 key 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.770
 there is this program indeed 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.390
 also used as amplification 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.950
 also as an amplifier that will serve 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.110
 tuner we can tune our 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.720
 tools the item is defined as 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.790
 a note as you can see and then 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.989
 this is mainly in the race there 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:23.660
 however, he takes what there is also of wolf 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.660
 that now let's see if I can find any 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:32.360
 the wolf they saw at the beginning 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.289
 showed user group would be a wolf who 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.819
 here I am they are shown to be in reality 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:45.680
 an endless series and I really have to say 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:47.180
 endless of recordings I don't think that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.169
 evolution to feel that one could 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.139
 feel the beautiful but a series of 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:58.270
 melody recordings that are 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:01.069
 really many that can serve us for 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.539
 be put under the bottom to help the 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:07.550
 our new song I hope to be there 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.399
 it was useful because in reality it was not there 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.520
 so much from the garage band but I have you 

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:16.789
 shown these little things they can 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.309
 always be helpful i hope this 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.159
 video you like it as always I ask you 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:24.110
 to follow the channel to write to you if 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.229
 you naturally want everything 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.449
 volunteer to put pleasure if you 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.580

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.580
