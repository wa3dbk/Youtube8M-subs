00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.060
 we come back to love people 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.849
 infamous second sun paper trail next 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.639
 mission, we go directly to part 2 of 6 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.799
 or part 2 of 36 use her 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.759
 phone to find her here and she 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.759
 to speak up 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:37.550
 but really fast 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:40.239
 this piece of lungs that should be high enough 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.239
 I think so 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.230
 but you have not caught me yet 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.060
 massive of her 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.940
 you ask yourself why me 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:37.350
 why del are planned the same too 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.369
 load 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.369
 we have to keep going 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.380
 projection again 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:38.200
 waiting under a roof for investigation 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.470
 or a matter that is a 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.470
 Award 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.880
 this is a great thank you game 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.080
 are so cool a flat can namely 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.080
 now fall down here 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:14.940
 it's such a shit may like 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.940
 hold tight 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.010
 that was it seriously now 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.010
 Sorry not caught me yet 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.500
 serious it would be really too long 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.220
 gone so that's not clear 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.080
 that my break wise, so a break 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.740
 insert people that was too much 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.820
 too much in the piece gambled 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.000
 We do not want to go through this 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.030
 let now already to the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.320
 border gone it was possible 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.500
 presumably the bands left it 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.370
 That's why we have to say 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.380
 Of course, here again direct conclusion yes 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.240
 oh well I think I believe in 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.770
 next time is the end of me 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.010
 That 's the last word we believe 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.000
 finally see what they get 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.740
 maybe not the whole one fuller 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.400
 You can not read like me 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.980
 escape 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.070
 As I said, it was not just a person 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.680
 It was stupid that I call stupid others 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.540
 people take fun with the game 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.550
 but we know that by now 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.020
 that's not enough on youtube 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.850
 We talked for a long time 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.440
 next time then probably to 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.390
 I think so 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.190
 we will see what awaits me 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.230
 Hope you are there until the next one 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.810
 times and yes you all know that 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.190
 Feedback there if you want to be and yes 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.270
 I'm sorry they follow so shortly 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.770
 But what are you supposed to do ? 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.290
 it is even how short the missions are 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.190
 so it may purely next time 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.190
 and bye
