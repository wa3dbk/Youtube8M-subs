00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello to all so we find ourselves for 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.200
 a new video a video so of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.280
 update on the beginning so why 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.179
 I wanted to do it simply 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.020
 to show you a little bit there that you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.660
 tell you the echo of lidl which makes it the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 static matches so it's very 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.050
 interesting about some characters the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.529
 characters so that pulsates pale because 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.890
 that look 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.329
 look here so it's lying but it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.950
 also wonder using the kinds 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 which makes it look like 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 here we can actually have a 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.360
 burst potential all the more 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 awesome for a character for 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.860
 a character called city â€‹â€‹whose clermont 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.960
 it's really a very, very good 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.210
 new to all who is murderer or 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.600
 even just a character who 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.879
 wish to increase it's the guys it's going 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.550
 be the case so for example since 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.979
 this item therefore provides you with the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.530
 travel speed and thus at once 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.549
 the mighty skiers to negligible the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.460
 everything so that's an item that's 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.250
 very interesting too because he's going 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.860
 allow you to switch to our boots 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.659
 with another item given that by 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.520
 example 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.770
 good me i sauna day as a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.350
 hang medium I use a mardan sense 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.829
 who is humble theme about her who is going 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.439
 especially played a lot on these halos 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.280
 and all these items a plague of the lich 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.049
 more and cold blood hate and childhood 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.780
 by adam allows me to have a speed 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.649
 of displacement which is superior 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.450
 largely by the way not the one that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.750
 I would have had just with this with 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.409
 boots 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.860
 so you have to know that the ribs of 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.979
 butten plus the halloween fuel and well that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.090
 normally gives you a speed of 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.950
 displacement which is six points 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.719
 less than 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.700
 normally with with friends 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.609
 which means it's pretty minimal 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.519
 as difference in other words just in 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:13.580
 day with an economical and influential 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.310
 the isch you can have pretty much the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.959
 same speed 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.650
 the same speed precisely as if you 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.920
 had boots 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.739
 except that you do not have the 15% 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.970
 magical penetration by the no but 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.069
 you indeed without wind 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.950
 power plus more especially the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:35.000
 very interesting passive which allows 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.760
 to punch oberst oberst here is a fat guy 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.410
 museum but well after that will not do my 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.959
 miracle clown for example for a 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.970
 character like that it will help you to 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.400
 pockets certainly but it's not going to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.970
 climate completely sahel and that four 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.690
 maximum targets that can be used 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.450
 so we will surely see these 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.129
 next time and in my opinion I think 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.250
 that it can be a good thing since 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:05.959
 lately there were only the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.760
 adeic characters who can take advantage of 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.410
 full stuff characters without the boots 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.709
 so for me I think it's a 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.209
 good news because here we have 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.200
 different possibilities that orient themselves 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.079
 there will be more burst with 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.459
 the characters ap and in my opinion it's going 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:28.069
 give rise to various various 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.840
 I do not doubt I do not doubt so 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.840
 gezin and surely in the jungle pretty 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.569
 tale facing the mans a small face to face 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.610
 before finishing this game and therefore the 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.489
 kick that's on this name I think by 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.819
 example that this staff that I have with him 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.530
 wants to finish xynthia late so the staff 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.840
 that I currently have is surely a 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.099
 of the best that good he has no 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.860
 magical resistance one is on a 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:54.460
 Bourges week in Quebec is safe 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.460
 in the process 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.370
 there we still manage to catch up 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.730
 normally we have to catch up without 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:14.730
 difficulty and we will have to review the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.730
 slow down is what I am normal 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:28.550
 here we are like sand in the middle 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:32.330
 the fiery medium besides good after 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:37.009
 all we would like anyway for I 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.310
 counted to win not to do either 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.990
 everything and anything 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.440
 so I'm also showing you 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.880
 learn nothing so here we are going to finish 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.699
 well this part there quickly they 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.330
 see the saone at once who is a 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.430
 normally gold support that says when 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.500
 even a lot of damage there precisely 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.620
 with this lavender stock it is enormously 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.620
 the more we will just finish 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.850
 his teacher here is a little bit of them a 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.120
 little bit of damage like a lot of the 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.120
 note 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:28.929
 here we feel and that's so I hope 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:31.240
 that it is this little raptor and the animation 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:33.189
 I hope these little explanations 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.669
 you will have more than these proposals of 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.369
 stuff 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.979
 in any case on those there will have to 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:41.289
 also more will perhaps leave you 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.559
 to think about it and suddenly bah 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.909
 I hope it has been helpful and 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:47.169
 I tell you next time for a 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.849
 next video do not hesitate to you 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.669
 subscribe the join the chain for more 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.249
 explanations on objects of the pe and 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.629
 other parties a little more fun as well 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.249
 than on other games here I hope 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:00.209
 that will have pleased you and I tell you 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.209
 review tubes and ebitda
