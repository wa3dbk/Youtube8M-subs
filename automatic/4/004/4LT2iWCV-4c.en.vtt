I took them out when i was coming home
from<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.990> shopping<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.060> like<00:02:10.179> a

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
from just shopping so this is like a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.100 
from just shopping so this is like a
twist<00:02:10.780> out<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.950> front<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.630> twist<00:02:13.960> is

twist out in the front but the twist is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.559 
twist out in the front but the twist is
still<00:02:14.350> intact<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.850> middle<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
still intact in the middle and

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.650 
still intact in the middle and
everything<00:02:17.470> else<00:02:17.620> was<00:02:17.740> just<00:02:17.800> twisted<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:21.660> this

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
everything else was just twisted so this

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.309
