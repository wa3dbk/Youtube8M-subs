00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
on that lip so as soon as that is

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.429 
on that lip so as soon as that is
tampered<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.979> will<00:01:53.250> come<00:01:53.909> loose<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.439> the

tampered with it will come loose and the
sapling<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:56.689> extend<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.180> part

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
sapling will extend so we have that part

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.410 
sapling will extend so we have that part
of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> trigger<00:02:00.860> into<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.880> then<00:02:03.119> over

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
of the trigger into there and then over

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
of the trigger into there and then over
here<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.290> tied<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> rope<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:06.360> snare

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
here I tied a rope to a snare

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.240 
here I tied a rope to a snare
so<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.869> get<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> idea<00:02:10.649> something<00:02:11.069> comes

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
so if you get the idea something comes

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.059 
so if you get the idea something comes
in<00:02:11.400> through<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> snare<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.500> pulls<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
in through the snare and it pulls the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.979 
in through the snare and it pulls the
line<00:02:14.220> tight<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.709> hopeful<00:02:17.069> idea<00:02:17.340> is

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
line tight and I the hopeful idea is

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.630 
line tight and I the hopeful idea is
that<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.650> top<00:02:19.830> part<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.190> trigger<00:02:20.400> here

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
that the top part of the trigger here

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.380 
that the top part of the trigger here
will<00:02:20.940> slip<00:02:21.510> out<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.780> place<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:23.239> when<00:02:24.239> that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
will slip out of place and when that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.699 
will slip out of place and when that
happens<00:02:24.720> it'll<00:02:24.989> be<00:02:25.080> nothing<00:02:25.200> holding<00:02:25.590> it

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
happens it'll be nothing holding it

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.520 
happens it'll be nothing holding it
together<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.360> sapling<00:02:27.780> should<00:02:28.019> extend

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
together and the sapling should extend

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.910 
together and the sapling should extend
out<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.420> whole<00:02:30.569> trap<00:02:30.870> should<00:02:31.260> fling<00:02:31.709> into

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
out and the whole trap should fling into

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
out and the whole trap should fling into
the<00:02:32.040> air<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.430> pull<00:02:32.849> whatever<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.239> through<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the air and pull whatever is through the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:03:03.809 
the air and pull whatever is through the
snare<00:02:33.780> with<00:02:34.019> it

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.879
