00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 the people there, beauty fell today I want 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:15.170
 talk a little about what it is about 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.170
 planted is is and aquarium with plants 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.350
 and what happens 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 we see in videos anyway it's some 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:32.099
 utopian planted aquariums business is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 It's really cool, it's really cool, it's just cool. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.710
 because it is an aquarium that needs 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.980
 for you to have a nice aquarium planted 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.020
 it requires a cost of one 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:56.579
 a little higher investment 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:01:00.090
 're too careful but usually when 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.219
 You can do that there is really is 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.439
 an aquarium that has no equal 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.299
 really the aesthetics of an aquarium 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.150
 planted is very beautiful 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:16.470
 It's like I said now you need some 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.240
 and is mainly in the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.200
 injection we need to inject co2 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.630
 in this aquarium is and have a lighting 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.270
 It's different for us to have a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.920
 good growth of these plants is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.840
 independent of the type of plant 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.110
 People are going to have an aquarium planted 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.590
 usually are demanding plants and the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.579
 People need to do is put in. 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.299
 dilute co2 in water 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:02:02.000
 there are 500 different systems there 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:03.659
 injection of CO2 into the water outside the bation 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.420
 care lights 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:13.290
 it's bota okay, so it's a good aquarium 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.370
 complicated but very nice I never 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.620
 I had 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.230
 It's and I would love to have more at the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.650
 financial conditions do not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.790
 The weather is really but I really am 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:34.140
 I would love to have a planted aquarium 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:39.150
 but we can have an aquarium 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.129
 very cool, we have less plants 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.180
 demanding 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.200
 Let's have an aquarium with plants full. 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.049
 of plants 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.549
 if you want to okay but needs a 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.650
 little research 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.650
 ever had're 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.430
 was pretty cool 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.290
 only I so my aquariums I give 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.150
 priority to fish 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.930
 so if you can see that you have 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.750
 one two stones here and I do not have 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.299
 more heart 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.780
 I like fish more than plants 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:24.450
 but I've had aquariums with plants that are 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:28.079
 different from locked aquarium is not 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.930
 It's really cool, even we're not going. 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.609
 speak on plant names this will the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.650
 I like everyone 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:43.310
 There are but a hundred plants 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.780
 need only water lighting 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.959
 for them to grow inside the aquarium 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.819
 it's because the blood's own faeces 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:56.340
 the fish will already walking around the 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:00.599
 some different conditions of humus 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.419
 finally the decomposition of food already 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.769
 will surprise some some nutrients 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.709
 of people 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:12.479
 of these plants then they develop 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:15.510
 well in an aquarium and are easy to 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:18.720
 maintenance is basically 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:23.630
 put them to grow with 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:27.120
 a bacaninha illumination of the people is 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:31.620
 search and see what types of 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.780
 plants are pleasing to you is okay in 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.110
 My opinion is not necessary for you to have 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.699
 an aquarium planted to have an aquarium 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.910
 It is a simple aquarium with 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.260
 some kinds 34 kinds of plants 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.960
 easy maintenance I think the thigh already 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.680
 It's already pretty good. 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.760
 It 's so this information wanted to pass. 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.250
 for you go to an aquarium shop in 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.260
 pet shop give a searched there 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:09.150
 usually the guy will want red 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:13.949
 system cylinder ppe-de 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:18.210
 ok, and do some research on the plants 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:21.690
 will go 10% out of the amount you are going 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.880
 to spend in a planted aquarium is 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.760
