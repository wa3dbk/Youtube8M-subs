00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 dear friends hello in touch 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.799
 Alexey Tsarkov and today I will tell you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.650
 what is bespin west what are you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.840
 represents and where, in principle, come from 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.730
 money why passively and in such 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.560
 quantities 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 I will explain to simple human Russian 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.580
 language here bist invest is a team 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 managers namely managers who 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.830
 involved in sports prediction 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.960
 event sports betting from from here to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.710
 income principle is taken as you decide 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.079
 invest in managers 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.430
 certain amount 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.160
 managers professionally do on 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.920
 this amount is risk free and is shared with 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 by your income as a percentage 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.160
 and the amount is up to 15 and nothing is fixed 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.590
 only the coefficients on rates 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.260
 bookmakers number 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.270
 sporting events every day well and so 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.489
 Further 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 that is why the percentage is not fixed 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.320
 maybe 4 percent maybe 15 conclusion 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.229
 funds occurs on request within 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.750
 one three days and that's exactly the more 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.200
 the managers get more profit 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.600
 we receive and therefore the command 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 professional forecasters best in 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 west she was formed in the ninth 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.790
 year 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.979
 At first, we did not do forecasting 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.640
 sporting events and selling sports 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.079
 forecasts and those who practice 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.869
 used to receive income from the network 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.770
 surely they met social networks 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.200
 or somewhere else 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.950
 because the constant those guys 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.079
 offered their predictions sold and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.869
 and everything is fine she did not earn 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:56.630
 after that the team began to spin 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.700
 customer accounts him lined up huge 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.039
 all because of the fact that his 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.250
 recommendations of other people are always with us 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:08.720
 helped determine their choice 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.830
 and the lineup was so big that 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.920
 the flow of wanting just became disproportionately 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.380
 huge guys just physically became 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.120
 does not manage to manage all the shields of all 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.709
 wanting 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.970
 because you had to go with 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.820
 accounts on the account and when hundreds of them already 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.500
 takes a lot of time 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.660
 it was necessary to move into different 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.360
 bookmakers for each account 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.450
 makes ten to fifteen bets on 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.280
 every day every day 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.380
 stopped taking bills for promotion 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.230
 because physically by the time they don't 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.440
 took it all but the number of people willing 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.750
 get loose in using your account 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 some bookmaker just 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:58.120
 get passive income for some 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.100
 the percentage of their profits for their not these 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.850
 services 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:07.900
 she did not decrease then the team beast 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.840
 invest best in west so it is beasts 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.020
 invest and the idea arose scale 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.180
 unwind accounts of all comers and 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.640
 attention in January 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.330
 January 28, 2014 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.340
 they created a project best in west which 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.580
 we get 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.130
 passive income trust their money 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.900
 professional of the business you 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.030
 they in turn increases believe 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.700
 give part of the profits to all participants 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.750
 project in the form of percent to 15 percent 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.110
 per day that's why the percentage is not 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.150
 fixed dependent odds ratio 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.880
 became as I said the same sports 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.400
 events quantity and so on like this 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.470
 everything just guys released a lot 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.470
 their time and given the opportunity 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.660
 receive passive income 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.230
 bookmaker among each without knowledge 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.209
 without experience and without risk and in conclusion you 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.580
 must understand that the amount 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.060
 sporting events are limited amounts 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.769
 Rates are limited by this if you 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.530
 today you do not have time to take this opportunity 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.260
 You can not manage to enter the club and never 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.040
 he in my opinion will be closed 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.380
 I do not even doubt it 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.630
