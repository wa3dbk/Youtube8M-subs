let's<00:00:20.890> take<00:00:21.130> a<00:00:21.160> look<00:00:21.369> inside<00:00:21.520> our<00:00:21.970> machine

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
let's take a look inside our machine

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.390 
let's take a look inside our machine
right<00:00:23.260> here<00:00:23.289> you<00:00:23.619> can<00:00:23.800> see<00:00:23.830> that<00:00:24.190> you're<00:00:24.310> gonna

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
right here you can see that you're gonna

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.730 
right here you can see that you're gonna
have<00:00:24.670> four<00:00:25.000> hard<00:00:25.360> drive<00:00:25.630> bays<00:00:25.900> in<00:00:25.930> front<00:00:26.470> in<00:00:26.650> a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
have four hard drive bays in front in a

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.279 
have four hard drive bays in front in a
2-u<00:00:27.220> form<00:00:27.609> factor<00:00:28.119> means<00:00:28.630> you<00:00:28.720> can<00:00:28.869> fit<00:00:29.050> one

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
2-u form factor means you can fit one

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.500 
2-u form factor means you can fit one
two<00:00:29.830> three<00:00:30.250> four<00:00:30.640> three<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.090> a<00:00:31.150> half<00:00:31.330> inch

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
two three four three and a half inch

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.079 
two three four three and a half inch
SATA<00:00:31.720> hard<00:00:31.990> drives<00:00:32.349> it's<00:00:32.920> half<00:00:33.219> depth<00:00:33.640> so<00:00:33.940> it's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
SATA hard drives it's half depth so it's

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:36.660 
SATA hard drives it's half depth so it's
very<00:00:34.359> low<00:00:34.690> depth<00:00:34.989> at<00:00:35.170> only<00:00:35.289> 18<00:00:35.679> inches<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:36.519> can

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
very low depth at only 18 inches you can

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.969 
very low depth at only 18 inches you can
put<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:36.940> Center<00:00:37.329> mount<00:00:37.539> in<00:00:37.719> a<00:00:37.839> telecom<00:00:38.409> rack<00:00:38.739> or

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:38.979 
put it Center mount in a telecom rack or

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:41.219 
put it Center mount in a telecom rack or
like<00:00:39.550> these<00:00:39.760> racks<00:00:40.030> behind<00:00:40.269> us<00:00:40.629> we<00:00:40.809> can

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
like these racks behind us we can

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.319 
like these racks behind us we can
put<00:00:42.010> them<00:00:42.129> front<00:00:42.399> to<00:00:42.550> back<00:00:42.729> so<00:00:42.969> you<00:00:43.059> can<00:00:43.149> fit

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
put them front to back so you can fit

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.910 
put them front to back so you can fit
twice<00:00:43.600> as<00:00:43.780> many<00:00:43.899> servers<00:00:44.199> per<00:00:44.499> rack

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
twice as many servers per rack

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.829 
twice as many servers per rack
so<00:00:45.219> let's<00:00:45.399> unscrew<00:00:45.729> the<00:00:45.940> hard<00:00:46.149> drives<00:00:46.420> here

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
so let's unscrew the hard drives here

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.419 
so let's unscrew the hard drives here
then<00:00:47.440> you'll<00:00:47.530> take<00:00:47.679> a<00:00:47.739> look<00:00:47.889> underneath<00:00:48.190> the

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
then you'll take a look underneath the

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.879 
then you'll take a look underneath the
hard<00:00:48.639> drive<00:00:48.879> tray<00:00:49.210> you've<00:00:49.929> got<00:00:50.139> two<00:00:50.499> quad-core

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:50.889

management as well the reason this is

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.340 
management as well the reason this is
going<00:05:54.710> so<00:05:55.039> fault<00:05:55.690> slow<00:05:56.690> is<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.139> have

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
going so fault slow is that you have
