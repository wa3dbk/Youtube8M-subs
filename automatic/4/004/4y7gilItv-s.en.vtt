00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.880
 I'm sonia and with this video 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.000
 I want to talk to you about something 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.540
 mine very much yours yours is ours 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.340
 self realization and I mean al 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.769
 world of promoting more one 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.470
 deeper listening than one's own 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.859
 needs and dreams 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.880
 beyond social and moral stereotypes 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.040
 of our fears 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.070
 thanks to the many jobs I have done in 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.420
 Italy abroad to my passions e 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.649
 also to my character 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.559
 I really got to know 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.680
 so many people and I got to 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.570
 to note that not only most 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.059
 part of us do not live a life there 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.910
 it satisfies but above all how many of us 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.059
 they don't really know what they want 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.530
 the speeches are more or less always of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:02.010
 this kind of life goes to the world 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.660
 it's hard impossible or here we have a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.920
 classic that when asked at 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.200
 people like going forward and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.560
 several other words than how to say 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.450
 indicate to stop dreaming 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.150
 re-enter the lines and adapt the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 own life to what is reality 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.659
 according to the common thought, you are there 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.850
 came to the conclusion that these 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.430
 thoughts these words repeated not 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.380
 they can really improve your life e 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.229
 that of the people around you 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.170
 and you make a change but you feel yourself 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.090
 a bit crazy to believe you want to do it 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.670
 here is my suggestion you mad me 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.130
 invitation never give up on yourself e 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 to his little big dreams too 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.570
 when they tell you that it is impossible too 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.820
 when they tell you that you are dreaming 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.000
 too big is that you don't have any 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.790
 ability that you have to make do with 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.820
 or that the world is going so far but 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.009
 especially when you repeat all these 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.950
 things to yourself because if I had 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.960
 heard even one or more of these 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.820
 advice 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.440
 I probably wouldn't have done it 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.350
 wonderful experiences they now do 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.090
 part of my personal and non-personal baggage 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.560
 I would have had just meetings 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.260
 they changed lives 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.300
 so ask yourself what I want 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.690
 say it aloud feel free to 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.060
 say let it go for a second if but 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.470
 the impossible possible and tell me 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.110
 I started telling myself 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.750
 in 2009 with what I call the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.940
 table of desires 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.850
 I have collected all the images that I have 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.220
 they make you feel happy and satisfied 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.700
 are practically my own 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.980
 dreams 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.110
 whenever i look at these table i 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.950
 feel full of energy gives me a charge 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.920
 emotional is crazy and adrenaline 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.380
 guess from 2009 to this part I can 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.960
 confirm to have touched in person 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.860
 every single experience represented by 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.290
 those images 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.460
 in fact I went far beyond mine 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.020
 expectations 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.390
 the ways to start feeling 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.690
 I really made a lot of you 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.660
 invite to read search discover 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.540
 travel but above all what much more 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.910
 important they have limited knowledge 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.990
 intellectual theorist 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.440
 experience it, throw your test on it 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.510
 skin 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.270
 if you are already following yourself and yours 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.460
 dreams and you feel fulfilled I invite you 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.790
 to continue to do so because the appears 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.230
 my 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.420
 the world needs happy people 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.810
 realized and paid because one 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.910
 happy person is a free person and 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.550
 a free person is a non person 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.680
 manipulable and even imagine what 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.830
 it could happen if everyone 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.510
 we were happy and not manipulable 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.310
 finally only because they were spoken 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.170
 enough I want you to leave a 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.410
 thought of my last trip in 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.140
 africa in tanzania tanzania is the 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.260
 land of mass 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.540
 the Masai are a very wary people 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.780
 towards the understandable white man 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.329
 anyway, I don't know how my own 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.160
 sister and the other girls who were in 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.350
 journey with us we were able to 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.120
 win the trust of one of these 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.770
 tribe that he willingly accepted 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.010
 to respond to our thirst for 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.110
 knowledge about their culture 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.150
 during the dialogue with this but you know there 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.480
 we realized what it is for 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.250
 them the maximum of masa realization 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.710
 in an image also what it could 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.660
 have in a society like ours the 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.690
 maximum well-being the maximum of 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.960
 realization according to a masai and have 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.100
 more holes possible and more ways possible 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.220
 so I wondered but if it was me 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.140
 that but you know if there was an out there 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.080
 stage of well-being and 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.240
 even greater self-realization than 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.400
 those that I imagine for myself and 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.950
 if I tried, imagine it if I tried to 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.110
 create it as my life would change 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.880
 how my horizons would open up 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.320
 I thank you because yours 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.600
 display will allow me to 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.490
 I hope to participate in a very event 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.030
 important for me to make my own 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.650
 dreams I thank you again and I wish you 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.900

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.710
 insight made italy pays with yours 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.710
 social impact
