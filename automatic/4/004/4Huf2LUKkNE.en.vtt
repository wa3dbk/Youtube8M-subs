be a lot of I think that's going to be a
lot<00:00:42.520> of<00:00:42.550> carnage<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.300> hopefully<00:00:44.200> we<00:00:44.290> can

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
lot of carnage and hopefully we can

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.280 
lot of carnage and hopefully we can
avoid<00:00:44.500> that<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:46.570> ourselves<00:00:46.690> up<00:00:47.050> on<00:00:47.200> the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
avoid that and get ourselves up on the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.020 
avoid that and get ourselves up on the
podium<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.829> hopefully<00:00:48.430> on<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.550> top<00:00:48.790> spot

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030
