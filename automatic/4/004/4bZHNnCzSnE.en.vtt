but<00:01:14.740> for<00:01:14.770> me<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.369> find<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.090> very<00:01:16.180> hard<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.620> be<00:01:17.770> in

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
but for me I find it very hard to be in

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.860 
but for me I find it very hard to be in
my<00:01:17.950> authentic<00:01:18.490> self<00:01:18.760> when<00:01:19.090> I'm<00:01:19.210> just<00:01:19.479> alone

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
my authentic self when I'm just alone

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.600 
my authentic self when I'm just alone
with<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.229> camera<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:20.830> like<00:01:21.010> bright<00:01:21.580> lights

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
with the camera and like bright lights

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.300 
with the camera and like bright lights
on<00:01:22.060> me<00:01:22.299> I<00:01:22.570> lose<00:01:23.170> my<00:01:23.440> train<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.710> thought<00:01:23.830> like<00:01:24.190> my

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
on me I lose my train of thought like my

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.160 
on me I lose my train of thought like my
brain<00:01:24.580> just<00:01:24.610> goes<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.180> mush<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.690> I<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.140> a

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
brain just goes to mush and I have a

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.010 
brain just goes to mush and I have a
hard<00:01:26.440> time<00:01:26.670> formulating<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.729> sentence<00:01:28.150> it's

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
hard time formulating a sentence it's

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.590 
hard time formulating a sentence it's
hard<00:01:29.290> for<00:01:29.440> me<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:29.830> I<00:01:29.860> decided<00:01:30.040> that<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:31.060> would<00:01:31.210> do

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
hard for me so I decided that I would do

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.420 
hard for me so I decided that I would do
a<00:01:31.630> question<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:32.290> answer<00:01:32.409> with<00:01:32.979> someone<00:01:33.280> else

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
a question and answer with someone else

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.670 
a question and answer with someone else
so<00:01:33.549> it'll<00:01:33.880> be<00:01:34.060> kind<00:01:34.420> of<00:01:34.510> like<00:01:34.570> an<00:01:34.900> interview

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
so it'll be kind of like an interview

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.830 
so it'll be kind of like an interview
style<00:01:35.920> but<00:01:36.460> you'll<00:01:36.580> also<00:01:36.760> get<00:01:37.060> their<00:01:37.330> opinion

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
style but you'll also get their opinion

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.890 
style but you'll also get their opinion
and<00:01:38.049> you'll<00:01:38.860> get<00:01:39.310> sharing<00:01:40.119> stories<00:01:40.390> back<00:01:40.720> and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
and you'll get sharing stories back and

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.050 
and you'll get sharing stories back and
forth<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.409> think<00:01:41.770> it'll<00:01:41.920> just<00:01:41.979> keep<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.880> very

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
forth so I think it'll just keep it very

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.640 
forth so I think it'll just keep it very
genuine<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.900> you'll<00:01:43.990> see<00:01:44.170> what<00:01:44.350> I'm<00:01:44.439> actually

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
genuine and you'll see what I'm actually

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.090 
genuine and you'll see what I'm actually
like<00:01:45.520> in<00:01:45.790> my<00:01:45.939> real<00:01:46.479> life<00:01:46.540> relationships<00:01:47.439> so
