protectors I have a motion is or glass
on<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.190> right<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.940> as<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.240> guys<00:01:12.299> can

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
on here right now and as you guys can

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000 
on here right now and as you guys can
see<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.690> case<00:01:12.900> doesn't<00:01:13.170> affect<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:13.860> all

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
see the case doesn't affect it at all

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.500 
see the case doesn't affect it at all
because<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.610> borders<00:01:14.909> don't<00:01:15.150> actually

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
because the borders don't actually

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.149 
because the borders don't actually
overlap<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> curved<00:01:16.350> edge<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> glasses

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
overlap the curved edge of the glasses

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
overlap the curved edge of the glasses
for<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.580> iPhone<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.479> protectors<00:01:18.840> aren't

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.490 
case fits in case is an excellent job
ensuring<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:47.940> case<00:02:48.150> fits<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.780> glove<00:02:48.870> now

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
ensuring this case fits like a glove now

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.350 
ensuring this case fits like a glove now
every<00:02:49.830> case<00:02:50.010> fits<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:50.850> just<00:02:50.880> fits

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
every case fits but this one just fits

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.150 
every case fits but this one just fits
perfectly<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:52.230> inner<00:02:52.410> silicone<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.130> rubber

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
perfectly the inner silicone or rubber

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.470 
perfectly the inner silicone or rubber
material<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.760> wraps<00:02:53.970> around<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.360> iPhone

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
material that wraps around the iPhone

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.660 
material that wraps around the iPhone
pretty<00:02:55.350> much<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.620> seals<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.430> place

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
pretty much just seals it in place

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.100 
pretty much just seals it in place
there's<00:02:56.910> no<00:02:56.970> gaps<00:02:57.240> or<00:02:57.450> anything<00:02:57.600> like<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.840> so

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
there's no gaps or anything like that so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.630 
there's no gaps or anything like that so
doesn't<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.470> we<00:02:58.650> can't<00:02:58.920> get<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.220> between<00:02:59.490> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
doesn't that we can't get in between the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.790 
doesn't that we can't get in between the
phone<00:02:59.820> and<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.030> case<00:03:00.300> enters<00:03:01.140> any<00:03:01.260> columns<00:03:01.710> or

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
although the matte finish is something I

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.590 
although the matte finish is something I
do<00:03:04.530> prefer<00:03:04.890> over<00:03:05.070> glossy<00:03:05.640> finishes<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.450> one
