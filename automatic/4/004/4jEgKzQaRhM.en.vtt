worm compost and they're growing in
castings<00:02:37.450> almost<00:02:37.780> pure<00:02:38.230> castings<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:39.090> few

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
castings almost pure castings a few

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.780 
castings almost pure castings a few
inches<00:02:40.240> down<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.920> everything<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:42.400> kind

inches down and so everything just kind
of<00:02:42.820> grows<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.270> crazy<00:02:43.300> now<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
of grows like crazy now this is the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.800 
of grows like crazy now this is the
northwest<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.640> we<00:02:45.850> don't<00:02:46.060> grow<00:02:46.300> avocado

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810

trees<00:02:47.140> but<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.620> tree<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.190> is<00:02:48.760> from<00:02:49.060> last

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
trees but this tree here is from last

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.500 
trees but this tree here is from last
year<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.430> compost<00:02:51.880> kept<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.209> warm<00:02:52.360> enough

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.790 
year so the compost kept it warm enough
to<00:02:53.340> keep<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.489> alive<00:02:55.050> we'll<00:02:56.050> see<00:02:56.320> what<00:02:56.620> happens

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
to keep it alive we'll see what happens

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.760 
to keep it alive we'll see what happens
next<00:02:57.220> year<00:02:57.550> or<00:02:57.989> maybe<00:02:58.989> someone<00:02:59.380> will<00:02:59.440> come<00:02:59.590> dig

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770
