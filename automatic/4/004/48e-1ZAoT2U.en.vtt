00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
come back you know this started as a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.450 
come back you know this started as a
Canada<00:00:16.289> Cup<00:00:16.470> back<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.710> nineteen<00:00:17.130> seventy<00:00:17.430> six

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
Canada Cup back in nineteen seventy six

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.070 
Canada Cup back in nineteen seventy six
and<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.000> was<00:00:18.090> about<00:00:18.270> every<00:00:18.570> three<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:18.930> four

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
and it was about every three or four

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.710 
and it was about every three or four
years<00:00:19.609> the<00:00:20.609> last<00:00:20.640> then<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.330> had<00:00:21.480> then<00:00:21.689> it

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
years the last then we had then it

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720 
years the last then we had then it
changed<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> world<00:00:22.410> cup<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> hockey<00:00:22.800> 1996

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
changed the world cup of hockey 1996

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.279 
changed the world cup of hockey 1996
when<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> u.s.<00:00:24.210> upset<00:00:24.630> Canada<00:00:25.050> then<00:00:25.199> we

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
when the u.s. upset Canada then we

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.779 
when the u.s. upset Canada then we
didn't<00:00:25.500> have<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.769> until<00:00:25.949> two<00:00:26.160> thousand<00:00:26.580> four

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
didn't have one until two thousand four

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.790 
didn't have one until two thousand four
and<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:27.630> we're<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.080> 12<00:00:28.380> years<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.769> I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and now we're going to go 12 years and I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740 
and now we're going to go 12 years and I
think<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.099> reason<00:00:29.130> why<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.720> no

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
think the reason why there was no

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.060 
think the reason why there was no
tournament<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.529> long<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> period

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
tournament for that long a period

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.090 
tournament for that long a period
because<00:00:32.550> there<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.530> kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.770> heated

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
because there was a kind of that heated

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.729 
because there was a kind of that heated
battle<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.880> Labor<00:00:36.360> battle<00:00:36.750> between<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.170> NHLPA

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
battle of Labor battle between the NHLPA

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
battle of Labor battle between the NHLPA
in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> NHL<00:00:38.309> they<00:00:38.879> had<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.239> things<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.690> had

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
in the NHL they had more things that had

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
in the NHL they had more things that had
to<00:00:39.930> agree<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.410> course<00:00:40.620> they<00:00:40.739> lost<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.160> season

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
to agree on of course they lost a season

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
to agree on of course they lost a season
there's<00:00:42.329> quite<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> bit<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.840> disagreement<00:00:43.350> they

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
there's quite a bit of disagreement they

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.630 
there's quite a bit of disagreement they
didn't<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.680> along<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.250> they're<00:00:44.460> back

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
didn't get along now they're back

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.830 
didn't get along now they're back
they've<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> 10-year<00:00:45.629> agreement

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
they've got the 10-year agreement

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
they've got the 10-year agreement
there's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> labor<00:00:46.739> harmony<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.610> they

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
there's a lot of labor harmony so they

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
there's a lot of labor harmony so they
worked<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.450> part<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.930> it's

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
worked this out as part of that and it's

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.930 
worked this out as part of that and it's
good<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:49.950> tournament<00:00:50.280> come<00:00:50.489> back

tournaments all about yes it's at an
awkward<00:01:01.680> time<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> beginning<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
awkward time at the beginning of a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.260 
awkward time at the beginning of a
season<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:04.110> still<00:01:04.619> once<00:01:05.339> they<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
season but still once they get going you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
season but still once they get going you
see<00:01:06.450> some<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.780> best<00:01:06.990> hockey<00:01:07.229> emerge<00:01:07.619> yeah

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
see some of that best hockey emerge yeah

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.710 
see some of that best hockey emerge yeah
it<00:01:08.430> certainly<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> feels<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.510> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it certainly is it feels like that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690 
it certainly is it feels like that
battle<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.530> supremacy<00:01:10.740> much<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
battle for supremacy much like the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.330 
battle for supremacy much like the
Olympics<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.479> any<00:01:12.630> way<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:12.960> well<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.710> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
Olympics in any way as well so you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
Olympics in any way as well so you
mentioned<00:01:14.520> why<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.180> bringing<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.659> back

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
mentioned why are they bringing it back

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.350 
mentioned why are they bringing it back
now<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.500> relations<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.280> better<00:01:17.490> well

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
now is it that relations are better well

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.969 
now is it that relations are better well
I<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:18.570> there's<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> number<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.470> reasons<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
I think there's a number of reasons you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.249 
I think there's a number of reasons you
have<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.700> big<00:01:20.909> thing<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.270> relations<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
have one big thing is the relations this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.160 
have one big thing is the relations this
is<00:01:22.350> another<00:01:22.500> way<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.850> grow<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> game<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
is another way to grow the game have the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
is another way to grow the game have the
best<00:01:25.350> players<00:01:25.650> play<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.430> something<00:01:26.850> different

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
best players play do something different

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.640 
best players play do something different
you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.720> we're<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> dog<00:01:28.200> days<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650

could<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.140> imagine<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:23.310> guess<00:03:23.700> Sydney<00:03:23.910> crowd

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
could you imagine I guess Sydney crowd

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.430 
could you imagine I guess Sydney crowd
would<00:03:24.450> be<00:03:24.540> seven<00:03:24.870> years<00:03:25.050> ago<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:25.320> this

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
would be seven years ago if this

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.840 
would be seven years ago if this
tournament<00:03:25.769> was<00:03:25.890> he'd<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.459> play<00:03:26.640> for

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
tournament was he'd have to play for

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.880 
tournament was he'd have to play for
that<00:03:26.910> he<00:03:27.060> couldn't<00:03:27.300> play<00:03:27.390> for<00:03:27.660> Canada<00:03:28.050> and

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
that he couldn't play for Canada and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.560 
that he couldn't play for Canada and
then<00:03:29.190> there's<00:03:29.370> also<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.700> theory<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.120> in

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
then there's also the theory that in

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.240 
then there's also the theory that in
soccer<00:03:30.900> for<00:03:31.140> instance<00:03:31.440> they<00:03:31.800> don't<00:03:31.950> send

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
soccer for instance they don't send

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.340 
soccer for instance they don't send
their<00:03:32.489> best<00:03:32.519> players<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.209> Olympics<00:03:33.630> they

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
their best players to the Olympics they

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.729 
their best players to the Olympics they
send<00:03:34.650> what's<00:03:35.070> called<00:03:35.280> an<00:03:35.370> under-23<00:03:36.090> team<00:03:36.120> and

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
send what's called an under-23 team and

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.680 
send what's called an under-23 team and
is<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:37.950> may<00:03:38.100> be<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.250> prelude<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.970> something

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
is this may be a prelude to something

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.470 
is this may be a prelude to something
that<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.920> NHL<00:03:41.280> will<00:03:41.430> try<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.180> Olympic

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
that the NHL will try with the Olympic

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.390 
that the NHL will try with the Olympic
Games<00:03:42.510> yeah<00:03:43.230> because<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.769> Olympics<00:03:44.160> prove

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
Games yeah because the Olympics prove

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.460 
Games yeah because the Olympics prove
you<00:03:44.640> know<00:03:44.670> they<00:03:45.000> especially<00:03:45.690> for<00:03:46.050> canada<00:03:46.380> in

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
you know they especially for canada in

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.340 
you know they especially for canada in
hockey<00:03:46.500> these<00:03:47.160> memorable<00:03:47.850> moments<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:49.019> so

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
hockey these memorable moments that so

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.170 
hockey these memorable moments that so
many<00:03:49.500> Canadians<00:03:50.070> have<00:03:50.280> emblazoned<00:03:50.850> it's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
many Canadians have emblazoned it's

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.910 
many Canadians have emblazoned it's
strange<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.630> think<00:03:51.780> although<00:03:52.170> those<00:03:52.650> moments

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
strange to think although those moments

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.680 
strange to think although those moments
weren't<00:03:53.280> all<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.580> always<00:03:53.910> there<00:03:54.180> any<00:03:54.420> shell

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
weren't all of it always there any shell

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.820 
weren't all of it always there any shell
kept<00:03:54.959> their<00:03:55.050> players<00:03:55.290> out<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.620> Olympics

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
kept their players out of the Olympics

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.620 
kept their players out of the Olympics
for<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.130> long<00:03:56.310> time<00:03:56.489> do<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.030> think<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.510> this

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
for a long time do you think that this

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.259 
for a long time do you think that this
is<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.840> signal<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.560> we're<00:03:59.280> going<00:03:59.430> back<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.970> no

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
is a signal that we're going back to no

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.940 
is a signal that we're going back to no
more<00:04:00.420> NHL<00:04:00.690> players<00:04:01.110> in<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> Olympics<00:04:01.739> it's

more NHL players in the Olympics it's
it's<00:04:02.130> really<00:04:02.280> tough<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.640> get<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:02.880> read<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.120> it

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
it's really tough to get a read on it

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.750 
it's really tough to get a read on it
we're<00:04:03.480> almost<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.200> year<00:04:04.410> away<00:04:04.590> from<00:04:04.620> from<00:04:05.550> what

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
to go all the way back again it'll be

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.020

very<00:04:18.299> interesting<00:04:18.419> now<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.140> noticed<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.340> few<00:04:20.940> of

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
very interesting now I noticed a few of

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.670 
very interesting now I noticed a few of
the<00:04:21.090> players<00:04:21.359> at<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.930> all-star<00:04:22.140> weekend

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
the players at the all-star weekend

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.100 
the players at the all-star weekend
spoke<00:04:23.039> up<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.460> said<00:04:23.550> we'd<00:04:24.539> like<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.840> go<00:04:24.930> back

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110

and<00:04:25.350> play<00:04:25.470> in<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.590> Olympics<00:04:25.979> again<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.400> I

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
and play in the Olympics again so I

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.160 
and play in the Olympics again so I
think

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
think

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.380 
think
if<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.410> players<00:04:27.650> keep<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.760> pressure<00:04:29.000> on<00:04:29.180> the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
if the players keep the pressure on the
