00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.760
 We humans tend to be obsessed with purity. We wear masks in public 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.400
 when we feel a cold coming on us. Cover with scented soap daily 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 and we're crazy about our hand sanitizer. But no matter how much we take a bath, 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.350
 we sterilize or scrub, despite this we are renumbered by our inner ecosystem. 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.570
 Get to know your "microbiome". 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.570
 The average adult is made up of approximately ten trillion cells, 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.450
 but how much do you think we carry bacteria with you? Billions? Trillion? About a hundred trillion microbes. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.770
 Our skin, hair, mouth and inside our bowels. 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.519
 You, me and everyone on Earth are mostly a microbe. But we were not born that way. 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.559
 We started in a sterile uterus, and we got our first dose of bacteria 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.710
 before we were born. As we walked through the scabbard 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.080
 we swallowed a bit of this guy: He lives in our guts, 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.319
 where it joins the other 600 species that come with our mother's milk. 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:06.660
 Their work? To break down the sugars in milk that we could not digest ourselves. 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.440
 As we embrace and kiss and eat and play in dirt, eventually over a thousand species of bacteria 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.410
 will call our guts home. Soon our little friends begin to drive away bad bacteria 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.280
 and help teach our immune system the difference between good and evil. 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.430
 Microbioma-free mice are much more sick as adults. 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.100
 And children who take too many antibiotics that kill our good bacteria along with the bad ones 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.290
 they are more likely to get asthma and bowel disease later in life. 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.450
 These bacteria just don't protect us - they help us feed. 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.450
 Vitamins like B3, B6, B12 and K are all produced by our microbial friends 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 and used by our bodies. Our microbe goes far beyond our intestines. 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.210
 Antonie van Leeuwenhok became the first person to see our little friends for the first time 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.430
 in 1683, when he scraped the coating from his teeth and put it under the microscope. 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 Even after we brush our teeth, hundreds of species live in our mouths, 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.600
 they fight disease and caries. No two people have the same oral bacteria. 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.390
 You share your mix with everyone you kiss. We thought the sterile lungs were healthy. 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.750
 But there are also bacteria that help prevent asthma and lung infection. 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.789
 We even found them in the ears and arteries and produce antibiotics in our noses. 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:17.640
 And then! Our biggest organ: skin. About a trillion (10 ^ 12) bacteria live 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.590
 around our hair follicle and on the skin. Some play in defense, they do our skin 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.490
 slightly acidic or produce chemicals to keep mushrooms from setting up a trade. 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.220
 Some skin bacteria prefer to live warm, chew in the dark places of our bodies 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.120
 our sebum and sweat and release chemicals that gives us our special. . . "Smell". 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.210
 There's a lot of weird microbiology science we don't understand: Regardless of your age 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.220
 diet, sex, or the place you're from, you probably only have one in three 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.040
 intestinal ecosystems. As blood groups, we share only a handful of gut microbiome species 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.540
 with all people. Did you hear about bacterial mind control? Vag vagus serves as a 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.500
 some direct phone line from our intestines to the brain. And the mice they have 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.200
 friendly bacteria in their guts are quieter and less nervous than those that don't. 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.920
 Here's another special microbial mystery. 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.410
 When you look at all kinds of bacteria on your right hand, only one fifth of them 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.530
 it will also be on your left hand. Even if you do this! 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.150
 All in all, we carry about 20,000 or so human genes and 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.400
 three million bacterial genes. In a sense, we are 1% people and 99% bacteria. 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.800
 Sure, some bacteria are bad, but most of them are just happy, 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.850
 that we are their home and love to stay healthy. 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.580
 If we do not deal with our microbiome as friends, they can rise against us. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
