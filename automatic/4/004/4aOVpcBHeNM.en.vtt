00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

all<00:00:00.750> right<00:00:00.930> in<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.290> video<00:00:01.560> we're<00:00:01.770> going<00:00:01.860> to

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
all right in this video we're going to

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.190 
all right in this video we're going to
look<00:00:02.070> at<00:00:02.250> some<00:00:02.490> examples<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:03.330> dividing

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
look at some examples of dividing

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.590 
look at some examples of dividing
fractions<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.549> divide<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.819> fraction<00:00:06.420> a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
fractions and to divide a fraction a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.530 
fractions and to divide a fraction a
over<00:00:06.839> B<00:00:07.020> divided<00:00:07.680> by<00:00:07.830> C<00:00:08.220> over<00:00:08.250> D<00:00:08.639> we<00:00:09.150> turn<00:00:09.420> it

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
over B divided by C over D we turn it

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.860 
over B divided by C over D we turn it
into<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.750> multiplication<00:00:10.130> problem<00:00:11.130> by<00:00:11.870> writing

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
into a multiplication problem by writing

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.820 
into a multiplication problem by writing
a<00:00:13.200> over<00:00:13.440> B<00:00:13.620> times<00:00:14.519> D<00:00:15.059> over<00:00:15.360> C<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.470> leave<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
a over B times D over C so we leave the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
a over B times D over C so we leave the
first<00:00:17.039> fraction<00:00:17.640> alone<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.539> instead<00:00:18.869> of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
first fraction alone but instead of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.080 
first fraction alone but instead of
division<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:19.740> use<00:00:19.920> multiplication<00:00:20.430> by<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
division we use multiplication by the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.320 
division we use multiplication by the
reciprocal<00:00:21.590> okay<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.340> reciprocal<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
reciprocal okay so the reciprocal of a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
reciprocal okay so the reciprocal of a
fraction<00:00:24.380> you<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.590> take<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> fraction<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
fraction you just take the fraction and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.849 
fraction you just take the fraction and
you<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.760> flip<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.330> over<00:00:27.480> okay<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you just flip it over okay so the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.740 
you just flip it over okay so the
numerator<00:00:29.279> becomes<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.880> denominator<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
numerator becomes the denominator and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.179 
numerator becomes the denominator and
the<00:00:31.019> denominator<00:00:31.050> becomes<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.040> numerator

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the denominator becomes the numerator

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.370 
the denominator becomes the numerator
you<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:33.000> change<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.480> sign<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.140> anything

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
you don't change the sign or do anything

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.959 
you don't change the sign or do anything
else<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:36.239> flip<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> fraction<00:00:37.140> so

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
else just just flip the fraction so

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.270 
else just just flip the fraction so
speaking<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.210> flipping<00:00:39.960> fractions<00:00:40.530> let's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
speaking of flipping fractions let's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.090 
speaking of flipping fractions let's
find<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.820> reciprocals<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.079> each<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.950> these

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
find the reciprocals of each of these

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.729 
find the reciprocals of each of these
numbers<00:00:44.570> well<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.750> first<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.200> relatively

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
numbers well the first one is relatively

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.470 
numbers well the first one is relatively
straightforward<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.610> find<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> reciprocal

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
straightforward to find the reciprocal

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.090 
straightforward to find the reciprocal
of<00:00:48.870> 5<00:00:49.079> over<00:00:49.350> 6<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.100> flip<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.610> 6<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.600> 5<00:00:52.100> but

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
of 5 over 6 we just flip it 6 over 5 but

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.610 
of 5 over 6 we just flip it 6 over 5 but
to<00:00:53.850> find<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> reciprocal<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.960> 3<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.469> one

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
to find the reciprocal of 3 and one

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.529 
to find the reciprocal of 3 and one
fourths<00:00:56.129> we're<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
fourths we're first going to have to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.250 
fourths we're first going to have to
make<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.789> just<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.270> single<00:01:00.300> fraction<00:01:00.750> no

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
make this into just a single fraction no

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.759 
make this into just a single fraction no
mixed<00:01:01.590> number<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.070> 3<00:01:03.059> times<00:01:03.210> 4<00:01:03.600> times<00:01:04.290> 3<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.680> 12

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
mixed number so 3 times 4 times 3 is 12

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.030 
mixed number so 3 times 4 times 3 is 12
plus<00:01:05.430> 1<00:01:06.000> will<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.150> 13

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
plus 1 will be 13

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
plus 1 will be 13
we'll<00:01:08.340> leave<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> denominator<00:01:08.790> alone<00:01:09.270> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
we'll leave the denominator alone so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
we'll leave the denominator alone so
that's<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.140> rewriting<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.490> then<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.790> we

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that's just rewriting but then if we

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.179 
that's just rewriting but then if we
take<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.270> reciprocal<00:01:12.689> now<00:01:13.380> we'll<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.740> flip

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
take the reciprocal now we'll just flip

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.590 
take the reciprocal now we'll just flip
the<00:01:14.400> fraction<00:01:14.610> over<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> 4<00:01:16.590> /<00:01:16.860> 13<00:01:17.090> would<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the fraction over so 4 / 13 would be the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.300 
the fraction over so 4 / 13 would be the
reciprocal<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.250> number<00:01:20.280> 3<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.180> 1/4

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
reciprocal of the number 3 and 1/4

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.550 
reciprocal of the number 3 and 1/4
likewise<00:01:23.509> 6<00:01:24.509> over<00:01:24.780> 5<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
likewise 6 over 5 would be the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.870 
likewise 6 over 5 would be the
reciprocal<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.810> 5<00:01:27.810> over<00:01:28.110> 6<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> let's<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
reciprocal of 5 over 6 so let's do a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.700 
reciprocal of 5 over 6 so let's do a
couple<00:01:30.090> where<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.540> actually<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
couple where we actually have to do the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
couple where we actually have to do the
division<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> let's<00:01:33.450> divide<00:01:33.630> 7<00:01:34.320> over<00:01:34.530> 10<00:01:34.770> /<00:01:35.369> 14

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
division so let's divide 7 over 10 / 14

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.620 
division so let's divide 7 over 10 / 14
over<00:01:36.509> 5<00:01:36.890> well<00:01:37.890> I'm<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> leave<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> first

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
over 5 well I'm going to leave the first

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.960 
over 5 well I'm going to leave the first
one<00:01:39.840> alone<00:01:40.100> my<00:01:41.100> division<00:01:41.670> becomes

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
one alone my division becomes

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.480 
one alone my division becomes
multiplication<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.430> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
multiplication and now I'm just going to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.899 
multiplication and now I'm just going to
flip<00:01:45.350> my<00:01:46.350> fraction<00:01:46.890> upside<00:01:47.070> down<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.700> going

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
flip my fraction upside down I'm going

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.490 
flip my fraction upside down I'm going
to<00:01:47.970> multiply<00:01:48.420> by<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.630> reciprocal

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to multiply by the reciprocal

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.289 
to multiply by the reciprocal
well<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:50.549> we're<00:01:50.790> back<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
well now we're back to just

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.620 
well now we're back to just
multiplication<00:01:52.259> problems<00:01:53.130> well<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:54.450> could

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
multiplication problems well we could

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.929 
multiplication problems well we could
just<00:01:54.810> multiply<00:01:54.960> 7<00:01:55.740> times<00:01:55.770> 5<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:56.670> 10

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
just multiply 7 times 5 and then 10

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.389 
just multiply 7 times 5 and then 10
times<00:01:57.090> 14<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.219> actually

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
times 14 but I see that I can actually

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.060 
times 14 but I see that I can actually
do<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> lot<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.600> simplification<00:02:01.530> first<00:02:01.770> by

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
do a lot of simplification first by

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.270 
do a lot of simplification first by
thinking<00:02:02.820> about<00:02:02.909> common<00:02:03.570> factors<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
thinking about common factors so if I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
thinking about common factors so if I
look<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.579> 7<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.119> 14<00:02:06.360> well<00:02:06.840> 7<00:02:07.530> goes<00:02:07.710> into<00:02:08.009> both

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
look at 7 and 14 well 7 goes into both

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.580 
look at 7 and 14 well 7 goes into both
of<00:02:08.250> those<00:02:08.550> numbers<00:02:08.989> 7<00:02:09.989> divided<00:02:10.470> by<00:02:10.500> 7

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
of those numbers 7 divided by 7

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.510 
of those numbers 7 divided by 7
would<00:02:11.709> leave<00:02:11.920> me<00:02:12.099> with<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.280> one<00:02:13.920> 14/7<00:02:14.920> would

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
would leave me with a one 14/7 would

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.059 
would leave me with a one 14/7 would
leave<00:02:15.700> me<00:02:15.880> with<00:02:15.910> two<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.810> then<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:17.709> can<00:02:17.860> do<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
leave me with two and then we can do the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.850 
leave me with two and then we can do the
same<00:02:18.220> thing<00:02:18.430> with<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> 5<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.209> 10<00:02:19.420> 5<00:02:20.319> divided

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
same thing with a 5 and the 10 5 divided

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.170 
same thing with a 5 and the 10 5 divided
by<00:02:20.890> 5<00:02:21.220> would<00:02:21.580> be<00:02:21.640> 1<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.650> 10<00:02:23.880> divided<00:02:24.880> by<00:02:24.910> 5

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
by 5 would be 1 and 10 divided by 5

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.350 
by 5 would be 1 and 10 divided by 5
would<00:02:25.510> leave<00:02:25.750> us<00:02:25.780> with<00:02:25.930> two

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
would leave us with two

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.050 
would leave us with two
okay<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:29.140> what<00:02:29.800> we're<00:02:29.950> left<00:02:30.099> with<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.400> 1<00:02:30.580> times

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
okay so what we're left with is 1 times

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.380 
okay so what we're left with is 1 times
1<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.930> numerator<00:02:32.110> which<00:02:32.739> is<00:02:32.890> 1<00:02:33.269> let's<00:02:34.269> see

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
1 in the numerator which is 1 let's see

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.990 
1 in the numerator which is 1 let's see
we<00:02:34.540> cancel<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.349> or<00:02:35.470> 10<00:02:35.739> 2<00:02:36.310> times<00:02:36.340> 2<00:02:36.790> would<00:02:36.940> be

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
we cancel that or 10 2 times 2 would be

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.660 
we cancel that or 10 2 times 2 would be
4<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:38.290> now<00:02:38.440> we've<00:02:38.620> done<00:02:38.769> our<00:02:38.830> division<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.519> says

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
4 so now we've done our division it says

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.809 
4 so now we've done our division it says
if<00:02:39.819> we<00:02:39.849> take<00:02:40.000> 7/10<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.170> divide<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.769> by<00:02:41.819> 14

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
if we take 7/10 and divide it by 14

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.060 
if we take 7/10 and divide it by 14
fifths<00:02:43.480> we'll<00:02:44.019> be<00:02:44.170> left<00:02:44.440> with<00:02:45.060> 1/4
