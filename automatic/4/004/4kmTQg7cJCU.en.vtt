00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 good morning to you good morning alfio see 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.820
 what a beautiful vineyard is behind us 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.330
 see beautiful and do not see it not 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.880
 see why it 's not there then 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 what is this discourse after the fortress is 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.869
 become of full age and true other me 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.330
 now it goes on alone it doesn't need 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.240
 of guardians we have thought of making you 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.939
 see how to plant a vineyard ie from 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.010
 when the land is destined to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.920
 vineyard until this comes 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.090
 planted so we are here in one 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.239
 old former macole vineyard fortress 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.820
 planted in 73 in 1975 by Italo 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 zucchini or italo immediately after 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.180
 the acquisition of the farm 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 of the macia and stefano million leave 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.809
 they are thirty years later thirty years later 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.809
 would you say of one 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.950
 now it is therefore nine years that one is 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.410
 been a couple of years with credibility 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.270
 rest without our intervention 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:10.210
 then a year of sowing a cereal 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.950
 course not to do the dumpster for 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.750
 do for oneself that one because also bad 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.630
 Barley coffee is not a plant 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.060
 of alfalfa mixed with one 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.880
 sunflower consociation so we have 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.490
 recreated a fifth beta tried of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 restore consociation of herbaceous crops 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.250
 for a few years ago we nourished him at 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.570
 slow and rest 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.420
 We said of a tree turner 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.850
 that anyway there is a lot of extracts 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.510
 a lot of nutrient consumption 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.770
 of vitality and therefore we must restore life 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.680
 to the ground in some way 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.810
 and now we are going to see also though 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.320
 what kind of soil is under these 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.570
 herbs and the next step of the soil 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.000
 that from being earth that does nothing 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.750
 from morning to evening he goes to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.729
 become land for a vineyard ok stop 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.110
 there, then, with the background noise 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.540
 precisely of these beautiful machines for 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:17.110
 we work earth moving machines 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.770
 we see that where the grass ends it begins 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.330
 the pre worked soil let's say but 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.610
 let's go to see the event here yes 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.920
 it's about land 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.010
 let's look at it kind of ground it is 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.700
 this conglomerates of lilac yes 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.810
 they call 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.819
 said in Italian that also makes rhyme is a 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.079
 ground 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:48.159
 of origin my scenic mixed in a while 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:51.099
 alberese a bit of fitness and a little and 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:55.569
 let me see if there is a small piece in my hand 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.340
 you do this here not because you do it like 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.430
 the no sitter movie figured out shows up 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.180
 the earth that is fine and if he does it 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.849
 we do too 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.139
 ok it seems there is a mixed component of 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.590
 clay and sand and silt maran stone I see 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:14.889
 I be told by us peasants yes 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.760
 mixed between precisely Alberese and Galestro 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.540
 therefore it is a land rather in 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.909
 equilibrium 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.430
 okay because this is the area where the 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.959
 presence of alberese and galestro is 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.510
 rather we say balanced ibra and here 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.150
 it's fine in such a field 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.629
 different techniques must be used for 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.519
 plant a vineyard or it is the same soup 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:43.290
 I don't know 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.209
 what are you referring to no I mean that 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.239
 it is up to today we have a lot of clay 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.219
 sandy and obviously the part of the 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.019
 skeleton favors in the 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:56.609
 soil preparation because anyway 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:04:00.230
 let's say the part of the stones creates a 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:03.299
 bit of drainage during preparation 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.829
 car drainage 13 ships but here's what 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.209
 is meant for drainage perhaps 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.510
 let's see it better we see it 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:14.519
 the place is better, however, the ideal one 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.280
 not to model the surface too much 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.079
 of the plot so no one does 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.759
 move the land to move 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.840
 very much the soil because the layer 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:28.050
 active and 40 cm 50 at most so yes 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.080
 try to keep it where it is 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.830
 need to do a little more moving 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.410
 this active layer is set aside and 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.190
 you can see them from the mountains 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.740
 set aside preserved as one 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.750
 preserve 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.420
 of good soil and then landed where 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.460
 you can where we need to level the 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.660
 land and then later comes 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.970
 reported the soil in the infant and 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.370
 we are going to look for precisely not 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.820
 mix inert soil from that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.640
 active very well at this point e 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.010
 during preparation there is need for 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.630
 do three depths for 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:18.750
 remove the veins of water and there are in the 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.820
 underground it is necessary to regulate the 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.220
 let's say more rain water then 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.350
 coming from the streets make it not 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.990
 flood the vineyard at the time of 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.930
 it rains which is the and the water that 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.000
 roots a firm stand and not of the 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.800
 train of runoff problems of 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.080
 transport and do this what 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.880
 we have to do let's go see it let's go 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.880
 to see it perhaps simpler is so
