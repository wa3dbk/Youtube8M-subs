been around since Starcraft 1 and that's
a<00:00:15.750> testament<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.470> just<00:00:16.710> how<00:00:16.800> effective<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.340> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
a testament of just how effective it is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.480 
a testament of just how effective it is
it<00:00:17.699> still<00:00:17.970> works<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.500> still<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.039> viable

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it still works and it's still a viable

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.509 
it still works and it's still a viable
strategy<00:00:20.960> now<00:00:21.960> what<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.220> does<00:00:23.369> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to go ahead and start creating your

to go ahead and start creating your
spawning<00:00:43.829> pool<00:00:44.210> now<00:00:45.210> after<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:45.899> spawning

spawning pool now after you're spawning

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690 
spawning pool now after you're spawning
pool<00:00:46.379> started<00:00:46.770> creating<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.370> finally

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
pool started creating you can finally

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
pool started creating you can finally
start<00:00:47.940> making<00:00:48.480> additional<00:00:48.899> drones<00:00:49.200> but

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
start making additional drones but

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.510 
start making additional drones but
you're<00:00:49.590> only<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> make<00:00:50.190> two<00:00:50.489> more

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you're only going to make two more

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.459 
you're only going to make two more
drones<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:51.960> first<00:00:52.199> Jones

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
drones as you can see my first Jones

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
drones as you can see my first Jones
coming<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.309> I'm<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.789> ahead<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
coming up and I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.360 
coming up and I'm going to go ahead and
start<00:00:54.239> building<00:00:54.360> my<00:00:54.570> second<00:00:54.960> drone<00:00:55.140> now<00:00:55.370> so

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
start building my second drone now so

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
start building my second drone now so
just<00:00:56.850> two<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.239> drones<00:00:57.600> after<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.230> start

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
just two more drones after you start

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.529 
just two more drones after you start
creating<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.859> spawning<00:00:59.190> pool<00:00:59.399> no<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
creating your spawning pool no more the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.170 
creating your spawning pool no more the
reason<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:02.609> these<00:01:02.969> two

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
reason for this is is with these two

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
reason for this is is with these two
more<00:01:03.329> drones<00:01:03.629> we're<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> 7<00:01:04.710> out

just<00:01:28.020> when<00:01:28.259> he's<00:01:28.439> trying<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> build<00:01:28.979> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
just when he's trying to build this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.819 
just when he's trying to build this
gateway<00:01:29.689> now<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.869> isn't<00:01:31.079> always<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
gateway now this isn't always going to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
gateway now this isn't always going to
the<00:01:32.009> case<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> works<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.299> works

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the case but when it works out it works

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
the case but when it works out it works
out<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> was<00:01:34.619> able<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.890> stop<00:01:35.100> him<00:01:35.340> from

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
out so I was able to stop him from

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.399 
out so I was able to stop him from
building<00:01:35.610> his<00:01:35.790> gateway<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.869> no<00:01:37.049> gateway

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
building his gateway and with no gateway

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.899 
building his gateway and with no gateway
is<00:01:37.590> obviously<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.460> able<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
is obviously not going to be able to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
is obviously not going to be able to
create<00:01:39.090> anything<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.600> stop<00:01:39.810> my<00:01:39.990> stop<00:01:40.710> my<00:01:40.860> rush

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
create anything to stop my stop my rush

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
create anything to stop my stop my rush
here<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.270> my<00:01:42.390> zerglings

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
here now as you can see my zerglings

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.389 
here now as you can see my zerglings
have<00:01:42.990> hatched<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.439> am<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.979> create<00:01:44.250> an

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
have hatched I am going to create an

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.060 
have hatched I am going to create an
overlord<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
overlord so that I can get out of the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.620 
overlord so that I can get out of the
supply<00:01:47.399> cap<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.090> create<00:01:48.509> additional

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
supply cap and create additional

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.010 
supply cap and create additional
zerglings<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.560> reinforce<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.159> initial<00:01:50.700> wave

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
zerglings to reinforce my initial wave

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.389 
zerglings to reinforce my initial wave
so<00:01:52.020> he<00:01:52.200> did<00:01:52.350> finally<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> Gateway<00:01:53.189> down

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
so he did finally get the Gateway down

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.249 
so he did finally get the Gateway down
he<00:01:53.579> managed<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.970> sneak<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> probe<00:01:54.750> around<00:01:55.049> my

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
he managed to sneak the probe around my

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
he managed to sneak the probe around my
drone<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.310> dropped<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> Gateway<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:56.969> did<00:01:57.299> end

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
drone and dropped the Gateway I did end

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.880 
drone and dropped the Gateway I did end
up<00:01:57.570> killing<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.990> probe<00:01:58.259> though<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.680> my

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
up killing the probe though with my

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.520 
up killing the probe though with my
drone<00:01:59.240> but<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.049> gateways<00:02:01.500> not

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
drone but as you can see is gateways not

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.139 
drone but as you can see is gateways not
even<00:02:01.860> halfway<00:02:02.009> finished<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.909> six

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
even halfway finished and the six

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.700 
even halfway finished and the six
Earthlings<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.689> moving<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.079> right<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
Earthlings are moving up right now and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.200 
Earthlings are moving up right now and
they're<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.790> create<00:02:06.000> some

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
they're just going to create some

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.880 
they're just going to create some
devastation<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.350> getting<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.710> nice

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
devastation here going up getting a nice

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.160 
devastation here going up getting a nice
surround<00:02:08.310> here<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.149> pylon<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.869> dropping

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
surround here on this pylon and dropping

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.650 
surround here on this pylon and dropping
it<00:02:10.440> right<00:02:10.649> away

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
it right away

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.210 
it right away
and<00:02:11.959> he<00:02:12.080> calls<00:02:12.319> good<00:02:12.530> game<00:02:12.709> he<00:02:12.920> realizes

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and he calls good game he realizes

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.770 
and he calls good game he realizes
there's<00:02:13.550> nothing<00:02:13.819> he<00:02:13.880> can<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:14.120> right<00:02:14.270> now<00:02:14.330> he

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
there's nothing he can do right now he

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.270 
there's nothing he can do right now he
doesn't<00:02:14.959> even<00:02:15.110> have<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.410> gateway<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.860> make<00:02:16.130> any

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
doesn't even have a gateway to make any

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.210 
doesn't even have a gateway to make any
units<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.030> that's<00:02:18.020> pretty<00:02:18.260> much<00:02:18.319> it

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
units so that's pretty much it

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.070 
units so that's pretty much it
had<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.700> not<00:02:19.760> been<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.180> case<00:02:20.330> though<00:02:20.600> my

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
had that not been the case though my

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.449 
had that not been the case though my
sixer<00:02:21.500> goings<00:02:21.740> would<00:02:21.860> have<00:02:21.950> moved<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
sixer goings would have moved in and

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.610 
sixer goings would have moved in and
done<00:02:22.550> some<00:02:22.730> decent<00:02:23.030> damage<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.690> also<00:02:24.380> have

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
done some decent damage and I also have

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.590 
done some decent damage and I also have
reinforcement<00:02:25.310> circlings<00:02:25.670> than<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:26.030> with

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
reinforcement circlings than that with

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.960 
reinforcement circlings than that with
with<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.500> initial<00:02:27.980> wave<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.430> enough<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
with the initial wave is enough to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.150 
with the initial wave is enough to
typically<00:02:29.480> take<00:02:29.690> someone<00:02:29.989> out<00:02:30.020> he<00:02:30.800> asked<00:02:31.069> me

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
typically take someone out he asked me

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.949 
typically take someone out he asked me
if<00:02:31.250> I'm<00:02:31.370> making<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.700> six<00:02:31.940> pool<00:02:32.150> again<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:32.930> a

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
if I'm making a six pool again this is a

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.690 
if I'm making a six pool again this is a
popular<00:02:33.410> strategy<00:02:33.560> people<00:02:33.920> are<00:02:34.190> aware<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.520> it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
popular strategy people are aware of it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.540 
popular strategy people are aware of it
but<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.000> still<00:02:35.090> effective<00:02:35.630> as<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.870> can<00:02:36.020> see

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
but it's still effective as you can see

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.300 
but it's still effective as you can see
so<00:02:37.550> just<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.000> quick<00:02:38.180> overview<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.980> go<00:02:40.160> ahead

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
so just a quick overview you go ahead

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.210 
so just a quick overview you go ahead
and<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:41.239> start<00:02:42.080> mining<00:02:42.620> right<00:02:42.800> away<00:02:43.040> with

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
and you start mining right away with

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.800 
and you start mining right away with
your<00:02:43.340> six<00:02:43.580> drones<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.120> make<00:02:44.269> more<00:02:44.480> no

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
your six drones you make more no

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.270 
your six drones you make more no
additional<00:02:45.230> drones<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.709> beginning<00:02:46.040> as

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
additional drones in the beginning as

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.390 
additional drones in the beginning as
soon<00:02:46.340> as<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.239> get<00:02:47.860> 200<00:02:48.860> minerals<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.220> make<00:02:49.370> a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
soon as you get 200 minerals you make a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.250 
soon as you get 200 minerals you make a
spawning<00:02:49.760> pool<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.300> then<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.930> make<00:02:51.080> two

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
spawning pool and then you make two

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.660 
spawning pool and then you make two
drones<00:02:51.530> putting<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:51.980> at<00:02:52.070> seven<00:02:52.340> out<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.459> ten

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
drones putting you at seven out of ten

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.520 
drones putting you at seven out of ten
supply<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.330> make<00:02:53.510> six<00:02:53.840> Earthlings<00:02:54.290> and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
supply you make six Earthlings and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.370 
supply you make six Earthlings and
Overlord<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> backup<00:02:55.940> Zerg<00:02:56.180> ones<00:02:56.420> so

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
Overlord and then a backup Zerg ones so

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.870
