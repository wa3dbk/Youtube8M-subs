00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 I have the great pleasure to introduce you 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 today a couple of part 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.330
 extraordinary noc and vincent who are 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.769
 became famous in my neighborhood 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.630
 thanks to kengo ball super shop with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.610
 ice cream because the ice cream the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.740
 goes out but also the ice creams or 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.380
 ladies years pursues her energy that everything 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520
 that but flavors that you have never 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.140
 exceptional taste 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.730
 so we ask them and for the time 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.279
 parties to reinvent the house in 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 spicy bread is the purchase of works that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.949
 will introduce us today and even 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.200
 it's easy to do at home 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 no it's true we really thought that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.770
 way to make sure that everyone 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.629
 can do it and it's true that it has 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.670
 been a bit of a challenge because the house 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.230
 in the house of profits we see it 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.820
 always traditional with a lot of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.350
 sweets and all that is so here we were 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.690
 a little bit more in spices because the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.600
 concept it was to redo the house 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.539
 but with spices and excuses on 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.699
 the house is exactly that and here we 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.270
 find it because lady pink the acagm the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.510
 star anise 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.340
 there is also the clementine that reminds 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.960
 of course Christmas at Kirov quite the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.400
 details are incredible and even 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.320
 windows at your house 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.600
 that is to say and that too we will learn 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 yeah how did you do windows 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.070
 it's just a sugar flowing that did 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.900
 the players have melted on the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.540
 corner of the gas stoves one sinks into the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.310
 light inside 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.860
 it's great why you lie 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.659
 ah yes there nothing yeah it looks like a two 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.729
 perfect manufacturing days then in 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.140
 watch you demonstrate to me how it is 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.700
 So here I 'll show you 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.009
 how do we stick the house eventually 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.729
 I did I made a corner with 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.740
 pastry waxed paper there it's 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.750
 our famous royal ice cream so it's 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.970
 egg whites icing sugar and a little 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.170
 soluble coffee for coloring for 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.509
 that she is about the same color 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.149
 it did not show too much so I take 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.520
 a spoon that I come tight in my 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.780
 body is so see it needs it 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.850
 is still a consistency to it's 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.830
 relatively flexible one year otherwise you 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.330
 are going to annoy you so here's the cornet 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.479
 the corner of the facts it is ice 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.060
 royal before I come the coupe and it's 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.500
 with that we will be able to stick our 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.630
 mullan so we'll show you 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.239
 the step of decorating before cooking in 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 five years so see here it's the walls 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.140
 different parts of the wall that have been 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.290
 decorated before then there we do it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.160
 see the paw and believed so here we take 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.950
 a whole egg 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.390
 in var is made over it also 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.750
 spices in credit was no longer 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.280
 dough 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.140
 so there you see that it was a part 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.720
 walls there me what am I going to do I 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.470
 made the roof so there if I 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.579
 will this basting generously 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.840
 do not hesitate then there you see we 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.760
 takes fast cars are just the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.150
 just stick on it 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.950
 kids that's her voice she does that 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.239
 in family in which fun the house 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.220
 in spicy bread for the family 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.690
 we're going there at the moment it has to be 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.959
 the instinct yes look I did the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.609
 tower 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.380
 I thought it was interesting 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.489
 with white pepper hop I put 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.079
 some peppercorns and eat 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.880
 there are no calculations and I ask them 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.810
 just just like that we 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.430
 makes a fruit pie it's the same 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.750
 thing should not try to calculate like 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.079
 mixing or grapefruit is important 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.060
 it is to give shine and 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.470
 gilding on spices 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.720
 here too what we wanted to tell you 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.280
 before baking to forget pop or 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.389
 this is for the detailed house the with 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.430
 important pieces simply 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.450
 do the windows then we made them 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.650
 because and we because it was the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.690
 look of the house you could do it 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.069
 round anything like shape is 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.060
 now in the oven what is this menu 350 that 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.769
 did about 15 minutes that they have 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.430
 baked 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.310
 now we see that we fix 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.870
 windows the debts step very easy 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.500
 very easy anyone is able to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.330
 do it at home 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.830
 it's just from the south that I melt 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.790
 in a saucepan with a little bit 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.890
 of water in them so that they are a little 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.239
 liquid whose super hot clermont I 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.750
 loved my pieces that are there and I 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.130
 start to inverted with a spoon 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.840
 the most delicately to allow on 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.280
 the voice cookie if you notice them 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.720
 forms of spicy bread we put them on 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.510
 parchment paper 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.370
 it is to make it easier when we go 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.620
 take off the different walls of the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.510
 house for the windows we leave that 1 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.430
 5-10 minutes it's ok it's over 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.769
 the benefits of also doing its 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.690
 cool windows and it boosts against 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.920
 spicy bread pieces make you see 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.320
 how do we assemble the two walls of 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.880
 side of walls and then after the same thing 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.040
 for all sides so I'm going 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.410
 directly with my royal ice on the 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.070
 side of the wall I have a paste directly 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.470
 on parchment paper my second 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.950
 step I put a little bit here so 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.830
 same thing for this one and we redo the 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:41.530
 attached and if we also want to help 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.820
 bear until it sticks 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.560
 see why they say it takes 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.940
 at least two days of work on the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.380
 time to assemble the walls the time of 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.120
 decorations and we must really leave well 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.370
 to dry the royal ice is white 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.930
 of egg sugar icing at the end of two 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.000
 days it's hard as stone so 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.650
 there worry is better are 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.919
 perfectly stick and we chose to 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.450
 decorate them with tracks but go 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.520
 with your imagination you can 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.800
 use dreamers 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.780
 fines and still candies 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.280
 also for less than 100 smile ben 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.780
 this is christmas make you happy 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.280
 take the time to do it with the 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.289
 kids and all that they're really going 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.060
 very pepy that's what makes the magic of 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.960
 Christmas in leaving them memories 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.960
 in the future
