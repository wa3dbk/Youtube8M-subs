 Today we will have the theme of construction 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.170
 lair park can be said quite 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.789
 not a common theme but, in principle, and for 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.530
 the communists theme are corrected people 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.150
 we have 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.280
 machine tools 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.370
 so dear friends the contest came up 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.320
 the end let's see what's presented 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.870
 We will probably start the participants with dark 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.100
 steel and we see impregnable here 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.640
 the fortress can even say so 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.530
 fenced with lava 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.590
 yes there are no fences here in 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.990
 Mainly holds the position of lava and in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.450
 the heart is such a let even a fortress 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.760
 here we can see the shaman's house as 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.600
 the participant himself told us also if 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.400
 let's go further viewing tower and arches 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:56.489
 ranig it like i was handed it here 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.320
 generally sacrifices or vice versa 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.810
 executed but something like that in general 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.989
 colors inquisition in one word and here we are 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.520
 we can look generally in general like this 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.130
 everything looks can say very cool 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.170
 just as general as a general impression 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.120
 all in a bunch to collect and nice eye 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.520
 let's say so let's see now what 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.060
 we were building a bazooka on the edge of a black 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.010
 wool is such a homemade mountain in 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.170
 the center of it we can see 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.810
 lava katoror if you fly away I 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.450
 I can not find the entrance where is the entrance or 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.730
 there is no entrance there is only one mountain 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.430
 well anyway i do and here is the entrance 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.090
 damn cool what an inconspicuous entrance like 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.070
 time that is necessary 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.989
 and here yes there is something real going on 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.269
 this table give where our dinner 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.760
 favorite brand chandelier as you can see all 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.820
 Feng Shui is great and we can also see 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.320
 this is purely chinese chinese 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.079
 little corner you can even say 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.489
 oh nigga here is where to keep it 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.000
 even take your stuff recently too 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.570
 moved here with us rain and glory yes 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.450
 see 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.579
 the prisoner which kept the prisoner who 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.190
 locked in this cell avoid all the same 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.800
 fail from here to cool basically 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.790
 I really liked it very cool 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.620
 let's see now what is it for us 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.380
 made an apple on we send out alas wool we 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.240
 see first the fence but generally very from 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.880
 In general, I like the most here 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.340
 this one and the whole composition 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.830
 watch can also notice here in 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.640
 lava canyon lobov and krator or rather 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:42.100
 also such a mountain let's see what 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.340
 we have inside inside inside of this mountain 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.090
 tags 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.870
 But they did not have time to come yet 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.360
 will not interfere 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.240
 scati-re squeeze 100 minutes is wrong 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.860
 a lot of it let's go now see what for 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.580
 did we do so what if this department and I on 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.750
 red wool 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.330
 here we can notice very very 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.030
 many different things here since 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.860
 this little crater here 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.720
 it is different that he is small all such 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.050
 big mountains 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.510
 let's go inside that too me 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.120
 it seems they do n't drink the water of the arch at all they 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.870
 they drink lava from them they don't need sources 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.300
 water let's see what we have here 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.750
 such a small house where the town hall live 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.970
 our arches are not our mink and let's say 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.540
 so in the center we see the totem 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.330
 sacrifices put their heads here 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.320
 enemies do we have here, we can also 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.820
 notice such 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.330
 the orc bedroom and in principle here too 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.060
 the most 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.100
 such bedrooms are exactly three identical houses 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.130
 but what's the plus of these three houses 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.620
 I can say that they are very similar to 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.600
 just houses from warcraft and who who 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.000
 played warcraft at once at the arch there on 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.830
 development will understand me so to speak 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.080
 Now Iâ€™ll probably say common words 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.870
 general impressions of all the buildings are not they 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.520
 in general, really liked it because 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.930
 the topic was quite complicated 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.780
 interesting and I can say that friends who 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.360

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.169
