scanner<00:02:40.139> works

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.640 

you<00:02:45.580> put<00:02:45.760> your<00:02:45.880> feet<00:02:46.060> on<00:02:46.090> these<00:02:46.390> spots<00:02:46.720> hold<00:02:47.440> on

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
you put your feet on these spots hold on

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.400 
you put your feet on these spots hold on
to<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.830> handles<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.340> look<00:02:48.580> straight<00:02:48.730> ahead

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
to the handles and look straight ahead

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.390 
to the handles and look straight ahead
normally<00:02:50.410> you'd<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.680> your<00:02:50.800> kid<00:02:51.010> off<00:02:51.160> and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
normally you'd have your kid off and

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.100 
normally you'd have your kid off and
just<00:02:51.520> be<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.700> your<00:02:51.790> underwear<00:02:52.270> but<00:02:52.690> i'll<00:02:52.780> spare

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
just be in your underwear but i'll spare

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.620 
just be in your underwear but i'll spare
you<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.260> there's<00:02:54.100> 24<00:02:54.640> senses<00:02:55.120> around<00:02:55.450> this

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
you that there's 24 senses around this

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.350 
you that there's 24 senses around this
pod<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.080> captured<00:02:56.640> 200,000<00:02:57.640> data<00:02:57.850> points<00:02:58.240> on

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
pod that captured 200,000 data points on

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.870 
pod that captured 200,000 data points on
my<00:02:58.540> body<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.470> software<00:03:00.070> then<00:03:00.280> translates

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
my body the software then translates

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.210 
my body the software then translates
that<00:03:01.060> into<00:03:01.120> 200<00:03:01.750> body<00:03:02.020> measurements<00:03:02.680> which<00:03:03.070> is

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
that into 200 body measurements which is

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.710 
that into 200 body measurements which is
accurate<00:03:03.790> down<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.300> millimeter<00:03:06.720> body

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
accurate down to the millimeter body

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.040 
accurate down to the millimeter body
measurements<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.120> quick<00:03:10.360> fun<00:03:10.750> process

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
measurements it's a quick fun process

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.230 
measurements it's a quick fun process
that<00:03:11.680> takes<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.130> embarrassment<00:03:12.730> factor<00:03:12.910> out

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
that takes the embarrassment factor out

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.200 
that takes the embarrassment factor out
of<00:03:13.300> being<00:03:13.720> measured<00:03:13.960> up<00:03:14.310> although<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.790> 3d

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
of being measured up although the 3d

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
image created by the scanner is a little

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.560 
image created by the scanner is a little
unflattering<00:03:19.800> that's<00:03:20.800> your<00:03:21.190> buddy<00:03:21.400> that's<00:03:22.390> my

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
buddy's game yeah really okay what's all

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.720 
buddy's game yeah really okay what's all
that<00:03:25.960> information<00:03:26.290> is<00:03:26.830> in<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.070> system<00:03:27.310> a

that information is in the system a

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.730 
that information is in the system a
digital<00:03:28.420> pattern<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.810> created<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:29.380> sent<00:03:29.620> off

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
digital pattern is created and sent off

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.920 
digital pattern is created and sent off
