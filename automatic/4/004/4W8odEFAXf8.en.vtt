that<00:02:07.190> was<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.520> short<00:02:07.790> punt<00:02:08.060> back<00:02:08.270> then<00:02:08.510> I

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
that was a short punt back then I

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.590 
that was a short punt back then I
remember<00:02:10.070> this<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.429> think<00:02:10.730> like<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:11.180> lot<00:02:11.390> of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
remember this that I think like a lot of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.740 
remember this that I think like a lot of
the<00:02:11.720> cards<00:02:12.020> are<00:02:12.110> numbered<00:02:12.350> of<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.590> 5500<00:02:13.750> so

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the cards are numbered of like 5500 so

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.690 
the cards are numbered of like 5500 so
if<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.960> got<00:02:15.110> one<00:02:15.290> 2<00:02:15.380> for<00:02:15.590> 4<00:02:15.920> 99<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.490> think

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
if you got one 2 for 4 99 I think

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.650 
if you got one 2 for 4 99 I think
something<00:02:16.940> might<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.120> been<00:02:17.150> number<00:02:17.420> 28

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
something might have been number 28

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.470 
something might have been number 28
thousand<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:19.190> if<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.430> got<00:02:19.550> one<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> 499<00:02:20.210> that

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
thousand so if you got one to 499 that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.540 
thousand so if you got one to 499 that
was<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.600> short<00:02:20.810> print<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.170> that's<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.550> but

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
was a short print and that's it but

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.920 
was a short print and that's it but
there<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.880> have<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.090> appreciate<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.720> Mike
