00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this is the first time in Europe and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.360 
this is the first time in Europe and
you've<00:00:32.910> got<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> whole<00:00:33.390> line<00:00:33.629> of<00:00:33.920> c-5<00:00:34.920> pedals

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you've got a whole line of c-5 pedals

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.579 
you've got a whole line of c-5 pedals
here<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.699> are<00:00:35.790> sort<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.379> preamp<00:00:37.379> ish

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
here that are sort of preamp ish

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:39.740 
here that are sort of preamp ish
overdrive<00:00:38.280> pedals<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.180> that's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
overdrive pedals is that right that's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
overdrive pedals is that right that's
right<00:00:39.899> yeah<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> used<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> design<00:00:41.399> valve

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
right yeah so I used to design valve

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.630 
right yeah so I used to design valve
amplifiers<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.920> thinking<00:00:44.250> behind<00:00:44.340> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
amplifiers and the thinking behind this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
amplifiers and the thinking behind this
is<00:00:44.790> they're<00:00:44.940> more<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.270> preamps<00:00:45.930> than<00:00:46.110> normal

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
is they're more like preamps than normal

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.330 
is they're more like preamps than normal
pedals<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.129> they're<00:00:47.280> much<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:47.610> responsive

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
pedals so they're much more responsive

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
pedals so they're much more responsive
okay<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.399> when<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.450> were<00:00:51.539> coming<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> were

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
okay so when we were coming in you were

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
okay so when we were coming in you were
playing<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.860> octopus<00:00:53.489> frightened

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
playing I think that octopus frightened

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
playing I think that octopus frightened
us<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.570> love<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> name<00:00:55.079> thank<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
us to love the name thank you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.250 
us to love the name thank you
so<00:00:56.399> tell<00:00:56.640> us<00:00:56.670> about<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.690> one<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> fuzz

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
so tell us about that that one is a fuzz

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.080 
so tell us about that that one is a fuzz
octave<00:00:58.649> pedal<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.250> has<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.910> wide

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
octave pedal but it has a really wide

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.479 
octave pedal but it has a really wide
frequency<00:01:00.390> response<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.859> chords

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
frequency response so you can do chords

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.029 
frequency response so you can do chords
as<00:01:02.670> well<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.680> typical<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:04.890> of

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
as well as just the typical kind of

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.670 
as well as just the typical kind of
hendrix<00:01:05.489> stuff<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.990> could<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.229> told<00:01:07.410> me<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
hendrix stuff you could have told me it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.050 
hendrix stuff you could have told me it
was<00:01:07.830> anything<00:01:08.160> and<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.580> would<00:01:08.759> have<00:01:08.850> believed

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
was anything and I would have believed

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.139 
was anything and I would have believed
you<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.450> can't<00:01:09.690> hear<00:01:09.899> and<00:01:11.149> so

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
you because I can't hear and so

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.620 
you because I can't hear and so
okay<00:01:12.690> so<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.590> octave<00:01:14.220> fuzz<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.539> do

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
okay so it's a an octave fuzz and I do

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.969 
okay so it's a an octave fuzz and I do
want<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.929> dial<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.410> a<00:01:16.440> couple<00:01:16.860> different

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
want to dial in a couple different

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:43.100 
want to dial in a couple different
sounds<00:01:17.640> or

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.310 

what<00:01:44.110> was<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.380> inspiration<00:01:44.710> for<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.400> fella

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
what was the inspiration for this fella

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.560 
what was the inspiration for this fella
it<00:01:47.320> really<00:01:47.680> came<00:01:47.830> about<00:01:47.980> because<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.730> was<00:01:49.210> fed

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
it really came about because I was fed

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.050 
it really came about because I was fed
up<00:01:49.600> with<00:01:49.720> octave<00:01:50.350> pedals<00:01:50.710> tracking<00:01:51.550> too<00:01:51.790> badly

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
up with octave pedals tracking too badly

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.180 
up with octave pedals tracking too badly
they<00:01:52.660> were<00:01:52.720> so<00:01:52.930> unpredictable<00:01:53.080> sometimes<00:01:53.800> it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
they were so unpredictable sometimes it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.190 
they were so unpredictable sometimes it
sounded<00:01:54.490> like<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.670> ring<00:01:54.880> modulator<00:01:55.390> when<00:01:56.170> I

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
sounded like a ring modulator when I

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.260 
sounded like a ring modulator when I
wanted<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.740> be<00:01:56.800> truck<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.280> cleaner<00:01:57.520> so

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
wanted it to be truck and cleaner so

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.240 
wanted it to be truck and cleaner so
it's<00:01:58.420> just<00:01:58.570> got<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.780> much<00:01:58.990> higher<00:01:59.170> frequency

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it's just got a much higher frequency

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.930 
it's just got a much higher frequency
response<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:02.560> what<00:02:03.250> should<00:02:03.340> we<00:02:03.430> look<00:02:03.550> at<00:02:03.700> next

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
response now what should we look at next

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.030 
response now what should we look at next
we'll<00:02:04.810> go<00:02:05.020> along<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.380> lines<00:02:05.530> right<00:02:05.770> King

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
we'll go along the lines right King

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.490 
we'll go along the lines right King
first<00:02:06.280> yeah<00:02:06.730> so<00:02:07.480> this<00:02:07.690> one<00:02:07.900> here<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.320> being

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
first yeah so this one here is being

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.080 
first yeah so this one here is being
used<00:02:08.740> by<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.920> lot<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:09.100> great<00:02:09.280> players<00:02:09.610> out<00:02:09.910> there

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
used by a lot of great players out there

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.450 
used by a lot of great players out there
because<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.450> its<00:02:10.570> dynamic<00:02:11.080> response<00:02:11.500> it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
because of its dynamic response it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:45.369 
because of its dynamic response it
cleans<00:02:12.760> up<00:02:12.970> exceptionally<00:02:13.750> well

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.280 

sounds<00:02:46.379> nice<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:47.219> mentioned<00:02:47.719> earlier<00:02:48.719> a<00:02:48.870> few

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
sounds nice you mentioned earlier a few

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.929 
sounds nice you mentioned earlier a few
players<00:02:49.500> who<00:02:49.650> are<00:02:49.859> using<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.819> other

but<00:03:07.430> cool<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.609> this<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.879> unusual<00:03:09.359> it's

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
but cool so this is unusual it's

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.479 
but cool so this is unusual it's
completely<00:03:09.989> passive<00:03:10.409> no<00:03:10.620> batteries<00:03:11.069> no<00:03:11.250> power

completely passive no batteries no power

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.479 
completely passive no batteries no power
supply<00:03:11.930> it's<00:03:12.930> essentially<00:03:13.379> a<00:03:13.409> clean<00:03:13.799> Activa

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
supply it's essentially a clean Activa

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.970 
supply it's essentially a clean Activa
you<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.299> combine<00:03:15.659> it<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:15.900> boost<00:03:16.290> overdrive

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
you can combine it with boost overdrive

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.399 
you can combine it with boost overdrive
distortion<00:03:17.519> or<00:03:17.939> just<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> dirty<00:03:18.599> amp<00:03:18.780> or<00:03:19.019> you

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
distortion or just the dirty amp or you

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.250 
distortion or just the dirty amp or you
could<00:03:19.560> use<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.739> with<00:03:20.810> pretty<00:03:21.810> much<00:03:21.989> anything

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
could use it with pretty much anything

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.229 
could use it with pretty much anything
even<00:03:22.560> modulation<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.549> I'll<00:03:23.790> show<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.030> it

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
even modulation so I'll show you it

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:35.149 
even modulation so I'll show you it
without<00:03:24.480> any<00:03:24.719> effects<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.349> first

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:52.550 

and<00:03:36.159> then<00:03:36.370> with<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.640> fuzz

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.470 

that's<00:03:53.560> pretty<00:03:53.710> rad<00:03:54.010> are<00:03:54.460> there<00:03:54.700> any<00:03:54.940> internal

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
that's pretty rad are there any internal

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.290 
that's pretty rad are there any internal

essentially<00:05:14.410> darkens<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.040> pickups<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.640> little

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
essentially darkens the pickups a little

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.370 
essentially darkens the pickups a little
bit<00:05:16.030> but<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.270> pushes<00:05:16.630> them<00:05:16.780> harder

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
bit but it pushes them harder

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.860 
bit but it pushes them harder
it's<00:05:18.010> a<00:05:18.100> dirty<00:05:18.340> boost<00:05:18.760> pedal<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:19.510> I'll<00:05:19.660> show

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
it's a dirty boost pedal so I'll show

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.360 
it's a dirty boost pedal so I'll show
you<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.080> in<00:05:20.170> the<00:05:20.260> normal<00:05:20.650> mode<00:05:20.770> which<00:05:21.100> is<00:05:21.250> the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
you it in the normal mode which is the

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:37.170 
you it in the normal mode which is the
flat<00:05:21.580> frequency<00:05:21.880> response

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.640 

again<00:05:38.180> very<00:05:38.420> responsive<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.230> pickup's

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
again very responsive to the pickup's

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.370 
again very responsive to the pickup's
and<00:05:39.980> your<00:05:40.220> volume<00:05:40.490> control<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:42.080> bright

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
and your volume control and the bright

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.080 
and your volume control and the bright
mode<00:05:42.620> instead<00:05:42.890> of<00:05:43.070> adding<00:05:43.190> treble<00:05:43.700> it<00:05:43.850> cuts

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
mode instead of adding treble it cuts

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.550 
mode instead of adding treble it cuts
some<00:05:44.330> of<00:05:44.420> the<00:05:44.480> low-end<00:05:44.870> so<00:05:45.110> you<00:05:45.200> get<00:05:45.380> a<00:05:45.410> bit

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
some of the low-end so you get a bit

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:59.500 
some of the low-end so you get a bit
