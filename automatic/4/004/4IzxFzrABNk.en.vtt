here<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.889> all<00:00:11.400> palm<00:00:11.700> tree<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.059> we're<00:00:12.300> gonna

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
here and all palm tree is we're gonna

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.049 
here and all palm tree is we're gonna
start<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> stock<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.590> our<00:00:14.280> stock<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.849> just

we go just like that and from here we're
going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> start<00:00:25.740> with<00:00:26.010> our<00:00:26.130> main<00:00:26.369> branches

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
going to start with our main branches

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.429 
going to start with our main branches
and<00:00:27.000> that's<00:00:27.119> five<00:00:27.330> smaller<00:00:27.810> dagger<00:00:28.080> strokes

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
and that's five smaller dagger strokes

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.730 
and that's five smaller dagger strokes
coming<00:00:28.800> off<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.949> our<00:00:29.220> main<00:00:29.400> stock<00:00:30.560> I'm<00:00:31.560> gonna

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
coming off of our main stock I'm gonna

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.520 
coming off of our main stock I'm gonna
come<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.270> two<00:00:33.530> three<00:00:34.530> four<00:00:35.510> five<00:00:36.510> now<00:00:36.870> if

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
come here one two three four five now if

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.630

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
you don't know your dagger stroke

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240 
you don't know your dagger stroke
already<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.840> palm<00:00:40.739> tree<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
already this palm tree right here is

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.740 
already this palm tree right here is
going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> take<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.820> twenty<00:00:42.180> minutes<00:00:42.480> or<00:00:42.600> more

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
going to take you twenty minutes or more

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.869 
going to take you twenty minutes or more
to<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.980> once<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.789> down

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
you'll notice I can do these dagger

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.110 
you'll notice I can do these dagger
strokes<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.559> pow<00:00:46.800> pow<00:00:47.070> pow<00:00:47.129> pow<00:00:47.340> pow<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
strokes just pow pow pow pow pow and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.760 
strokes just pow pow pow pow pow and
that's<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> way<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:48.989> really<00:00:49.260> should<00:00:49.500> look

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that's the way they really should look

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.220 
that's the way they really should look
so<00:00:50.399> we've<00:00:50.640> got<00:00:50.820> our<00:00:50.910> five<00:00:51.180> main<00:00:51.840> branches

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so we've got our five main branches

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 
so we've got our five main branches
coming<00:00:52.469> off<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> our<00:00:52.949> palm<00:00:53.190> tree<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:54.000> each<00:00:54.300> one

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
coming off of our palm tree now each one

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
coming off of our palm tree now each one
of<00:00:54.660> these<00:00:54.840> main<00:00:55.800> branches<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.520> gonna<00:00:56.640> have

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
of these main branches are gonna have

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.060 
of these main branches are gonna have
the<00:00:57.059> palm<00:00:57.570> leaves<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.109> these<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.859> more

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the palm leaves and these are just more

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.819 
the palm leaves and these are just more
dagger<00:00:59.430> strokes<00:00:59.760> built<00:01:00.539> into<00:01:00.809> our<00:01:00.840> five<00:01:01.140> main

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
dagger strokes built into our five main

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.529 
dagger strokes built into our five main
strokes<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.300> gonna<00:01:03.420> always

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
strokes right here so I'm gonna always

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.759 
strokes right here so I'm gonna always
start<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> center<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.470> gonna<00:01:04.589> start

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
start the center and I'm gonna start

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.100 
start the center and I'm gonna start
working<00:01:05.220> these<00:01:05.309> things<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.840> when<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> come

here<00:01:08.240> start<00:01:09.240> working<00:01:09.869> these<00:01:10.020> dagger<00:01:10.380> strokes

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
here start working these dagger strokes

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:21.510 
here start working these dagger strokes
out

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.969 

and<00:01:22.060> you'll<00:01:22.240> notice<00:01:22.450> by<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.750> end<00:01:23.079> that<00:01:23.860> our

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
and you'll notice by the end that our

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.370 
and you'll notice by the end that our
five<00:01:24.189> main<00:01:24.549> branches<00:01:25.450> were<00:01:25.600> only<00:01:25.960> actually

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
five main branches were only actually

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.719 
five main branches were only actually
just<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.649> reference<00:01:27.329> for<00:01:28.329> our<00:01:28.360> dagger<00:01:29.140> strokes

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
just a reference for our dagger strokes

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.800 
just a reference for our dagger strokes
so<00:01:30.729> I've<00:01:30.820> got<00:01:30.970> two<00:01:31.180> of<00:01:31.210> them<00:01:31.360> knocked<00:01:31.600> out

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
so I've got two of them knocked out

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.960 
so I've got two of them knocked out
already<00:01:32.100> I'm<00:01:33.100> going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.340> come<00:01:33.490> back<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.820> hit

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
the rest of these three working just a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.249 
the rest of these three working just a
little<00:01:41.170> bit<00:01:41.289> higher<00:01:41.530> than<00:01:41.799> I'm<00:01:41.890> accustomed<00:01:42.220> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
little bit higher than I'm accustomed to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.480 
little bit higher than I'm accustomed to
usually<00:01:44.259> if<00:01:44.350> you're<00:01:44.470> working<00:01:44.710> on<00:01:44.920> an<00:01:45.070> easel<00:01:45.250> I

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
usually if you're working on an easel I

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.850 
usually if you're working on an easel I
recommend<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.000> set<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.360> height<00:01:46.539> to<00:01:46.860> where

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
recommend you set the height to where

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.859 
recommend you set the height to where
you<00:01:47.920> don't<00:01:48.070> have<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.250> reach<00:01:48.490> too<00:01:48.700> high<00:01:48.880> or

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
you don't have to reach too high or

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.899 
you don't have to reach too high or
reach<00:01:50.110> too<00:01:50.350> low<00:01:50.530> because<00:01:51.189> that's<00:01:51.490> gonna<00:01:51.610> mean

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
reach too low because that's gonna mean

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.270 
reach too low because that's gonna mean
inaccurate<00:01:52.570> strokes<00:01:52.929> it's<00:01:53.740> gonna<00:01:53.950> mean<00:01:54.250> that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
inaccurate strokes it's gonna mean that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.039 
inaccurate strokes it's gonna mean that
you're<00:01:54.819> gonna<00:01:54.909> end<00:01:55.149> up<00:01:55.240> with<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.450> lot<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.780> arm

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
you're gonna end up with a lot of arm

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.779
