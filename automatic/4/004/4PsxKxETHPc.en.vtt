00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.929
 I know it's a meal for the party 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.240

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.480

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.510
 like a 3d cinema but maybe if this 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.820
 part of the video like a asshole that I am 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.830
 I deleted it without realizing it, so it happened to 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.120
 apply what is easy, either 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.860
 I lost all the video but good 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.570
 grab the presented you take out all the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.300
 fat you have in the meat and put it 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.730
 with a water pan and discover you 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.989
 add a vegetable stand salt 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.960
 pepper and 1,2 boil it roughly 50 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.990
 60 minutes everything will depend on the size 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.940
 of their weight but when they go to buy what 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.710
 question and the song that he pretty much 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.030
 is going to tell you how long it exhibits 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.430
 cooking spent that time more or less 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.470
 the pincha litanite tenderly because 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.240
 is and this is very important let him 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.190
 cool inside the pan a 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020
 cold vaquita keep it on the hillside and 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.380

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.970
 mix and if you have very thick 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.700
