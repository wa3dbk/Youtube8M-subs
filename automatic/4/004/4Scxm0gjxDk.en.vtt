00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.790
 the oil level is important for the proper functioning of the engine 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.289
 too low an oil level can cause fashion damage 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.339
 we are going to show you how to check that yourself 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.240
 we advise you to check the oil level every month or for a long drive 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.500
 in a normal situation the engine consumes less than one liter of oil per 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.069
 1,000 kilometers 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.069
 to check the debris on the first bonnet 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.380
 in the instruction booklet it is stated where the extraction of the bonnet is from 

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.380
 the car is 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.120
 for most cars the bonnet opens from the front and often it is 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.320
 still protected with a white h 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 make sure that the car is level, make sure that your car is running in the measurement on the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.020
 sidewalk it is enough for a wrong meeting 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.290
 we advise you to measure the oil level with a cold engine 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.150
 this means that the car has stood still for 12 hours if this is not possible 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.740
 we advise you to switch off the engine at least fifteen minutes in advance 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.720
 before you turn the oil pipe in the instruction booklet you can read where 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.440
 the oil dipstick is located 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.490
 Usually the dipstick is recognizable by the fact that you cannot or with you 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.890
 remarkable colours 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 it often falls out mvg they first just with a book 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.010
 insert the belfry group 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.260
 and pay attention that this is completely against the attack I tell stick 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.530
 hermien and read the oil level if the level is below the minimum 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.960
 it is wise to top up the oil 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.250
 the instruction booklet indicates which oil you can use 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.110
 it also appears to be an oil slick spec specifications that you can say 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.840
 with the specifications from the instruction booklet 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.460
 If you do not have the right oil, Tyson always had an oil that worked as well 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.130
 possibly fits him or her plus that also indicate on the back of the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.380
 oil price 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.790
 If you are afraid of spilling with oil then use a funnel 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.350
 when we come to the engine of this we start smoking and the worst case caught fire 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.950
 Of course you also cannot feel without it 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.109
 such a first half a liter in then check the oil level again 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.590
 if the level is still insufficient, then again half a liter with a controlling bell 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.280
 then again 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.250
 if you have used an unknown oil we advise you to have it at the garage 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.709
 have it checked
