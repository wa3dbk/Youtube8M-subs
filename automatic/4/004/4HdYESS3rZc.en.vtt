00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and run the cloning software that it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.450 
and run the cloning software that it
comes<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.250> basically<00:01:32.840> do<00:01:33.840> an<00:01:33.990> image

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460

rated<00:02:16.050> amount<00:02:16.409> so<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:16.950> quite<00:02:17.129> fast

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
rated amount so it's actually quite fast

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.040 
rated amount so it's actually quite fast
here<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:19.290> uncompressible<00:02:20.250> data<00:02:21.050> 171

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
here is the uncompressible data 171

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.960 
here is the uncompressible data 171
Meg's<00:02:22.319> per<00:02:22.830> second<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.550> right<00:02:23.730> which<00:02:23.940> is

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
Meg's per second on the right which is

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.300 
Meg's per second on the right which is
expected<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.960> know

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
expected you know

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.980 
expected you know
when<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.700> comes<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.120> compressed<00:02:26.780> and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
when it comes to compressed and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.610 
when it comes to compressed and
uncompressed<00:02:27.370> data<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:29.080> sequential<00:02:30.080> z'<00:02:30.290> and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
uncompressed data the sequential z' and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.150 
uncompressed data the sequential z' and
the<00:02:31.550> writes<00:02:32.030> will<00:02:32.360> be<00:02:32.540> slightly<00:02:33.020> lower<00:02:33.350> but

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
the writes will be slightly lower but

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.720 
the writes will be slightly lower but
it's<00:02:34.700> definitely<00:02:35.350> above<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:37.069> rated<00:02:37.310> amount

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
it's definitely above the rated amount

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.910 
it's definitely above the rated amount
so<00:02:37.970> they<00:02:38.150> say<00:02:38.330> 450<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.590> definitely

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
so they say 450 and it's definitely

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.910 
so they say 450 and it's definitely
above<00:02:40.280> 450<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.300> did<00:02:41.780> like<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.170> consistency

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
above 450 I did like the consistency

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.130 
above 450 I did like the consistency
though<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.160> did<00:02:43.550> run<00:02:43.730> some<00:02:44.120> further<00:02:44.300> tests<00:02:44.930> on

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
though I did run some further tests on

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.740 
though I did run some further tests on
it<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.800> make<00:02:45.950> sure<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:47.150> know<00:02:47.239> we<00:02:47.390> did<00:02:47.540> get

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
it to make sure that you know we did get

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.490 
it to make sure that you know we did get
good<00:02:48.130> throughput<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:50.000> ATO<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:51.260> disk

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
good throughput and on ATO the disk

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.410 
good throughput and on ATO the disk
benchmark<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.310> choice<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.610> many<00:02:52.970> people<00:02:53.270> use

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
benchmark of choice that many people use

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.050 
benchmark of choice that many people use
these<00:02:53.810> days<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.350> definitely<00:02:55.010> showed<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.880> on

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
these days it definitely showed that on

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.150 
these days it definitely showed that on
the<00:02:56.209> sequential<00:02:56.630> reads<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:57.320> writes<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.800> was

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
the sequential reads and writes it was

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.570 
the sequential reads and writes it was
indeed<00:02:58.910> above<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.200> rated<00:03:00.380> amount<00:03:01.040> all<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
indeed above the rated amount all the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.020 
indeed above the rated amount all the
way<00:03:01.640> up<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:02.290> 551<00:03:03.290> Meg's<00:03:03.920> per<00:03:04.220> second<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.760> the

way up to 551 Meg's per second on the
read<00:03:05.239> which<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.630> quite<00:03:06.140> impressive<00:03:06.470> for<00:03:06.980> this

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610
