think I scored in my career but Gordon

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.880 
think I scored in my career but Gordon
was<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.079> talk<00:00:40.260> about<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.710> best

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
was you know if you talk about the best

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.270 
was you know if you talk about the best
gold<00:00:41.160> scores<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:42.329> full<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> history<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.280> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
gold scores in full of history and you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
gold scores in full of history and you
know<00:00:44.579> obviously<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.090> was<00:00:45.210> people<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.960> score

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
know obviously there was people to score

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.450 
know obviously there was people to score
quality<00:00:47.039> goals

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
quality goals

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
quality goals
Gordon<00:00:48.329> scored<00:00:48.570> many<00:00:48.719> colleagues<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.350> but

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
Gordon scored many colleagues I was but

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.049 
Gordon scored many colleagues I was but
a<00:00:49.530> lot<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.770> gold<00:00:49.950> Gordon's<00:00:50.370> girls<00:00:50.610> came<00:00:50.820> from

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
a lot of gold Gordon's girls came from

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.660 
a lot of gold Gordon's girls came from
in<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> around<00:00:51.570> at<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.930> six-yard<00:00:52.320> box<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
in and around at the six-yard box and so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.770 
in and around at the six-yard box and so
I<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> look<00:00:54.270> through<00:00:54.449> his<00:00:54.570> career

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I think if you look through his career

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
I think if you look through his career
and<00:00:55.020> he'll<00:00:55.140> probably<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> first<00:00:55.980> women<00:00:56.309> he

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and he'll probably be the first women he

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.619 
and he'll probably be the first women he
never<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.760> scored<00:00:57.030> many<00:00:57.120> spectacular

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
never really scored many spectacular

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.290 
never really scored many spectacular
goals<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.890> he's<00:00:59.100> still<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.640> me<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.120> that's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
goals but he's still it for me so that's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.930 
goals but he's still it for me so that's
the<00:01:00.390> BDM<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.350> all-time<00:01:01.800> great<00:01:02.039> dogs<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.820> my

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the BDM the all-time great dogs for my

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.429 
the BDM the all-time great dogs for my
full<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.480> purely<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> amount<00:01:04.409> of

girls<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.799> school<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.309> think<00:01:05.580> I've<00:01:05.670> always<00:01:05.970> said

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.590 
girls in school I think I've always said
that<00:01:06.740> there's<00:01:07.740> probably<00:01:08.220> three<00:01:09.090> goals<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that there's probably three goals that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.219 
that there's probably three goals that
stand<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.770> me<00:01:11.040> people<00:01:11.939> always<00:01:12.229> talk

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229

I'm fortunate to hold it at present but

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.800 
I'm fortunate to hold it at present but
the<00:02:35.430> records<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:35.850> there<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.210> broken<00:02:36.330> so

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
the records are there to be broken so

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.800 
the records are there to be broken so
one<00:02:37.020> day<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> would<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.470> bunker
