 I'll show you where to download and install 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 ksk pirate play on the network to start 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.360
 need to download it from the site bought a link 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.639
 on the site I will give in the description 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.639
 wait for 30 seconds 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.610
 click on start 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.040
 here I will not load it because 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.480
 I have already downloaded the blues now open 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.930
 the folder you downloaded open 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.930
 game installer 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.660
 choose the path to install the game 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.739
 click next 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.460
 waiting for the game to be set it is not to wait 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.460
 too long 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.960
 after a tedious installation, enter your 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.960
 nick in the game 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.780
 save the game patch you will have 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.929
 longer because I have a game already 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.929
 installed 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.330
 after the patches we will have this linen 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.130
 burda anna warns us that we need 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.530
 disable antivirus and steam 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.080
 but personally, I did not turn off the steam myself 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.020
 I turned off this thing about fun 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.970
 30 minutes and there it says it is 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.280
 take a lot of time so don't 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.280
 scare so long it's ok 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.310
 when it disappears from your desktop 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.650
 raise the funnel somewhere in the ground 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:07.100
 runs the group in the second can 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:10.550
 change the nickname in the game now you can 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.220
 quietly play but there are such servers in 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 which you can not go because 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.420
 this steam ovsky server is not pirated 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.420
