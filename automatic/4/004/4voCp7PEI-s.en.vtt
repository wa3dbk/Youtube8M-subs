00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.729
 so-called chanterelle or or 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:55.080

 of under the nails turns so I can 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.530
 to see below to distinguish them from what 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.980
 they distinguish themselves from the best and from nothing 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.239
 melli and the lamella when young 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:06.359
 still attached to the hat 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:09.400
 after which it opens in the lamella however vi 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.409
 therefore they are ddd anti high nails 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.099
