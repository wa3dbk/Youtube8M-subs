00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:10.000
 tablet they are laptops but here 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.099
 in fact, this is such a foam 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.780
 where did it all live in two 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.030
 the layer is simply glued to 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.489
 to lift 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.590
 laptop laptop open here of course it 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.880
 already ripped everything she was letters n attack 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.419
 done means removed the bottom cover 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.389
 a laptop and just such a fan 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.900
 for the hard drives here the floor was the glue 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.900
 masking tape 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.820
 he recorded here is such a block 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.949
 these are the rock plug 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.620
 instant standard plug for 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.260
 winchesters that is such here 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.389
 the system was up and running from time 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.919
 time work and by the way I can tell you that 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.199
 I was afraid to render video but one video 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.710
 I had to render it 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.590
 launched i should have done and i 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.690
 I will tell you that never 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.270
 the laptop is not heated here felt 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.669
 like heated and here with this cooler and no 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.960
 never really got warm 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.229
 somehow effective but he first 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.750
 constantly buzzing here and 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.580
 in my opinion all this is wrong of course it is 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.400
 it's all open of course you're always here 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.349
 made such a hole so that the memory too 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.880
 cooled well actually on this 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.690
