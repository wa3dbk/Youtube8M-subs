honda civic hybrid savvy mirrors on a
non-hybrid<00:00:10.610> civic<00:00:11.750> this<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.929> SI<00:00:13.610> 4-door

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
non-hybrid civic this is the SI 4-door

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.620 
non-hybrid civic this is the SI 4-door
the<00:00:17.060> right<00:00:18.060> side<00:00:19.160> got<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> left<00:00:20.490> side<00:00:20.699> that's

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the right side got the left side that's

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.620 
the right side got the left side that's
what<00:00:21.810> she<00:00:21.900> got<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> wine

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.919 

it<00:00:28.050> was<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.259> lot<00:00:28.439> simpler<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.669> then<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.779> whole

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it was a lot simpler to do then my whole

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.930 
it was a lot simpler to do then my whole
7<00:00:31.430> Honda<00:00:32.430> Accord<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:34.530> only<00:00:34.710> three<00:00:34.980> wires<00:00:35.219> so

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
7 Honda Accord it's only three wires so

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.459 
7 Honda Accord it's only three wires so
you<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.660> focus<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.199> for<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you really have to focus on for the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.639 
you really have to focus on for the
power<00:00:38.449> which<00:00:39.449> for<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.780> driver's<00:00:40.170> side<00:00:40.320> is

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
power which for the driver's side is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.869 
power which for the driver's side is
yellow<00:00:41.129> red<00:00:41.370> yellow<00:00:43.070> silver<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> yellow

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
yellow red yellow silver and yellow

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.009 
yellow red yellow silver and yellow
white<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.100> then<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:47.489> power<00:00:48.019> which

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
white and then you have your power which

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.979 
white and then you have your power which
is<00:00:49.229> for<00:00:50.030> purple<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:53.000> your<00:00:54.000> negative<00:00:54.420> should

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is for purple and your negative should

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.360 
is for purple and your negative should
be<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:56.309> light<00:00:56.519> purple<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.890> positive

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
be the light purple and your positive

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.719 
be the light purple and your positive
should<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.970> dark<00:01:00.210> purple<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.580> wired<00:01:02.580> it

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
should be the dark purple I wired it

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.120 
should be the dark purple I wired it
through<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.150> door<00:01:06.860> didn't<00:01:07.860> come<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.070> right

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
through the door didn't come out right

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
through the door didn't come out right
because<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.820> side<00:01:09.030> has<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> panel<00:01:09.900> there<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
because this side has a panel there I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.140 
because this side has a panel there I
couldn't<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.890> through<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:14.150> passenger

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
couldn't get right through but passenger

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.850 
couldn't get right through but passenger
side<00:01:15.329> came<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> lot<00:01:15.869> better

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.420 

what<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.490> did<00:01:19.760> was<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.210> took<00:01:20.770> same<00:01:21.770> wiring<00:01:22.190> for

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
what I did was I took same wiring for

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.600 
what I did was I took same wiring for
the<00:01:22.520> hybrid<00:01:23.380> mirrors<00:01:24.380> are<00:01:24.650> saying<00:01:25.220> for<00:01:25.460> your

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
the hybrid mirrors are saying for your

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.260 
the hybrid mirrors are saying for your
non<00:01:26.540> hybrid<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:27.950> just<00:01:28.310> took<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.850> plug<00:01:29.120> out

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
non hybrid so I just took the plug out

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.070 
non hybrid so I just took the plug out
and<00:01:29.860> then<00:01:30.860> just<00:01:31.190> attach<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.670> plug<00:01:31.880> back<00:01:32.030> in<00:01:32.270> so

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
and then just attach the plug back in so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.790 
and then just attach the plug back in so
spliced<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:34.250> here<00:01:34.660> just<00:01:35.660> used<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.140> reuse<00:01:36.620> the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
spliced it here just used to reuse the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.910 
spliced it here just used to reuse the
plug<00:01:37.010> for<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.640> original<00:01:38.330> mirror<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.710> is

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
plug for the original mirror and this is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.950 
plug for the original mirror and this is
your<00:01:40.570> hybrid<00:01:41.570> wiring<00:01:42.410> it<00:01:43.720> goes<00:01:44.720> right

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
your hybrid wiring it goes right

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.140 
your hybrid wiring it goes right
together<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:45.950> not<00:01:46.100> really<00:01:46.370> hard<00:01:47.000> to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
together so it's not really hard to

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.810 
together so it's not really hard to
myself

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:05.120 

let's<00:01:52.330> check<00:01:52.480> out<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.690> passenger<00:01:53.170> side

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.630 

passenger<00:02:06.060> side<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:07.099> yellow<00:02:08.099> silver

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
passenger side you have yellow silver

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.479 
passenger side you have yellow silver
and<00:02:09.259> white<00:02:10.259> or<00:02:10.590> yellow<00:02:10.950> white<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and white or yellow white you want to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.630 
and white or yellow white you want to
call<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.110> then<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.319> your<00:02:13.470> blue<00:02:13.769> with<00:02:14.519> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
call it then you have your blue with the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.520 
call it then you have your blue with the
silver<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.470> then<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:16.769> blue<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.580> black

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
silver and then your blue with black

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.360 
silver and then your blue with black
then<00:02:19.530> over<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.310> should<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.720> be

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
then over here is just should not be

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.800 
then over here is just should not be
should<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:24.480> probe<00:02:24.690> light<00:02:24.959> purple<00:02:26.810> for

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
should be the probe light purple for

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.810 
should be the probe light purple for
power

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.310 

my<00:02:35.820> dark<00:02:36.750> purple<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.350> day<00:02:38.190> goes<00:02:38.810> dark<00:02:39.810> purple

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
my dark purple for day goes dark purple

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.680 
my dark purple for day goes dark purple
for<00:02:41.250> negative<00:02:42.950> or<00:02:43.950> vice<00:02:44.010> versa

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
for negative or vice versa

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.520 
for negative or vice versa
and<00:02:46.050> here<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.160> see<00:02:47.490> that's<00:02:47.730> why<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:47.910> put<00:02:48.090> my

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
and here as you see that's why I put my

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.510 
and here as you see that's why I put my
negative<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.180> run<00:02:51.180> my<00:02:51.330> power<00:02:52.370> through<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
negative and run my power through the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.280 
negative and run my power through the
door<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.120> one<00:02:54.330> came<00:02:54.480> out<00:02:54.570> perfect

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
door this one came out perfect

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.860 
door this one came out perfect
actually<00:02:55.770> ran<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.130> through<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.330> through

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
actually ran it through here and through

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.690 
actually ran it through here and through
my<00:02:58.020> door<00:02:58.200> panel<00:02:58.620> all<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.070> way<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.550> back

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
my door panel all the way to the back

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.820 
my door panel all the way to the back
and<00:02:59.880> spice<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.330> with<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.540> back<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:01.770> is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
and spice it with the back so this is

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.860 
and spice it with the back so this is
since<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.280> came<00:03:02.340> out<00:03:02.610> perfect<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:06.000> there<00:03:06.780> you

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
since I came out perfect and there you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.660 
since I came out perfect and there you
have<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.350> mean<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.740> just<00:03:07.830> three<00:03:08.340> simple

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
have it I mean it's just three simple

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.970 
have it I mean it's just three simple
wires<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.270> then<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.080> two<00:03:10.290> power<00:03:10.620> negative

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
wires and then the two power negative

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.270 
wires and then the two power negative
light<00:03:11.940> purple<00:03:12.210> dark<00:03:12.750> purple<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:14.010> one

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
light purple dark purple now this one

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.350 
light purple dark purple now this one
didn't<00:03:14.850> come<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.210> heated<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:17.040> if<00:03:17.670> it

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
didn't come with the heated so if it

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.360 
didn't come with the heated so if it
does<00:03:18.540> come<00:03:18.780> with<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.020> it'll<00:03:19.230> come<00:03:19.410> with<00:03:19.560> two

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
does come with it it'll come with two

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.500 
does come with it it'll come with two
extra<00:03:20.760> wires<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.360> altogether<00:03:21.660> it'll<00:03:21.960> be<00:03:22.490> seven

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
extra wires so altogether it'll be seven

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.320 
extra wires so altogether it'll be seven
three<00:03:24.510> for<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.930> mirror<00:03:25.490> two<00:03:26.490> for<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.910> signal

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
three for the mirror two for the signal

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.030 
three for the mirror two for the signal
light<00:03:27.450> which<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.750> power<00:03:27.960> negative<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.560> then

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
light which is power negative and then

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.620 
light which is power negative and then
two<00:03:29.280> for<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.610> heated<00:03:29.910> mirror<00:03:30.090> which<00:03:30.330> will<00:03:30.510> be

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
two for the heated mirror which will be

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.540 
two for the heated mirror which will be
power<00:03:31.470> negative<00:03:32.390> they<00:03:33.390> sell<00:03:33.660> them<00:03:33.840> without

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
power negative they sell them without

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.920 
power negative they sell them without
heat<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.820> they<00:03:36.090> sell<00:03:36.330> them<00:03:36.420> with<00:03:36.600> heated

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
heat it and they sell them with heated

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.410 
heat it and they sell them with heated
so<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.010> just<00:03:38.160> have<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.310> add<00:03:38.520> extra<00:03:38.790> wire<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.330> if

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
so you just have to add extra wire so if

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.180 
so you just have to add extra wire so if
you<00:03:39.510> have<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.660> EXL<00:03:40.170> with<00:03:40.320> heated<00:03:40.560> mirrors<00:03:40.920> those

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
you have a EXL with heated mirrors those

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.980 
you have a EXL with heated mirrors those
are<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.400> ones<00:03:41.580> you're<00:03:41.700> gonna<00:03:41.820> get<00:03:42.090> but<00:03:42.870> do<00:03:42.930> you

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
are the ones you're gonna get but do you

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.430 
are the ones you're gonna get but do you
have<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.140> x<00:03:43.530> LX<00:03:44.190> or<00:03:44.430> DX<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.060> doesn't<00:03:45.450> have<00:03:45.630> heat

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
have a x LX or DX that doesn't have heat

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.950 
have a x LX or DX that doesn't have heat
it<00:03:46.590> or<00:03:47.130> an<00:03:47.670> SI<00:03:47.970> which<00:03:48.210> does<00:03:48.390> not<00:03:48.510> calling<00:03:48.810> heat

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
it or an SI which does not calling heat

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.250 
it or an SI which does not calling heat
it<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.920> could<00:03:50.100> get<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.840> Harvard<00:03:51.840> knows<00:03:52.080> that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
it you could get the Harvard knows that

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.910 
it you could get the Harvard knows that
don't<00:03:52.950> have<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.250> heat<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.430> option<00:03:54.740> and<00:03:55.740> there

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
don't have to heat it option and there

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.330 
don't have to heat it option and there
you<00:03:55.980> go

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
you go

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.720 
you go
hope<00:03:57.270> you<00:03:57.420> enjoy<00:03:57.690> it
