00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 now 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.280
 For example, on a flight from Lima, Cusco , 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.340
 plane took off from lima and the pilot to 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.469
 pilot did not raise one of those from the 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.100
 landing gear one of the wheels 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.620
 for the landing 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.800
 the procedure and they know that 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.500
 perfectly pilots is to return to 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.970
 land to him solve the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.550
 problem 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.739
 but the pilot did not return to Lima but 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.800
 that went to the cusco with the train of 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.020
 landing down that happened on 13th 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.210
 November 2010 on the plane of 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:46.329
 registration ob in 1823 there is a crime but 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.520
 enter into cause resistance to advance 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.040
 then we are no longer clean 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.100
 and with resistance to the advance because no longer 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.800
 Holds at 25,000 feet but probably 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.410
 endure to 18 and if the hills have 22 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.730
 we are four thousand feet under 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.580
 Hill 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.490
 and we can not go from here to Cusco with 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.600
 the train or down in no way because 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.360
 we are playing 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.830
 to fly the single-engine plane was planted 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.479
 an engine and there we stayed flying 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.780
 ascended by crossing the mountain range of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.640
 andes and if in mid-flight there 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.649
 lost an engine would have failed a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.229
 motor looks or falls crashes into a 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.110
 time anyway because the plane 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.210
 can fly by an engine but not with the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.000
 train to three below because it is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 too much resistance to advance in that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 moment that happened that barbarity and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.990
 they saw call the pilot and tell me 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.630
 bring me your license go to the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.909
 school does not return within one year on 1 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.250
 February this year happened another 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.640
 done quite seriously the crew of 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.340
 the uve ship 1841 did not report the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.110
 occurrences of aircraft maintenance 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.710
 another occasion not to dispatch the flight in 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.210
 conditions I heard well no 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.340
 airworthy means that the plane 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.489
 can not fly 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.190
 is that of febles but and says so 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.400
 continues to endanger the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.379
 safety but 19 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.019
 In March, another very important event 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.080
 serious note that there were hundreds of 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.720
 passengers on board 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.640
 according to the document the peruvian plane 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.410
 registration airlines v 1839 pp 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.420
 dabbled in the flight level of a 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.950
 ship of lan peru and when I was by 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.020
 land on collision path 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.810
 it means that the plan was 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.230
 approaching irvine or plane 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.440
 to prove it is and almost almost crashes 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.450
 collide in the air or like the combis 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.550
 like the combi is that it gets components 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.390
 of cars do not mind running over 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.099
 to hit 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.650
 despite the instructions of the tower of 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.380
 control these were not heard by 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.019
 the crew of peruvian airlines to the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.000
 time you buy a plane ticket 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.160
 to go bird 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.840
 you are not buying a lottery to see 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.849
 if it comes, wine 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.610
 the conclusion of the document is 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.110
 forceful and alarming both the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.180
 management of company operations 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.430
 that schedule flights as the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.580
 technical crew lack 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.010
 security awareness another aspect 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.870
 important discussed in the document is the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.970
 referred to the flight time record 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.970
 Auxiliary pilots and crew 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.930
 stand since May we are in 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:45.590
 August then if you are going to live it 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.129
 it says how many hours the pilot flew such in 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.600
 the last 24 hours do not know why the 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.060
 record ttr minas de mayo 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.130
 how much did he fly in the last seven days not 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.290
 knows how much in the past 30 days 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.570
 he knows how many last 90 days he does not know 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.910
 this is of supreme importance because 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.730
 according to the record it is known if the pilot 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.370
 is or is not fatigued to maneuver the 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.610
 plane we do not even have to get to the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.610
 airplane the culture is of non-compliance 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.889
 and again I tell you , it's not that they 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.380
 they have to go to learn this what 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.380
 found in your operations manual 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.210
 the blunt document of the address 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.800
 general of civil aeronautics also 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.770
 makes references to another type of 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.930
 breaches peruvian airlines has 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.260
 a debt with the sunat that borders the 2 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.090
 million soles for ibi 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.730
 nor have the 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.740
 liquidations of 48 workers who 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.620
 were stopped in the months of June and 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.690
 July the debt for that single item 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.840
 amounts to 196 thousand 247 soles if the 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:02.040
 airline does not have money to pay its 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.530
 you owe the fuel the food to your 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.009
 crew on vacation the staff 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.589
 your salary your cts 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.270
 with what money buy spares how to 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:13.249
 can appreciate the items that have had 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.779
 greater execution in relation to 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.300
 borrowed are the expenses incurred in 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:20.029
 the simulator uniform that fuel and 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.039
 those with the least expense or where they have not 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:24.229
 spent enough what should 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.300
 have spent only item of 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.249
 maintenance this is really 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.839
 alarming given the 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:33.139
 antiquity of the peruvian fleet 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:36.750
 airlines they have five aircraft 7 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:41.289
 300 737 200 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.559
 and you have two 737 300 aircraft 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:47.529
 the aircraft 737 200 more or less have 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:51.550
 an average of 30 years of activity and 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:52.820
 the 737 300 that are the most modern 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.090
 they have 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.490
 about 25 or 26 years old 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.830
 this program tried to interview 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.550
 Caesar Cataño, you could get a 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.550
 interview this time 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:13.120
 carlos of bad faith carlos with you nothing if 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.280
 we will not be in the document that is not 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.169
 where Caesar Cataño was presented was in 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.660
 two congressional committees where 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.969
 incredibly he was not questioned for 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.679
 nothing 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:25.959
 this is an attitude that some 

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:27.309
 They qualify odd having 

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:29.369
 account that Cataño has been 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:32.139
 investigated together with their companies 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:34.299
 including peruvian airlines per wash 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.869
 of assets there is no resolution 

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:39.939
 firm to say that the company foresees 

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:40.719
 winning it is out of all 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:42.939
 investigation 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:45.219
 The attorney general has appealed 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:47.979
 the initial decision of the prosecutor of tacna 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:50.469
 and it is still pending to solve if 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:52.779
 peruvian airlines remains or not outside of 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:54.549
 suspicions of money laundering in 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:57.279
 this moment the office of the attorney 

00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:59.799
 In view of this refusal, he has filed 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:02.379
 corresponding appeals 

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:04.689
 despite everything but line took flight this 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:06.759
 Friday it seems that the address 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:08.910
 civil aeronautics general was given to 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:13.850
 political pressures 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.850
 I hope there are no disasters to regret
