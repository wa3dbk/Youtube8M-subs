00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
mud bottom we've got a bug hatch going

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.800 
mud bottom we've got a bug hatch going
on<00:00:28.920> today<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> bugs<00:00:30.029> are<00:00:30.240> coming<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.630> out

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
on today so the bugs are coming up out

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.780 
on today so the bugs are coming up out
of<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.019> mud<00:00:31.260> probably<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:32.189> bait<00:00:32.369> Fisher

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
of that mud probably some bait Fisher

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.490 
of that mud probably some bait Fisher
and<00:00:33.059> they're<00:00:33.180> eating<00:00:33.480> them<00:00:33.660> bugs<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.380> of

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and they're eating them bugs and of

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.840 
and they're eating them bugs and of
course<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.800> walleyes<00:00:35.130> are<00:00:35.309> around<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> bait

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
course the walleyes are around the bait

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670 
course the walleyes are around the bait
fish<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> little<00:00:36.989> bit<00:00:37.110> tougher<00:00:37.469> bite

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
fish but it's a little bit tougher bite

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.770 
fish but it's a little bit tougher bite
because<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.640> many<00:00:38.940> bait<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
because there's so many bait that the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.479 
because there's so many bait that the
walleyes<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.469> eat<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.829> day<00:00:41.010> basically

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
walleyes can just eat all day basically

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.729 
walleyes can just eat all day basically
gorge<00:00:41.879> themselves<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:43.170> perch<00:00:43.440> or

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
gorge themselves with little perch or

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
gorge themselves with little perch or
other<00:00:43.920> kinds<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.340> minnows<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.809> lot

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
other kinds of minnows so that's a lot

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.389 
other kinds of minnows so that's a lot
of<00:00:46.079> times<00:00:46.260> where<00:00:46.440> crank<00:00:46.739> baits<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.160> really

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
of times where crank baits are really

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
of times where crank baits are really
good<00:00:47.610> because<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.090> crank<00:00:48.360> bait<00:00:48.570> oftentimes

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
good because the crank bait oftentimes

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.520 
good because the crank bait oftentimes
will<00:00:49.469> entice<00:00:50.129> more<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.960> striking<00:00:51.960> bite<00:00:52.170> than

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
will entice more of a striking bite than

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
will entice more of a striking bite than
an<00:00:52.649> eating<00:00:52.980> bite<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.399> crank<00:00:53.670> bait<00:00:53.850> coming<00:00:54.090> by

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
an eating bite that crank bait coming by

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.150 
an eating bite that crank bait coming by
maybe<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:55.350> vibration

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
maybe it's got just the right vibration

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
maybe it's got just the right vibration
you<00:00:56.489> pull<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> by<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> thousand<00:00:57.480> fish<00:00:57.660> over<00:00:57.960> here

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you pull it by a thousand fish over here

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.610 
you pull it by a thousand fish over here
number<00:00:58.770> 1001<00:00:59.579> takes<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> grabs<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.440> neat

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
number 1001 takes and grabs it the neat

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.579 
number 1001 takes and grabs it the neat
thing<00:01:01.649> about<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:03.300> technology<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.140> today<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
thing about the technology for today and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.070 
thing about the technology for today and
electronics<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> past<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
electronics is is that in the past you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.420 
electronics is is that in the past you
really<00:01:07.290> didn't<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.590> where<00:01:07.770> these<00:01:07.890> mud<00:01:08.130> flats

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
really didn't know where these mud flats

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.789 
really didn't know where these mud flats
were<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.390> fish<00:01:09.570> still<00:01:09.810> relate<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.350> those<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
were the fish still relate to those and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.020 
were the fish still relate to those and
every<00:01:10.950> once<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> while<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.520> move<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.850> on

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
every once in a while they move up on

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
every once in a while they move up on
those<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.390> eat<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.530> they're<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.799> there

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
those to eat but when they're not there

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.710 
those to eat but when they're not there
they<00:01:14.220> move<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.520> into<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.939> basin<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> want

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
they move out into the basin so I want

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
they move out into the basin so I want
to<00:01:15.810> show<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.020> something<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.710> map<00:01:16.979> what

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to show you something on this map what

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.730 
to show you something on this map what
I'm<00:01:17.790> actually<00:01:18.000> doing<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> each<00:01:19.500> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I'm actually doing is you know each of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.320 
I'm actually doing is you know each of
these<00:01:19.830> little<00:01:20.159> lines<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.820> outlining

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
these little lines here is outlining

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.200 
these little lines here is outlining
these<00:01:22.020> mud<00:01:22.380> flats<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:23.790> doing<00:01:23.820> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
these mud flats and what I'm doing is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
these mud flats and what I'm doing is
actually<00:01:24.600> working<00:01:24.840> along<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> edges<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
actually working along the edges of

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
actually working along the edges of
those<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.240> arrow<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.990> my

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
those and this little arrow here is my

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
those and this little arrow here is my
boat<00:01:28.380> position<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.430> exactly<00:01:29.759> where<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
boat position I can see exactly where I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.469 
boat position I can see exactly where I
am<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.540> I'm<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.810> running<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.500> onto<00:01:31.890> those<00:01:32.009> bars

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
am so I'm not running up onto those bars
