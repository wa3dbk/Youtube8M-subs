 here pointed returned with a server wall 4 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.250
 because I already have 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.260
 three livestock servants 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.220

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.470

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.470
 You'll put it down. 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.000
 you will put 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 the link and the server space 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 if you do not have a server yet 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.450
 the charez karez system 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.320
 It's wanting to put 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.890
 you may have also come in contact with the current for our 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.580

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.930
 cfk 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.120
 and it falls 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.919
 stealing the river team 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.099
 it's personal 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.119
 so let's continue 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.150
 a penguin that you will leave 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.879
 the way it gives 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.559
 who does the door 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.049
 the portal to the server will pass to you 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.749
 You're putting it here. 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.739
 the last number 3 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.169
 on the other side here 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.399
 basic port again will repeat the same number 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.399
 Why did you put it on the other side if you put it on the holder? 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.769
 the user 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.319
 the user here you will be passing 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.270

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.659
 to put questions it here the password 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.239

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.399
 the key in that first line that you will put 10 01 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.549
 to 07 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.129
 and on the bottom line 10 08 the catch 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.019
 Okay the staff. 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.709

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.109

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.599

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.849
 01 02 03 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.289
 here until ct 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.289
 and here until the 208 cap in trouble 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.159
 here we will put 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.159
 connect automatically 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.559
 a little bit more 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.509
 in the other 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.899
 the trick 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.249
 and so 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:53.689

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.579
 logged in connected to your secret the trailer that I could come from a new 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.299

 he was the owner of the contemporary 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.219

 It's explained here. 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:14.609
 I had some doubt about it 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.650
 and those who do not yet have their server 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.519
