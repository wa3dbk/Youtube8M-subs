00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.540
 olazábal jiménez this technique today I bring you a not that was very successful and that 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.410
 is going to fire eight agents 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.019
 that what was inside the clarion satellite 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.419
 which by the way is still valid and here is the money 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.009
 for the state to have its goal is to have more chances of winning 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.089
 it's something that is made with the palette of ais when they speak 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.999
 this couple that I am going to do is to know by heart because in the going we have everything 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.130
 the world 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 and the balance to your destination 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.060
 I'm going to use the word 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.000
 as you know the parents this palette are not too let's say before to 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.740
 timid 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.050
 so 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.550
 we would never be external what would be more colors, well, yes, they can be 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.809
 do there's always a decent way on the occasion to say these colors do not 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.410
 I wanted it and I hope it's not working 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.110
 that product I'm going to haggle at the same time that is only very fit for the end for the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.680
 dth home work 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.380
 so bad enough 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.920
 to start enhancing the little girl and skill and that she was in the car though 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.780
 the ine the palette there can be given 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 no ricardo kitoko 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.520
 and matches 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.910
 meanwhile from apply the color of eyes we will define daily arrive 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.110
 these dates I'm going to use being interested and the shadow that of makeateam 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 is fan page view 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.920
 we are filling little by little all the marbles we can have 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
 more unpopulated areas 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.509
 despite the difference 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.150
 the past 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.460
 to continue with the saga that is the weekend of two tenths that remains 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.070
 flat 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.590
 with the shadow 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 walk the ones that are here 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.330
 but to remember the purpose of accounting for the eye as bland to the shadow body 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.670
 as a mexican helped me that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.590
 of sefarad 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.049
 we start where we touch appointment is the outermost part 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.989
 and we are going little by little 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.989
 extending the product upwards and is that outside 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.519
 to pick up university and then we're going to use the Polish soprano 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.209
 with the beep to ensure that they 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.939
 with this feat ballpoint pen we are going to give a little light 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.939
 no tear 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:46.489
 use again the tenor of alarcón when being this we are going to give a little color 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.489
 under the lower lashes 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.079
 to give a little more intensity the eyes are solutions in the ncpe of 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.079
 cleaning although the level required 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:10.069
 for the eyelashes also saw to use a product from Medellin is this one 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.619
 the colossus time that blake also leave the leader and demandable 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.900
 when that with the mascara or transition 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.449
 in effect volume 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.879
 I like to give some incidence in the root 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.639
 let's get up second xxi 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.679
 to create a slightly more dramatic effect 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.659
 He thinks that if we wanted to give it a bit of drama we can do it with 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.069
 our online vote 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.069
 with more extensively 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.959
 for colomer before the attack the bottom 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.959
 the funny thing is that external demand 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.969
 this panorama will be addressed labor issues she is very favorable 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:05.069
 for these holidays 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.469
 it gives us a plus of luminosity 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.470
 to finish we will go to the lips 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.019
 It is essential before arriving in Córdoba 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.450
 prepare them and for that I'm going to use this one happens and this diesel racing of 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.650
 Milan 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.219
 we're not going 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.799
 although it is incredible 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.860
 and the Libyan area the butt is the pillar the box 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.099
 what way of state villegas 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:38.330
 to add a bit of brightness and a little intensity this rose I will pass the 

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:41.329
 bng the ipad should do 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.860
 television applied 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.080
 little touches 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.699
 esteban can never apply over the soro path and we go with a shine 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.979
 spectacularly interesting and look what a pretty red it would be if you want 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.590
 get that effect of the minor said good this spectacular 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.379
 and that's how the whole block looks 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.250
 the magistrate this one what it took in the video the draw of the trip clarinetes 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.169
 but that got angry a lot that it is very much and especially for his girls 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.280
 that braided the idea is to match 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.950
 I hope that they will want to be useful many others because it is paid 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.520
 for this and much more as I say if I wrote before commenting with your adp 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.580
 above all you learn a lot until the next rivas
