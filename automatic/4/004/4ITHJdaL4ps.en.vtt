00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:13.110 

you

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.220 

the<00:00:14.120> most<00:00:14.300> difficult<00:00:14.690> part<00:00:14.870> of<00:00:14.900> this<00:00:14.990> project

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
the most difficult part of this project

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.670 
the most difficult part of this project
was<00:00:15.620> really<00:00:15.890> the<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.090> pre-production<00:00:17.680> trying

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
was really the the pre-production trying

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.990 
was really the the pre-production trying
to<00:00:18.770> find<00:00:19.040> the<00:00:19.160> animals<00:00:19.490> that<00:00:19.580> I<00:00:19.670> could<00:00:19.820> bring

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
to find the animals that I could bring

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.480 
to find the animals that I could bring
into<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:20.330> studio<00:00:20.770> find<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.860> right<00:00:22.010> trainers

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
into the studio find the right trainers

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.300 
into the studio find the right trainers
to<00:00:22.640> come<00:00:22.790> with<00:00:23.000> these<00:00:23.180> animals<00:00:23.420> and<00:00:23.990> even<00:00:24.980> just

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
to come with these animals and even just

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.929 
to come with these animals and even just
to<00:00:25.400> find<00:00:25.700> a<00:00:26.119> space<00:00:26.510> that<00:00:26.990> that<00:00:27.410> could<00:00:27.939> contain

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
to find a space that that could contain

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.900 
to find a space that that could contain
an<00:00:29.090> elephant<00:00:29.570> contain<00:00:29.930> a<00:00:29.960> giraffe<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.910> and

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
an elephant contain a giraffe and and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.030 
an elephant contain a giraffe and and
that<00:00:32.029> was<00:00:32.150> a<00:00:32.180> big<00:00:32.509> part<00:00:32.840> of<00:00:32.930> it<00:00:33.079> and<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:33.650> in<00:00:33.920> many

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
that was a big part of it and so in many

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.740 
that was a big part of it and so in many
ways<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.490> project<00:00:34.880> was<00:00:35.030> almost<00:00:35.300> over<00:00:35.600> before

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
ways the project was almost over before

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.130 
ways the project was almost over before
it<00:00:35.960> ever<00:00:36.050> began<00:00:36.260> my<00:00:37.070> initial<00:00:37.460> idea<00:00:37.579> was

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
it ever began my initial idea was

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.810 
it ever began my initial idea was
relatively<00:00:39.140> small<00:00:39.320> in<00:00:39.739> scope<00:00:40.010> let<00:00:40.579> me<00:00:40.670> just

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
relatively small in scope let me just

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.810 
relatively small in scope let me just
try<00:00:41.000> working<00:00:41.960> with<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:42.170> chimpanzee<00:00:42.820> maybe

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
try working with the chimpanzee maybe

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.510 
try working with the chimpanzee maybe
you<00:00:44.239> know<00:00:44.390> some<00:00:44.870> some<00:00:45.109> other<00:00:45.289> primates<00:00:45.829> and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
you know some some other primates and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.810 
you know some some other primates and
then<00:00:47.090> once<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:48.050> realized<00:00:48.469> what<00:00:49.070> was<00:00:49.100> involved

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
then once I realized what was involved

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.549 
then once I realized what was involved
it<00:00:49.969> made<00:00:50.120> more<00:00:50.329> sense<00:00:50.390> just<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.899> hire<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.199> lot<00:00:51.469> of

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
it made more sense just to hire a lot of

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.590 
it made more sense just to hire a lot of
different<00:00:51.859> animals<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:52.789> for<00:00:52.969> my<00:00:53.059> first<00:00:53.269> shoot

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
different animals so for my first shoot

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.569 
different animals so for my first shoot
I<00:00:53.750> went<00:00:53.930> from<00:00:54.109> just<00:00:54.410> having<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.710> chimpanzee<00:00:55.309> to

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
I went from just having a chimpanzee to

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.930 
I went from just having a chimpanzee to
having<00:00:56.420> an<00:00:56.750> elephant<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.890> lion<00:00:58.399> a<00:00:58.489> tiger<00:00:58.699> a

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
having an elephant a lion a tiger a

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.380 
having an elephant a lion a tiger a
zebra<00:00:59.539> and<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:01.160> hadn't<00:01:01.760> even<00:01:01.850> started<00:01:02.329> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
zebra and I hadn't even started the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.530 
zebra and I hadn't even started the
project<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.050> once<00:01:03.949> I<00:01:04.160> got<00:01:04.339> started<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:05.180> lot<00:01:05.449> of

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
project and once I got started a lot of

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.060 
project and once I got started a lot of
other<00:01:05.690> things<00:01:05.930> came<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.320> light<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.800> I<00:01:06.830> never

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
other things came to light that I never

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.660 
other things came to light that I never
would<00:01:07.250> have<00:01:07.280> expected<00:01:09.190> well<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.220> think<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
would have expected well I think the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.340 
would have expected well I think the
missing<00:01:11.180> thing<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:11.960> these<00:01:12.170> are

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
missing thing is is that these are

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.230 
missing thing is is that these are
considered<00:01:12.800> trained<00:01:13.250> animals<00:01:13.850> however

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
considered trained animals however

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.960 
considered trained animals however
they're<00:01:15.080> not<00:01:15.110> trained<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.920> sense<00:01:16.189> that<00:01:16.369> a

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
they're not trained in the sense that a

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.270 
they're not trained in the sense that a
dog<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.299> trained<00:01:17.780> where<00:01:18.079> you<00:01:18.170> can<00:01:18.320> say<00:01:18.530> sit<00:01:18.979> and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
dog is trained where you can say sit and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.460 
dog is trained where you can say sit and
they'll<00:01:19.400> sit<00:01:19.700> there<00:01:19.970> basically<00:01:20.720> trained<00:01:21.170> to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
they'll sit there basically trained to

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.920 
they'll sit there basically trained to
not<00:01:21.619> come<00:01:22.009> out<00:01:22.130> on<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.729> set<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.299> try<00:01:23.840> to

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
not come out on to the set and try to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.289 
not come out on to the set and try to
attack<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.890> then<00:01:25.310> beyond<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.759> they're

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
attack you and then beyond that they're

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.580 
attack you and then beyond that they're
really<00:01:26.479> going<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.689> do<00:01:26.810> what<00:01:26.960> they<00:01:27.079> want<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:27.409> do

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
really going to do what they want to do

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.380 
really going to do what they want to do
and<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:29.060> up<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.770> as<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.920> photographer

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
and it's up to to you as a photographer

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.740 
and it's up to to you as a photographer
to<00:01:32.390> try<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.659> find<00:01:32.899> a<00:01:33.079> moment<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.680> all<00:01:33.799> of<00:01:34.009> that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
to try to find a moment and all of that

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.530 
to try to find a moment and all of that
organized<00:01:35.750> chaos<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:37.729> know<00:01:37.759> hopefully<00:01:38.180> the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
organized chaos you know hopefully the

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.510 
organized chaos you know hopefully the
animal<00:01:38.930> will<00:01:39.020> give<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.470> moment<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.100> lot

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
animal will give you that moment a lot

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.280 
animal will give you that moment a lot
of<00:01:40.579> it<00:01:40.759> has<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:40.909> do<00:01:41.060> with<00:01:41.149> patience<00:01:41.810> because

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
of it has to do with patience because

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.429 
of it has to do with patience because
you<00:01:42.380> can't<00:01:43.600> continually<00:01:44.600> mess<00:01:45.170> with<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
you can't continually mess with the

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.410 
you can't continually mess with the
lighting<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:46.340> can't<00:01:46.610> have<00:01:46.820> people<00:01:47.000> running

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
lighting you can't have people running

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.209 
lighting you can't have people running
in<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.570> out<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.439> scene<00:01:48.710> I<00:01:48.740> mean<00:01:49.130> you

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
in and out of the scene I mean you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.679 
in and out of the scene I mean you
really<00:01:49.460> have<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.850> just<00:01:49.880> let<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.210> animal<00:01:50.540> do

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
really have to just let the animal do

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.450 
really have to just let the animal do
what<00:01:50.840> they're<00:01:50.990> going<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.170> do<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.740> then

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
what they're going to do and then

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.550 
what they're going to do and then
hopefully<00:01:52.729> you'll<00:01:53.000> find<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.479> moment<00:01:53.960> you'll

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
hopefully you'll find that moment you'll

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.289 
hopefully you'll find that moment you'll
find<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.039> little<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:55.640> little<00:01:55.700> piece<00:01:56.119> of

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
find that little that little piece of

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.609 
find that little that little piece of
connection<00:01:56.899> that's<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.140> little<00:01:57.320> bit<00:01:57.469> more

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
connection that's a little bit more

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.440 
connection that's a little bit more
extraordinary

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.550 

I<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:04.540> that<00:02:04.660> when<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.870> stand<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:05.290> front<00:02:05.410> of

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
I think that when you stand in front of

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.620 
I think that when you stand in front of
one<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.770> these<00:02:05.860> images<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.640> there's<00:02:07.570> a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
one of these images and there's a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.060 
one of these images and there's a
starkness<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.500> there's<00:02:08.680> a<00:02:08.770> sense<00:02:08.979> of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
starkness to it there's a sense of

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.280 
starkness to it there's a sense of
isolation<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.930> one-on-one

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
isolation that it's a one-on-one

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.170 
isolation that it's a one-on-one
experience<00:02:11.590> you're<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.370> equal<00:02:12.760> playing<00:02:13.030> field

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
experience you're on equal playing field

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.340 
experience you're on equal playing field
with<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.690> animal

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
with this animal

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.980 
with this animal
you're<00:02:14.890> inhabiting<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.520> space<00:02:15.760> with<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.720> a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
you're inhabiting the space with it in a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.560 
you're inhabiting the space with it in a
way<00:02:17.020> that's<00:02:17.230> much<00:02:18.010> more<00:02:18.220> immediate<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:19.300> much

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
way that's much more immediate it's much

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.440 
way that's much more immediate it's much
more<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.500> sense<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.980> proximity<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.270> get

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
more a sense of proximity then you get

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.270 
more a sense of proximity then you get
when<00:02:22.570> you're<00:02:22.690> looking<00:02:22.960> at<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.260> Safari<00:02:23.830> image

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
when you're looking at a Safari image

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.190 
when you're looking at a Safari image
for<00:02:24.550> example<00:02:24.580> where<00:02:25.480> you're<00:02:25.600> looking<00:02:25.780> into

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
for example where you're looking into

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.920 
for example where you're looking into
their<00:02:26.380> world<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.240> you're<00:02:28.240> not<00:02:28.390> really<00:02:28.510> part

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
their world and you're not really part

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.170 
their world and you're not really part
of<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.080> world<00:02:29.380> what<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.340> doing<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.760> bringing

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
of that world what I'm doing is bringing

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.780 
of that world what I'm doing is bringing
you<00:02:31.240> into<00:02:31.840> sort<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.770> common<00:02:33.190> space<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.700> you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
you into sort of a common space that you

you into sort of a common space that you
can<00:02:33.940> share<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.510> moment<00:02:34.810> with<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.080> animal
