00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 many have written that figuratively 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.650
 the game borussia from a team or 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.650
 server is made after 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.880
 hey people i 'm welcome two 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.710
 next episode as well as games today two 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.119
 meter on that though and we have 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.279
 also a topic at the start we see how 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.050
 always no player cool 1.8 bank on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.460
 every case and in two seconds it works 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.960
 Let's see the box in front 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.510
 and then it is already the same 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
 theme going on and yes already at that time 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.160
 get sword and yes age still 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.669
 a little armor xp hammer seven 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 bottles 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.329
 oha and now we can do something 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.399
 enchant 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.920
 too bad that you do not have a good sword 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.420
 but have okay today it should be around 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.010
 a bomb does not have the point 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.950
 go after I think the most 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.210
 already know what it is 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.100
 many have yesterday as the new one 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.890
 play mode came out on the g 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.809
 point net server pvp have many 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 really wrote that the game mode 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.699
 yes made by the team or server 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.070
 is and had to come also had so 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.180
 the clean-team and breathing falls on 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.380
 I want to write that and I would like that one 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.820
 reproduce a bit many have that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.650
 also not read since there is 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.580
 of course, my opinion you can 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.580
 you also like to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.270
 comments and have no compass 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.710
 no matter okay there is one in the comic 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.040
 blog or is it a comeback i believe 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.030
 beautiful 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.210
 yes in any case has posted so 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.590
 gomez but now would not believe that 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.689
 the idea of ​​that once as one 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 So play mode of the PvP game mode 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.530
 already before the 11th 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.320
 timo yes game mode in planning was or 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.240
 who had the idea and I think 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.149
 really not that such a big worry 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.939
 like coming back hd funknetz server 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.369
 just so any stupid things 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.210
 yes writes and if for example 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.100
 also on twitter so on the accounts 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.790
 goes to a team or server account 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.310
 on the gong hd.de twitter accounts then 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 I also really saw that the two 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.780
 So server teams are good with each other 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.660
 and they are definitely not 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.250
 and since that one is there you can 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.599
 really make sure that if 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.290
 for example, to work such a big one 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.709
 so overwrite 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.150
 the idea that we already had before 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.129
 but only the teams had it 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.250
 you can already do that before 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.290
 believe and will do so too 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.870
 wrote the 1 1 and that too have 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.159
 a lot of really twitter posted in 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.060
 the comments 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:36.239
 that is imitated really what 11 11 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.030
 It is not very clear against one against one 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.150
 and of course that rubbish that minecraft 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.849
 but 11 on and no idea who 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.420
 one on one and I believe that 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.909
 that 's a spectacular it's easy 11 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.470
 to invent because yes that's it 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.540
 just one against one 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.540
 Of course you can say okay now 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.359
 maybe he does not attack from there 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.859
 a bit and now I'm allowed to 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:09.470
 do not burn there and that always comes 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.790
 also almost take 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.290
 we have to concentrate pretty well 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.239
 and there it is in the lava itself 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.510
 flew there and have him very beautiful 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.549
 age okay well and yes you can 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.159
 say that maybe the gomez server 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.120
 now in a few functions yes 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:29.340
 I took over what I have now 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.569
 Do not think so now because it really is 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.129
 really, mine could be said of course 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.790
 your like to in the comments 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.709
 write 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.720
 because it really is something else 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.909
 that's like in the yard and come 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.340
 server on lonely de la luz 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.099
 is just implemented differently and had to 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.370
 example, as far as I know the idea too 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.729
 already stop for a short time or stop 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.109
 the idea before the server or the 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.629
 Commissioner has the holder exactly 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.370
 first implemented and so what stop at the 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.729
 team without server task is natural 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.689
 However, so it's just nothing 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:06.299
 from 11 to bed what in sg in pippi and 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.459
 there are still some kids on the timo 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.199
 what you do not create on the server 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.629
 can one can create tournaments therefore 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.639
 something completely different and on the gomez 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.659
 But you already have predetermined kids 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.269
 which one can choose 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.030
 and whoever writes then has it 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.430
 counterfeited no idea 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.050
 yes that's a little stupid so you guys 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.460
 Of course, your opinion in 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.979
 they are writing and 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.990
 that also got no man 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.490
 I 'm too stupid now I still wanted 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.539
 but we have the ice in the sword 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.699
 it did not come anymore 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.160
 but no matter we are still enchanted 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.069
 quickly our sword comes here 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.440
 you will not forget the sharper 1 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.110
 wanted and then did ok you there 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.759
 the iron rose the tease but have the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.280
 we did not manage to do that either 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.960
 good was a really cool round so far 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.310
 You really like your opinion about that 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.610
 write in the comments 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.199
 I had this before today too 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.300
 to take up the new ranking 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.330
 point system on the hd point network but 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.680
 that was not so good of me now 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.750
 but unfortunately not worked anymore 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.210
 have worked because I have now too 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.860
 really late and that is 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.380
 really not as many games at 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.690
 and we just go in now 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:25.979
 mischief on it ok and so gamescom later 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.889
 has now placed the one and there too 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.139
 a really good axis and damian 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.759
 get so nice that 's the round sg 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.360
 Tomorrow will probably be 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:40.530
 new n 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.849
 Thank you, thank you all clearly a schäuble 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.440
 down 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:48.150
 I do not know why but good tomorrow 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.500
 also comes the new scoring system 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.630
 So I really think it's not bad 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.669
 when people write as always ben 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:58.050
 quite funny for what reason but good 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.159
 what in this video wants me 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.360
 In any case about the positive 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.620
 reviews 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.630
 until one day he gets clean again 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.099
 and yes as I said your opinion below in 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.099
 the comments skin in and so
