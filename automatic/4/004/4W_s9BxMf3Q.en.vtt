00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
that quick guys I mean it's not like he

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.860 
that quick guys I mean it's not like he
you<00:03:25.520> know<00:03:25.610> we<00:03:25.760> can<00:03:25.940> plan<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.270> out<00:03:26.420> sometimes

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870

you have to go with the flow and that's

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.980 
you have to go with the flow and that's
why<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.550> pays<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:28.970> be<00:03:29.120> in<00:03:29.270> shape<00:03:29.300> year<00:03:29.780> round
