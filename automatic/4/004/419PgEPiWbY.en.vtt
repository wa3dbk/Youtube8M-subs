00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.360 
know this allows for him to be able to
control<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> area<00:00:10.620> around<00:00:10.740> his<00:00:10.920> main<00:00:11.130> with

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.240 
control the area around his main with
medical<00:00:11.940> marine<00:00:12.179> instead<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.599> turrets<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
medical marine instead of turrets and

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.400 
medical marine instead of turrets and
we'll<00:00:14.250> see<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:14.519> if<00:00:15.299> zero<00:00:15.599> besides<00:00:15.900> go<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.230> there

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
we'll see if if zero besides go in there

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.599 
we'll see if if zero besides go in there
so<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.680> picking<00:00:16.920> off<00:00:17.010> one<00:00:17.220> st<00:00:17.340> be<00:00:17.580> there

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the next tech route will be but I think

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.370 
the next tech route will be but I think
he<00:01:30.420> will<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.600> well<00:01:30.720> prepared<00:01:30.869> though<00:01:31.170> for

he will be well prepared though for
anything<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.950> now<00:01:31.979> he's<00:01:32.220> got<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.520> little

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
anything right now he's got that little

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.280 
anything right now he's got that little
bunker<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.750> bunker<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
bunker it's got that bunker up in the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.100 
bunker it's got that bunker up in the
front<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.360> unless<00:01:36.360> there's<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:37.079> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
front and unless there's a lot of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.109 
front and unless there's a lot of
lurkers<00:01:37.350> being<00:01:37.650> produced<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.909> think

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
lurkers being produced now I don't think

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.850 
lurkers being produced now I don't think
0<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.810> able<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.110> any<00:01:40.290> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.470> frontal

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
0 will be able to do any kind of frontal

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
0 will be able to do any kind of frontal
attack<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.280> 0<00:01:41.610> might<00:01:41.880> decide<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> do

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
attack now 0 might decide to do

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
attack now 0 might decide to do
something<00:01:42.390> tricky<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.680> lurker<00:01:44.250> trap

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
something tricky like a lurker trap

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
something tricky like a lurker trap
somewhere<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> map<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.450> would<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
somewhere in the map and that would be a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
somewhere in the map and that would be a
really<00:01:46.439> smart<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.890> getting<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.759> lead<00:01:47.970> in

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
really smart way of getting a lead in

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.370 
really smart way of getting a lead in
this<00:01:48.180> game<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:48.869> now<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> game<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
this game I think right now the game is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350 
this game I think right now the game is
pretty<00:01:49.829> stalemated<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.700> point<00:01:50.970> if

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pretty stalemated at this point if

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.789 
pretty stalemated at this point if
anything<00:01:51.720> flashes<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> little<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:52.439> ahead<00:01:52.530> he

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
anything flashes a little bit ahead he

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.160 
anything flashes a little bit ahead he
has<00:01:52.920> basically<00:01:53.640> been<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.880> her<00:01:54.149> ass<00:01:54.329> tum<00:01:54.689> he's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
has basically been on her ass tum he's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.410 
has basically been on her ass tum he's
lost<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.500> couple<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.890> suvs<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.579> only<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> few<00:01:56.969> and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
lost a couple of suvs but only a few and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.999 
lost a couple of suvs but only a few and
he<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.140> Science<00:01:58.409> Vessel<00:01:58.469> tech<00:01:58.829> up

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
he will have that Science Vessel tech up

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.800 
he will have that Science Vessel tech up
pretty<00:01:59.250> soon<00:01:59.430> he<00:01:59.969> will<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.299> able<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> convince

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
pretty soon he will be able to convince

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.359 
pretty soon he will be able to convince
probably<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.500> his<00:02:01.619> late-game<00:02:01.799> tech<00:02:02.159> very

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
out though let's as I say that because

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.559 
out though let's as I say that because
of<00:02:45.220> those<00:02:45.310> there<00:02:45.640> are<00:02:45.790> lurkers<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.390> field

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
of those there are lurkers in the field

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.569 
of those there are lurkers in the field
and<00:02:46.630> he<00:02:46.690> doesn't<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.260> science<00:02:47.590> vessels<00:02:47.890> with

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
and he doesn't have science vessels with

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.759 
and he doesn't have science vessels with
enough<00:02:48.910> energy<00:02:49.060> for<00:02:49.329> irradiate<00:02:50.019> anytime<00:02:50.440> soon

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
enough energy for irradiate anytime soon

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.770 
enough energy for irradiate anytime soon
and<00:02:51.010> those<00:02:51.640> lurkers<00:02:52.000> could<00:02:52.299> be<00:02:52.420> devastating

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
and those lurkers could be devastating

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.309 
and those lurkers could be devastating

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
looks like he does get 14 min so he will

have<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.370> swarm<00:06:12.669> I<00:06:12.789> believe<00:06:13.030> in<00:06:13.210> range<00:06:13.389> of

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
some of the turrets and he's continued

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.520 
some of the turrets and he's continued
to<00:06:15.400> produce<00:06:15.550> these<00:06:15.789> two<00:06:15.940> filers<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.530> really

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
to produce these two filers and really

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.200 
to produce these two filers and really
actually<00:06:17.740> I<00:06:17.919> that<00:06:18.219> wasn't<00:06:18.460> as<00:06:18.669> all<00:06:18.849> and<00:06:19.030> as<00:06:19.120> I

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
actually I that wasn't as all and as I

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.129 
actually I that wasn't as all and as I

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
thought it would be I thought he would

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.959 
thought it would be I thought he would

more of his gas in the initial attack

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.620 
more of his gas in the initial attack
but<00:06:24.099> looks<00:06:24.250> like<00:06:24.310> he's<00:06:24.490> actually<00:06:24.669> build<00:06:24.969> gone

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
but looks like he's actually build gone

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.909 
but looks like he's actually build gone
back<00:06:25.810> to<00:06:25.960> building<00:06:26.199> more<00:06:26.380> to<00:06:26.530> filers<00:06:26.889> and
