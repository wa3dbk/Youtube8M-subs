00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.770
 which you can access through 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.090
 at the last mission of the dlc de 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.440
 the advent of a call that I believe 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.130
 this is the first mission that you 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.739
 request to do 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.960
 thanks to the fashion khat missions 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.790

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.010
 mission the advent of a call that is 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.720
 accessible from the ishtar depression 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.000

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.400
 on Venus in which you will need 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.590
 stalking scholasse so when you 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.420
 launch the mission at some point from 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.640
 your journey you can not get to this 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.440
 where you have to turn back and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.030
 just left before getting on the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.430
 bridge so right after you know it a 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.530
 kind of his picks with a design 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.030
 different from what you usually have 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.420
 have these little holes in the cave 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.340
 elia the symbol of the wolves that lies 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.140
 on the ground of this cave 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.270
 so we do not know yet 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.479
 what does it really mean 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.760
 it means what's the point 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.590
 very little use unfortunately for 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.270

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.700

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.080
 it just brings you nothing more 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.150
