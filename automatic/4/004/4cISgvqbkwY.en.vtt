in<00:02:40.950> Under<00:02:41.190> Armour<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.610> far<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.120> has<00:02:42.270> been

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
in Under Armour so far that it has been

in Under Armour so far that it has been
to<00:02:42.570> make<00:02:42.690> money<00:02:42.960> in<00:02:43.490> horse<00:02:44.490> racing<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:45.750> I

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
to make money in horse racing but I

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.290 
to make money in horse racing but I
think<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.380> love<00:02:47.010> or<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> opportunity

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
think the the love or the opportunity

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.670 
think the the love or the opportunity
that<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:48.900> too<00:02:49.200> different<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
that we have is not too different and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.050 
that we have is not too different and
what<00:02:49.860> we<00:02:49.950> want<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.190> do<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> formula<00:02:50.880> for
