00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello my dear oldies and gamer 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.730
 Welcome to the new follow 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.690
 today it's a bit about 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.690
 Exclusive title in the case for the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.759
 current console generation ps4 xbox 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.309
 from here very so you now 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.800
 bombarded with hd remakes is formally 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 you get the definitive versions of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.859
 they are actually playing some 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.080
 before that pretty smart and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.590
 now, for example, devil may cry 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.119
 or statements announced and it is 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.099
 yes, a little bit always the mood 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 As we would the exclusive titles of this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.850
 generation a bit too short 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 and I personally think that the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.910
 Explicit meanwhile really get 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.700
 I'm playing pretty bombeck right now 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.010
 Two pieces on the PS4 plays blood bowl 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.950
 and on the xbox of i have im now 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.750
 orient small forest started especially 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.820
 The latter was very much looking forward to it 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.620
 I saw the first us 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.260
 I immediately liked style as well 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.230
 very happy that we are such a metroid 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.750
 fewer games in which you just newly 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.010
 the area opens up and the longer you do that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 Game plays and new skills 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 gets a little bit on blood bonn white 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.309
 torn who it is yes 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.409
 basically the direct succession that way 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.650
 So play the dax house of the demon 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.320
 Souls row and I never really have 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.580
 one played this game and me 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 thought so a higher not know but 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.330
 the reviews were so good we have 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.220
 so fancy to play this game 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.509
 and only after the style so this 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 Gothic horror 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.540
 I'm really looking forward to that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.040
 and started the part too 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.020
 play and I'm really excited about that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.509
 point I feel it all 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 Exclusive title until it's his new one 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.049
 So it looks like maybe 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.060
 launch title are keeping pretty good 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.590
 pretty much the scales and I'm with 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.780
 none of the two consoles 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.790
 unhappy so that's my summary 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.990
 is also good now also now 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.720
 year old over a year old 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.850
 and yes both has but for me in 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.140
 I'm reluctant to play both games now 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.159
 I would have missed it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.840
 imagine that people are giving the wedding rings 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.729
 of course there are people 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 The sad you play sheet bomb 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.509
 can and I personally find that one 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.579
 good thing because that shows that this 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.159
 Consoles that still have titles 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.290
 they have the playership 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.489
 and before that too 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.720
 Feel that I have everything here 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.970
 the balance keeps in the beginning to the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.480
 For example, I personally have one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.819
 a little more fun and xbox 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 there was a game like the 13 3 there 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.959
 killzone did not quite click 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.340
 with me but later I have again 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.890
 so a little bit more ps4 seen so 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.890
 a player vps 4 that me the big one 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.290
 big edge has in the genre is true 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.000
 the extra there such a case ingame but on 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.920
 the page has here, for example, the xbox 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.560
 killer instincts but I do not 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.180
 as much games as the gf is because the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.569
 not so big in the game 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.340
 other 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.440
 which is because of that also applies to the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.569
 ps3 has appeared so no 100 is 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.829
 percent exclusive title but also in 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.410
 other shows have the feeling that the 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.950
 Consoles pretty well keep the balance 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.840
 for example, the xbox has ca and the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.090
 psp has drive works drive is not the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.349
 of his mega berner but there is always a 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.739
 Option the games for themselves 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.569
 to have 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.099
 then I have infamous seconds 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.640
 played a very good part 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.250
 openworld sandbox moderately and on the xbox 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.890
 hannover drive was at almost the same time 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.560
 which was pretty similar in just a game 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.030
 just on the xbox one and meanwhile 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.230
 the feeling that the two consoles 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.030
 find your way slowly 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.630
 it comes from the title because I'm glad 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.250
 really that only nextgen are 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.010
 but just today has recorded 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.120
 For the first time I have it 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.799
 me that would do so a bit 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.900
 I'm waiting a bit 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.760
 until I mean something 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.109
 still puts the game catalog on the table 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.459
 finished the game 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.349
 Downloading could be a reward 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.030
 so to speak, that I finally 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.609
 also by playing what I started 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.989
 and you may have thought that is 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.870
 Great people like it 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.209
 recommend but not many because you xbox 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.650
 one and then ten meters came first 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.109
 These thoughts may be one 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.590
 title is also because that is not the triple 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.049
 a title is the mega press gets 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.269
 really should play the people 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.190
 should have seen and among the people 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.200
 really damn I would have said then 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.090
 just the xbox of the same sheet construction 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.200
 I do not know how many people do that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.209
 really love people and idolatrous 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.419
 it is important that such people exist 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.889
 the say now I need ps4 because 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:18.130
 honestly no matter what console you 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.690
 buys or on whose side is in the 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.760
 The end effect is that people really do 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.360
 So only one side is moral 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.340
 beat 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.510
 that's what the game industry needs 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.040
 again a bit of the desire to play 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.450
 I think it's like that by now 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.310
 The year started well with these 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.420
 both games for me personally has one 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.280
 I have had enough 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.010
 material had all the way to wear though 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.360
 Now I have platform where I am 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.520
 really beautiful can sink me rows 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.860
 danuri will be even better soon 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.140
 So I think the new generation 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.600
 Consoles is finally here 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.230
 So, we have a little bit going on 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.420
 lasted 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.480
 July so the eu is also yes 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.870
 I'm not all that good at it 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.740
 same level as Xbox vps from 4 to 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.030
 For technical reasons it would be 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.760
 probably not quite fair though 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.280
 the games qualitatively only for eu 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.720
 are terrific so there you have to 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.550
 do not talk about it but in mine 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.650
 eyes are going on so far 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.690
 with the next generation he 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.050
 actually the granule is how you see 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.580
 the 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.800
 leave me the comments your thoughts 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.040
 in the comments your thoughts too 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.150
 this theme will bring you a high five 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.690
 see you in the next video until then 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.690
 at
