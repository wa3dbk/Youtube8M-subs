actually draining it so what I've got to
do<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:55.970> my<00:00:56.239> system<00:00:56.629> now<00:00:56.840> is<00:00:57.489> I've<00:00:58.489> got<00:00:58.640> a

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
do to my system now is I've got a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.250 
do to my system now is I've got a
partially<00:00:59.180> drain<00:00:59.450> I'm<00:00:59.750> going<00:00:59.870> to<00:00:59.930> completely

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
partially drain I'm going to completely

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.010 
partially drain I'm going to completely
drain<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.650> but<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:00.800> get<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.070> idea<00:01:02.020> because

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
drain it but you get the idea because

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.240 
drain it but you get the idea because
I've<00:01:03.140> got<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.290> put<00:01:03.440> me<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.620> new<00:01:03.739> memory<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:06.250> so

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
I've got to put me a new memory and so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.960 
I've got to put me a new memory and so
the<00:01:07.340> first<00:01:07.580> thing<00:01:07.820> you've<00:01:07.940> got<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.119> do<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.690> find

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
the first thing you've got to do is find

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.330 
the first thing you've got to do is find
the<00:01:10.970> highest<00:01:11.210> point<00:01:11.450> now<00:01:11.869> it's<00:01:12.110> normally<00:01:12.530> you

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
the highest point now it's normally you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.969 
the highest point now it's normally you
should<00:01:13.640> have<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.820> fill<00:01:14.060> port<00:01:14.360> or<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:15.140> reservoir

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
should have a fill port or a reservoir

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.680 
should have a fill port or a reservoir
at<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.190> top<00:01:16.750> at<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.780> highest<00:01:18.080> possible<00:01:18.500> point

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
at the top at the highest possible point

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.480 
at the top at the highest possible point
the<00:01:20.690> principle<00:01:21.259> is<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:23.170> put<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.290> tube<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:24.740> to

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
the principle is you put the tube in to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.490 
the principle is you put the tube in to
the<00:01:26.030> either<00:01:26.420> down<00:01:26.720> through<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.050> top<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
the either down through the top and the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.969 
the either down through the top and the
fill<00:01:27.710> port<00:01:28.330> into<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.420> fluid<00:01:29.690> what<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.590> suggest

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
fill port into the fluid what I suggest

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.109 
fill port into the fluid what I suggest
you<00:01:31.100> actually<00:01:31.220> do<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.610> you've<00:01:31.729> got<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> tea

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
you actually do is you've got a tea

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.230 
you actually do is you've got a tea
joint<00:01:32.450> he's<00:01:33.170> going<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.060> cross

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
joint he's going to the the cross

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.240 
joint he's going to the the cross
section<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.979> put<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.310> pipe<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:39.250> I'll

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
section and put the pipe in and I'll

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.770 
section and put the pipe in and I'll
come<00:01:40.610> back<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:40.970> minute<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.270> show<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:41.540> what

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
with with the top off well we're not

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.680 
with with the top off well we're not
gonna<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:38.690> oxide<00:02:39.140> be<00:02:39.200> no<00:02:39.319> fluid<00:02:40.540> squeeze<00:02:41.540> that

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
gonna get oxide be no fluid squeeze that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.839 
gonna get oxide be no fluid squeeze that
the<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.680> bottle<00:02:42.980> first<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.370> get<00:02:43.489> some<00:02:43.670> air<00:02:43.819> out

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.950 
the the bottle first to get some air out
and<00:02:44.300> then<00:02:44.840> tighten<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> top<00:02:45.440> back<00:02:45.650> off<00:02:46.960> so

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
and then tighten the top back off so

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.180 
and then tighten the top back off so
you've<00:02:48.050> got<00:02:48.140> one<00:02:48.290> or<00:02:48.320> two<00:02:48.410> ways<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.860> doing<00:02:48.980> it

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
you've got one or two ways of doing it

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.740 
you've got one or two ways of doing it
basically

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.970 

squeeze<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.700> get<00:02:56.820> air<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.210> through

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
squeeze it so you get air going through

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.760 
squeeze it so you get air going through
release<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.130> pressure<00:02:59.340> and<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:01.470> start

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
release the pressure and you start

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.280 
release the pressure and you start
getting<00:03:01.890> water<00:03:02.130> coming<00:03:02.520> out<00:03:02.930> now<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.110> drop

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
getting water coming out now if you drop

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.180 
getting water coming out now if you drop
it<00:03:04.440> down<00:03:04.560> below<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.060> reservoir<00:03:06.510> height

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
it down below the the reservoir height

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.860 
it down below the the reservoir height
loosen<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> top<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.520> bit<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> air<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.750> get

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
loosen the top a bit so the air can get

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:19.360 
loosen the top a bit so the air can get
into<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.230> bottle<00:03:12.320> all<00:03:13.320> right<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:13.980> see

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.910 

yeah<00:03:24.170> there<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.260> go<00:03:25.290> that's<00:03:25.500> all<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.800> water

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
yeah there you go that's all the water

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.650 
yeah there you go that's all the water
gone<00:03:26.220> out<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.580> rest<00:03:27.980> now<00:03:29.420> obviously<00:03:30.420> I've

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
gone out of the rest now obviously I've

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.350 
gone out of the rest now obviously I've
only<00:03:30.780> got<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.020> take<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:32.000> excuse<00:03:33.000> me<00:03:33.090> I've<00:03:33.210> only

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
only got to take the excuse me I've only

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.820 
only got to take the excuse me I've only
got<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.600> take<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.320> top<00:03:34.940> hose<00:03:35.940> off<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.830> in

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
got to take the the top hose off this in

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.600 
got to take the the top hose off this in
order<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.190> get<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:39.000> plumbing<00:03:39.510> in<00:03:39.600> for<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
order to get the the plumbing in for the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.360 
order to get the the plumbing in for the
the<00:03:41.610> new<00:03:41.790> RAM<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.410> I've<00:03:43.740> got<00:03:43.890> no<00:03:44.040> need<00:03:44.250> to

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the new RAM so I've got no need to

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.490 
the new RAM so I've got no need to
actually<00:03:44.610> drain<00:03:44.850> anymore<00:03:45.270> if<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.200> want<00:03:46.380> to

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
actually drain anymore if you want to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.900 
actually drain anymore if you want to
actually<00:03:46.590> drain<00:03:47.010> any<00:03:47.310> more<00:03:47.580> than<00:03:47.730> that

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
actually drain any more than that

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.210 
actually drain any more than that
there's<00:03:48.300> no<00:03:48.450> actual<00:03:49.290> fluid<00:03:49.800> in<00:03:49.890> this<00:03:49.980> type

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
there's no actual fluid in this type

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.550 
there's no actual fluid in this type
pipe<00:03:50.490> now<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.660> if<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:51.810> disconnect<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.350> top

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
pipe now so if you disconnect the top

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.030 
pipe now so if you disconnect the top
pipe<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:53.120> then<00:03:54.120> hold<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.230> down<00:03:55.410> into<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
pipe and then hold it down into the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.970 
pipe and then hold it down into the
bottle<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.270> drain<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.320> then

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
bottle you can drain it like that then

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.520 
bottle you can drain it like that then
obviously<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.790> take<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.120> pipe<00:04:00.330> off<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
obviously you take the pipe off the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.050 
obviously you take the pipe off the
other<00:04:01.650> area<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.130> I'll<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.310> no<00:04:02.490> fluid<00:04:02.880> in<00:04:02.970> it

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
other area that I'll have no fluid in it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.550 
other area that I'll have no fluid in it
which<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.270> that<00:04:03.300> one<00:04:03.630> that's<00:04:03.810> got<00:04:03.960> no<00:04:04.110> fluid<00:04:04.470> in

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
which is that one that's got no fluid in

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.440 
which is that one that's got no fluid in
and<00:04:04.710> then<00:04:05.520> you<00:04:05.610> work<00:04:05.760> your<00:04:05.790> way<00:04:06.000> down<00:04:06.030> like

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
and then you work your way down like

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.560 
and then you work your way down like
that<00:04:06.770> it's<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.890> long<00:04:08.070> drawn-out<00:04:08.640> process<00:04:08.760> but

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
that it's a long drawn-out process but

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.390 
that it's a long drawn-out process but
you<00:04:09.840> don't<00:04:10.020> lose<00:04:10.140> any<00:04:10.350> fluid<00:04:10.770> and<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.250> can

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
you don't lose any fluid and you can

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.750 
you don't lose any fluid and you can
reuse<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:13.320> hopefully<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:13.890> don't<00:04:13.920> drop<00:04:14.130> in

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
reuse it and hopefully you don't drop in

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.440 
reuse it and hopefully you don't drop in
anywhere<00:04:15.150> when<00:04:15.690> I've<00:04:15.780> had<00:04:15.810> no<00:04:16.080> dropped<00:04:16.380> yet<00:04:16.620> so

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.920 

well<00:04:21.450> I'm<00:04:21.540> on<00:04:21.630> it

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
well I'm on it

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.570 
well I'm on it
the<00:04:22.530> other<00:04:22.680> thing<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:22.890> you<00:04:23.040> can<00:04:23.160> actually<00:04:23.280> do

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
the other thing that you can actually do

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.940 
the other thing that you can actually do
I've<00:04:23.760> just<00:04:23.910> thought<00:04:25.640> if<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.850> take<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.950> if

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
I've just thought if you take the if

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.260 
I've just thought if you take the if
you've<00:04:29.130> got<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> reservoir<00:04:29.670> mounted<00:04:30.120> at<00:04:30.180> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
you've got a reservoir mounted at the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.530 
you've got a reservoir mounted at the
top<00:04:30.450> like<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.780> one<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.110> um<00:04:31.880> if<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.060> take<00:04:33.300> the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
top like this one is um if you take the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.310 
top like this one is um if you take the
the<00:04:33.900> reservoir<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.130> actually<00:04:35.490> drop<00:04:35.670> it<00:04:35.820> down

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
the reservoir and actually drop it down

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.110 
the reservoir and actually drop it down
the<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.860> fluid<00:04:38.040> actually<00:04:38.430> comes<00:04:38.610> back<00:04:38.730> into

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the the fluid actually comes back into

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.680 
the the fluid actually comes back into
the<00:04:39.240> into<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.630> reservoir<00:04:41.510> especially<00:04:42.510> coming

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
the into the reservoir especially coming

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.420 
the into the reservoir especially coming
I<00:04:42.960> mean<00:04:43.140> I've<00:04:43.260> got<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.590> other<00:04:43.980> reservoir

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
I mean I've got the the other reservoir

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.610 
I mean I've got the the other reservoir
in<00:04:44.550> here<00:04:44.700> but<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:45.570> tax<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.960> levels<00:04:46.260> itself

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
in here but you tax the levels itself

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.080 
in here but you tax the levels itself
out<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:46.890> if<00:04:47.130> you<00:04:47.220> just<00:04:47.370> need<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.640> take<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.910> top

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
out so if you just need to take the top

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.840 
out so if you just need to take the top
piping<00:04:48.600> off<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.650> replace<00:04:50.010> anything<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.670> there

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
piping off and replace anything in there

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.720 
piping off and replace anything in there
then<00:04:51.030> that's<00:04:51.150> fine<00:04:51.950> but<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.130> can<00:04:53.340> get<00:04:53.460> as<00:04:53.550> much

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
then that's fine but you can get as much

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.980 
then that's fine but you can get as much
as<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:53.970> possibly<00:04:54.330> can<00:04:54.510> out<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:54.870> you've

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
as you possibly can out that you've

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.170 
as you possibly can out that you've
fueled<00:04:55.380> by<00:04:55.410> using<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.160> reservoir<00:04:57.000> if<00:04:57.090> you

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
fueled by using the reservoir if you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.270 
fueled by using the reservoir if you
know<00:04:57.300> what<00:04:57.390> I<00:04:57.420> mean<00:04:57.630> I'm<00:04:58.290> useless<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.860> explain

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
know what I mean I'm useless to explain

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.779 
know what I mean I'm useless to explain
it<00:04:59.520> so

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.249 

there<00:05:04.789> you<00:05:04.849> go<00:05:04.999> that<00:05:05.239> pipes<00:05:05.479> completely<00:05:06.020> clear

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
there you go that pipes completely clear

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:06.639 
there you go that pipes completely clear
now

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:06.649 
now

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:40.779 
now
so<00:05:35.349> it's<00:05:36.399> OCZ<00:05:37.449> ocz<00:05:38.619> memory<00:05:39.619> night<00:05:39.949> PC<00:05:40.610> to

megahertz water cool so I don't know how

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.299 
megahertz water cool so I don't know how
I'm<00:05:51.529> exactly<00:05:51.979> going<00:05:52.129> to<00:05:52.189> do<00:05:52.399> this<00:05:52.610> yet<00:05:52.939> but

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:54.309 
I'm exactly going to do this yet but

00:05:54.309 --> 00:06:18.640 
I'm exactly going to do this yet but
here<00:05:55.309> we<00:05:55.429> go

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.800 

okay<00:06:19.650> I<00:06:19.680> know<00:06:20.060> where<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.150> plumbers<00:06:21.480> got<00:06:21.600> to<00:06:21.720> go

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
okay I know where the plumbers got to go

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.050 
okay I know where the plumbers got to go
exactly<00:06:22.350> the<00:06:22.650> the<00:06:23.160> length<00:06:23.280> of<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.490> pipes<00:06:23.760> now

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
exactly the the length of the pipes now

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.550 
exactly the the length of the pipes now
on<00:06:24.330> the<00:06:24.420> top<00:06:24.630> I've<00:06:24.900> just<00:06:25.080> got<00:06:25.230> to<00:06:25.320> do<00:06:25.410> the

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
on the top I've just got to do the

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.820 
on the top I've just got to do the
bottom<00:06:27.080> decided<00:06:28.080> that<00:06:28.140> that<00:06:28.260> one<00:06:28.440> is<00:06:28.560> going<00:06:28.740> to

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
bottom decided that that one is going to

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.700 
bottom decided that that one is going to
go<00:06:28.950> to<00:06:29.010> the<00:06:29.220> bottom<00:06:29.430> because<00:06:29.790> of<00:06:29.970> bubbles<00:06:30.750> so

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
go to the bottom because of bubbles so

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.900 
go to the bottom because of bubbles so
the<00:06:31.800> bubbles<00:06:32.070> can<00:06:32.130> actually<00:06:32.400> get<00:06:32.550> through<00:06:32.700> to

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
the bubbles can actually get through to

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.060 
the bubbles can actually get through to
the<00:06:33.000> top<00:06:33.210> and<00:06:33.510> then<00:06:34.230> they<00:06:34.350> go<00:06:34.470> from<00:06:34.650> the<00:06:34.830> top<00:06:35.010> to

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
the top and then they go from the top to

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:41.390 
the top and then they go from the top to
the<00:06:35.660> input<00:06:36.660> on<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:36.900> micro<00:06:37.260> rez<00:06:38.150> via<00:06:39.150> that<00:06:40.400> so

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
the input on the micro rez via that so

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.400 
the input on the micro rez via that so
I've<00:06:41.790> got<00:06:42.090> to<00:06:42.180> take<00:06:42.330> it<00:06:42.480> out<00:06:42.600> now<00:06:42.630> I'm<00:06:43.170> going<00:06:43.320> to

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
I've got to take it out now I'm going to

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.760 
I've got to take it out now I'm going to
cable<00:06:44.160> tie<00:06:44.340> these<00:06:44.400> things<00:06:44.640> to<00:06:45.060> stop<00:06:45.270> any<00:06:45.770> air

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
cable tie these things to stop any air

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.250 
cable tie these things to stop any air
getting<00:06:47.040> sorry<00:06:47.940> just<00:06:48.510> got<00:06:48.630> the<00:06:48.750> pipes<00:06:48.990> leaking

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
getting sorry just got the pipes leaking

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.230 
getting sorry just got the pipes leaking
so<00:06:49.880> I'll<00:06:50.880> come<00:06:51.090> back<00:06:51.210> when<00:06:51.360> that's<00:06:51.570> done<00:06:53.240> okay

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
so I'll come back when that's done okay

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.610 
so I'll come back when that's done okay
because<00:06:54.450> of<00:06:54.630> all<00:06:54.750> the<00:06:54.870> the<00:06:55.290> plumbing<00:06:55.560> have

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
because of all the the plumbing have

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.960 
because of all the the plumbing have
already<00:06:55.890> done<00:06:56.040> I've<00:06:56.160> had<00:06:56.280> to<00:06:56.370> change<00:06:56.669> things

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
already done I've had to change things

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.440 
already done I've had to change things
slightly<00:06:57.320> the<00:06:58.640> the<00:06:59.640> input<00:06:59.760> to<00:07:00.120> the<00:07:00.240> RAM

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
slightly the the input to the RAM

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.390 
slightly the the input to the RAM
actually<00:07:00.810> goes<00:07:00.960> into<00:07:01.260> the<00:07:01.500> top<00:07:01.740> now<00:07:01.980> and<00:07:02.280> out

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
actually goes into the top now and out

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.520 
actually goes into the top now and out
through<00:07:02.640> the<00:07:02.760> bottom<00:07:03.120> and<00:07:03.300> back<00:07:04.080> into<00:07:04.380> the

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
through the bottom and back into the

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.610 
through the bottom and back into the
into<00:07:05.340> the<00:07:05.430> res<00:07:05.990> so<00:07:06.990> it's<00:07:07.140> gonna<00:07:07.260> be<00:07:07.440> a<00:07:07.470> bit

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
into the res so it's gonna be a bit

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.050 
into the res so it's gonna be a bit
harder<00:07:07.860> to<00:07:07.890> bleed<00:07:10.490> what<00:07:11.490> I<00:07:11.520> had<00:07:11.640> to<00:07:11.700> do<00:07:11.820> that

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
harder to bleed what I had to do that

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.720 
harder to bleed what I had to do that
way<00:07:12.210> because<00:07:12.390> the<00:07:12.720> the<00:07:13.110> pipes<00:07:13.380> wouldn't<00:07:13.770> Bend

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
way because the the pipes wouldn't Bend

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:21.980 
way because the the pipes wouldn't Bend
from<00:07:16.550> there<00:07:17.550> to<00:07:17.790> there<00:07:17.970> so<00:07:20.510> just<00:07:21.510> gonna<00:07:21.720> fill

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
from there to there so just gonna fill

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.360 
from there to there so just gonna fill
it<00:07:22.080> up<00:07:22.110> now<00:07:23.390> as<00:07:24.390> you<00:07:24.570> know<00:07:24.720> the<00:07:24.990> way<00:07:25.950> arch<00:07:26.160> the
