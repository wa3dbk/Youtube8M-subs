all right so I'm putting spritz on and I
knew<00:00:06.359> with<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:07.189> but<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.360> do<00:00:09.510> it

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
knew with this but this is how I do it

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.499 
knew with this but this is how I do it
there's<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.639> lot<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.820> people<00:00:12.030> say<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.210> need

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
there's a lot of people say you need

there's a lot of people say you need
special<00:00:12.929> tools<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.799> don't<00:00:14.670> believe<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.849> first

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
special tools I don't believe that first

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.230 
special tools I don't believe that first
what<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.730> measured<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.880> scale

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
what I do is measured out the scale

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.160 
what I do is measured out the scale
length<00:00:18.650> on<00:00:19.670> an<00:00:20.670> existing<00:00:20.939> guitar<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.840> held

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
length on an existing guitar I just held

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.540 
length on an existing guitar I just held
the<00:00:22.260> fret<00:00:22.500> board<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.250> made<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the fret board up to it and made the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.009 
the fret board up to it and made the
marks<00:00:24.019> then<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.140> used<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:26.070> straightedge<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.170 

made<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> lines<00:00:31.320> straight<00:00:34.610> then<00:00:35.610> instead<00:00:36.059> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
made the lines straight then instead of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.290 
made the lines straight then instead of
buying<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> special<00:00:37.290> salt<00:00:37.700> that<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.850> know

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
buying the special salt that you know

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.270 
buying the special salt that you know
have<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.350> start<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.460> cut<00:00:42.390> off<00:00:42.570> with

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
have to have I start the cut off with

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
have to have I start the cut off with
this<00:00:44.280> small<00:00:44.670> axle<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.870> blades<00:00:46.110> too<00:00:46.320> wide

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
this small axle the the blades too wide

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.240 
this small axle the the blades too wide
for<00:00:46.530> frets<00:00:47.010> though<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.530> just<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.920> group

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
for frets though so I just get a group

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.650 
for frets though so I just get a group
going<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> because<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.449> one's

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
going with it because it's it this one's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
going with it because it's it this one's
better<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:51.930> starting<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
better for starting it so you get the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.080 
better for starting it so you get the
groove<00:00:53.520> start<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.660> small<00:00:56.090> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
groove start up that just a small and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.750 
groove start up that just a small and
then<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> take<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.690> coping<00:00:58.440> saw<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.579> much

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
then I take this coping saw as a much

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.160 
then I take this coping saw as a much
thinner<00:01:00.000> blade<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.280> figured<00:01:02.609> out

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
thinner blade on it and I figured out

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
thinner blade on it and I figured out
how<00:01:04.170> deep<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:05.280> trial<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.670> error<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
how deep to go just trial and error I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
how deep to go just trial and error I
tried<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.510> scrap<00:01:06.840> wood<00:01:06.960> before<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.320> put<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
tried it on scrap wood before I put it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.429 
tried it on scrap wood before I put it
on<00:01:07.560> my<00:01:07.680> actual<00:01:07.950> neck<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:11.330> lightly

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
on my actual neck here and I lightly

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
on my actual neck here and I lightly
just<00:01:13.439> went<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.580> we've<00:01:15.210> already

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
just went with it you know we've already

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.370 
just went with it you know we've already
made<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.689> grooves<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.170> gonna<00:01:16.290> make

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
again the groove I push it down with my

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.550 
again the groove I push it down with my
thumb<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:33.570> make<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.050> seated<00:01:34.230> in<00:01:34.440> there

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
thumb to make sure it's seated in there

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.030 
thumb to make sure it's seated in there
good<00:01:34.910> so<00:01:35.910> if<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.780> rolls<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.380> side<00:01:37.710> you're

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
good so if it rolls to the side you're

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.080 
good so if it rolls to the side you're
kind<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:39.350> mess<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.740> neck<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.730> little<00:01:41.970> bit
