so<00:00:06.500> we're<00:00:06.649> talking<00:00:06.799> about<00:00:07.069> glute<00:00:07.460> strength

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:07.819 
so we're talking about glute strength

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.810 
so we're talking about glute strength
and<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:08.570> importance<00:00:09.080> of<00:00:09.440> training<00:00:10.370> muscles

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
and the importance of training muscles

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.850 
and the importance of training muscles
and<00:00:11.120> chains<00:00:11.480> and<00:00:11.780> not<00:00:11.990> just<00:00:12.320> selectively

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
and chains and not just selectively

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.160 
and chains and not just selectively
trying<00:00:13.220> to<00:00:13.340> isolate<00:00:13.600> foot<00:00:14.600> strengthening

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
trying to isolate foot strengthening

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.690 
trying to isolate foot strengthening
strength<00:00:15.470> hips<00:00:15.740> strength<00:00:16.040> things<00:00:16.280> like<00:00:16.490> that

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
strength hips strength things like that

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.820 
strength hips strength things like that
and<00:00:17.150> this<00:00:17.420> is<00:00:17.510> gonna<00:00:17.660> kind<00:00:17.840> of<00:00:17.990> show<00:00:18.050> you<00:00:18.290> what

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
and this is gonna kind of show you what

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.050 
and this is gonna kind of show you what
we're<00:00:19.040> what<00:00:19.370> we're<00:00:19.490> talking<00:00:19.730> about<00:00:19.820> when<00:00:19.970> we

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
we're what we're talking about when we

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.490 
we're what we're talking about when we
do<00:00:20.150> that<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:20.690> we're<00:00:20.780> gonna<00:00:20.840> watch<00:00:21.110> the<00:00:21.290> left

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
do that so we're gonna watch the left

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.410 
do that so we're gonna watch the left
foot<00:00:21.710> come<00:00:21.920> in<00:00:22.070> contact<00:00:22.280> with<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:22.789> ground<00:00:22.970> and

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
foot come in contact with the ground and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.560 
foot come in contact with the ground and
these<00:00:24.410> will<00:00:24.650> just<00:00:24.680> be<00:00:24.890> synced<00:00:25.400> up<00:00:25.520> for<00:00:26.360> the

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
these will just be synced up for the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.480 
these will just be synced up for the
purpose<00:00:26.930> of<00:00:27.110> watching<00:00:27.619> these<00:00:27.800> muscles<00:00:28.220> fire

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
purpose of watching these muscles fire

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.160 
purpose of watching these muscles fire
and<00:00:28.820> change<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:29.330> we're<00:00:29.449> gonna<00:00:29.570> be<00:00:29.720> looking<00:00:29.869> at

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
and change so we're gonna be looking at

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.960 
and change so we're gonna be looking at
the<00:00:30.350> left<00:00:30.530> leg<00:00:30.800> we're<00:00:31.340> gonna<00:00:31.490> be<00:00:31.550> looking<00:00:31.670> at

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
the left leg we're gonna be looking at

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.720 
the left leg we're gonna be looking at
the<00:00:32.090> outside<00:00:32.239> glute<00:00:32.810> muscle<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:34.280> inside

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
the outside glute muscle and the inside

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.510 
the outside glute muscle and the inside
knee<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:36.470> inside<00:00:36.829> part<00:00:37.130> of<00:00:37.220> the<00:00:37.280> foot

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
knee and the inside part of the foot

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.690 
knee and the inside part of the foot
these<00:00:38.090> three<00:00:38.660> muscle<00:00:39.110> groups<00:00:39.399> your<00:00:40.399> glute

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
these three muscle groups your glute

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.410 
these three muscle groups your glute
medius<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.540> gluten<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.950> your<00:00:43.610> VMO<00:00:44.090> which<00:00:44.300> is

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
medius and gluten and your VMO which is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.090 
medius and gluten and your VMO which is
part<00:00:44.630> of<00:00:44.660> your<00:00:44.809> quad<00:00:45.020> your<00:00:45.380> posterior<00:00:45.739> tib

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
part of your quad your posterior tib

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.500 
part of your quad your posterior tib
which<00:00:46.250> is<00:00:46.370> your<00:00:46.489> foot<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.790> ankle<00:00:46.850> muscle<00:00:47.300> all

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
which is your foot and ankle muscle all

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.569 
which is your foot and ankle muscle all
fire<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:48.170> decelerate<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:49.040> into<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.399> ground

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
fire to decelerate you into the ground

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.150 
fire to decelerate you into the ground
so<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:50.270> can<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:51.140> can<00:00:51.170> shock<00:00:51.559> observe<00:00:51.920> through

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
so you can you can shock observe through

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.500 
so you can you can shock observe through
that<00:00:52.309> foot<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:52.760> then<00:00:52.910> pull<00:00:53.120> yourself<00:00:53.239> back

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
that foot and then pull yourself back

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.360 
that foot and then pull yourself back
off<00:00:53.870> or<00:00:54.110> push<00:00:54.260> off<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:54.649> it's<00:00:55.100> going<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:55.280> show

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
off or push off so it's going to show

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.459 
off or push off so it's going to show
you<00:00:55.579> far<00:00:56.059> these<00:00:56.360> muscles<00:00:56.809> firing<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.290> chain

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
you far these muscles firing and chain

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.080 
you far these muscles firing and chain
we're<00:00:57.710> actually<00:00:57.860> going<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.219> probably<00:00:58.969> go

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
we're actually going to probably go

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.670 
we're actually going to probably go
through<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.840> let's<00:00:59.960> watch<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.469> right<00:01:00.649> side

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
through and let's watch the right side

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.599 
through and let's watch the right side
because<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.309> right<00:01:01.460> side<00:01:01.760> has<00:01:02.180> a<00:01:02.239> more<00:01:02.540> ideal

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
because the right side has a more ideal

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.249 
because the right side has a more ideal
firing<00:01:04.609> pattern<00:01:04.999> so<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.689> right<00:01:05.840> foots<00:01:06.109> coming

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
firing pattern so the right foots coming

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.010 
firing pattern so the right foots coming
in<00:01:06.469> contact<00:01:06.679> with<00:01:07.069> the<00:01:07.159> ground<00:01:07.509> and<00:01:08.509> we<00:01:08.659> see<00:01:08.899> it

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
in contact with the ground and we see it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.459 
in contact with the ground and we see it
come<00:01:09.229> over<00:01:09.819> and<00:01:10.819> what<00:01:10.969> we<00:01:11.060> can<00:01:11.209> see<00:01:11.389> is<00:01:11.569> as<00:01:12.109> far

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
come over and what we can see is as far

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.830 
come over and what we can see is as far
as<00:01:12.670> coming<00:01:13.670> all<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.939> way<00:01:14.030> down<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.719> knee

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
as coming all the way down is the knee

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.209 
as coming all the way down is the knee
looks<00:01:15.139> pretty<00:01:15.409> good<00:01:15.560> everything's<00:01:15.979> nice<00:01:16.189> and

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
looks pretty good everything's nice and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.129 
looks pretty good everything's nice and
aligned<00:01:16.670> there<00:01:16.909> he's<00:01:17.029> controlling<00:01:17.539> we're

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:18.139 
aligned there he's controlling we're

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:19.599 
aligned there he's controlling we're
looking<00:01:18.409> at<00:01:18.499> the<00:01:18.590> foot<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:18.829> ankle<00:01:18.979> he<00:01:19.340> doesn't

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
looking at the foot and ankle he doesn't

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.870 
looking at the foot and ankle he doesn't
have<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:19.759> huge<00:01:21.130> pronation<00:01:22.130> moment<00:01:22.670> through

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
have a huge pronation moment through

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.459 
have a huge pronation moment through
that<00:01:23.029> foot<00:01:23.389> and<00:01:23.600> everything's<00:01:23.990> nice<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.409> in

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
that foot and everything's nice and in

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.249 
that foot and everything's nice and in
line<00:01:24.679> so<00:01:25.539> we're<00:01:26.539> gonna<00:01:26.659> do<00:01:26.899> this<00:01:27.049> in

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
line so we're gonna do this in

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.230 
line so we're gonna do this in
comparison<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.369> big<00:01:28.549> thing<00:01:28.819> is<00:01:28.939> looking

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
comparison so the big thing is looking

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.459 
comparison so the big thing is looking
at<00:01:29.329> this<00:01:29.479> foot<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:29.810> ankle<00:01:29.899> this<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.349> where

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
at this foot and ankle this is where

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.719 
at this foot and ankle this is where
most<00:01:30.619> people<00:01:30.770> think<00:01:31.130> all<00:01:31.279> he<00:01:31.429> needs<00:01:31.609> is

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
most people think all he needs is

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.399 
most people think all he needs is
strengthen<00:01:32.149> its<00:01:32.299> foot<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:32.599> ankle<00:01:32.689> but<00:01:33.319> it

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
strengthen its foot and ankle but it

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.260 
strengthen its foot and ankle but it
comes<00:01:33.679> as<00:01:33.859> a<00:01:34.130> group<00:01:34.429> of<00:01:34.579> muscles<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:35.029> fire

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
comes as a group of muscles that fire

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.089 
comes as a group of muscles that fire
and<00:01:35.479> it's<00:01:35.599> not<00:01:35.779> just<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.139> single<00:01:36.349> select<00:01:36.740> muscle

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:37.099 
and it's not just a single select muscle

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.399 
and it's not just a single select muscle
group<00:01:37.279> so<00:01:37.880> as<00:01:38.060> he<00:01:38.209> comes<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:38.630> contact<00:01:38.869> with<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
group so as he comes in contact with the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.339 
group so as he comes in contact with the
ground<00:01:39.649> if<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:40.549> look<00:01:40.700> at<00:01:40.880> both<00:01:41.029> feet<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:41.689> we

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
ground if we look at both feet so we

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.889 
ground if we look at both feet so we
look<00:01:42.499> here<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.159> then<00:01:43.669> the<00:01:43.819> bigger<00:01:44.240> view<00:01:44.599> here

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
look here and then the bigger view here

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.779 
look here and then the bigger view here
you<00:01:45.049> can<00:01:45.229> see<00:01:45.439> how<00:01:45.709> much<00:01:45.919> pronation<00:01:46.459> is

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
you can see how much pronation is

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.219 
you can see how much pronation is
happening<00:01:47.149> on<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.359> inside<00:01:47.689> part<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.109> that

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
happening on the inside part of that

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.800 
happening on the inside part of that
ankle<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.029> that's<00:01:50.029> really<00:01:50.359> coming<00:01:50.539> from<00:01:50.659> a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
ankle and that's really coming from a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.749 
ankle and that's really coming from a
posterior<00:01:51.380> tib<00:01:51.560> muscle<00:01:51.919> as<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.069> comes<00:01:52.310> down<00:01:52.520> on

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
posterior tib muscle as it comes down on

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.129 
posterior tib muscle as it comes down on
the<00:01:52.849> inside<00:01:53.149> part<00:01:53.389> of<00:01:53.419> the<00:01:53.539> shin<00:01:53.749> and<00:01:53.990> it's

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
the inside part of the shin and it's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.769 
the inside part of the shin and it's
trying<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.590> slow<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.249> down<00:01:55.549> or<00:01:56.239> we're

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:56.779 
trying to slow that down or we're

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.199 
trying to slow that down or we're
supposed<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.380> pronate<00:01:57.739> when<00:01:58.099> we<00:01:58.189> come<00:01:59.179> through

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
supposed to pronate when we come through

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.639 
supposed to pronate when we come through
mid<00:01:59.569> stance<00:01:59.810> which<00:01:59.989> is<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.200> foot<00:02:00.380> underneath

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
mid stance which is the foot underneath

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.440 
mid stance which is the foot underneath
you<00:02:00.889> and<00:02:01.069> then<00:02:01.189> we<00:02:01.279> got<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.549> resue<00:02:02.060> pinnate<00:02:02.299> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
you and then we got to resue pinnate the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.269 
you and then we got to resue pinnate the
foot<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:02.779> we<00:02:02.869> get<00:02:02.989> a<00:02:03.020> nice<00:02:03.319> rigid<00:02:03.649> foot<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.130> push

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:04.279 
foot so we get a nice rigid foot to push

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.580 
foot so we get a nice rigid foot to push
off<00:02:04.489> of<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.299> when<00:02:05.419> he<00:02:05.539> comes<00:02:05.749> back<00:02:05.959> to<00:02:06.169> push<00:02:06.380> off

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
off of so when he comes back to push off

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.859 
off of so when he comes back to push off
he's<00:02:07.159> still<00:02:07.459> pronated<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.240> we're<00:02:08.540> looking

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
he's still pronated and we're looking

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.560 
he's still pronated and we're looking
you<00:02:09.860> know<00:02:09.890> through<00:02:10.280> here<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:11.150> mid<00:02:11.330> part

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
you know through here the the mid part

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.210 
you know through here the the mid part
of<00:02:11.690> his<00:02:11.810> shoe<00:02:11.990> still<00:02:12.380> pronated<00:02:12.980> as

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
of his shoe still pronated as

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.490 
of his shoe still pronated as
comes<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.580> push<00:02:13.760> off<00:02:13.970> he's<00:02:14.600> still<00:02:14.870> pronated

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
comes to push off he's still pronated

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.040 
comes to push off he's still pronated
and<00:02:16.100> he's<00:02:16.220> still<00:02:16.460> pronated<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.120> he<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.930> know

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
and he's still pronated so he you know

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.050 
and he's still pronated so he you know
your<00:02:18.410> your<00:02:18.860> maximum<00:02:19.370> force<00:02:19.610> push<00:02:19.820> off<00:02:19.940> is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
your your maximum force push off is

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.730 
your your maximum force push off is
gonna<00:02:20.150> come<00:02:20.480> through<00:02:20.720> supination<00:02:21.470> and

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
gonna come through supination and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.410 
gonna come through supination and
turning<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.250> foot<00:02:22.460> back<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.060> we<00:02:23.150> can<00:02:23.240> see

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
turning that foot back in so we can see

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.540 
turning that foot back in so we can see
how<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.810> see<00:02:24.050> how<00:02:24.200> he's<00:02:24.380> still<00:02:24.650> pronated<00:02:25.340> there

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
how it see how he's still pronated there

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.360 
how it see how he's still pronated there
and<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:26.480> he<00:02:26.570> comes<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.960> push<00:02:27.140> off<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:28.160> look<00:02:28.280> at

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and then he comes to push off we look at

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.770 
and then he comes to push off we look at
the<00:02:28.490> other<00:02:28.610> side<00:02:28.820> as<00:02:28.970> he<00:02:29.060> come<00:02:29.240> through<00:02:29.510> comes

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
the other side as he come through comes

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.080 
the other side as he come through comes
through<00:02:30.140> there's<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.920> pronation<00:02:31.310> he<00:02:31.790> comes

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
through there's the pronation he comes

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.050 
through there's the pronation he comes
through<00:02:32.620> resue<00:02:33.620> Penates<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.100> foot<00:02:34.370> his<00:02:35.030> foot

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
through resue Penates the foot his foot

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.530 
through resue Penates the foot his foot
starts<00:02:35.570> turning<00:02:35.960> inwards<00:02:36.380> here<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:38.150> push<00:02:38.330> off

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
starts turning inwards here to push off

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.480 
starts turning inwards here to push off
well<00:02:39.350> let's<00:02:39.500> go<00:02:39.620> back<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.010> left<00:02:40.220> foot

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
well let's go back to the left foot

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.030 
well let's go back to the left foot
we're<00:02:41.210> looking<00:02:41.540> at<00:02:41.720> his<00:02:41.900> ability<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.380> control

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
we're looking at his ability to control

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.100 
we're looking at his ability to control
his<00:02:43.280> deceleration<00:02:44.090> into<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.390> ground<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
his deceleration into the ground the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.960 
his deceleration into the ground the
glutes<00:02:45.380> gonna<00:02:45.590> fire<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.250> inside<00:02:46.610> part<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:46.880> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
glutes gonna fire the inside part of the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.430 
glutes gonna fire the inside part of the
knee<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.330> inside<00:02:47.690> part<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.050> leg<00:02:48.230> are

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
knee and the inside part of the leg are

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.500 
knee and the inside part of the leg are
all<00:02:48.950> gonna<00:02:49.190> control<00:02:49.610> those<00:02:49.820> motions<00:02:50.240> as<00:02:50.420> he

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
all gonna control those motions as he

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.930 
all gonna control those motions as he
comes<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:50.959> contact<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.650> ground<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.580> if

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
comes in contact with the ground so if

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.880 
comes in contact with the ground so if
we<00:02:53.060> go<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.480> big<00:02:53.660> view<00:02:53.900> we<00:02:54.050> watch<00:02:54.230> just<00:02:54.680> this

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
we go to the big view we watch just this

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.490 
we go to the big view we watch just this
left<00:02:55.280> leg<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.540> we<00:02:56.720> want<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.990> look<00:02:57.170> at<00:02:57.290> that

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
left leg and we want to look at that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.080 
left leg and we want to look at that
knee<00:02:57.709> you're<00:02:57.950> gonna<00:02:58.040> watch<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.550> knee<00:02:58.670> go<00:02:58.820> into

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
knee you're gonna watch the knee go into

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.490 
knee you're gonna watch the knee go into
a<00:02:59.120> knock-kneed<00:02:59.600> presentation<00:03:00.260> which<00:03:00.350> is

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
a knock-kneed presentation which is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.240 
a knock-kneed presentation which is
called<00:03:00.680> Jenny<00:03:00.890> valgus<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:02.740> that<00:03:03.740> is<00:03:03.980> showing

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
called Jenny valgus and that is showing

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.550 
called Jenny valgus and that is showing
you<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.700> his<00:03:04.940> upper<00:03:05.810> thigh<00:03:05.840> bone<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.410> his

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
you that his upper thigh bone and his

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.100 
you that his upper thigh bone and his
femur<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.310> spinning<00:03:08.300> into<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.840> ground

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
femur is spinning into the ground

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.380 
femur is spinning into the ground
because<00:03:09.770> his<00:03:10.160> external<00:03:10.580> rotators<00:03:11.150> which<00:03:11.270> are

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
because his external rotators which are

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.540 
because his external rotators which are
the<00:03:11.480> glutes<00:03:11.720> cannot<00:03:12.170> control<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.400> if<00:03:13.459> you

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
the glutes cannot control that so if you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.210 
the glutes cannot control that so if you
can't<00:03:13.850> control<00:03:14.330> this<00:03:14.660> thigh<00:03:15.080> bone<00:03:15.380> rotating

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
can't control this thigh bone rotating

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.410 
can't control this thigh bone rotating
inwards<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:17.260> watching<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.580> come<00:03:19.580> in<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.150> kind

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
inwards and watching it come in and kind

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.720 
inwards and watching it come in and kind
of<00:03:20.540> buckle<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.140> it's<00:03:21.709> just<00:03:21.980> gonna<00:03:22.070> drag<00:03:22.489> this

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
of buckle in it's just gonna drag this

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.220 
of buckle in it's just gonna drag this
foot<00:03:23.060> with<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:23.660> selectively

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
foot with it so selectively

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.199 
foot with it so selectively
strengthening<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:24.920> foot<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.190> ankle<00:03:25.280> you

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
strengthening the foot and ankle you

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.820 
strengthening the foot and ankle you
know<00:03:26.330> with<00:03:26.750> tubing<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.290> things<00:03:27.470> like<00:03:27.680> that

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
know with tubing and things like that

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.440 
know with tubing and things like that
and<00:03:27.980> isolating<00:03:28.550> that<00:03:28.640> muscle<00:03:28.940> group<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.239> not

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
and isolating that muscle group is not

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.150 
and isolating that muscle group is not
ideal<00:03:29.600> because<00:03:30.080> your<00:03:30.230> muscles<00:03:30.560> fire<00:03:30.830> in

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
ideal because your muscles fire in

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.400 
ideal because your muscles fire in
Chains<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:32.330> have<00:03:32.450> them<00:03:32.600> back<00:03:32.720> up<00:03:32.989> just<00:03:33.230> watch

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
Chains we have them back up just watch

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.530 
Chains we have them back up just watch
that<00:03:33.709> knee<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.430> left<00:03:34.730> knee<00:03:34.910> as<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.120> comes<00:03:35.330> in

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
that knee that left knee as it comes in

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.509 
that knee that left knee as it comes in
and<00:03:35.810> just<00:03:35.989> look<00:03:36.170> at<00:03:36.320> it<00:03:36.350> buckle<00:03:36.800> inwards<00:03:37.190> and

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
and just look at it buckle inwards and

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.900 
and just look at it buckle inwards and
stay<00:03:38.180> there<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:39.110> foot<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.440> ankle<00:03:39.640> drags<00:03:40.640> with

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
stay there the foot and ankle drags with

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.340 
stay there the foot and ankle drags with
it<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:43.100> knee<00:03:43.310> goes<00:03:43.580> down<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.299> all<00:03:44.959> of

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
it the knee goes down and in all of

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.479 
it the knee goes down and in all of
these<00:03:45.530> things<00:03:45.890> are<00:03:46.130> happening<00:03:46.670> all<00:03:47.390> at<00:03:47.660> once

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
these things are happening all at once

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.070 
these things are happening all at once
so<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.519> bunch<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.180> muscle<00:03:50.480> groups<00:03:50.630> contribute

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
so a bunch of muscle groups contribute

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.660 
so a bunch of muscle groups contribute
to<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.260> overall<00:03:51.350> motion<00:03:51.890> we<00:03:52.160> are<00:03:52.280> meant<00:03:52.549> to

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
to the overall motion we are meant to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.370 
to the overall motion we are meant to
train<00:03:53.180> our<00:03:53.390> muscle<00:03:53.720> groups<00:03:53.989> in<00:03:54.489> Chains<00:03:55.489> not

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
train our muscle groups in Chains not

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.380 
train our muscle groups in Chains not
isolating<00:03:57.380> them<00:03:57.500> on<00:03:57.650> machines<00:03:58.070> or<00:03:58.489> pushing<00:03:59.239> to

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
isolating them on machines or pushing to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.030 
isolating them on machines or pushing to
being<00:03:59.630> around<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.049> that<00:04:00.110> just<00:04:00.350> shows<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.799> that

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
being around so that just shows you that

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.550 
being around so that just shows you that
everything<00:04:02.000> fires<00:04:02.209> at<00:04:02.480> once<00:04:02.690> it's<00:04:02.930> not<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.140> one

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
everything fires at once it's not a one

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.660 
everything fires at once it's not a one
one<00:04:04.160> muscle<00:04:05.030> group<00:04:05.060> kind<00:04:05.450> of<00:04:05.540> deal
