00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
about when making a Lego cube is you can

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.290 
about when making a Lego cube is you can
see<00:00:32.190> if<00:00:33.190> you're<00:00:33.430> holding<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.850> cube<00:00:34.059> like<00:00:34.239> this

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
see if you're holding the cube like this

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.630 
see if you're holding the cube like this
you<00:00:35.230> can<00:00:35.410> actually<00:00:35.559> see<00:00:35.920> that<00:00:36.100> these<00:00:36.370> are

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
I raised a couple pieces a couple sides

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.850 
I raised a couple pieces a couple sides
the<00:01:56.030> yellow<00:01:56.270> sides<00:01:56.570> raised<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.200> blue<00:01:57.410> side<00:01:57.650> is

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
the yellow sides raised the blue side is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
red side have passed clear dots on it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.669 
red side have passed clear dots on it
orange<00:02:08.000> side<00:02:08.239> has<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.780> little<00:02:08.929> grills<00:02:09.350> and

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
orange side has the little grills and

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.740 
orange side has the little grills and
the<00:02:10.310> grills<00:02:10.550> are<00:02:10.700> cool<00:02:10.880> because<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.450> makes<00:02:11.630> it

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
the grills are cool because it makes it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.240 
the grills are cool because it makes it
a<00:02:11.810> little<00:02:11.900> more<00:02:12.080> challenging<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.739> have<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.100> be

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
a little more challenging you have to be

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.420 
a little more challenging you have to be
sure<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.670> centerpiece<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.350> line<00:02:15.680> because

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
sure the centerpiece is in line because

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.390 
sure the centerpiece is in line because
it<00:02:16.580> could<00:02:16.700> be<00:02:16.730> twisted<00:02:17.090> 90<00:02:17.600> degrees<00:02:17.959> also<00:02:18.830> here

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
it could be twisted 90 degrees also here

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.920 
it could be twisted 90 degrees also here
with<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.940> arrow<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.570> have<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.750> make<00:02:20.900> sure

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
with the arrow so you have to make sure

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.890 
with the arrow so you have to make sure
the<00:02:21.200> arrow<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.830> line<00:02:22.070> as<00:02:22.370> well<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:23.630> would<00:02:23.780> be

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the arrow is in line as well it would be

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.660 
the arrow is in line as well it would be
cool<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.140> add<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> lot<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.890> arrows<00:02:25.070> then<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.519> can

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
cool to add a lot of arrows then you can

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.759 
cool to add a lot of arrows then you can
make<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.850> shepherd's<00:02:26.269> cube<00:02:26.840> which<00:02:27.440> would<00:02:27.650> be

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
make a shepherd's cube which would be

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.979 
make a shepherd's cube which would be
fun<00:02:28.010> that's<00:02:28.280> when<00:02:28.550> there's<00:02:29.030> arrows<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.630> every

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
fun that's when there's arrows on every

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.620 
fun that's when there's arrows on every
side<00:02:32.830> anyway<00:02:33.860> it's<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.730> lot<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.300> fun<00:02:35.540> to

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
side anyway it's a lot of fun to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.660 
side anyway it's a lot of fun to
customize<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.380> recommend<00:02:37.160> building<00:02:37.340> one<00:02:37.640> of

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
customize I recommend building one of

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.940 
customize I recommend building one of
these<00:02:37.820> it's<00:02:38.750> very<00:02:38.959> simple<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.709> get<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
these it's very simple you just get the

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.660 
these it's very simple you just get the
Legos<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:41.090> glue<00:02:41.360> them<00:02:41.450> onto<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.900> cube

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
Legos and you glue them onto the cube

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.720 
Legos and you glue them onto the cube
super<00:02:43.670> glue<00:02:43.959> very<00:02:44.959> easy<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.549> lot<00:02:46.700> of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
super glue very easy and it's a lot of

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.750 
super glue very easy and it's a lot of
fun<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.209> go<00:02:47.600> ahead<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.840> give<00:02:48.049> it<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.200> try<00:02:48.760> thanks

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
fun so go ahead and give it a try thanks

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.180 
fun so go ahead and give it a try thanks
for<00:02:49.880> watching
