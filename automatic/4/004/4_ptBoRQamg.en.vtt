you wear skinny waist belts with them

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
you wear skinny waist belts with them
and<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.479> noticed<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.960> sometimes<00:01:22.470> some<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and I noticed that sometimes some of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.410 
and I noticed that sometimes some of
them<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.610> too<00:01:23.850> long<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.390> just

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
them are a bit too long and they just

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
them are a bit too long and they just
kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> hang<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.340> tie<00:01:26.640> them<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
kind of hang and so you tie them in a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.670 
kind of hang and so you tie them in a
knot<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> knot<00:01:27.960> comes<00:01:28.290> undone

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
knot but then that knot comes undone

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.249 
knot but then that knot comes undone
constantly<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.270> knot<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.479> doesn't<00:01:31.200> go

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
constantly or the knot just doesn't go

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.390 
constantly or the knot just doesn't go
with<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> outfit<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.159> really

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
with the outfit like it just really

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.840 
with the outfit like it just really
bulky<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> found<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> tie<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
bulky and so I found a way to tie it to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
bulky and so I found a way to tie it to
where<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.450> bulky<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:37.020> all<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
where it's not bulky at all and that it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
where it's not bulky at all and that it
stays<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> same<00:01:38.250> time<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.390> looks

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
stays at the same time it just looks

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.210 
stays at the same time it just looks
really<00:01:39.869> nice<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> outfit<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:43.189> here<00:01:44.189> I

belt the better this knot will look in

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.360 
belt the better this knot will look in
my<00:02:54.840> own<00:02:55.019> opinion<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.709> your<00:02:55.830> bail<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.220> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
my own opinion like if your bail is a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.220 
my own opinion like if your bail is a
little<00:02:56.640> bit<00:02:56.760> thick<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.180> mine<00:02:57.450> then<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.110> will

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
little bit thick like mine then it will

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.600 
little bit thick like mine then it will
be<00:02:58.349> kind<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.620> chunky<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.099> it's<00:02:59.250> not<00:02:59.400> super

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
be kind of chunky but it's not super

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.490 
be kind of chunky but it's not super
chunky<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.390> way<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.750> stays<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.319> whole

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
