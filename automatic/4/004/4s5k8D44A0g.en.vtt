would I was going to expecting a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.680 
would I was going to expecting a
3-megapixel<00:01:46.070> job<00:01:46.670> they're<00:01:46.910> quite

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
3-megapixel job they're quite

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.960 
3-megapixel job they're quite
lightweight<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.590> little<00:01:48.830> bit<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.310> elastic

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
lightweight but a little bit of elastic

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.110 
lightweight but a little bit of elastic
plastic<00:01:50.540> e<00:01:50.990> as<00:01:51.200> well<00:01:51.610> don't<00:01:52.610> want<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.820> price

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
plastic e as well don't want the price

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.760 
plastic e as well don't want the price
point<00:01:53.360> hanging<00:01:53.570> around<00:01:53.840> for<00:01:54.080> here<00:01:54.410> is<00:01:54.590> but

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
point hanging around for here is but

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.000 
point hanging around for here is but
obviously<00:01:55.040> their<00:01:55.810> target<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.260> archos<00:01:57.710> 101

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
obviously their target is the archos 101

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.160 
obviously their target is the archos 101
right<00:01:58.610> but<00:01:58.940> if<00:01:59.090> we<00:01:59.300> think<00:01:59.510> two<00:01:59.780> three<00:02:00.050> or<00:02:00.140> four

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
right but if we think two three or four

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.170 
right but if we think two three or four
months<00:02:00.320> ahead<00:02:00.710> when<00:02:01.070> honeycombs<00:02:01.550> available

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
months ahead when honeycombs available

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.230 
months ahead when honeycombs available
this<00:02:02.300> could<00:02:02.600> be<00:02:02.990> something<00:02:03.290> that<00:02:03.470> will<00:02:04.150> look<00:02:05.150> a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
this could be something that will look a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.480

damn<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.840> guess<00:02:20.990> we<00:02:21.110> should<00:02:21.260> do<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.530> as

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
damn it so I guess we should do it as

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.650 
damn it so I guess we should do it as
well<00:02:21.620> let's<00:02:22.580> quickly<00:02:22.820> do<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.090> angry<00:02:23.300> birds

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.089 

the<00:02:44.659> color<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.049> a<00:02:45.170> little<00:02:45.230> bit<00:02:45.530> washed<00:02:45.709> out<00:02:45.920> on

the color is a little bit washed out on
this<00:02:46.569> not<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.780> best<00:02:48.110> screen<00:02:48.409> I've<00:02:48.650> seen<00:02:49.569> but

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
this not the best screen I've seen but

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.880 
this not the best screen I've seen but
really<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:51.019> have<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.290> think<00:02:51.409> about<00:02:51.590> where

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
really we have to think about where

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.140 
really we have to think about where
they're<00:02:52.010> going<00:02:52.129> to<00:02:52.189> position<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.670> there's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
they're going to position it there's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.000 
they're going to position it there's
that<00:02:53.269> back<00:02:53.510> button<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.049> top<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.620> just

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
that back button on the top so you just

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.869 
that back button on the top so you just
full<00:02:55.220> screen<00:02:55.579> apps<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:56.860> run<00:02:57.860> let's<00:02:58.610> come<00:02:58.849> out

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
there's the device on docking station so

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.570 
there's the device on docking station so
that's<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.430> few<00:03:34.610> sort<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.120> viewpad<00:03:36.370> g10<00:03:37.370> s
