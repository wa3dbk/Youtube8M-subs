00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
okay so here comes part two of our

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.249 
okay so here comes part two of our
interview<00:00:02.159> with<00:00:03.120> asus<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.659> Intel<00:00:03.929> about<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
interview with asus and Intel about the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.019 
interview with asus and Intel about the
brand<00:00:04.500> new<00:00:04.680> zenfone<00:00:05.160> 2<00:00:05.339> we<00:00:05.520> did<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:05.759> along

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
brand new zenfone 2 we did this along

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.179 
brand new zenfone 2 we did this along
side<00:00:06.629> Tom's<00:00:07.259> guide<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.770> our<00:00:07.830> friend<00:00:08.040> Mark

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
side Tom's guide and our friend Mark

side Tom's guide and our friend Mark
spoon<00:00:08.490> our<00:00:08.670> so<00:00:08.970> take<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> look<00:00:09.389> enjoy<00:00:16.190> actually

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
spoon our so take a look enjoy actually

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.189 
spoon our so take a look enjoy actually
I<00:00:17.279> believe<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:18.060> very<00:00:18.119> important<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> you

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
I believe it's very important to you

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.820 
I believe it's very important to you
know<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> also<00:00:20.630> drive<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.660> best<00:00:22.080> architecture

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
know to also drive the best architecture

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.070 
know to also drive the best architecture
for<00:00:23.010> example<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.640> no<00:00:23.789> free<00:00:24.029> lunch<00:00:24.300> so

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
for example there is no free lunch so

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.929 
for example there is no free lunch so
that's<00:00:25.380> why<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.619> know<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.070> example<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that's why you know for example the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 
that's why you know for example the
performance<00:00:27.420> monster<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:29.039> still

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
performance monster and this we still

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.669 
performance monster and this we still
need<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> lot<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.730> components<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.410> case

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
need a lot of components so in that case

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.490 
need a lot of components so in that case
I<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.059> we<00:00:33.059> would<00:00:33.239> rather<00:00:33.480> choose<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.230> kind

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
I think we would rather choose this kind

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
I think we would rather choose this kind
of<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.770> architecture<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.820> also<00:00:36.180> good

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
of you know architecture is also good

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.229 
of you know architecture is also good
for<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> grip<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.790> also<00:00:39.120> have

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
for so the grip right and you also have

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.380 
for so the grip right and you also have
enough<00:00:39.660> space<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> dual<00:00:41.969> sim

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
enough space here so I have the dual sim

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.779 
enough space here so I have the dual sim
and<00:00:42.629> also<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> performance<00:00:43.890> monster<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
and also the performance monster and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.630 
and also the performance monster and
then<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.469> metal<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.219> right

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
then actually this is metal like right

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.600 
then actually this is metal like right
but<00:00:48.120> actually<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> NC<00:00:49.050> p.m.<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> it's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
but actually this is NC p.m. so it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.240 
but actually this is NC p.m. so it's
metal<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.020> also<00:00:52.410> which<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.949> don't<00:00:53.129> make

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
metal like but also which I don't make

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.209 
metal like but also which I don't make
it<00:00:53.370> very<00:00:53.520> zen<00:00:53.989> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> lot<00:00:56.190> of

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it very zen kind of it how so a lot of

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.610 
it very zen kind of it how so a lot of
you<00:00:56.430> know<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.090> also<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> also<00:00:57.989> good<00:00:58.379> for

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you know and also this is also good for

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
you know and also this is also good for
you<00:00:58.800> know<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> electromagnetic<00:00:59.820> wave<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you know the electromagnetic wave the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.680 
you know the electromagnetic wave the
antenna<00:01:01.230> design<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> lot<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
antenna design so I think a lot of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.289 
antenna design so I think a lot of
things<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.379> uh<00:01:04.500> come<00:01:05.129> into<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.090> I

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
things you know uh come into and then I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.899 
things you know uh come into and then I
think<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> break<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.470> okay<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.760> can

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
think the break through it okay if I can

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.310 
think the break through it okay if I can
show<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
show you that you know actually the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
show you that you know actually the
internal<00:01:10.710> architecture<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:12.119> very

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
internal architecture you know it's very

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.210 
internal architecture you know it's very
interesting<00:01:15.350> we<00:01:16.350> even<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:16.979> have

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
interesting we even you know have

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.880 
interesting we even you know have
so-called<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.049> bridge<00:01:19.320> yes

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
so-called you know a kind of bridge yes

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
so-called you know a kind of bridge yes
ok<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.869> kind<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.820> flexible<00:01:23.820> pc<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.540> then

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
ok so the kind of flexible pc and then

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.940 
ok so the kind of flexible pc and then
go<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.830> from<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> know<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.439> PCB<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.680> then

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
go go from the you know the PCB and then

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.910 
go go from the you know the PCB and then
here<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.770> put<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
here and then to here and then put the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.240 
here and then to here and then put the
same<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> think<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
same here so I think up because the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.469 
same here so I think up because the
middle<00:01:35.610> part<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.340> battery<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.270> can

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
middle part so the battery then we can

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.770 
middle part so the battery then we can
go<00:01:39.630> lower<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.880> battery

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
go lower so you can have more battery

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.289 
go lower so you can have more battery
there<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> total<00:01:44.220> optimization<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
there so it's the total optimization of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
there so it's the total optimization of
the<00:01:45.450> optima<00:01:45.720> battery<00:01:46.200> life<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the optima battery life that because you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
the optima battery life that because you
can<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.579> done<00:01:47.759> some<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> our<00:01:48.420> own<00:01:48.570> tests<00:01:48.990> we

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
can be done some of our own tests we

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.249 
can be done some of our own tests we
have<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.259> an<00:01:49.680> LTE<00:01:50.189> web<00:01:50.670> surfing<00:01:50.880> test<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.509> about

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
have a an LTE web surfing test and about

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319 
have a an LTE web surfing test and about
seven<00:01:52.590> hours<00:01:52.680> or<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.579> about<00:01:54.060> an<00:01:54.210> hour

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
seven hours or so which is about an hour

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
seven hours or so which is about an hour
less<00:01:54.689> than<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> average<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.829> are<00:01:55.860> some

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
less than the average there are some

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.219 
less than the average there are some
that<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.549> same<00:01:56.969> range<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.869> did<00:01:58.049> talk

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
that are in that same range we did talk

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.539 
that are in that same range we did talk
about<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.590> quick<00:01:58.770> charging<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.399> how

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
about the quick charging and how

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
about the quick charging and how
important<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.810> back<00:02:01.049> up<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> full

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
important it is to get back up to a full

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.219 
important it is to get back up to a full
charge<00:02:02.180> but<00:02:03.180> how<00:02:03.299> much<00:02:03.360> attention<00:02:03.869> was<00:02:04.110> paid

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
charge but how much attention was paid

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.830 
charge but how much attention was paid
to<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.040> efficiency<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.909> how<00:02:06.299> much<00:02:06.420> work<00:02:06.659> does

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
to the efficiency and how much work does

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.609 
to the efficiency and how much work does
until<00:02:07.500> still<00:02:07.710> need<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.599> ok<00:02:09.599> i<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:09.899> what

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
until still need to do ok i think what

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.140 
until still need to do ok i think what
i'm<00:02:10.739> against<00:02:11.160> close

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
i'm against close

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.530 
i'm against close
altogether<00:02:14.099> okay<00:02:15.099> I<00:02:15.129> think<00:02:15.549> we<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.209> found

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
altogether okay I think we have found

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.410 
altogether okay I think we have found
that<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.049> know<00:02:17.200> very<00:02:17.769> carefully<00:02:18.459> frankly

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
that you know very carefully frankly

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.770 
that you know very carefully frankly
speaking<00:02:19.540> uh<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.489> performance<00:02:22.360> we<00:02:22.540> get

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
speaking uh the the performance we get

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.649 
speaking uh the the performance we get
okay<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.319> think<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.890> still<00:02:24.250> be<00:02:24.849> young<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.510> know

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
okay I think I still be young you know

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.369 
okay I think I still be young you know
the<00:02:25.959> power<00:02:26.230> consumption<00:02:26.650> increase<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:28.180> uh<00:02:28.450> for

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
the power consumption increase so uh for

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.800 
the power consumption increase so uh for
what<00:02:29.489> performance<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.700> think<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.269> still<00:02:31.510> see

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
what performance I think we still see

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.360 
what performance I think we still see
you<00:02:31.930> know<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.079> very<00:02:32.379> good<00:02:32.500> advantage<00:02:32.950> there

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
you know a very good advantage there

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.300 
you know a very good advantage there
right<00:02:33.760> okay<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:34.689> think<00:02:35.049> you<00:02:35.769> are<00:02:35.890> right<00:02:36.099> you

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
right okay but I think you are right you

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.809 
right okay but I think you are right you
know<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.670> then<00:02:37.030> how<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.599> we<00:02:38.079> try<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.819> improve

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
know and then how can we try to improve

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.460 
know and then how can we try to improve

movers<00:02:50.560> add<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:51.069> kind<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.400> things<00:02:51.609> is<00:02:51.760> also<00:02:52.060> very

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
movers add a kind of things is also very

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.819 
movers add a kind of things is also very
important<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.109> also<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.530> fast<00:02:53.739> charging

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
important and also the fast charging

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.180 
important and also the fast charging
both<00:02:54.639> of<00:02:54.819> them<00:02:55.120> power<00:02:55.359> okay<00:02:56.349> everything<00:02:57.040> we

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
both of them power okay everything we

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.580 
both of them power okay everything we
try<00:02:57.430> very<00:02:57.459> hard<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.970> get<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.720> cover<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.170> yes

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
try very hard to get to cover that yes

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.039 
try very hard to get to cover that yes
and<00:03:00.280> it's<00:03:00.730> about<00:03:00.819> performance<00:03:01.329> for<00:03:01.569> what<00:03:01.720> and

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
and it's about performance for what and

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.589 
and it's about performance for what and
then<00:03:02.290> system-level<00:03:02.799> optimization<00:03:03.639> I<00:03:04.209> mean

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
then system-level optimization I mean

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.119 
then system-level optimization I mean
physics<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.049> physics<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.530> physics<00:03:05.680> if<00:03:06.040> you

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
physics is physics is physics if you

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.470 
physics is physics is physics if you
want<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.370> do<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.579> much<00:03:06.790> processing<00:03:07.299> you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
want to do that much processing you

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.410 
want to do that much processing you
gotta<00:03:07.659> cross<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.109> performance<00:03:08.620> go<00:03:08.799> up<00:03:08.950> area

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
gotta cross that performance go up area

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.050 
gotta cross that performance go up area
and<00:03:10.420> look<00:03:11.379> one<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.799> great<00:03:12.700> things<00:03:12.730> about

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
and look one of the great things about

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.640 
and look one of the great things about
this<00:03:13.329> collaboration<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.439> then

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
this collaboration it's that was then

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.589 
this collaboration it's that was then
sit<00:03:14.920> down<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.310> say<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:16.120> know<00:03:16.239> okay<00:03:16.480> we're

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
sit down and say you know okay we're

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.180 
sit down and say you know okay we're
getting<00:03:16.689> that<00:03:16.959> emiem<00:03:17.349> for<00:03:17.530> performance<00:03:18.040> but

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
getting that emiem for performance but

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.099 
getting that emiem for performance but
what<00:03:18.370> do<00:03:18.489> we<00:03:18.609> do<00:03:18.730> at<00:03:18.879> the<00:03:19.000> system<00:03:19.150> level<00:03:19.359> to

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
what do we do at the system level to

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.099 
what do we do at the system level to
optimize<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.980> very<00:03:21.549> important<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.930> have

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
optimize and very important and I have

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.449 
optimize and very important and I have
some<00:03:23.319> things<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:23.590> probably<00:03:23.769> need<00:03:24.129> to<00:03:24.160> do<00:03:24.340> at

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
some things we probably need to do at

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.400 
some things we probably need to do at
the<00:03:24.579> radio<00:03:24.940> layer<00:03:25.239> also<00:03:25.660> because<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.139> lot<00:03:26.379> of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
the radio layer also because a lot of

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.589 
the radio layer also because a lot of
the<00:03:26.530> battery<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.280> drained<00:03:27.549> by<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.760> radio<00:03:28.209> we

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
the battery is drained by the radio we

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.839 
the battery is drained by the radio we
always<00:03:28.750> talk<00:03:28.959> about<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.260> processor<00:03:29.769> but<00:03:30.699> when

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
always talk about the processor but when

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.270 
always talk about the processor but when
the<00:03:30.970> ridges<00:03:31.239> out<00:03:31.480> there<00:03:31.690> trying<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.199> send<00:03:33.159> a

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
the ridges out there trying to send a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.990 
the ridges out there trying to send a
lot<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.549> like<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.480> big<00:03:34.750> file<00:03:35.199> and<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:36.400> low<00:03:36.609> signal

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
lot of like a big file and in low signal

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.689 
lot of like a big file and in low signal
condition<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:38.680> doesn't<00:03:38.980> stop<00:03:39.129> it<00:03:39.400> just<00:03:39.519> keeps

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
condition it doesn't stop it just keeps

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.180 
condition it doesn't stop it just keeps
on<00:03:39.819> going<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.299> that's<00:03:40.449> an<00:03:40.739> example<00:03:41.739> of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
on going so that's an example of

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.559 
on going so that's an example of
something<00:03:42.400> we<00:03:42.609> can<00:03:42.760> do<00:03:42.849> it<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.090> system<00:03:43.449> now

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
something we can do it the system now

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.039 
something we can do it the system now
that<00:03:44.260> will<00:03:44.409> be<00:03:44.590> saving<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.389> measurable<00:03:46.930> way

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
that will be saving in a measurable way

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.530 
that will be saving in a measurable way
battery<00:03:47.440> life<00:03:47.590> every<00:03:48.159> occasion<00:03:48.790> cops<00:03:49.090> yes

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
battery life every occasion cops yes

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.509 
battery life every occasion cops yes
yeah<00:03:49.810> about<00:03:50.229> the<00:03:50.470> power<00:03:50.709> consumption<00:03:51.220> in

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
yeah about the power consumption in

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.710 
yeah about the power consumption in
right

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.780 

you
