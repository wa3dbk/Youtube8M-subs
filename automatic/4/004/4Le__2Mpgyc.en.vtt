00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.490 

yes<00:00:23.330> I<00:00:23.480> first<00:00:23.750> started<00:00:24.080> thinking<00:00:24.290> about

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
yes I first started thinking about

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.980 
yes I first started thinking about
architecture<00:00:25.100> through<00:00:25.690> travelling<00:00:26.690> with<00:00:26.810> my

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
architecture through travelling with my

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.200 
architecture through travelling with my
parents<00:00:27.440> the<00:00:27.590> connection<00:00:28.100> between<00:00:28.210> buildings

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
parents the connection between buildings

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.700 
parents the connection between buildings
and<00:00:29.420> then<00:00:29.630> escaped<00:00:29.960> or<00:00:30.080> something<00:00:30.439> that<00:00:30.590> was

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
and then escaped or something that was

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.679 
and then escaped or something that was
kind<00:00:31.010> of<00:00:31.070> embedded<00:00:31.400> in<00:00:31.550> me<00:00:31.730> from<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.360> young<00:00:32.419> age

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
kind of embedded in me from a young age

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.990 
kind of embedded in me from a young age
but<00:00:33.230> I<00:00:33.260> really<00:00:33.559> loved<00:00:33.739> physics<00:00:33.950> I<00:00:34.370> really<00:00:34.880> love

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
but I really loved physics I really love

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.380 
but I really loved physics I really love
art<00:00:35.300> architects<00:00:36.020> work<00:00:36.590> between<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.880> everyday

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
art architects work between the everyday

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.710 
art architects work between the everyday
and<00:00:39.370> amazing<00:00:40.370> I<00:00:40.550> really<00:00:41.210> wanted<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.540> do

and amazing I really wanted to do

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.619 
and amazing I really wanted to do
architecture<00:00:42.699> so<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.820> open<00:00:44.120> day<00:00:44.239> I<00:00:44.270> found<00:00:44.510> it

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
architecture so the open day I found it

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.479 
architecture so the open day I found it
very<00:00:44.780> useful<00:00:44.900> because<00:00:45.800> at<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:45.980> open<00:00:46.250> day<00:00:46.370> they

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
very useful because at the open day they

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.430 
very useful because at the open day they
show<00:00:46.699> different<00:00:47.390> levels<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.110> different

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
show different levels and the different
