the closer features on this stick first
starting<00:00:31.090> with<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.300> shaft<00:00:31.540> dimensions<00:00:32.110> to<00:00:32.320> it

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
starting with the shaft dimensions to it

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.020 
starting with the shaft dimensions to it
and<00:00:32.680> they<00:00:32.950> really<00:00:33.160> done<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.309> nice<00:00:33.520> job<00:00:33.579> at

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
aspect of the stick as I said this is

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.270 
aspect of the stick as I said this is
the<00:00:46.870> non<00:00:47.109> grip<00:00:47.379> version<00:00:47.769> so<00:00:47.890> it's<00:00:48.010> gonna<00:00:48.100> have

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
the non grip version so it's gonna have

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.489 
the non grip version so it's gonna have
a<00:00:48.309> smooth<00:00:48.609> coating<00:00:48.940> that<00:00:49.629> nipple<00:00:49.899> grip<00:00:50.199> does

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
a smooth coating that nipple grip does

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.319 
a smooth coating that nipple grip does
have<00:00:50.769> off<00:00:51.070> of<00:00:51.249> that<00:00:51.339> additional<00:00:51.789> grip<00:00:52.149> and

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329

have off of that additional grip and
without<00:00:52.570> being<00:00:52.749> too<00:00:52.989> tacky<00:00:53.499> of<00:00:53.589> a<00:00:53.649> feeling

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
without being too tacky of a feeling

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.340 
without being too tacky of a feeling
this<00:00:54.879> stick<00:00:55.089> is<00:00:55.210> going<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.420> be<00:00:55.629> have<00:00:55.809> there<00:00:56.320> a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
this stick is going to be have there a

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.459 
this stick is going to be have there a
carbon<00:00:56.920> elite<00:00:57.420> material<00:00:58.420> used<00:00:58.659> on<00:00:58.809> it<00:00:58.989> in<00:00:59.079> the

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
carbon elite material used on it in the

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:00.660 
carbon elite material used on it in the
construction<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.159> that's<00:01:00.339> going<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.550> be<00:01:00.640> a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
construction so that's going to be a

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.259 
construction so that's going to be a
higher<00:01:00.940> grade<00:01:01.530> aircraft<00:01:02.850> carbon<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:04.180> that's

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
higher grade aircraft carbon so that's

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.240 
higher grade aircraft carbon so that's
gonna<00:01:04.449> offer<00:01:04.659> some<00:01:04.989> great<00:01:05.199> lightweight<00:01:06.010> feel

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
gonna offer some great lightweight feel

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.880 
gonna offer some great lightweight feel
Sol's<00:01:06.640> exceptional<00:01:07.450> power<00:01:07.659> on<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.530> then

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
Sol's exceptional power on it and then

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.560 
Sol's exceptional power on it and then
as<00:01:09.070> we<00:01:09.220> move<00:01:09.399> down<00:01:09.579> on<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.850> stick<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.329> they're

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
as we move down on the stick and they're

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.760 
as we move down on the stick and they're
actually<00:01:10.750> using<00:01:11.079> what<00:01:11.290> they're<00:01:11.409> calling<00:01:11.619> a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
actually using what they're calling a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.620 
actually using what they're calling a
linear<00:01:12.130> taper<00:01:12.399> on<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.880> so<00:01:13.240> that's<00:01:13.299> gonna<00:01:13.450> be<00:01:13.600> a

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
linear taper on it so that's gonna be a

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.969 
linear taper on it so that's gonna be a
little<00:01:13.810> bit<00:01:13.990> different<00:01:14.380> design<00:01:14.530> than<00:01:14.890> what

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
little bit different design than what

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:15.870 
little bit different design than what
you've<00:01:15.159> seen<00:01:15.280> on<00:01:15.430> some<00:01:15.579> of<00:01:15.670> their<00:01:15.759> other

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
you've seen on some of their other

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.940 
you've seen on some of their other
sticks<00:01:16.299> basically<00:01:17.229> what<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.439> does<00:01:17.470> is<00:01:17.680> instead

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
sticks basically what it does is instead

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.560 
sticks basically what it does is instead
of<00:01:18.009> concentrating<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.729> flex<00:01:18.970> point<00:01:19.180> right<00:01:19.390> to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
of concentrating the flex point right to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.600 
of concentrating the flex point right to
the<00:01:19.659> middle<00:01:20.079> or<00:01:20.229> right<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.740> lower<00:01:21.250> point

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
the middle or right to the lower point

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.880 
the middle or right to the lower point
of<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.850> stick<00:01:22.090> having<00:01:22.719> a<00:01:22.810> low<00:01:22.960> kick<00:01:23.170> point<00:01:23.680> or

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
of the stick having a low kick point or

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.380 
of the stick having a low kick point or
having<00:01:24.219> a<00:01:24.310> mid<00:01:24.520> kick<00:01:24.670> point<00:01:24.939> they<00:01:25.329> do

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
having a mid kick point they do

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.880 
having a mid kick point they do
something<00:01:25.960> kinda<00:01:26.259> in<00:01:26.350> between<00:01:26.380> with<00:01:26.740> this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
something kinda in between with this

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.249 
something kinda in between with this
linear<00:01:27.219> taper<00:01:27.540> basically<00:01:28.540> what<00:01:28.659> this<00:01:28.840> does<00:01:29.079> is

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
linear taper basically what this does is

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.620 
linear taper basically what this does is
it<00:01:29.740> lengthens<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.460> overall<00:01:30.790> flex<00:01:31.119> profile

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
it lengthens the overall flex profile

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.179 
it lengthens the overall flex profile
the<00:01:31.840> stick<00:01:32.079> so<00:01:32.500> you're<00:01:32.619> gonna<00:01:32.710> have<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:32.950> more

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
the stick so you're gonna have a more

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.279 
the stick so you're gonna have a more
consistent<00:01:33.759> flex<00:01:34.329> throughout<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.840> stick<00:01:35.079> and

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
consistent flex throughout the stick and

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.170 
consistent flex throughout the stick and
that's<00:01:35.560> really<00:01:36.039> gonna<00:01:36.189> allow<00:01:36.430> you<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.729> load<00:01:36.969> up

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
that's really gonna allow you to load up

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.450 
that's really gonna allow you to load up
more<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.630> those<00:01:38.020> one<00:01:38.350> timers<00:01:38.829> as<00:01:38.979> well<00:01:39.219> as<00:01:39.310> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
more on those one timers as well as the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.340 
more on those one timers as well as the
slap<00:01:39.729> shots<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:40.780> that's<00:01:40.899> going<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.079> give<00:01:41.229> you<00:01:41.289> a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
slap shots so that's going to give you a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.840 
slap shots so that's going to give you a
little<00:01:41.590> more<00:01:41.649> power<00:01:41.890> it's<00:01:42.460> not<00:01:42.579> gonna<00:01:42.729> be

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
little more power it's not gonna be

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.179 
little more power it's not gonna be
quite<00:01:43.060> as<00:01:43.210> snappy<00:01:43.750> as<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.869> feel<00:01:44.170> but<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:44.979> will

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
quite as snappy as a feel but you will

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.149 
quite as snappy as a feel but you will
get<00:01:45.369> with<00:01:45.520> some<00:01:45.670> extra<00:01:46.090> power<00:01:46.270> on<00:01:46.479> your<00:01:46.630> shots

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
get with some extra power on your shots

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.260 
get with some extra power on your shots
okay<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:48.250> taking<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.640> closer<00:01:48.820> look<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.180> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
okay so taking a closer look to the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.639 
okay so taking a closer look to the
blade<00:01:49.539> on<00:01:49.719> this<00:01:49.810> stick<00:01:50.049> this<00:01:50.079> is<00:01:50.289> gonna<00:01:50.380> be<00:01:50.500> one

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
blade on this stick this is gonna be one

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:51.420 
blade on this stick this is gonna be one
of<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.829> things<00:01:50.979> that's<00:01:51.130> going<00:01:51.369> to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
of the things that's going to

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.399 
of the things that's going to
differentiate<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.329> between<00:01:52.719> last<00:01:53.079> year's

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
differentiate this between last year's

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.349 
differentiate this between last year's
dolomites<00:01:53.859> spine<00:01:54.189> is<00:01:54.369> they've<00:01:54.880> actually<00:01:55.060> gone

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
dolomites spine is they've actually gone

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.240 
dolomites spine is they've actually gone
ahead<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:55.630> used<00:01:55.810> their<00:01:56.109> double<00:01:56.469> D<00:01:56.619> technology

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
ahead and used their double D technology

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.580 
ahead and used their double D technology
on<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.549> what<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.299> double<00:01:58.539> D<00:01:58.689> technology<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.380> is

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
on it what the double D technology is is

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.580 
on it what the double D technology is is
its<00:02:00.070> dual<00:02:00.310> density<00:02:00.549> foams<00:02:01.060> inside<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.929> blade

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
its dual density foams inside the blade

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.770 
its dual density foams inside the blade
so<00:02:03.100> basically<00:02:03.460> on<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.640> toe<00:02:03.850> portion<00:02:04.359> you<00:02:04.750> have

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
so basically on the toe portion you have

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.380 
so basically on the toe portion you have
some<00:02:05.049> softer<00:02:05.590> foams<00:02:05.859> that<00:02:06.520> aren't<00:02:06.820> quite<00:02:07.030> as

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
some softer foams that aren't quite as

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.419 
some softer foams that aren't quite as
dense<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:08.080> then<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.679> heel<00:02:08.890> portion<00:02:09.100> back

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
dense and then in the heel portion back

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.740 
dense and then in the heel portion back
here<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.729> have<00:02:09.789> some<00:02:09.970> really<00:02:10.149> dense<00:02:10.420> foams

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
here you have some really dense foams

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.030 
here you have some really dense foams
that's<00:02:10.990> going<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.200> give<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> more<00:02:11.560> solid

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
that's going to give you a more solid

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.410 
that's going to give you a more solid
feel<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.700> that's<00:02:13.120> going<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.300> do<00:02:13.390> a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
feel to it and that's going to do a

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.420 
feel to it and that's going to do a
couple<00:02:13.840> different<00:02:13.870> things<00:02:14.170> one<00:02:15.100> thing<00:02:15.250> what

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
couple different things one thing what

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.590 
couple different things one thing what
its<00:02:15.520> gonna<00:02:15.580> do<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.940> you're<00:02:16.090> gonna<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.420> those

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
its gonna do is you're gonna have those

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.059 
its gonna do is you're gonna have those
higher<00:02:16.870> density<00:02:17.260> foams<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.650> heel

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
higher density foams in the heel

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.849 
higher density foams in the heel
for<00:02:18.609> more<00:02:19.060> durability<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.870> then<00:02:20.349> also<00:02:20.560> by

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
for more durability and then also by

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.170 
for more durability and then also by
having<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.189> softer<00:02:21.579> foams<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:21.909> front

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
having the softer foams in the front

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.399 
having the softer foams in the front
that's<00:02:22.359> gonna<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.599> more<00:02:22.780> for<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.139> overall

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
that's gonna be more for the overall

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.989 
that's gonna be more for the overall
feel<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.859> stick<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.189> in<00:02:24.280> your<00:02:24.400> pocket<00:02:24.760> so

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:24.999 
feel the stick and in your pocket so

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.000 
feel the stick and in your pocket so
it's<00:02:25.120> gonna<00:02:25.209> have<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.389> softer<00:02:25.870> feel<00:02:26.079> another

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
it's gonna have a softer feel another

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's gonna have a softer feel another
thing<00:02:27.189> that's<00:02:27.249> gonna<00:02:27.489> do<00:02:27.609> by<00:02:27.790> concentrating

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
thing that's gonna do by concentrating

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.330 
thing that's gonna do by concentrating
some<00:02:28.599> denser<00:02:28.959> materials<00:02:29.349> here<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:30.249> gonna

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
some denser materials here it's gonna

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.709 
some denser materials here it's gonna
make<00:02:30.579> this<00:02:30.790> portion<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.359> stick<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.599> little

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:31.719 
make this portion of the stick a little

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.479 
make this portion of the stick a little
bit<00:02:31.989> lighter<00:02:32.319> um<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.010> when<00:02:33.159> you're<00:02:33.280> coming

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
bit lighter um so when you're coming

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.160 
bit lighter um so when you're coming
through<00:02:33.609> and<00:02:33.939> your<00:02:34.030> shots<00:02:34.299> um<00:02:34.719> it's<00:02:35.049> actually

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
through and your shots um it's actually

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.660 
through and your shots um it's actually
gonna<00:02:35.409> have<00:02:35.590> less<00:02:35.769> of<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.010> swing<00:02:36.310> weight<00:02:36.519> and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
gonna have less of a swing weight and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.099 
gonna have less of a swing weight and
stay<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.849> little<00:02:36.969> more<00:02:37.120> true<00:02:37.480> throughout<00:02:37.840> your

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
stay a little more true throughout your

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.500 
stay a little more true throughout your
slap<00:02:38.439> shots<00:02:38.739> or<00:02:38.950> wrist<00:02:39.129> shot<00:02:39.250> snap<00:02:39.609> shots<00:02:39.849> um

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
slap shots or wrist shot snap shots um

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.729 
slap shots or wrist shot snap shots um
so<00:02:40.719> that's<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.900> nice<00:02:41.049> feature<00:02:41.079> that<00:02:41.530> they've

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
so that's a nice feature that they've

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.110 
so that's a nice feature that they've
gone<00:02:41.859> ahead<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.129> added<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> stick<00:02:42.969> as

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
gone ahead and added on to the stick as

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.819 
gone ahead and added on to the stick as
well<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.359> a<00:02:43.420> couple<00:02:43.719> others<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.620> water

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
well as a couple others in the water

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.830 
well as a couple others in the water
line<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.219> then<00:02:45.639> also<00:02:45.909> what's<00:02:46.419> setting<00:02:46.599> this

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
line and then also what's setting this

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.899 
line and then also what's setting this
guy<00:02:47.019> apart<00:02:47.349> from<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.099> other<00:02:48.249> Dolomites<00:02:48.700> is

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
guy apart from the other Dolomites is

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.330 
guy apart from the other Dolomites is
going<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.299> be<00:02:49.389> the<00:02:49.510> stein<00:02:49.900> technology<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:51.189> can

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
going to be the stein technology you can

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.800 
going to be the stein technology you can
see<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.639> here<00:02:51.909> they<00:02:52.060> kind<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.299> highlight<00:02:52.689> it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
see it here they kind of highlight it

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.920 
see it here they kind of highlight it
with<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.200> metallic<00:02:54.159> graphics<00:02:55.090> on<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.419> but

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
with the metallic graphics on it but

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.360 
with the metallic graphics on it but
what<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.199> spine<00:02:56.409> technology<00:02:56.949> is<00:02:57.040> going<00:02:57.129> to<00:02:57.189> do

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
what the spine technology is going to do

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.800 
what the spine technology is going to do
is<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.639> going<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.849> add<00:02:58.000> rigidity<00:02:58.569> through

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
is it's going to add rigidity through

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.149 
is it's going to add rigidity through
the<00:02:58.870> blade<00:02:59.079> so<00:02:59.560> you're<00:02:59.650> gonna<00:02:59.739> really<00:02:59.919> have

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
the blade so you're gonna really have

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.890 
the blade so you're gonna really have
that<00:03:00.340> stiffness<00:03:00.760> within<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.389> toe<00:03:01.599> all<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
that stiffness within the toe all the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.050 
that stiffness within the toe all the
way<00:03:02.079> back<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.500> heel<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.519> it's<00:03:03.639> gonna<00:03:03.760> help

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
way back to the heel so it's gonna help

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.179 
way back to the heel so it's gonna help
you<00:03:04.180> out<00:03:04.209> with<00:03:04.510> your<00:03:04.569> paw<00:03:04.870> handling<00:03:05.349> I'm

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
you out with your paw handling I'm

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.289 
you out with your paw handling I'm
because<00:03:06.400> if<00:03:06.489> it's<00:03:06.609> gonna<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:06.909> a<00:03:06.939> nice<00:03:07.120> gun

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
because if it's gonna have a nice gun

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.509 
because if it's gonna have a nice gun
consistent<00:03:08.290> feel<00:03:08.469> throughout<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:09.040> blade<00:03:09.310> and

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
consistent feel throughout the blade and

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.670 
consistent feel throughout the blade and
also<00:03:10.389> another<00:03:10.780> nice<00:03:10.989> thing<00:03:11.049> about<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.409> is

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
also another nice thing about that is

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.929 
also another nice thing about that is
being<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:12.129> keeping<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.639> firm

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
being that it's keeping it firm

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.569 
being that it's keeping it firm
throughout<00:03:13.569> is<00:03:13.959> it's<00:03:14.439> gonna<00:03:14.560> be<00:03:14.620> great<00:03:15.189> for

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
throughout is it's gonna be great for

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.280 
throughout is it's gonna be great for
your<00:03:15.699> shot<00:03:16.329> accuracy<00:03:16.689> it's<00:03:17.019> really<00:03:17.199> gonna

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
your shot accuracy it's really gonna

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.050 
your shot accuracy it's really gonna
keep<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.709> puck<00:03:17.919> staying<00:03:18.189> true<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.699> blade

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
keep the puck staying true on the blade

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.580 
keep the puck staying true on the blade
and<00:03:19.299> really<00:03:19.870> give<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.079> that<00:03:20.109> pinpoint

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
and really give you that pinpoint

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.619 
and really give you that pinpoint
accuracy<00:03:20.889> um<00:03:21.609> so<00:03:21.819> as<00:03:21.939> we<00:03:22.060> go<00:03:22.150> ahead<00:03:22.389> and<00:03:22.540> move

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
accuracy um so as we go ahead and move

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.059 
accuracy um so as we go ahead and move
on<00:03:22.810> out<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.169> take<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.349> look<00:03:23.620> at<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> overall

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
on out to take a look at the overall

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.860 
on out to take a look at the overall
features<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.790> stick<00:03:25.060> or<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.239> overall<00:03:25.540> feel

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
features and stick or the overall feel

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.170 
features and stick or the overall feel
of<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.139> it<00:03:26.680> has<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.829> great<00:03:27.159> lightweight<00:03:27.489> feel<00:03:27.970> to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
of it it has a great lightweight feel to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.300 
of it it has a great lightweight feel to
it<00:03:28.269> it's<00:03:28.930> not<00:03:29.169> their<00:03:29.409> lightest<00:03:29.799> stick<00:03:30.009> but<00:03:30.220> it

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
it it's not their lightest stick but it

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.710 
it it's not their lightest stick but it
definitely<00:03:30.669> has<00:03:30.759> a<00:03:30.819> lightweight<00:03:31.000> feel<00:03:31.419> it

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
definitely has a lightweight feel it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.479 
definitely has a lightweight feel it
feels<00:03:32.079> very<00:03:32.259> balanced<00:03:32.919> and<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.129> uses<00:03:33.340> that

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
feels very balanced and it uses that

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.939 
feels very balanced and it uses that
high<00:03:33.819> grade<00:03:34.169> carbonyl<00:03:35.169> on<00:03:35.229> it<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:35.769> you're

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
high grade carbonyl on it so you're

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.530 
high grade carbonyl on it so you're
gonna<00:03:36.040> get<00:03:36.189> that<00:03:36.250> power<00:03:36.609> as<00:03:37.030> well<00:03:37.299> as<00:03:37.329> the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
gonna get that power as well as the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.119 
gonna get that power as well as the
weight<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:37.989> you'd<00:03:38.139> expect<00:03:38.560> from<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.799> high<00:03:38.949> end

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
weight that you'd expect from a high end

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.899 
weight that you'd expect from a high end
stick<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.519> this

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
stick like this

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.640 
stick like this
um<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:40.509> once<00:03:40.689> again<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:41.019> has<00:03:41.079> been<00:03:41.349> just<00:03:41.560> a

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
um so once again this has been just a

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.710 
um so once again this has been just a
quick<00:03:41.919> look<00:03:42.220> at<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.819> warrior<00:03:43.060> Dolomites

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
quick look at the warrior Dolomites
