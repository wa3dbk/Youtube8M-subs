00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
and um yes i did get two cards out of it

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.460 
and um yes i did get two cards out of it
plus<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.250> 75<00:04:02.609> k<00:04:02.819> profit<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.450> little<00:04:04.319> bit<00:04:04.410> more

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
plus the 75 k profit a little bit more

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.680 
plus the 75 k profit a little bit more
than<00:04:04.650> 75<00:04:05.010> k<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.430> i<00:04:05.849> think<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.209> all<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.480> cards

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
than 75 k and i think that all the cards

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.599 
than 75 k and i think that all the cards
you<00:04:06.780> can<00:04:06.840> drop<00:04:07.109> in<00:04:07.290> value<00:04:07.410> unless<00:04:08.310> they<00:04:08.519> make

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
you can drop in value unless they make

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.339 
you can drop in value unless they make
some<00:04:08.790> crazy<00:04:09.180> collection<00:04:09.419> with<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> rewards

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
some crazy collection with the rewards

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.020 
some crazy collection with the rewards
or<00:04:10.560> some<00:04:10.769> like<00:04:10.950> special<00:04:11.250> cards<00:04:11.729> like<00:04:11.850> they
