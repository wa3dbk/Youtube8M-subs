Walters car shop I will say that this
this<00:00:14.070> model<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> little<00:00:14.910> tedious<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.480> little

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
this model was a little tedious a little

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.309 
this model was a little tedious a little
bit<00:00:15.750> more<00:00:15.900> tedious<00:00:16.259> than<00:00:16.379> I'd<00:00:16.619> expected<00:00:18.319> looks

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:19.319 
bit more tedious than I'd expected looks

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:24.109 
bit more tedious than I'd expected looks
nice<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:21.349> will<00:00:22.349> say<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.119> instruction

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
nice I will say that the instruction

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.109 
nice I will say that the instruction
sheet<00:00:24.319> leaves<00:00:25.319> a<00:00:25.529> little<00:00:25.710> bit<00:00:25.979> to<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.279> desired

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.150 

overall<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.149> good<00:00:30.329> model<00:00:30.569> I<00:00:31.229> was<00:00:31.710> worried<00:00:32.099> about

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
overall a good model I was worried about

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.110 
overall a good model I was worried about
it<00:00:32.460> fitting<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.879> the<00:00:33.000> base<00:00:33.739> because<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:35.120> you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
it fitting on the base because of you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.639 
it fitting on the base because of you
know<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> put<00:00:36.570> into<00:00:36.750> four<00:00:36.960> walls<00:00:37.199> together

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
know you put into four walls together

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.450 
know you put into four walls together
but<00:00:38.039> everything<00:00:38.399> turned<00:00:38.609> out<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:40.460> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
but everything turned out good the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.579 
but everything turned out good the
windows<00:00:41.940> did<00:00:42.269> not<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.379> notches

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
windows did not have the little notches

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.950 
windows did not have the little notches
that<00:00:43.829> I'd<00:00:44.070> first<00:00:44.429> thought<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.749> are

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that I'd first thought but they are

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.540 
that I'd first thought but they are
oversized<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.249> it<00:00:47.940> wasn't<00:00:48.239> too<00:00:48.359> much<00:00:48.570> problem

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
oversized and it wasn't too much problem

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.099 
oversized and it wasn't too much problem
just<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.300> cutting<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.659> of<00:00:51.809> glass<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
just a lot of cutting out of glass and

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.540 
just a lot of cutting out of glass and
stuff<00:00:53.089> but<00:00:54.089> if<00:00:54.269> you<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.260> mmm<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.370> see

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
stuff but if you see this mmm you see

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.450 
stuff but if you see this mmm you see
cus<00:00:56.699> some<00:00:56.850> streaks<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.690> glass<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.069> stuff

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
cus some streaks on the glass and stuff

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.059 
cus some streaks on the glass and stuff
I<00:00:59.609> don't<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.909> if<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.079> cameras<00:01:01.499> gonna<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
I don't know if the cameras gonna get it

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.880 
I don't know if the cameras gonna get it
or<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.339> but<00:01:03.140> that's<00:01:04.140> easy<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.559> take<00:01:04.710> off<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
or not but that's easy to take off and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.620 
or not but that's easy to take off and
just<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> q-tip<00:01:05.579> with<00:01:05.820> some<00:01:05.970> alcohol<00:01:06.149> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
just like a q-tip with some alcohol and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.740 
just like a q-tip with some alcohol and
those<00:01:06.689> streaks<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.259> go<00:01:07.530> away<00:01:08.360> this<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.540> be

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
those streaks all go away this will be

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
those streaks all go away this will be
lighted<00:01:10.229> eventually<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.149> inside<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.380 

I'm<00:01:15.780> happy<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.820> for<00:01:17.820> those<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
know not most of you uses the easy track

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.660 
know not most of you uses the easy track
but<00:01:21.080> since<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.320> my<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.830> one<00:01:22.980> here<00:01:23.370> with

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.880 
me I decided to use the Botwin easy
track<00:01:26.840> for<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:27.930> layout<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.620> was<00:01:28.770> just

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
track for my layout and I was just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
track for my layout and I was just
curious<00:01:29.160> to<00:01:29.370> see<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:30.180> wanted<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.690> show<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.900> guys

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
this for those who do have it I'm

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.430 
this for those who do have it I'm
thinking<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.330> it<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:35.660> does<00:01:36.660> not<00:01:36.900> line<00:01:37.410> up

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
thinking about it this does not line up

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.220 
thinking about it this does not line up
with<00:01:38.120> that<00:01:39.120> it's<00:01:39.480> about<00:01:39.660> a<00:01:39.720> quarter<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.140> an

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
with that it's about a quarter of an

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.130 
with that it's about a quarter of an
inch<00:01:40.290> too<00:01:40.680> high<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:42.300> in<00:01:42.510> my<00:01:42.600> layout<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:42.990> going

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
inch too high so in my layout I'm going

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.310 
inch too high so in my layout I'm going
to<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.620> get<00:01:44.160> some<00:01:44.340> flex<00:01:44.640> track<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:46.140> do

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
to have to get some flex track and do

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.580 
to have to get some flex track and do
like<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> slow<00:01:46.950> downward<00:01:47.840> slope<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.440> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
like a slow downward slope to get it in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.350 
like a slow downward slope to get it in
but<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.730> into<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.210> because

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
but it's not going into here because

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.090 
but it's not going into here because
like<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:52.050> here<00:01:52.260> where<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.440> building<00:01:52.740> sits

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
like right here where this building sits

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.620 
like right here where this building sits
that's<00:01:53.310> where<00:01:53.400> my<00:01:53.520> transport<00:01:54.030> table<00:01:54.330> is<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that's where my transport table is and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.900 
that's where my transport table is and
I've<00:01:54.720> only<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.220> one<00:01:56.220> line<00:01:56.430> coming<00:01:56.700> into

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
I've only got one one line coming into

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.550 
I've only got one one line coming into
the<00:01:57.000> transport<00:01:57.510> table<00:01:57.870> so<00:01:58.080> I'm<00:01:58.290> only<00:01:58.410> gonna

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the transport table so I'm only gonna

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.920 
the transport table so I'm only gonna
have<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.010> once<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.870> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
have to do that once so that's not that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.860 
have to do that once so that's not that
big<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.320> deal

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870

across on the front in the back are uh

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.950 
across on the front in the back are uh
have<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.680> be<00:03:13.860> glued<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.220> last<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:16.130> fits

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
have to be glued on last and this fits

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.500 
have to be glued on last and this fits
in<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:21.510> get<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.810> underneath<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:24.120> lip

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
in I can get it underneath this lip

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.810 
in I can get it underneath this lip
right<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.770> no<00:03:26.070> other<00:03:26.280> way<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.580> get

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
right here and it's no other way to get

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.050 
right here and it's no other way to get
it<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.620> what<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.830> could<00:03:29.280> probably<00:03:29.580> do<00:03:30.000> I

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
it in there what you could probably do I

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.290 
it in there what you could probably do I
guess<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:31.340> put<00:03:32.340> get<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.640> top<00:03:32.850> together<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
guess is put get the top together and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.030 
guess is put get the top together and
put<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.510> on<00:03:33.630> first<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.230> then<00:03:34.350> put<00:03:34.590> your<00:03:34.770> lips

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
put it on first and then put your lips

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.130 
put it on first and then put your lips
but<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.820> mean<00:03:36.390> that's<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.720> little<00:03:36.930> nitpicky

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
but I mean that's just a little nitpicky

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.690 
but I mean that's just a little nitpicky

thing but it was a it was um quite a
shock<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.360> uh<00:03:42.390> when<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.320> was<00:03:43.470> putting<00:03:43.680> together

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
shock it uh when I was putting together

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.410 
shock it uh when I was putting together
I<00:03:44.070> got<00:03:44.280> all<00:03:44.370> together<00:03:44.520> like<00:03:44.760> oh<00:03:44.880> my<00:03:45.030> gosh<00:03:45.209> it's

there so not too much of a problem it's
not<00:03:59.590> glued<00:03:59.890> down<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.250> base<00:04:00.490> right<00:04:00.700> now

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
not glued down to the base right now
