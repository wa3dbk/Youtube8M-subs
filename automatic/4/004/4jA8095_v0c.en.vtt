Munich I don't think that's all we're
discussing<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.030> Bayern<00:02:09.239> Munich<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.020> by

discussing with Bayern Munich but by

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.070 
discussing with Bayern Munich but by
mucus<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:10.830> letting<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.550> door<00:02:11.760> open

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
mucus or letting the door open

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I'm not pushing him through it but not

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.360 
I'm not pushing him through it but not
asking<00:02:15.330> him<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.570> stay<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.280> United<00:02:17.280> have

offered him a two-year contract I think

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
offered him a two-year contract I think
we're<00:02:22.200> probably<00:02:22.320> going<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> end<00:02:22.740> up<00:02:22.950> getting

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
that Schneiderlin was told him and

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.790 
that Schneiderlin was told him and
Schweinsteiger<00:02:30.720> would<00:02:30.900> be<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.380> midfield

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800

like we're working on both of those and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.680 
like we're working on both of those and
I<00:02:59.160> thought<00:02:59.459> mullah<00:02:59.850> was<00:02:59.970> going<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.300> be<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> big

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
I thought mullah was going to be a big

I thought mullah was going to be a big
one<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.110> didn't<00:03:01.650> include<00:03:01.890> Schweinsteiger<00:03:02.550> in

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
one I didn't include Schweinsteiger in

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.920 
one I didn't include Schweinsteiger in
that<00:03:02.880> because<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> wasn't<00:03:03.510> certain<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.840> was

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
that because I wasn't certain it was

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.150 
that because I wasn't certain it was
going<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.110> happen<00:03:04.230> but<00:03:04.590> let's<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:05.010> think

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
going to happen but let's just think

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.590 
going to happen but let's just think
about<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.459> if<00:03:05.760> those<00:03:05.970> are<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.240> signings

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
about that if those are the signings

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.260 
about that if those are the signings
that<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.840> get<00:03:07.110> that's<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.740> phenomenal<00:03:08.270> starts
