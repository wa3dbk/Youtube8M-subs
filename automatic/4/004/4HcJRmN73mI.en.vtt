00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.580 
we're going to go through all of the
changes<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.520> more<00:00:17.940> detail<00:00:18.480> dice<00:00:19.350> have

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
changes in more detail dice have

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.470 
changes in more detail dice have
basically<00:00:20.070> introduced<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.850> whole<00:00:21.060> bunch<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
basically introduced a whole bunch of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.880 
basically introduced a whole bunch of
negative<00:00:21.630> effects<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.410> some<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
negative effects to some of the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.380 
negative effects to some of the
attachments<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.850> made<00:00:24.029> running

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
attachments and this is made running

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.320 
attachments and this is made running
guns<00:00:24.600> bear<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.199> more<00:00:25.740> viable<00:00:26.039> option<00:00:26.699> whether

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
guns bear a more viable option whether

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.790 
guns bear a more viable option whether
or<00:00:27.420> not<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.689> should<00:00:27.810> keep<00:00:28.199> running<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.680> your

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
or not you should keep running with your

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.320 
or not you should keep running with your
favorite<00:00:29.189> set<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.490> though<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.179> going

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
favorite set up though is really going

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.849 
favorite set up though is really going
to<00:00:30.420> depend<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> lot<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.260> different<00:00:31.679> factors

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to depend on a lot of different factors

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.799 
to depend on a lot of different factors
so<00:00:32.309> hopefully<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.910> video<00:00:33.059> will<00:00:33.270> make<00:00:33.570> things

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so hopefully this video will make things

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.500 
so hopefully this video will make things
a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.410> less<00:00:34.680> confusing<00:00:35.239> now<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
a little bit less confusing now the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.119 
a little bit less confusing now the
biggest<00:00:36.690> changes<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.350> attachments<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
biggest changes to attachments in the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.340 
biggest changes to attachments in the
recent<00:00:38.610> patch<00:00:38.820> has<00:00:39.090> been<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> grips<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
recent patch has been to the grips and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.440 
recent patch has been to the grips and
the<00:00:40.530> flash<00:00:40.770> hider<00:00:41.010> which<00:00:41.340> previously<00:00:41.730> had<00:00:42.059> no

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the flash hider which previously had no

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.330 
the flash hider which previously had no
penalties<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.320> all<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.190> these

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
penalties at all all of these

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
penalties at all all of these
attachments<00:00:44.940> now<00:00:45.090> add<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> penalty<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.930> spread

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
attachments now add a penalty to spread

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
attachments now add a penalty to spread
decrease<00:00:46.469> which<00:00:46.950> basically<00:00:47.700> increases<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
decrease which basically increases the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
decrease which basically increases the
time<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.899> takes<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.260> your<00:00:49.379> spread<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.829> return

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
time it takes for your spread to return

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
time it takes for your spread to return
to<00:00:50.399> normal<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.510> isn't<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> huge<00:00:52.199> issue<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
to normal this isn't a huge issue but it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.709 
to normal this isn't a huge issue but it
does<00:00:53.100> affect<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> accuracy<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.120> burst<00:00:54.420> fire

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
does affect the accuracy of burst fire

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
does affect the accuracy of burst fire
and<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.289> both<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.649> grip<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.250> barrel

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and with both a grip and a barrel

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
and with both a grip and a barrel
attachment<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:57.480> penalty<00:00:57.809> does<00:00:58.140> add<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.469> as

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
attachment this penalty does add up as

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.830 
attachment this penalty does add up as
long<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.730> bear<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.300> mind<00:01:00.329> though<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
long as you bear this in mind though you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
long as you bear this in mind though you
should<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.289> able<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.649> adapt<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.160> setup<00:01:02.520> but

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
should be able to adapt your setup but

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
should be able to adapt your setup but
it<00:01:03.090> does<00:01:03.390> mean<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.690> certain<00:01:04.199> weapons<00:01:04.350> are

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it does mean that certain weapons are

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.140 
it does mean that certain weapons are
now<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.129> less<00:01:05.339> effective<00:01:05.820> than<00:01:05.850> they

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
now going to be less effective than they

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.200 
now going to be less effective than they
once<00:01:06.360> were<00:01:06.860> trying<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> analyze<00:01:08.369> every<00:01:08.880> single

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
once were trying to analyze every single

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.240 
once were trying to analyze every single
weapon<00:01:09.360> isn't<00:01:09.720> exactly<00:01:10.260> possible<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.070> this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
weapon isn't exactly possible in this

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460 
weapon isn't exactly possible in this
video<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> general<00:01:12.390> rule<00:01:12.720> weapons<00:01:13.320> that

have<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.680> high<00:01:13.920> spread<00:01:14.250> increase<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.760> begin

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
have a high spread increase to begin

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.580 
have a high spread increase to begin
with<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.780> affected<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.350> most

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
with are going to be affected the most

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.280 
with are going to be affected the most
also<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.939> i<00:01:18.090> said<00:01:18.330> before<00:01:18.450> weapons<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
also like i said before weapons that you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.840 
also like i said before weapons that you
tend<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> burst<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.159> also<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
tend to burst are also going to be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.550 
tend to burst are also going to be
affected<00:01:21.090> which<00:01:21.810> basically<00:01:22.200> includes

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
affected which basically includes

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.499 
affected which basically includes
anything<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> mid<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> high<00:01:24.060> rate<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> fire

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
anything with a mid to high rate of fire

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.080 
anything with a mid to high rate of fire
in<00:01:25.350> addition<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> attachment<00:01:26.700> penalty<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
in addition to the attachment penalty a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
in addition to the attachment penalty a
lot<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.360> guns<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.960> also<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> nerve<00:01:28.740> tuve

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
lot of guns have also got a nerve tuve

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.649 
lot of guns have also got a nerve tuve
spread<00:01:29.549> decrease<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.150> might<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
spread decrease so you might want to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
spread decrease so you might want to
avoid<00:01:30.900> making<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> problem<00:01:31.590> worse<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:32.250> these

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
avoid making the problem worse on these

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.660 
still very useful even with the penalty

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.700 
don't think either of these attachments
are<00:02:47.000> really<00:02:47.300> necessary<00:02:47.810> though<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.560> it's

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
are really necessary though so it's

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.320 
are really necessary though so it's
probably<00:02:48.920> best<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.490> just<00:02:49.550> work<00:02:49.910> on<00:02:50.180> your

probably best to just work on your

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.820 
probably best to just work on your
recoil<00:02:50.690> control<00:02:50.870> if<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.470> find<00:02:51.709> yourself

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
recoil control if you find yourself

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.520 
recoil control if you find yourself
needing<00:02:52.280> them<00:02:52.580> now<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.540> should<00:02:54.050> also<00:02:54.320> mention

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
needing them now I should also mention

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.440 
needing them now I should also mention
that<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.130> laser<00:02:55.340> side<00:02:55.700> has<00:02:55.940> been<00:02:55.970> slightly

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
that the laser side has been slightly

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.660 
that the laser side has been slightly
buffed<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.500> fairly<00:02:57.740> minor<00:02:58.070> change<00:02:58.459> so

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
buffed but it's a fairly minor change so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.100 
buffed but it's a fairly minor change so
I<00:02:58.700> doubt<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.150> will<00:02:59.330> make<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.510> huge<00:02:59.630> difference

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
I doubt this will make a huge difference

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.470 
I doubt this will make a huge difference
in<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.590> long<00:03:00.740> run<00:03:00.800> there's<00:03:01.700> also<00:03:01.880> been<00:03:02.180> above

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
in the long run there's also been above

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.150 
in the long run there's also been above
to<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.690> shotgun<00:03:03.170> chokes<00:03:03.470> but<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.740> won't<00:03:03.980> get

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
to the shotgun chokes but I won't get

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.620 
to the shotgun chokes but I won't get
into<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.459> because<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.970> think<00:03:05.030> we<00:03:05.300> pretty<00:03:05.510> much

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
into that because I think we pretty much

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.570 
into that because I think we pretty much
all<00:03:05.959> know<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.470> shotguns<00:03:06.920> are<00:03:07.160> just

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
all know that shotguns are just

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.280 
all know that shotguns are just
generally<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.060> lot<00:03:08.270> better<00:03:08.420> after<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.080> patch

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
generally a lot better after the patch

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.980 
generally a lot better after the patch
as<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:10.370> said<00:03:10.430> most<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.120> important<00:03:11.600> changes

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
as I said most of the important changes

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.360 
as I said most of the important changes
have<00:03:12.110> been<00:03:12.230> made<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.709> grips<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
have been made to the grips and the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.980 
have been made to the grips and the
barrel<00:03:13.700> attachments<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.330> combined<00:03:14.720> with<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
barrel attachments and combined with the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.870 
barrel attachments and combined with the
weapon<00:03:15.320> balancing<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.459> pretty<00:03:16.700> big

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
weapon balancing this is a pretty big

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.060 
weapon balancing this is a pretty big
shake-up<00:03:17.209> for<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.630> loadout<00:03:17.989> system<00:03:18.470> if<00:03:18.650> you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
shake-up for the loadout system if you

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.560 
shake-up for the loadout system if you
want<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.400> take<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.550> look<00:03:19.730> at<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.970> full<00:03:20.150> list<00:03:20.360> of

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
want to take a look at the full list of

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.360 
want to take a look at the full list of
weapon<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.019> attachment<00:03:21.500> changes<00:03:21.920> well<00:03:22.130> it's

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
weapon and attachment changes well it's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.310 
weapon and attachment changes well it's
a<00:03:22.459> bit<00:03:22.670> difficult<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.150> understand<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.200> I'll

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
a bit difficult to understand but I'll

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.630 
a bit difficult to understand but I'll
leave<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.560> link<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.100> description<00:03:25.519> for

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
leave a link in the description for

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.090 
leave a link in the description for
anyone<00:03:25.940> who<00:03:26.120> does<00:03:26.390> want<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.660> take<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> look<00:03:27.170> so

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
anyone who does want to take a look so

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.280 
anyone who does want to take a look so
barring<00:03:28.700> all<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.209> in<00:03:29.390> mind<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:30.110> should

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
barring all of this in mind you should

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.960 
barring all of this in mind you should
have<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.500> pretty<00:03:30.739> good<00:03:30.800> idea<00:03:30.950> by<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:31.610> of<00:03:31.790> how

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
have a pretty good idea by now of how

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.430 
have a pretty good idea by now of how
the<00:03:32.030> new<00:03:32.269> penalties<00:03:32.720> are<00:03:32.959> going<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.260> change

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
the new penalties are going to change

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.650 
the new penalties are going to change
your<00:03:33.590> setups<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.730> recap<00:03:35.150> though<00:03:35.360> in<00:03:35.630> general

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
your setups to recap though in general

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.170 
your setups to recap though in general
like<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.410> said<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.769> flash<00:03:36.980> hider<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.550> basically

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
like I said the flash hider is basically

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.790 
like I said the flash hider is basically
dead<00:03:38.420> now<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.840> you'll<00:03:39.230> also<00:03:39.380> want<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.709> be

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
dead now and you'll also want to be

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.560 
dead now and you'll also want to be
careful<00:03:39.830> of<00:03:40.250> what<00:03:40.400> weapons<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.850> put<00:03:41.090> grips<00:03:41.360> on

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
careful of what weapons you put grips on

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.170 
careful of what weapons you put grips on
as<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.870> general<00:03:42.739> rule<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:43.160> probably<00:03:43.670> only<00:03:43.850> use

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
as a general rule I probably only use

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.840 
as a general rule I probably only use
the<00:03:44.360> stubby<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.959> potato<00:03:45.380> on<00:03:45.739> low<00:03:46.010> rpm<00:03:46.519> weapons

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
the stubby and potato on low rpm weapons

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.910 
the stubby and potato on low rpm weapons
that<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.090> don't<00:03:47.360> burst<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.380> angled<00:03:48.800> in

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
that you don't burst and the angled in

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.380 
that you don't burst and the angled in
the<00:03:49.010> folding<00:03:49.400> grips<00:03:49.640> on<00:03:49.880> guns<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.330> are

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
the folding grips on guns that are

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.930 
the folding grips on guns that are
particularly<00:03:50.900> difficult<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.560> control<00:03:51.860> as<00:03:52.340> for

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
particularly difficult to control as for

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.280 
particularly difficult to control as for
the<00:03:53.030> ergo<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.510> heavy<00:03:53.690> barrel<00:03:53.900> or<00:03:54.200> the

the ergo the heavy barrel or the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.840 
the ergo the heavy barrel or the
suppressor<00:03:54.739> though<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:55.340> should<00:03:55.519> be<00:03:55.670> pretty

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
suppressor though you should be pretty

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.820 
suppressor though you should be pretty
safe<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.480> if<00:03:56.750> you're<00:03:56.900> anything<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:57.260> me<00:03:57.470> this

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
safe and if you're anything like me this

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.560 
safe and if you're anything like me this
will<00:03:58.010> probably<00:03:58.220> make<00:03:58.580> up<00:03:58.790> ninety<00:03:59.150> percent<00:03:59.269> of

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
will probably make up ninety percent of

will probably make up ninety percent of
