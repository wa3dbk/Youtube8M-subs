that<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.190> different<00:02:16.879> from<00:02:17.090> some<00:02:17.750> content

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
that is different from some content

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.800 
that is different from some content
issues<00:02:18.769> some<00:02:19.250> content<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.910> be<00:02:19.970> taken

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
issues some content that can be taken

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.740 
issues some content that can be taken
from<00:02:20.989> some<00:02:21.410> other<00:02:21.950> source<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:23.090> suppose<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
from some other source and I suppose the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.449 
from some other source and I suppose the
key<00:02:23.930> thing<00:02:24.230> about<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.739> project<00:02:24.980> ultimately

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
key thing about this project ultimately

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.070 
key thing about this project ultimately
it<00:02:25.760> will<00:02:25.849> be<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.150> our<00:02:26.300> students<00:02:26.750> will<00:02:26.870> learn

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
it will be that our students will learn

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.530 
it will be that our students will learn
to<00:02:27.290> problem<00:02:27.709> solve<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.220> different<00:02:28.580> ways<00:02:28.819> they

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
to problem solve in different ways they

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
to problem solve in different ways they
will<00:02:29.690> be<00:02:29.840> able<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.530> represent<00:02:31.040> what<00:02:31.580> they

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
will be able to represent what they

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.490 
will be able to represent what they
understand<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.450> know<00:02:32.599> in<00:02:32.870> different<00:02:33.260> ways

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
understand and know in different ways

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.350 
understand and know in different ways
they<00:02:34.099> will<00:02:34.220> also<00:02:34.400> be<00:02:34.670> able<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.879> see<00:02:35.060> others

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
they will also be able to see others

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360 
they will also be able to see others
people's<00:02:35.720> perspectives<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.950> see<00:02:37.160> that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
people's perspectives and to see that

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.699 
people's perspectives and to see that
nothing<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.910> simple<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.810> things<00:02:39.170> like<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.470> work

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
nothing is simple the things like a work

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.250 
nothing is simple the things like a work
of<00:02:39.860> art<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.280> highly<00:02:40.730> complex<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.629> has<00:02:41.810> multiple

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
of art is highly complex it has multiple

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.370 
of art is highly complex it has multiple
levels<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.890> layers<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.299> life<00:02:44.510> has<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.049> I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
levels and layers just as life has and I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.559 
levels and layers just as life has and I
think<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.769> terms<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.310> vicarious<00:02:46.670> experience

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
think in terms of vicarious experience

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.449 
think in terms of vicarious experience
of<00:02:47.720> putting<00:02:47.989> our<00:02:48.140> students<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.310> role<00:02:49.430> of

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
of putting our students in the role of

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.370 
of putting our students in the role of
what's<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:50.000> come<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.299> life<00:02:50.510> act<00:02:51.019> as<00:02:51.349> a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
what's to come in life act as a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.259 
what's to come in life act as a
marvelous<00:02:51.920> way<00:02:52.130> of<00:02:52.370> taking<00:02:52.760> them<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> edge

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
marvelous way of taking them to the edge

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.539 
marvelous way of taking them to the edge
and<00:02:53.540> then<00:02:53.599> letting<00:02:54.140> them<00:02:54.319> fly<00:02:54.620> seeing<00:02:55.400> new

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
and then letting them fly seeing new

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.670 
and then letting them fly seeing new
possibilities<00:02:56.299> in<00:02:56.329> a<00:02:56.569> painting<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.170> letting

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
possibilities in a painting and letting

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.069 
possibilities in a painting and letting
them<00:02:57.829> see<00:02:58.099> that<00:02:58.549> there<00:02:58.760> are<00:02:58.940> multiple<00:02:59.629> ways<00:02:59.750> of

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
them see that there are multiple ways of

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.020 
them see that there are multiple ways of
solving<00:03:00.319> problems<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.459> we<00:03:01.610> must<00:03:01.790> take<00:03:01.970> a

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
solving problems and that we must take a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.059 
solving problems and that we must take a
risk<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.540> put<00:03:02.660> ourselves<00:03:02.810> out<00:03:03.200> there<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.680> be

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
risk and put ourselves out there and be

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.030 
risk and put ourselves out there and be
part<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.760> solution<00:03:05.239> for<00:03:06.200> us<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.920> be

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
part of the solution for us to be

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.410 
part of the solution for us to be
working<00:03:07.250> with<00:03:07.489> an<00:03:07.670> institution<00:03:08.269> that's

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
working with an institution that's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.119 
working with an institution that's
really<00:03:08.690> thinking<00:03:08.959> about<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.590> applications

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
really thinking about the applications

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.210 
really thinking about the applications
of<00:03:10.220> ETS<00:03:10.700> not<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.690> in<00:03:11.780> one<00:03:11.930> class<00:03:12.379> not<00:03:12.920> just

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
of ETS not just in one class not just

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.400 
of ETS not just in one class not just
with<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.549> group<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.910> students<00:03:14.360> not<00:03:14.780> just<00:03:15.049> in<00:03:15.170> one

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
with a group of students not just in one

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.879 
with a group of students not just in one
context<00:03:15.890> but<00:03:16.010> thinking<00:03:16.310> about<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.549> at<00:03:16.850> a

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
context but thinking about it at a

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.559 
context but thinking about it at a
systems<00:03:18.889> level<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:19.430> really<00:03:19.819> exciting<00:03:20.450> and

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
systems level is really exciting and

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.629 
systems level is really exciting and
really<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:21.530> be<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> real<00:03:21.859> game-changer<00:03:22.130> in

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
really can be a real game-changer in

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.759 
really can be a real game-changer in
thinking<00:03:22.910> about<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.299> way<00:03:23.329> that<00:03:23.660> education<00:03:23.810> is

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
thinking about the way that education is

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.989 
thinking about the way that education is
going<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.130> actually<00:03:25.310> look<00:03:25.519> here<00:03:26.209> at<00:03:26.450> UCC
