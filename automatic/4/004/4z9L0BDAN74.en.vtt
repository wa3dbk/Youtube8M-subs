00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.550 
graveyard a marketplace bergisch plots
maybe<00:00:14.250> four<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:14.670> five<00:00:15.000> hundred<00:00:15.480> people<00:00:15.960> living

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
maybe four or five hundred people living

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.560 
maybe four or five hundred people living
in<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.930> over<00:00:18.930> time<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.619> begins<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
in it and over time it begins to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.799 
in it and over time it begins to
disappear<00:00:21.590> it<00:00:22.590> declines<00:00:23.130> economically<00:00:24.000> but

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:24.809 
disappear it declines economically but

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:28.179 
disappear it declines economically but
then<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.919> sands<00:00:26.610> begin<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.450> cover<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.869> over

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
then the sands begin to cover it over

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.459 
then the sands begin to cover it over
and<00:00:29.189> what<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.610> think<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:30.029> might<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.540> here<00:00:31.079> is

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:31.469 
and what we think we might have here is

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:34.579 
and what we think we might have here is
a<00:00:31.529> time<00:00:32.009> capsule<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.570> medieval<00:00:33.930> town

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:34.589 
a time capsule of a medieval town

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:39.229 
a time capsule of a medieval town
covered<00:00:35.519> by<00:00:36.179> this<00:00:36.239> stuff<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.550> this<00:00:38.550> stuff<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
covered by this stuff and this stuff is

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.739 
covered by this stuff and this stuff is
going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.129> important<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.399> us

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:41.749 
going to get very important for us

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.040 
going to get very important for us
during<00:00:42.749> the<00:00:42.899> shoot<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:43.769> as<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.339> can<00:00:44.579> see

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
during the shoot because as you can see

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.509 
during the shoot because as you can see
it's<00:00:46.050> sand<00:00:46.589> but<00:00:47.519> it's<00:00:47.699> sort<00:00:48.089> of<00:00:48.359> kind<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.050> flows

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
it's sand but it's sort of kind of flows

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.419 
it's sand but it's sort of kind of flows
like<00:00:50.519> water<00:00:51.109> the<00:00:52.109> problem<00:00:52.589> with<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.159> you

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
like water the problem with that is you

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.079 
like water the problem with that is you
dig<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.179> hole<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.839> it<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:55.260> put<00:00:56.249> somebody<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
dig a hole in it and put somebody in it

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.410 
dig a hole in it and put somebody in it
and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:58.260> sand<00:00:58.559> begins<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.219> fill<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> hole

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and the sand begins to fill in the hole

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.599 
and the sand begins to fill in the hole
it<00:01:00.780> begins<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> collapse<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.829> almost<00:01:02.129> flow

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it begins to collapse and almost flow

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.299 
it begins to collapse and almost flow
into<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> trenches<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.830> we're<00:01:05.010> doing

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
into the trenches and what we're doing

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.690 
into the trenches and what we're doing
down<00:01:05.610> there<00:01:05.930> if<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> look

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.149 

that's<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.570> first<00:01:11.840> trench<00:01:12.259> going<00:01:12.740> in<00:01:12.920> down

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
that's the first trench going in down

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.690 
that's the first trench going in down
there<00:01:13.579> and<00:01:14.060> it's<00:01:14.360> going<00:01:14.570> into<00:01:14.990> sand<00:01:15.579> and<00:01:16.579> we

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
there and it's going into sand and we

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.889 
there and it's going into sand and we
don't<00:01:16.939> know<00:01:17.240> how<00:01:17.659> far<00:01:17.719> down<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:19.899> boundary

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
don't know how far down the boundary

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.090 
don't know how far down the boundary
ditch<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.979> buildings<00:01:22.520> are<00:01:22.969> going<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.450> be

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
ditch and the buildings are going to be

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.330 
ditch and the buildings are going to be
if<00:01:25.100> they're<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.880> meter<00:01:26.479> down<00:01:26.929> we<00:01:27.710> have<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.100> dig

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
if they're a meter down we have to dig

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.630 
if they're a meter down we have to dig
two<00:01:28.850> or<00:01:29.000> three<00:01:29.270> meters<00:01:29.720> out<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.829> stop<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.369> sand

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
two or three meters out to stop the sand

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.270 
two or three meters out to stop the sand
back<00:01:31.970> filling<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.569> trench<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:33.350> even<00:01:34.009> then

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
back filling that trench and even then

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.850 
back filling that trench and even then
that<00:01:34.520> might<00:01:35.030> not<00:01:35.299> be<00:01:35.450> big<00:01:35.630> enough<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.619> there's

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
that might not be big enough so there's

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.069 
that might not be big enough so there's
some<00:01:37.009> fantastic<00:01:37.819> challenges<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.600> this<00:01:38.810> site

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
some fantastic challenges on this site

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.330 
some fantastic challenges on this site
but<00:01:39.770> also<00:01:39.950> there's<00:01:40.789> some<00:01:41.119> fantastic

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
but also there's some fantastic

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.570 
but also there's some fantastic
archaeology<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:43.549> hope<00:01:43.959> underneath<00:01:44.959> all<00:01:45.259> this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
archaeology we hope underneath all this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.699 
archaeology we hope underneath all this
this<00:01:46.580> is<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.819> final<00:01:47.240> blog<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.750> year<00:01:47.990> I

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
this is the final blog of the year I

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
enjoy it we're going to be filming it

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.760 
enjoy it we're going to be filming it
from<00:01:52.399> all<00:01:52.549> sorts<00:01:52.819> of<00:01:52.939> different<00:01:53.000> angles<00:01:53.780> but<00:01:54.500> I

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
from all sorts of different angles but I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.069 
from all sorts of different angles but I
hope<00:01:55.520> by<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.030> end<00:01:56.149> of<00:01:56.329> those<00:01:56.450> three<00:01:56.509> days

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
hope by the end of those three days

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.380 
hope by the end of those three days
we're<00:01:57.709> going<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.039> looking<00:01:58.220> at<00:01:58.579> what<00:01:58.880> is

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
we're going to be looking at what is

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.770 
we're going to be looking at what is
lying<00:02:00.020> under<00:02:00.619> this<00:02:01.630> huge<00:02:02.630> sand<00:02:03.079> dune<00:02:03.409> here
