00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.479 
reservoir actually does hold quite a
large<00:03:06.510> amount<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:07.049> water<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.829> probably<00:03:08.250> get

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
large amount of water you probably get

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.740 
large amount of water you probably get
about<00:03:09.079> 6<00:03:10.079> or<00:03:10.200> 7<00:03:10.260> cups<00:03:10.739> or<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.160> out<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.340> us<00:03:11.750> we'll

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
about 6 or 7 cups or so out of us we'll

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.420 
about 6 or 7 cups or so out of us we'll
just<00:03:12.780> put<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> into<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> back<00:03:13.829> of<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.070> machine

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
just put it into the back of the machine

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.840 
just put it into the back of the machine
here<00:03:16.340> right<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.810> actual

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
here right and this is the actual

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.810 
here right and this is the actual
capsule<00:03:20.850> holder<00:03:22.010> where<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.100> will<00:03:23.220> place<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
capsule holder where you will place the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.400 
capsule holder where you will place the
coffee<00:03:24.690> pots<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:27.299> put<00:03:27.540> cap<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.959> see<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.200> know

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
coffee pots and put cap and see you know

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.800 
coffee pots and put cap and see you know
we<00:03:29.040> actually<00:03:29.160> need<00:03:29.579> two<00:03:29.880> different<00:03:30.390> types<00:03:30.630> of

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
we actually need two different types of

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.620 
we actually need two different types of
parts<00:03:31.200> when<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.130> first<00:03:32.489> one<00:03:32.820> here<00:03:33.090> which<00:03:33.600> is

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
parts when you first one here which is

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.900 
parts when you first one here which is
the<00:03:35.359> coffee<00:03:36.359> pot<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:37.799> that's<00:03:38.130> actually<00:03:38.430> black

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
the coffee pot and that's actually black

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.620 
the coffee pot and that's actually black
in<00:03:39.120> color

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
in color

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.750 
in color
so<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.500> can't<00:03:40.769> make<00:03:40.859> any<00:03:40.950> mistakes<00:03:41.220> there

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
so you can't make any mistakes there

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.069 
so you can't make any mistakes there
hopefully<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.850> second<00:03:45.239> one<00:03:45.390> we'll<00:03:45.720> be<00:03:45.870> using

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
hopefully the second one we'll be using

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.370 
hopefully the second one we'll be using
it<00:03:46.290> which<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.799> milk<00:03:47.010> pot<00:03:47.569> which<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.600> white

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
it which is the milk pot which is white

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.270 
it which is the milk pot which is white
in<00:03:49.650> color<00:03:50.359> so<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:52.560> can't<00:03:52.799> rather<00:03:53.040> get

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
in color so you can't rather get

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.080 
in color so you can't rather get
confused

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.360 

first<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:56.990> all<00:03:57.080> though<00:03:57.290> we<00:03:57.470> just<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.160> keep

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
first of all though we just like to keep

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.200 
first of all though we just like to keep
in<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.640> seal<00:04:00.100> we<00:04:01.100> just<00:04:01.280> tear<00:04:01.580> this<00:04:01.790> on<00:04:02.000> the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
in the seal we just tear this on the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.940 
in the seal we just tear this on the
side<00:04:02.510> control<00:04:03.200> here<00:04:03.470> on<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.470> green<00:04:06.710> light

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
side control here on the green light

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.130 
side control here on the green light
that<00:04:07.250> will<00:04:07.430> flush<00:04:07.820> until<00:04:08.510> it's<00:04:08.660> actually

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
that will flush until it's actually

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.280 
that will flush until it's actually
heated<00:04:10.100> up<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.370> water<00:04:10.660> we<00:04:11.660> have<00:04:11.690> just<00:04:11.990> got

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
heated up the water we have just got

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.130 
heated up the water we have just got
there<00:04:12.620> enough<00:04:13.430> for<00:04:14.290> one<00:04:16.000> cup<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.140> capacitor

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
there enough for one cup of capacitor

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.670 
there enough for one cup of capacitor
there<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:19.150> was<00:04:20.150> eating<00:04:20.630> I'll<00:04:20.750> just<00:04:20.930> like<00:04:21.140> to<00:04:21.260> say
