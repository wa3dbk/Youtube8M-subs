00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.659
 would be 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.450
 to pay for our device to 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:49.200

 0.2 Brazil 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.430
 this is what would be happening in our 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.430
 device on par 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.620

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.470
 at the time of executing the commands 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.530

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.190
 the usb cable 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.200
 after about 8 minutes
