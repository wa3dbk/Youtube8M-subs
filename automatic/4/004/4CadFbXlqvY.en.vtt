00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.550
 so dear friends want to introduce you 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.340
 homemade smoke generator mine for 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.699
 cold smoked 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.369
 it consists of a bucket 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:25.260
 a little pinotex and more 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.869
 can plastic to sawdust and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.099
 shavings 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:36.149
 herself filed to the hole blew and 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:40.260
 burned well further the smoke itself will be with us 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.680
 coming out of this tube will be just 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.760
 simple tee here the cork is inserted and 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:51.649
 this very nail nut twisted so 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 Now we will run it 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.820
 take shavings alder chips on 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.470
 planers 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:09.590
 planer touched so to run here 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.590
 enough for me 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:24.990
 close the plump and insert the tube 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.380
 from compressor to compressor not from 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.970
 refrigerator but better to take the compressor 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.509
 here's an aquarium it with a pressure regulator and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.600
 you can regulate the density of smoke 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.619
 so we insert the tube work labor to 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:49.280
 necessarily provided that the tube should 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.280
 already included here in this pipe so include 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.310
 turn on the compressor and 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.390
 so from the laundry and just set on fire 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:23.160
 She immediately for tightens here and went 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.160
 behind the smoke 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:54.440
 so she watered once and everything and smoke went 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.240
 then put a barrel in which he will 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.410
 most 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:04.459
 smoked everything is very simple subscribe 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.940
 on our channel and you will see many more people 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.000
 useful leave comments here 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:16.940
 such a bucket is burning somewhere 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.160
 hours if its whole is filled with 4 here 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.980
 Nothing complicated I opened it I closed it 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 again Diane is burning all see what spirit 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.200
 thick smoke 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.570
 that's when the aquarium battery 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.060
 compressor this height of smoke can 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.060
 regulate all good luck
