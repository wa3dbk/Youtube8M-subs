00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
helicopter in the air I wanted to get

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.469

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
rugged Scottish coastline and I thought

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.340 
rugged Scottish coastline and I thought
with<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.089> size<00:01:02.389> of<00:01:02.539> this<00:01:02.629> camera<00:01:02.899> we<00:01:03.079> can<00:01:03.170> take

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
with the size of this camera we can take

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.920 
with the size of this camera we can take
advantage<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.889> it<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.159> an<00:01:04.309> aerial<00:01:04.640> drawn<00:01:05.089> so<00:01:05.840> we

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
advantage of it of an aerial drawn so we

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.140 
advantage of it of an aerial drawn so we
got<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.170> guys<00:01:06.320> from<00:01:06.520> horizon<00:01:07.520> air<00:01:07.640> peds<00:01:07.909> come

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
got the guys from horizon air peds come

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.539 
got the guys from horizon air peds come
up<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:08.479> fly<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:09.650> us

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700

beach and planting a big whiskey barrel
in<00:02:11.510> there<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:12.080> filmed<00:02:12.470> him<00:02:12.620> preparing<00:02:13.370> fish<00:02:13.730> on

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
in there we filmed him preparing fish on

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.729 
in there we filmed him preparing fish on
the<00:02:14.090> beach<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.600> actually<00:02:15.290> putting<00:02:15.500> them<00:02:15.650> on

these<00:02:15.860> battens<00:02:16.370> smoking<00:02:17.330> them<00:02:17.510> outside<00:02:18.350> in

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
these battens smoking them outside in

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:32.050 
these battens smoking them outside in
the<00:02:18.650> beautiful<00:02:18.950> great<00:02:19.280> outdoors

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.690 

the<00:02:32.720> use<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:33.020> an<00:02:33.140> S<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> very<00:02:33.890> very<00:02:34.100> compact

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
the use of an S is a very very compact

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.580 
the use of an S is a very very compact
camera<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.270> mean<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.840> no<00:02:36.020> bigger<00:02:36.290> than<00:02:36.410> a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
camera I mean it it's no bigger than a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.610 
camera I mean it it's no bigger than a
compact<00:02:37.100> camera<00:02:37.340> actually<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.319> it's

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
compact camera actually and so that it's

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.309 
compact camera actually and so that it's
really<00:02:39.800> versatile<00:02:40.430> because<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:41.000> its<00:02:41.120> size<00:02:41.390> you

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
really versatile because of its size you

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.230 
really versatile because of its size you
can<00:02:42.500> put<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.770> in<00:02:42.890> just<00:02:43.100> almost<00:02:43.610> any<00:02:43.819> situation

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
can put it in just almost any situation

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.690 
can put it in just almost any situation
we've<00:02:44.900> had<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:46.130> steady<00:02:46.430> rig

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
we've had it on a be steady rig

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.210 
we've had it on a be steady rig
free-flying<00:02:47.450> gimbal<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.170> that's<00:02:48.950> being

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
free-flying gimbal and that's being

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.920 
free-flying gimbal and that's being
useful<00:02:49.670> as<00:02:49.790> well<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.330> give<00:02:50.480> us<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.750> bit<00:02:50.900> of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
useful as well to give us a bit of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.780 
useful as well to give us a bit of
stability<00:02:51.250> instead<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.340> having<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.580> what<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
stability instead of having to what the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.210 
stability instead of having to what the
steady<00:02:53.090> camera<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.840> big<00:02:54.220> cumbersome

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
steady camera I can big cumbersome

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.550 
steady camera I can big cumbersome
stabilization<00:02:56.150> devices<00:02:56.630> we've<00:02:57.140> been<00:02:57.319> able<00:02:57.440> to

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
stabilization devices we've been able to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.070 
stabilization devices we've been able to
just<00:02:57.770> throw<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.640> there<00:02:58.970> do<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.480> few<00:02:59.780> shots

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
just throw that on there do a few shots

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.479 
just throw that on there do a few shots
and<00:03:00.440> it's<00:03:00.800> really<00:03:01.010> added<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.280> lot<00:03:01.340> of

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
and it's really added a lot of

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.160 
and it's really added a lot of
production<00:03:01.910> value<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.390> size<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:03.080> the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
production value so the size of the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.680 
production value so the size of the
camera<00:03:03.590> has<00:03:04.070> really<00:03:04.459> helped<00:03:04.760> us<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.150> get<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> lot

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
camera has really helped us to get a lot

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.059 
camera has really helped us to get a lot
of<00:03:05.780> different<00:03:06.140> stuff

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.670 

if<00:03:10.030> anyone's<00:03:10.420> currently<00:03:11.200> working<00:03:11.439> with<00:03:11.590> the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
if anyone's currently working with the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.349

DSLR and is looking for a small
form-factor<00:03:13.840> camera<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> one<00:03:15.489> to
