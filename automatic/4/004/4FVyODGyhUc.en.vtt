and when we come to the early chapters
of<00:00:02.370> Genesis<00:00:03.000> my<00:00:03.929> own<00:00:04.080> view<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.350> quite<00:00:04.710> clear<00:00:04.950> on

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
of Genesis my own view is quite clear on

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.829 
of Genesis my own view is quite clear on
this<00:00:05.279> that<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.700> early<00:00:05.879> chapters<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.270> Genesis

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
this that the early chapters of Genesis

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.500 
this that the early chapters of Genesis
are<00:00:07.049> not<00:00:07.680> meant<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.250> be<00:00:08.370> read<00:00:08.580> as<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> scientific

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
textbook they are they're fundamentally

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.189 
textbook they are they're fundamentally
to<00:00:13.290> tell<00:00:13.500> us<00:00:13.650> who<00:00:13.920> God<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.849> what<00:00:15.750> he<00:00:15.839> thinks

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
to tell us who God is and what he thinks

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.859 
to tell us who God is and what he thinks
of<00:00:16.320> human<00:00:16.680> beings<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.420> indeed<00:00:18.420> something

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
of human beings and indeed something

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.890 
of human beings and indeed something
about<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.350> nature<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.770> human<00:00:20.220> beings<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
about the nature of human beings and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.290 
about the nature of human beings and
therefore<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.260> don't<00:00:22.890> myself<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.090> read

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
therefore I don't myself want to read

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.800 
therefore I don't myself want to read
back<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> time<00:00:25.230> scale<00:00:25.650> into<00:00:26.609> Genesis<00:00:27.090> 1<00:00:27.330> 2<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.750> 3

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
back a time scale into Genesis 1 2 and 3

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.830 
back a time scale into Genesis 1 2 and 3
and<00:00:28.080> try<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.650> date<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.099> universe<00:00:29.609> by<00:00:30.570> these

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and try and date the universe by these

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.290 
and try and date the universe by these
stories<00:00:31.460> now<00:00:32.460> that's<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> say<00:00:33.149> that

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
stories now that's not to say that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.510 
stories now that's not to say that
they're<00:00:33.510> simply<00:00:33.930> stories<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.590> were<00:00:34.770> created

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
they're simply stories that were created

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.959 
they're simply stories that were created
to<00:00:35.760> tell<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> theological<00:00:37.110> story<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.770> think<00:00:38.760> they

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
to tell a theological story I think they

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.930 
to tell a theological story I think they
are<00:00:39.000> truth<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.950> inspired<00:00:41.610> by

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
are truth in that they are inspired by

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.229 
are truth in that they are inspired by
God<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.950> they<00:00:43.950> tell<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.489> fundamental

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
God and they tell some fundamental

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.950 
God and they tell some fundamental
things<00:00:46.100> about<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.789> nature<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.300> God<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
things about the nature of God and the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.549 
things about the nature of God and the
nature<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.860> human<00:00:50.250> beings<00:00:51.079> when<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> comes<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
nature of human beings when it comes to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.160 
nature of human beings when it comes to
understanding<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.789> question<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.960> human

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
understanding the question of human

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.729 
understanding the question of human
origins<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:57.180> Adam<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.449> Eve<00:00:57.600> story<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.350> me<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
origins the Adam and Eve story for me is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
origins the Adam and Eve story for me is
profound<00:01:00.170> in<00:01:01.170> lots<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.620> ways<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:02.789> says<00:01:03.539> for

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
profound in lots of ways it says for

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.000 
profound in lots of ways it says for
example<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:05.010> are<00:01:05.519> made<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.150> dust<00:01:07.010> there's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
example that we are made of dust there's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.179 
example that we are made of dust there's
something<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:09.450> continuity<00:01:10.159> with<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
something about our continuity with the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.690 
something about our continuity with the
rest<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.790> creation<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.799> therefore<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.040> don't

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
rest of creation and therefore I don't

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
rest of creation and therefore I don't
worry<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.630> fact<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
worry about the fact that the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490 
worry about the fact that the
evolutionary<00:01:17.100> process<00:01:17.630> means<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.140> share

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
evolutionary process means that we share

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.219 
evolutionary process means that we share
a<00:01:19.530> great<00:01:19.950> deal<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.520> common<00:01:20.720> with<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> rest<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
a great deal in common with the rest of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.580 
a great deal in common with the rest of
creation<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> genetic<00:01:24.150> level

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
creation you know at a genetic level

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.170 
creation you know at a genetic level
we're<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.770> too<00:01:26.009> different<00:01:26.250> from<00:01:26.520> cauliflower

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
we're not too different from cauliflower

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.899 
we're not too different from cauliflower
in<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:28.110> sense<00:01:28.470> there<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> continuity

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
in that sense there is continuity

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
in that sense there is continuity
between<00:01:30.509> human<00:01:31.110> beings<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> rest<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
between human beings and the rest of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.380 
between human beings and the rest of
creation<00:01:32.780> but<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:33.990> also<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.530> image

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
creation but there's also that image

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.520 
creation but there's also that image
beautifully<00:01:36.390> portrayed<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> Genesis

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.069 
beautifully portrayed in the Genesis
account<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:38.189> how<00:01:39.060> God<00:01:39.390> breathed<00:01:39.930> into<00:01:40.619> Adam

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
account of how God breathed into Adam

account of how God breathed into Adam
giving<00:01:43.079> life<00:01:43.430> now<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.579> does<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.880> mean<00:01:45.740> well

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
giving life now what does that mean well

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
giving life now what does that mean well
