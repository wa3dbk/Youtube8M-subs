by the same the UI same the changes are
there<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.420> framework<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:47.760> you<00:01:48.760> have

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.320 
there in the framework and you have
Google<00:01:49.120> absolute<00:01:49.720> this<00:01:49.900> time<00:01:51.150> let<00:01:52.150> me<00:01:52.180> just

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
a Fink just hold all the edge sir

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
a Fink just hold all the edge sir
we<00:02:06.270> show<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> boudin<00:02:06.870> mission<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.800> get

we show you the boudin mission you get
with<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.220> room<00:02:18.260> as<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:19.920> see<00:02:20.100> this

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
with this room as you can see this

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.070 
with this room as you can see this
framework<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:21.000> should<00:02:21.270> change<00:02:21.510> quite<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> bit

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
framework is should change quite a bit

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:45.170 
framework is should change quite a bit
and<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> new<00:02:24.750> boot<00:02:24.900> animation

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.150 

everything<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.540> same<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:47.160> applications

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
everything is the same the applications

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.180 
everything is the same the applications
of<00:02:48.250> same<00:02:48.490> locks<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.090> also<00:02:49.240> same<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.980> a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
of same locks in is also same and just a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.800 
of same locks in is also same and just a
few<00:02:54.250> like<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.550> few<00:02:55.030> applications<00:02:55.210> have<00:02:55.690> been

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
few like a few applications have been

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.530 
few like a few applications have been
modded<00:02:56.170> up<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.560> guess<00:02:57.000> so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
modded up I guess so

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.720 
modded up I guess so
the<00:02:58.870> launcher<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.260> also<00:02:59.500> same<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.370> launchers

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
the launcher is also same the launchers
