00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.890
 in principle hello and now more or less 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.679
 I would be about seven months if you want 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.810
 I explain what the development or 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.279
 how would she be and so a little bit 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.769
 you make the idea because it seems incredible 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.569
 how tiny you can be 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.039
 also but it is that trains with traction 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.680
 Your baby can already suck his finger 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.829
 can have and is proven to have 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.840
 pain and they can see and hear that is 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.910
 see if your baby coming to the world would weigh 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.980
 more or less a kilo and a half and would have 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.899
 many possibilities that everything came out 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.539
 well thanks to the advances that there have been 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.010
 in technology next month that we 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.750
 we'll see but well I'll tell you a little bit 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.910
 in advance everything and it would be eight 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.980
 months and your baby would have almost everything 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.300
 developing what grows more in the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.699
 eighth month and what tends to 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.530
 develop fully is the brain and 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.859
 the only thing that the lungs up to the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.790
 ninth month in 35 week 36 week is 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.930
 when I would be totally 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.880
 developed 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.530
 keep in mind that babies go 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.970
 increasing in size and you will notice that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 at the end of pregnancy in the ninth month 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.930
 has less space to move so 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 you will notice that moving less is not 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.250
 nothing happens to him but the uterus or his 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 little house if it is going to be small and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 final, of course, it does not have much 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 mobility as in the beginning but it is not 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.229
 nothing bad so there is a bit for 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.820
 cent as of movements you have to 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.070
 see the day but I do not think it's going to 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.360
 move as the stimuli and have 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.970
 contact with the aie at the end when 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.430
 born normal is that despite 3 to 3 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.370
 kilitos and a half and that looks about 50 600 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.640
 more or less 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.920
 during the last trimester of pregnancy 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.140
 we can feel more nervous thinking 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.720
 on how will childbirth be in health 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.020
 of the baby and if we are going to know how to do it 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.240
 well are habitual feelings that the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.770
 best way to relativize them is 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.680
 sharing them with our beings 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.050
 dear our doctor or in the classes 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.990
 of preparation and remains you are in 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.460
 general, you are well, well, what 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.700
 only thing that happens is that I have discomfort 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.240
 in the abdomen now it's going pretty 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:18.010
 I followed swollen ankles 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.210
 hands and then also what happens to me 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.340
 is that I have many problems and many 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.380
 discomfort at bedtime not 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.090
 find a comfortable position the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.160
 tips that I will give you are very 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.870
 basic and you can help what happens 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.420
 that how uncomfortable you are not 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.370
 lock remove nothing 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.959
 then look at what is recommended in the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.940
 pregnancy is to drink more or less about two 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.459
 liters of water per day about 8 glasses of 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.260
 water then to sleep the position more 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.790
 comfortable to rest are always those of 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.440
 side cubes stretch towards the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.880
 left or to the right side 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.739
 there's always going to be a side where you 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.870
 small is better if you already know 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.310
 what is it then what you have to 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.069
 sleep and then try to incorporate the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.350
 leg of the bed a little so that 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.239
 you go all the liquid that has been 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.370
 accumulated during the day put on a 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.230
 pillow between your legs if you want and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.430
 the truth is that this retention of 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.769
 liquids would not burn to the end 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.180
 of pregnancy because everything is linked to the 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.880
 progesterone and the hormone 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.470
 pregnancy that holds liquids and here 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.900
 as we have a stock in the gut that 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.459
 prevents blood from rising upwards 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.799
 is accumulating in the legs and only 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.920
 it drains at night and it is possible that 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.150
 note as contractions if done in 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.310
 a gestational week in which you 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.080
 you find it is normal to start noticing 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.360
 contractions is to say that the gut is 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.100
 it makes you hard but painless xxi is worth 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.900
 these are braxton contractions 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.080
 hicks begin to appear from 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.340
 the 28 29 week and are typical of 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.590
 moment in which you are 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.209
 and you'll see that by taking tea drinking 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.040
 of ice cream you will miss these are the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.470
 contractions of the moment in the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.480
 that you find abertis amount as if 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.340
 I will be short of breath as if it will cost me 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.410
 breathe from the account that wave is already going 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.690
 growing you grows it and the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.970
 growing uterus pushes the diaphragm 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.680
 diaphragm rises towards the pulmonary cavity 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.180
 and what happens to the lungs has less 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.370
 space to expand and when you catch 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.959
 air is like the feeling that not 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.819
 you can expand the lungs of not 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.170
 you can inspire all this well when you 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.870
 small come to the world and you'll see how you 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.030
 pass 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.130
 if you already have any more questions or something 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.500
 I can help you because I do not think 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.870
 no all remember that we have 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.120
 pending the subject of breastfeeding to see 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.450
 what are you going to do if I still do not have very 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.800
 clear what I'm going to do in the end 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.639
 and nothing we see in him I wrote the 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.639
 stack cut
