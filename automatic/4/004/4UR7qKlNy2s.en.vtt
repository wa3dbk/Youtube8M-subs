00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey everyone its James here and we're

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.320 
hey everyone its James here and we're
going<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.179> be<00:00:03.300> looking<00:00:03.449> today<00:00:04.020> at<00:00:04.069> improving

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330 
going to be looking today at improving

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.330 
going to be looking today at improving
typography<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.560> if<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.710> see<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.010> big

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
typography and if you see this big

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.060 
typography and if you see this big
letter<00:00:08.670> A<00:00:08.790> here<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.139> called<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.410> drop<00:00:10.769> cap

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
letter A here this is called a drop cap

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.910 
letter A here this is called a drop cap
and<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.759> pushes<00:00:11.969> away<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:13.170> content<00:00:13.679> by<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
and it pushes away the content by the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.410 
and it pushes away the content by the
right<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.400> from<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> bottom<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.179> way<00:00:15.269> we

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
right and from the bottom and the way we

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.290 
right and from the bottom and the way we
achieve<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.410> by<00:00:16.470> floating<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.760> single

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
achieve this is by floating that single

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.170 
achieve this is by floating that single
letter<00:00:18.539> using<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.350> class<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.640> i'll<00:00:20.939> show<00:00:21.119> you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
letter using a class so i'll show you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.570 
letter using a class so i'll show you
how<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.289> there's<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.340> bit<00:00:23.519> of

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
how to do that and there's a bit of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.429 
how to do that and there's a bit of
padding<00:00:23.789> involved<00:00:24.689> there<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.260> pushing

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
padding involved there so it's pushing

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.900 
padding involved there so it's pushing
out<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> right<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.519> pushing<00:00:26.670> out

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
out to the right and it's pushing out

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.460 
out to the right and it's pushing out
from<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> bottom<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.539> I've<00:00:27.689> also<00:00:27.840> specified

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
from the bottom and I've also specified

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
from the bottom and I've also specified
a<00:00:28.500> line<00:00:28.859> height<00:00:29.220> which<00:00:29.460> helps<00:00:29.789> us<00:00:29.880> achieve<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
a line height which helps us achieve the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.950 
a line height which helps us achieve the
effect<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:32.730> demonstrate<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> drop<00:00:33.719> cap

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
effect to demonstrate the drop cap

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.380 
effect to demonstrate the drop cap
effect<00:00:34.500> i'll<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:34.980> adding<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.550> drop<00:00:35.700> cap<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.239> this

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
effect i'll be adding a drop cap to this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
effect i'll be adding a drop cap to this
paragraph<00:00:36.870> which<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.410> an<00:00:37.530> inside<00:00:37.920> and

if you're watching this on youtube and
show<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.379> how<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.620> make<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> effects<00:00:51.649> so

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
show you how to make the effects so

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.170 
show you how to make the effects so
we'll<00:00:52.800> take<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> look<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.370> code<00:00:53.610> view<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
we'll take a look in code view and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.670 
we'll take a look in code view and
you'll<00:00:54.360> note<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> simple<00:00:55.020> paragraph

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680

you'll note so I have a simple paragraph
and<00:00:55.949> there's<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> tee<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.270> letter<00:00:57.719> T<00:00:58.050> which<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and there's a tee a letter T which is

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.439 
and there's a tee a letter T which is
the<00:00:58.620> T<00:00:58.890> i'm<00:00:59.070> using<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> example<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the T i'm using for the example and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
the T i'm using for the example and
there's<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> span<00:01:01.050> class<00:01:01.410> wrapped<00:01:02.039> around<00:01:02.399> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
there's a span class wrapped around it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.299 
there's a span class wrapped around it
called<00:01:03.449> drop<00:01:03.750> cap<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.769> we're<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> make

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
called drop cap so we're going to make

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.910 
called drop cap so we're going to make
the<00:01:05.580> drop<00:01:05.909> cap<00:01:06.270> class<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.799> call

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the drop cap class now and you can call

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 
the drop cap class now and you can call
this<00:01:08.070> whatever<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.270> called<00:01:09.570> a

this whatever you want but it's called a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.120 
this whatever you want but it's called a
drop<00:01:09.900> cap<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.439> that's<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:10.890> i'm<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
drop cap so that's what i'm going to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.020 
drop cap so that's what i'm going to
call<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.729> drop<00:01:12.360> cap<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.850> open<00:01:14.850> curly

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
call it so drop cap and open curly

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
call it so drop cap and open curly
brackets<00:01:15.479> close<00:01:15.750> curly<00:01:16.080> brackets<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> we'll

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
brackets close curly brackets and we'll

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.840 
brackets close curly brackets and we'll
put<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> code<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.939> center<00:01:19.640> okay<00:01:20.640> now

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
put the code in the center okay now

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.510 
put the code in the center okay now
whatever<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.570> attach<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.110> class<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.710> it's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
whatever we attach this class to it's

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.060 
whatever we attach this class to it's
going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> float<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.450> element<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.979> this

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
going to float the element so we in this

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.010 
going to float the element so we in this
case<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> float<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.210> particular

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
case we want it to float a particular

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.569 
case we want it to float a particular
letter<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.710> we're<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> type<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> float

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
letter so we're going to type in float

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.120 
letter so we're going to type in float
coat<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.630> its<00:01:30.750> float<00:01:30.990> left<00:01:31.320> put<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
coat on and we want its float left put a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.190 
coat on and we want its float left put a
semicolon<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> end<00:01:33.119> I'm<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> change

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
semicolon on the end I'm going to change

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
semicolon on the end I'm going to change
the<00:01:34.350> text<00:01:34.680> color<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> sort<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> purple<00:01:36.090> color
