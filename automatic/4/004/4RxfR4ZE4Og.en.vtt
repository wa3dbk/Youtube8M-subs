00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
glass as a telltale sign also you can

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.610 
glass as a telltale sign also you can
see<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.879> glass<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.149> raised<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> top

of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> watch<00:00:59.480> it<00:01:00.480> shouldn't<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.930> glass

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
of the watch it shouldn't be glass

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
of the watch it shouldn't be glass
anyway<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> shouldn't<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.309> any<00:01:02.550> color<00:01:02.850> at

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
anyway you shouldn't have any color at

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.609 
anyway you shouldn't have any color at
all<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.690> definitely<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> be

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
all and it's definitely not going to be

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.000 
all and it's definitely not going to be
raised<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.430> Breitling<00:01:06.350> last<00:01:07.350> thing<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
raised if it's a Breitling last thing of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.510 
raised if it's a Breitling last thing of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
course you can look at the movement and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.060 
course you can look at the movement and
you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:12.479> see<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.140> let<00:01:13.530> me<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.830> into

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you can see the let me get that into

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.440 
you can see the let me get that into

got a red stem and that is supposed to
be<00:01:47.689> a<00:01:47.719> chronometer<00:01:48.079> not<00:01:48.649> an<00:01:48.799> actual<00:01:49.130> second

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
be a chronometer not an actual second

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.749 
be a chronometer not an actual second
hand<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:50.530> that's<00:01:51.530> actually<00:01:51.950> not<00:01:52.399> supposed<00:01:52.549> to

be<00:01:52.909> moving<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.960> Breitling<00:01:54.350> movement<00:01:54.799> is<00:01:55.039> very

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
be moving the Breitling movement is very

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.289 
be moving the Breitling movement is very
precise

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
precise

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.980 
precise
it<00:01:56.450> doesn't<00:01:56.929> need<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.080> second<00:01:57.500> hand<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.990> that's

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
it doesn't need a second hand and that's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.969 
it doesn't need a second hand and that's
what<00:02:00.170> you're<00:02:00.289> looking<00:02:00.319> at<00:02:00.560> right<00:02:00.619> there<00:02:00.830> you

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
can see the second hands on each of

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.080 
can see the second hands on each of
those<00:02:02.890> moving<00:02:03.890> what<00:02:04.069> they<00:02:04.189> do<00:02:04.250> look<00:02:04.700> very<00:02:04.759> very

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
those moving what they do look very very

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.779 
those moving what they do look very very
nice<00:02:05.450> but<00:02:06.289> if<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.409> really<00:02:06.860> want<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.399> step<00:02:07.579> it

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
nice but if you really want to step it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.600 
nice but if you really want to step it
up<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:09.349> know<00:02:09.470> represent<00:02:09.679> Breitling<00:02:10.399> then

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
up and you know represent Breitling then

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.729 
up and you know represent Breitling then
just<00:02:11.530> spend<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> money<00:02:12.829> get<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.790> real<00:02:13.970> thing

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
just spend the money get the real thing

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.770 
just spend the money get the real thing
that's<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.920> brother

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.440 

movement<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.590> precise<00:02:20.540> has<00:02:21.540> world<00:02:21.900> time<00:02:23.450> you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
movement is precise has world time you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.510 
movement is precise has world time you
can<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.810> looks<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.830> lot<00:02:26.070> like<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.490> other

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
can see looks a lot like the other

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.370 
can see looks a lot like the other
watches<00:02:27.920> there's<00:02:28.920> another<00:02:29.220> one<00:02:30.110> but<00:02:31.110> when<00:02:31.260> you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
watches there's another one but when you

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.970 
watches there's another one but when you
put<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> Fugazi's<00:02:32.430> next<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.940> real<00:02:33.120> thing

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
put the Fugazi's next to the real thing

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.480 
put the Fugazi's next to the real thing
there's<00:02:34.980> really<00:02:35.160> no<00:02:35.400> comparison<00:02:37.280> again<00:02:38.280> I'll

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
there's really no comparison again I'll

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.510 
there's really no comparison again I'll
show<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.000> glass<00:02:39.860> or<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.010> crystal

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
show you that glass or that crystal

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.790 
show you that glass or that crystal
basically<00:02:42.060> has<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:42.990> little<00:02:43.260> bit<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.500> glare<00:02:43.740> on

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
basically has a little bit of a glare on

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890 
basically has a little bit of a glare on
it<00:02:44.100> but<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.460> can<00:02:44.490> see<00:02:44.820> right<00:02:45.000> there<00:02:45.030> it's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
it but you can see right there it's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.980 
it but you can see right there it's
really<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.320> raised<00:02:46.680> off<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.130> watch<00:02:47.340> at<00:02:47.640> all

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
really not raised off to watch at all

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.930 
really not raised off to watch at all
but<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.170> if<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.830> stand<00:02:50.100> outside<00:02:50.280> that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
but the if you stand outside that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.630 
but the if you stand outside that
crystal<00:02:51.390> will<00:02:51.510> actually<00:02:51.840> disappear<00:02:52.640> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
crystal will actually disappear the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.540 
crystal will actually disappear the
steel<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.840> watch<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.290> much<00:02:55.590> heavier<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
steel the watch is much heavier the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.390 
steel the watch is much heavier the
steel<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> surgical<00:02:57.810> steel<00:02:58.400> surgical
