00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.200 
of the better drawings I've ever done so
that's<00:00:31.710> cool<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> only<00:00:32.340> problem<00:00:32.700> i<00:00:32.880> would

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
that's cool the only problem i would

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.650 
that's cool the only problem i would
definitely<00:00:33.989> change<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:35.180> one<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> pens

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
definitely change is one of the pens

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.000 
definitely change is one of the pens
because<00:00:37.140> i<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.320> using<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:37.860> different

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
because i was using like three different

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.940 
because i was using like three different
pens<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> pens<00:00:39.149> bled<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> start

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
pens one of the pens bled when I start

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.000 
pens one of the pens bled when I start
painting<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.540> something<00:00:42.780> that

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
painting it and that is something that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.549 
painting it and that is something that
sucks<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.910> kind<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.239> changed<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> color<00:00:46.469> of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
sucks so it kind of changed the color of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.979 
sucks so it kind of changed the color of
it<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.010> not<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> worry<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.329> how<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.719> ends

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it but not to worry I know how this ends

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.630 
it but not to worry I know how this ends
it<00:00:49.350> ends<00:00:49.890> okay<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.840> um<00:00:52.100> better<00:00:53.100> than<00:00:53.280> okay<00:00:53.430> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it ends okay so um better than okay I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.889 
it ends okay so um better than okay I
think<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.120> ends<00:00:54.390> rather<00:00:54.809> good<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:56.690> this<00:00:57.690> isn't

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
