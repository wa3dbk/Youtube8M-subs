months into the game the fact that i got

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.370 
months into the game the fact that i got
that<00:01:43.390> it's<00:01:43.539> pretty<00:01:43.719> impressive<00:01:43.929> in<00:01:44.259> my

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
that it's pretty impressive in my

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.700 
that it's pretty impressive in my
opinion<00:01:44.710> that's<00:01:45.340> just<00:01:45.579> me<00:01:45.729> uh<00:01:46.409> yeah<00:01:47.409> i'll<00:01:47.530> have

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
this video wandering all my sensitivity

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.700 
this video wandering all my sensitivity
as<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.939> is<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.749> problem<00:02:07.960> this<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.290> that<00:02:08.560> it's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
as this is the problem this is that it's

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.160 
as this is the problem this is that it's
a<00:02:08.800> really<00:02:09.040> a<00:02:09.130> personal<00:02:09.640> thing<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.390> you

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
a really a personal thing and you

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.080 
a really a personal thing and you
shouldn't<00:02:11.470> use<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> sensitivity<00:02:12.400> just<00:02:12.820> because

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
shouldn't use a sensitivity just because

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.840 
shouldn't use a sensitivity just because
somebody<00:02:13.540> else

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
somebody else

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.880 
somebody else
is<00:02:13.910> using<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> doesn't<00:02:15.200> necessarily<00:02:15.710> mean

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
is using it doesn't necessarily mean

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.140 
is using it doesn't necessarily mean
you're<00:02:16.040> going<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> be<00:02:16.340> doing<00:02:16.490> good<00:02:16.790> with<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
you're going to be doing good with that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.450 
you're going to be doing good with that
so<00:02:17.870> that's<00:02:18.050> just<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.830> know<00:02:18.950> what<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.400> think

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
so that's just you know what I think

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.170 
so that's just you know what I think
about<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:22.850> use<00:02:22.970> whatever

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
about that so so just use whatever

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.210 
about that so so just use whatever
sensitivity<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.260> want<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.530> use<00:02:24.650> really<00:02:24.920> it's

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
sensitivity you want to use really it's

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.110 
sensitivity you want to use really it's
up<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:25.910> not<00:02:26.060> up<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.300> other<00:02:26.960> people
