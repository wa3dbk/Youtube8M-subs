00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.330 
everyone have the same kill streaks and
that<00:02:55.900> would<00:02:55.990> be<00:02:56.050> kind<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.260> boring<00:02:56.440> right<00:02:56.770> like

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340

cod4<00:02:57.760> cut<00:02:58.060> five<00:02:58.270> I<00:02:58.800> think<00:02:59.800> it's<00:03:00.040> better<00:03:00.250> that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.790 
cod4 cut five I think it's better that

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800
