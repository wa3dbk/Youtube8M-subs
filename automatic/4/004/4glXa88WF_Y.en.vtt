well<00:00:02.490> there's<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.700> variety<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:03.179> coatings

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:03.630 
well there's a variety of coatings

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.240 
well there's a variety of coatings
involved<00:00:04.170> here<00:00:04.319> we<00:00:04.470> start<00:00:04.710> with<00:00:04.770> piston

this<00:01:39.329> nose<00:01:39.540> mobile<00:01:39.899> we<00:01:40.049> build<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.439> good

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
this nose mobile we build a really good

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.200 
this nose mobile we build a really good
automobile<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> produce<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.640> 700

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
automobile to produce like 700

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.539 
automobile to produce like 700
horsepower<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.810> about<00:01:43.130> 650<00:01:44.130> pounds<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
horsepower and about 650 pounds of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.279 
horsepower and about 650 pounds of
torque<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.539> we<00:01:45.659> tore<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.930> engine

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
torque and then we tore the engine

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.440 
torque and then we tore the engine
totally<00:01:46.649> apart<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.159> sent<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> parts<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
totally apart I sent all the parts and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.830 
totally apart I sent all the parts and
pieces<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.840> Leonard<00:01:49.140> he<00:01:49.890> turned<00:01:50.130> around<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
pieces to Leonard he turned around and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.600 
pieces to Leonard he turned around and
totally<00:01:51.840> cleaned<00:01:52.110> everything<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:53.310> coated

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
totally cleaned everything and we coated

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
totally cleaned everything and we coated
every<00:01:54.030> single<00:01:54.450> moving<00:01:54.719> part<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.229> engine

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
every single moving part in that engine

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
every single moving part in that engine
all<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> way<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:56.189> camshaft<00:01:56.759> crankshaft

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
all the way from camshaft crankshaft

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.599 
all the way from camshaft crankshaft
aluminum<00:01:57.840> rods<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.890> did<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> valves<00:01:59.490> we

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
aluminum rods we did the valves we

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:00.980 
aluminum rods we did the valves we
coated<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> heads<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.450> go<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> intake

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
coated the heads we go to the intake

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620 
coated the heads we go to the intake
manifold<00:02:01.500> inside<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.520> top<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.149> bottom<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
manifold inside out top and bottom and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.309 
manifold inside out top and bottom and
we<00:02:04.619> picked<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.420> 51<00:02:06.770> related<00:02:07.770> horsepower<00:02:08.430> Wow

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
we picked up 51 related horsepower Wow

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.630 
we picked up 51 related horsepower Wow
the<00:02:10.319> thing<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.769> this<00:02:11.009> build<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.459> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the thing about this build you have to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.309 
the thing about this build you have to
realize<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.209> look<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.959> kind<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
realize I look at that kind of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.480 
realize I look at that kind of
horsepower

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
horsepower

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.420 
horsepower
as<00:02:14.640> free<00:02:15.510> horsepower<00:02:15.960> even<00:02:16.680> though<00:02:16.800> there<00:02:17.190> is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
as free horsepower even though there is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.890 
as free horsepower even though there is
a<00:02:17.460> cost<00:02:17.850> then<00:02:18.240> there<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.570> an<00:02:18.720> application

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
a cost then there is an application

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140 
a cost then there is an application
procedure<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.950> all<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.520> goes<00:02:20.700> into<00:02:20.730> this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
procedure and all that goes into this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.180 
procedure and all that goes into this
but<00:02:21.390> once<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.960> have<00:02:22.050> built<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.590> maximum

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
but once you have built the maximum

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.210 
but once you have built the maximum
engine<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.990> can<00:02:25.170> build<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.710> then<00:02:26.130> you

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
engine that you can build and then you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.860 
engine that you can build and then you
go<00:02:26.370> ahead<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.850> apply<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.120> CODIS<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.780> get

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
go ahead and apply this CODIS and get

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.270 
go ahead and apply this CODIS and get
another<00:02:28.050> fifty<00:02:28.380> one<00:02:28.500> horsepower<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:29.130> like<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
another fifty one horsepower it's like a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.610 
another fifty one horsepower it's like a
gift
