right I think that's the Allan gvl for a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.139 
right I think that's the Allan gvl for a
great<00:02:08.250> value<00:02:08.489> luxury<00:02:09.269> and

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
yeah well blame would arguably it's

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.970 
yeah well blame would arguably it's

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.740 

but<00:05:20.050> when<00:05:20.919> you<00:05:21.040> put<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.550> in<00:05:21.639> person<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.480> lever

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
but when you put it in person the lever

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.870 
but when you put it in person the lever
kind<00:05:23.050> of<00:05:23.139> bounces<00:05:23.620> back<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:24.070> neutral<00:05:24.400> anyway

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
kind of bounces back to neutral anyway

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.409 
kind of bounces back to neutral anyway
but<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:26.050> gear<00:05:26.290> let's<00:05:26.860> just<00:05:27.180> what<00:05:28.180> its<00:05:28.300> gonna

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
but the gear let's just what its gonna

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:39.320 
but the gear let's just what its gonna
have<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.810> try<00:05:29.229> I<00:05:29.760> don't<00:05:30.760> know<00:05:31.740> okay<00:05:32.740> its<00:05:32.860> first

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.650 

okay<00:05:40.620> where<00:05:41.620> are<00:05:41.680> we<00:05:41.770> going<00:05:42.070> right<00:05:42.660> right

let's rip this it all are levitated up

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.450 
let's rip this it all are levitated up
to<00:06:22.180> 15<00:06:22.719> does<00:06:23.289> everything<00:06:23.560> that<00:06:23.710> do<00:06:24.189> Tigers

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
to 15 does everything that do Tigers

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.989 
to 15 does everything that do Tigers
gonna<00:06:24.849> work<00:06:24.999> very<00:06:25.210> slowly<00:06:25.590> yeah<00:06:26.879> we're<00:06:27.879> gonna
