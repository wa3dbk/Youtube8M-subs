00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.789
 hello last week i like to try 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.309
 make a piñata and for those who do not know 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:15.190
 a piñata is a base made of paper 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.439
 made to place candy inside more or 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.960
 less well and they are normally used in the 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.940
 children's party and sometimes in the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.740
 adults that the piñata is supposed to 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.110
 they should flip with a stick although 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.110
 Sometimes things just happen like these 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.390
 do not 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 and that was the story of how I became 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.960
 this scar a little sad 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 Well first of all I'll show you how 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.400
 it was my pineapple is ready 321 is it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.350
 well I also want to learn how to do 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.480
 piñatas and you and me if you first thing 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.030
 you have to do is inflate a blog without 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 yes clear yes yes 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.320
 the money 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.610
 now 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.220
 and almost already almost 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.560
 Everything is true 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.060
 like there is something hard 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.610
 for fear the tutorial 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.610
 she waits but do not go 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 the next step is to make paste of 15 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.240
 knots which is certainly a tutorial a 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.240
 simple tutorial and it did not work out I'm silly 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.650
 better let's talk about children's parties 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.119
 they have never asked what it is that 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.640
 it happens when they break the piñata 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.500
 obviously when breaking the street the sweets 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.830
 and that is the decisive moment of the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.830
 children 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.880
 and the sweets are for children 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.629
 give me light 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.360
 and that 's the story of how I won my 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.340
 chocolate I enjoyed it so much good today 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.040
 we learned how to make a piñata 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.330
 get a beautiful chocolate and without 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.069
 no single problem good 3 or 4 good 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.750
 if you really want to make a piñata 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.569
 remember to try to do the best 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.569
 possible because if you do not stay like this 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.300
