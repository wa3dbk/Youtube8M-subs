00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.240 

I'm<00:00:00.089> talking<00:00:00.810> about<00:00:00.870> pads<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:02.340> tampons

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.490 

so<00:00:31.360> let's<00:00:32.360> get<00:00:32.509> started<00:00:32.570> one<00:00:33.110> thing<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.350> want

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
so let's get started one thing you want

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.410 
so let's get started one thing you want
to<00:00:33.530> remember<00:00:33.590> about<00:00:34.100> pads<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:34.610> tampons<00:00:35.000> is

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
to remember about pads and tampons is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.240 
to remember about pads and tampons is
that<00:00:35.960> they<00:00:36.110> are<00:00:36.140> very<00:00:36.320> different<00:00:37.809> um<00:00:39.760> or<00:00:40.760> a

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
that they are very different um or a

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.660 
that they are very different um or a
tampon<00:00:43.250> now<00:00:44.180> tampons<00:00:44.780> are<00:00:45.230> pretty<00:00:45.800> small<00:00:46.550> as

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
tampon now tampons are pretty small as

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.270 
tampon now tampons are pretty small as
you<00:00:46.760> can<00:00:46.910> see<00:00:47.090> they're<00:00:47.620> smaller<00:00:48.620> compared<00:00:49.129> to

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
you can see they're smaller compared to

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.250 
you can see they're smaller compared to
a<00:00:49.360> pad<00:00:50.440> but<00:00:51.519> the<00:00:52.519> good<00:00:52.699> thing<00:00:52.760> about<00:00:52.970> a<00:00:53.449> tampon

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
a pad but the good thing about a tampon

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.990 
a pad but the good thing about a tampon
is<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:54.800> it's<00:00:54.949> small<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:55.460> can<00:00:55.640> put<00:00:55.879> this

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
is that it's small you can put this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.469 
is that it's small you can put this
easily<00:00:56.629> in<00:00:57.080> your<00:00:57.470> purse<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:59.120> carry<00:00:59.330> it

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
easily in your purse and carry it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.630 
easily in your purse and carry it
wherever<00:00:59.629> you<00:00:59.839> need<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.460> difference

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
wherever you need to and the difference

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.820 
wherever you need to and the difference
between<00:01:02.049> pads<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:03.379> tampons<00:01:03.949> are<00:01:04.850> that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
between pads and tampons are that

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.450 
between pads and tampons are that
typically<00:01:06.830> cats<00:01:07.610> can<00:01:08.150> hold<00:01:08.390> more<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.460> tampons

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
typically cats can hold more and tampons

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.640 
typically cats can hold more and tampons
do<00:01:10.760> not<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.040> should<00:01:13.280> change<00:01:13.610> your

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
do not it but you should change your

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.320 
do not it but you should change your
hair<00:01:15.650> or<00:01:16.189> tampon<00:01:16.970> whenever<00:01:18.909> you<00:01:19.909> know<00:01:20.030> is

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
hair or tampon whenever you know is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.560 
hair or tampon whenever you know is
getting<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:21.290> be<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.530> bit<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.960> fool<00:01:25.570> seriously

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
getting to be a bit to fool seriously

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.810 
getting to be a bit to fool seriously
you<00:01:27.049> know<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.259> don't<00:01:27.500> want<00:01:27.679> to<00:01:27.740> be<00:01:28.070> saturated

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
you know you don't want to be saturated

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.340 
you know you don't want to be saturated
so<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.479> have<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:29.810> change<00:01:30.079> them<00:01:30.520> when<00:01:31.520> needed

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
so you have to change them when needed

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.109 
so you have to change them when needed
typically<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.560> says<00:01:33.770> change<00:01:34.219> every<00:01:34.789> four<00:01:35.090> to

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
typically it says change every four to

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.700 
typically it says change every four to
eight<00:01:35.390> hours<00:01:35.420> but<00:01:36.109> in<00:01:36.859> around<00:01:37.310> our<00:01:37.820> too<00:01:38.710> kind

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
eight hours but in around our too kind

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.010 
eight hours but in around our too kind
it's<00:01:40.249> kind<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.549> becoming<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:41.030> little<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:42.049> know

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
it's kind of becoming a little you know

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.950 
it's kind of becoming a little you know
saturated<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.679> should<00:01:45.859> change<00:01:46.070> them<00:01:46.960> one

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
saturated you should change them one

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.109 
saturated you should change them one
thing<00:01:48.109> to<00:01:48.140> remember<00:01:48.289> though<00:01:48.679> since<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:49.999> know

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
thing to remember though since you know

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.090 
thing to remember though since you know
usually<00:01:50.359> we<00:01:50.749> have<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:50.929> tampon<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:51.859> can't

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
usually we have a tampon in you can't

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.789 
usually we have a tampon in you can't
really<00:01:52.249> feel<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:52.939> kind<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.329> sometimes<00:01:54.289> may

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
really feel it you kind of sometimes may

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.499 
really feel it you kind of sometimes may
forget<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:55.340> you're<00:01:55.490> wearing<00:01:55.670> one<00:01:55.939> but

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
remember to change them because if you

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.710 
remember to change them because if you
leave<00:01:59.479> them<00:01:59.600> in<00:01:59.749> too<00:01:59.869> long<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.499> can't<00:02:00.770> get

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720
