00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.430
 for from our merger q pasta with meat 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.980
 then what we are going to do is stew 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.070
 first the meat of the reel that I have 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.010
 here already chopped a medium onion a 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.589
 green pepper half red pepper two 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 garlic cloves and we have prepared the 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.280
 white wine measure 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.260
 well we light our pot we put 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.119
 the fry menu and as soon as the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.940
 hot oil what we're going to do 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.940
 will be to throw the meat to brown 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.670
 and I lie and let you collect salpimentado 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.920
 color to throw the vegetables over 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.899
 that the flesh has taken color 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.429
 over our vegetables and let's leave 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.429
 for we chatted a little 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.580
 and we go around and we're going to let 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.550
 pose 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.110
 every point has also added a 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.110
 green chilli 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.960
 now that we see that the onion is 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.960
 being already transparent 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.610
 let's add a chopped tomatito 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.610
 we go around 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.540
 and we let two mix well 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 flavors 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.860
 so much 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.650
 and we add the measure of white wine 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.110
 we give it a few laps and what we are going to 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.960
 do is let it boil a little 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.049
 to evaporate the alcohol we close the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.930
 pot we canceled the bad fry and 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.860
 we will put stew menu with the valve in 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.860
 closed position 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.000
 as soon as I finish in the pot we cancel 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.229
 the depressurized menu we open it and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.060
 we are going to add 400 grams of pasta 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.060
 this case I am macaroni 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.830
 an envelope of saffron to give them that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.830
 little yellow 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.130
 and stock cube broth 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.130
 meat 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.240
 we give it a few laps 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.830
 and we will not cover with water 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:48.170
 that I already have previously heated 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.790
 so we saved ourselves a little time in 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.500
 that the pot has to heat and the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.100
 we cure a little more 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.930
 that's how we cover them 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:04.879
 without reaching top of everything 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.280
 we take a few turns so we close the pot 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.420
 closed exposure valve and we're going to 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.420
 put me in a paste 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.670
 well just whistle we canceled the menu and 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.670
 let's slowly depressurize 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.110
 well as below the valve we already 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.620
 we have expressed we canceled the menu 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.620
 we open 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:55.980
 and here is the result 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.980
 we take a turn to be strong 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.610

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.380
