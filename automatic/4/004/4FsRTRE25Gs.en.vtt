00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.009
 almost everything is ready for us 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.010
 to start collecting fiber during 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.460
 left here such leaves to tie even 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.519
 with they are not difficult we start with these 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.500
 orange lights knit 3 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.500
 air loops then do 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:30.599
 lush column here this last 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:37.320
 loop 1 3 well, probably 4 closing 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:50.730
 the top one two three 4 5 and again too 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:01:01.680
 at most two three four possible and 5 solution 3 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:02.550
 4 5 6 pull in a lush column 3 4 5 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 I'll try 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.030
 she doesn't have to be everything exactly 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.700
 and symmetrically in this is just interesting 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:22.409
 it is a little reminiscent of paintings picasa 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:25.850
 or other avant-gardists 45 if 5 will 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.579
 more circular so knob in the middle 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.579
 wichita 4 slightly oblong 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:53.440
 not confused. and finish three four 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.350
 air five must now be cut 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.920
 here is the chain that we got 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:09.720
 here it will be the middle we start as 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:19.660
 always with the edge just by the columns without 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:24.540
 Nakida first, this is beautifully necessary 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.130
 respect the berry so that it does not charm 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.830
 some 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:35.860
 strings from the main mass and then for 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.350
 so that we will not have this notch 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:46.420
 already move on with double crochet and 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:51.520
 align our line that's how it is 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.800
 it turns out when we reach the next 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:00.780
 berries go to the posts without nakida 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.780
 here you can do it now 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.989
 somewhat hooking is not it than later 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.160
 also a few but others and then 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.739
 preserved and and solid view here we are 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.989
 go back to the double crochet 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:26.050
 I'll show you how it turns out 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.910
 this is the first row here this first row here 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.970
 double crochet went 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.450
 and here without nakida here again some 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.820
 the signs 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.489
 here we have already turned out middle 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.900
 those double crochets here and here 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.780
 bars without sc and do povorotik 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.600
 start knitting with crochets 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.850
 so we had a narrow here and here 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.940
 apparently added bars snaps 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.980
 there and again without nakida turns out such 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.170
 leaflet end commit it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.540
 or than brown or black 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:09.680
 and here is such an interesting detail to ready for 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.350
 work well that's what we did 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.950
 left to trim 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:19.700
 can be black can be dark brown in 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:24.170
 This case is dark brown bollards 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:29.410
 without single row 1 and one more element 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.410
 ready here so she drives
