00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.889
 fillers to lose weight remember 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.269
 this little word is a little bit 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.610
 different from those we saw the week 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.289

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.869

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.689
 description of this video so you can see 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.220
 the top 5 that we saw last week 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.650
 all the foods that we are going to see in 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.289
 this top 10 have something in common the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.810
 volume of them is impressive by the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.030
 caloric amount that you're eating from 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.469
 this food like this helps you 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.540
 when you are in the most difficult process 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.230
 to lose weight when you have very high 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.140
 magazines in low calorie ranges 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.480
 those foods fill your stomach with a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.670
 awesome way for not many 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.640
 calories when consuming it then it helps you 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.949
 to go through that stage of weight loss 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.289

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.739
 suffering and it becomes much much more 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.449

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.070
 now that I start thinking if all 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.469
 these foods have the same 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.200
 characteristic and there's not much of that 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.210
 talk about each of them 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.590
 let's not make this a little bit different 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.689
 three the apples the grapefruit the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.009
 lettuce the cauliflower and herb with the 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.409
 integral mobile watermelon cucumber 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.220
 mushrooms and water but citizen of 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.220
 the formal line 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.870
