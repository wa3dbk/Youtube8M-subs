I<00:00:04.910> got<00:00:05.910> this<00:00:06.089> far<00:00:06.330> with<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.779> rake<00:00:07.580> I'm<00:00:08.580> gonna

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.200 
I got this far with the rake I'm gonna
have<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.940> rake<00:00:09.090> again<00:00:09.389> because<00:00:11.000> most<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
have to rake again because most of the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.770 
have to rake again because most of the
trees<00:00:12.389> still<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.809> leaves<00:00:14.509> this<00:00:15.509> first

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
trees still have leaves this first

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.650 
trees still have leaves this first
raking<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.789> basically<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.119> smooth<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
raking was basically to smooth out the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.179 
raking was basically to smooth out the
path<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.410> all<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> sticks<00:00:19.830> out<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
path and get all the sticks out of the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.929 
path and get all the sticks out of the
way<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.470> after<00:00:22.470> all<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.769> leaves<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.130> off<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
way so after all the leaves are off the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.300 
way so after all the leaves are off the
trees<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.710> ground<00:00:25.830> then<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:26.189> go
