00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.370 

all<00:00:00.960> right<00:00:01.170> so<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.620> build<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.890> boat

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
all right so I'm going to build the boat

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.730 
all right so I'm going to build the boat
everything<00:00:04.380> starts<00:00:05.009> out<00:00:05.160> with<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.460> cube

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
everything starts out with the cube

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.759 
everything starts out with the cube
going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.799> hold<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.040> X<00:00:08.220> key<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:09.530> snap<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
going to hold the X key and snap to the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.560 
going to hold the X key and snap to the
grid<00:00:13.700> and<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:16.139> idea<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:17.150> to<00:00:18.150> keep<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.539> simple

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
grid and the idea is to keep it simple

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.910 
grid and the idea is to keep it simple
as<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.470> go<00:00:19.650> as<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:21.750> most<00:00:21.930> important<00:00:22.439> thing<00:00:22.650> is

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
as you go as the most important thing is

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.099 
as you go as the most important thing is
to<00:00:23.039> keep<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.340> simple<00:00:23.600> so<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:25.050> to

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
to keep it simple so I'm going to go to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.750 
to keep it simple so I'm going to go to
face<00:00:25.830> mode<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:27.769> I'm<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.099> shrink<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
face mode and I'm going to shrink the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.900 
face mode and I'm going to shrink the
front<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:31.340> move<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> forward<00:00:34.730> grab<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
front of it move it forward grab the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.660 
front of it move it forward grab the
back<00:00:38.660> face<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.129> then<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> switch

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
back face and then I'm going to switch

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.690 
back face and then I'm going to switch
to<00:00:41.969> rotation<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.190> shape<00:00:44.489> this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
to rotation and I'm going to shape this

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.830 
to rotation and I'm going to shape this
out<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:46.129> close<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.690> an

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
out as close as I can get it to an

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.709 
out as close as I can get it to an
actual<00:00:49.170> boat<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:50.420> I<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.770> I'm<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
actual boat as I can I'm going to go to

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:02.860 
actual boat as I can I'm going to go to
vertex<00:00:54.719> mode

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.130 

and<00:01:02.960> just<00:01:03.800> scale<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.160> and<00:01:04.850> what<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:05.480> do<00:01:05.660> is<00:01:05.930> you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
and just scale it and what you do is you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.030 
and just scale it and what you do is you
manipulate<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.830> geometry<00:01:07.400> as<00:01:08.740> far<00:01:09.740> as<00:01:09.890> you

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
manipulate the geometry as far as you

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.210 
manipulate the geometry as far as you
can<00:01:11.229> before<00:01:12.229> adding<00:01:12.890> anything<00:01:13.430> else<00:01:15.190> so<00:01:16.190> I

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
can before adding anything else so I

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.890 
can before adding anything else so I
think<00:01:16.370> I've<00:01:16.670> hit<00:01:16.820> that<00:01:17.030> point<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.450> don't<00:01:17.660> think

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
think I've hit that point I don't think

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.900 
think I've hit that point I don't think
I<00:01:18.020> can<00:01:18.200> manipulate<00:01:18.440> this<00:01:18.890> any<00:01:19.130> further

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
I can manipulate this any further

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.810 
I can manipulate this any further
maybe<00:01:20.479> just<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.900> little<00:01:20.979> now<00:01:21.979> one<00:01:22.250> little<00:01:22.460> tip

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
maybe just a little now one little tip

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.730 
maybe just a little now one little tip
to<00:01:22.850> keep<00:01:23.270> things<00:01:23.510> symmetrical<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.260> don't<00:01:24.530> use

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
to keep things symmetrical I don't use

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
to keep things symmetrical I don't use
the<00:01:24.920> move<00:01:25.130> tool<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.700> use<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.420> scale<00:01:26.720> tool<00:01:27.760> this

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
the move tool I use the scale tool this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:38.260 
the move tool I use the scale tool this
keeps<00:01:29.090> things<00:01:29.420> nice<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.200> symmetrical<00:01:37.270> okay

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
keeps things nice and symmetrical okay

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.120 
keeps things nice and symmetrical okay
now<00:01:38.479> I'm<00:01:38.570> going<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.780> add<00:01:38.899> geometry<00:01:39.229> there's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
now I'm going to add geometry there's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.859 
now I'm going to add geometry there's
two<00:01:40.430> ways<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.970> want<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.479> add<00:01:41.600> geometry

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
two ways I want you to add geometry

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.870 
two ways I want you to add geometry
number<00:01:42.560> one<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:44.020> with<00:01:45.020> either<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.100> extrude

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
number one is with either the extrude

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.420 
number one is with either the extrude
tool<00:01:46.910> or<00:01:47.390> number<00:01:47.840> two<00:01:48.050> with<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.500> insert<00:01:49.220> edge

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
tool or number two with the insert edge

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.030 
tool or number two with the insert edge
loop<00:01:49.460> tool<00:01:50.350> I'm<00:01:51.350> going<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.530> use<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.710> insert

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
loop tool I'm going to use the insert

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.930 
loop tool I'm going to use the insert
edge<00:01:52.280> loop<00:01:52.310> tool<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:57.310> then<00:01:59.350> model<00:02:00.940> using

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
edge loop tool and then model using

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.460 
edge loop tool and then model using
scale<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.840> move<00:02:03.140> or<00:02:03.320> rotate<00:02:04.990> go<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.050> go<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.259> edge

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
scale or move or rotate go to go to edge

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.260 
scale or move or rotate go to go to edge
mode

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.660 

and<00:02:13.620> I'm<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.800> insert<00:02:15.100> another<00:02:15.220> edge

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and I'm going to insert another edge

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:27.790 
and I'm going to insert another edge
loop<00:02:16.500> scale<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:21.580> like<00:02:21.700> this

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.580 

and<00:02:28.800> then<00:02:28.920> I'll<00:02:29.010> go<00:02:29.129> back<00:02:29.340> through<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
and then I'll go back through the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.500 
and then I'll go back through the
geometry<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.430> give<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.670> shape<00:02:32.909> while<00:02:33.330> it's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
geometry and give it shape while it's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.600 
geometry and give it shape while it's
still<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.110> its<00:02:34.470> simple<00:02:34.890> form<00:02:35.099> before<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> add

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
still in its simple form before I add

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.860 
still in its simple form before I add
anything<00:02:35.849> else<00:02:36.150> I'm<00:02:36.390> not<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.720> worry

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
anything else I'm not going to worry

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.170 
anything else I'm not going to worry
about<00:02:36.930> rounding<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.830> out<00:02:38.069> not<00:02:39.000> going<00:02:39.090> to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
about rounding this out not going to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.330 
about rounding this out not going to
worry<00:02:39.360> about<00:02:39.390> rounding<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.830> yet<00:02:41.190> I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
worry about rounding it here just yet I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.930 
worry about rounding it here just yet I
will<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.390> not<00:02:42.650> not<00:02:43.650> until<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> get<00:02:44.340> more<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.849> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
will but not not until I get more of the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:57.050 
will but not not until I get more of the
shape<00:02:45.120> I'd<00:02:45.299> like<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.840> place

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.570 

so<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.870> go<00:02:57.990> back<00:02:58.020> through<00:02:58.490> viewing<00:02:59.490> this

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
so I can go back through viewing this

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.350 
so I can go back through viewing this
geometry<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.209> bottom<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.750> could<00:03:01.620> scale<00:03:01.920> it

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.449 

now<00:03:06.360> if<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.690> want<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.020> add<00:03:07.170> an<00:03:07.470> edge<00:03:08.040> loop<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.430> just

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
now if I want to add an edge loop I just

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.920 
now if I want to add an edge loop I just
hit<00:03:09.150> Y<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:10.050> repeat<00:03:10.350> my<00:03:10.470> previous<00:03:10.860> tool<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.750 

I'll<00:03:15.930> go<00:03:16.170> in<00:03:16.319> on<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.800> vert<00:03:16.980> level<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.520> I'll<00:03:17.670> go

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
I'll go in on the vert level so I'll go

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.229 
I'll go in on the vert level so I'll go
to<00:03:17.850> vertex<00:03:18.030> I'm<00:03:18.540> selecting<00:03:19.170> both<00:03:19.380> sides<00:03:20.239> I'm

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
to vertex I'm selecting both sides I'm

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.910 
to vertex I'm selecting both sides I'm
pulling<00:03:21.930> around<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.470> selecting<00:03:22.770> both

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
pulling around it and selecting both

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.070 
pulling around it and selecting both
sides<00:03:24.440> I'm<00:03:25.440> checking<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.100> make<00:03:26.190> sure<00:03:27.080> I've

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
sides I'm checking to make sure I've

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.910 
sides I'm checking to make sure I've
selected<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.709> right<00:03:28.860> verts<00:03:30.290> when<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.380> hit<00:03:31.500> R<00:03:31.739> to

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
selected the right verts when I hit R to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.180 
selected the right verts when I hit R to
scale<00:03:32.250> keeps<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.790> symmetrical<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:34.560> now<00:03:35.040> I'm

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
scale keeps it symmetrical and now I'm

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:47.770 
scale keeps it symmetrical and now I'm
starting<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.580> round<00:03:35.760> out<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> boat

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.020 

now<00:03:48.320> use<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.710> extrude<00:03:49.040> tool<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.520> will<00:03:49.580> select

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
now use the extrude tool I will select

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.730 
now use the extrude tool I will select
just<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.600> top<00:03:50.780> faces<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:53.750> will<00:03:54.020> turn<00:03:54.560> it

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
just the top faces and I will turn it

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.650 
just the top faces and I will turn it
make<00:03:55.100> sure<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.340> have<00:03:55.580> nothing<00:03:55.940> else<00:03:56.060> selected

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
make sure I have nothing else selected

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.220 
make sure I have nothing else selected
and<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.710> don't<00:03:58.420> so<00:03:59.420> then<00:03:59.570> I'll<00:03:59.690> go<00:03:59.870> to<00:03:59.930> the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
and I don't so then I'll go to the

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.920 
and I don't so then I'll go to the
extrude<00:04:00.650> tool<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:04.760> will<00:04:04.820> scale<00:04:05.300> it<00:04:05.330> in<00:04:05.630> my

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
extrude tool and I will scale it in my

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.850 
extrude tool and I will scale it in my
extrusion<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.270> I<00:04:08.270> will<00:04:08.390> hit<00:04:08.510> G<00:04:08.990> repeats<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
extrusion and I will hit G repeats the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.590 
extrusion and I will hit G repeats the
previous<00:04:10.250> process<00:04:12.910> that<00:04:13.910> gives<00:04:14.150> me<00:04:14.330> another

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
previous process that gives me another

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.539 
previous process that gives me another
extrusion<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.320> then<00:04:15.680> I'll<00:04:15.770> just<00:04:15.920> hit<00:04:16.100> R<00:04:16.310> and

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
extrusion and then I'll just hit R and

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.819 
extrusion and then I'll just hit R and
scale<00:04:18.579> now<00:04:20.049> I've<00:04:21.049> got<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.320> be<00:04:21.380> careful<00:04:21.769> about

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
scale now I've got to be careful about

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.590 
scale now I've got to be careful about
penetrating<00:04:22.460> geometry<00:04:23.090> see<00:04:23.300> I've<00:04:23.419> got

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
penetrating geometry see I've got

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.350 
penetrating geometry see I've got
geometry<00:04:24.410> penetrating<00:04:24.980> here<00:04:25.220> so<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.030> want<00:04:26.270> to

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
geometry penetrating here so I want to

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:35.589 
geometry penetrating here so I want to
correct<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.870> while<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.080> recognize<00:04:27.530> it

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.159 

and<00:04:35.809> I<00:04:36.259> have<00:04:36.379> geometry<00:04:36.649> penetrating<00:04:37.339> here

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
and I have geometry penetrating here

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:46.869 
and I have geometry penetrating here
I'll<00:04:39.169> correct<00:04:39.499> that

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.989 

and<00:04:47.209> that<00:04:47.929> is<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.139> simplified<00:04:48.860> based<00:04:49.520> version

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:49.999 
and that is a simplified based version

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:53.139 
and that is a simplified based version
of<00:04:50.179> the<00:04:50.959> boat
