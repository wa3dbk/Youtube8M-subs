00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.890
 Current 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.670
 If you are from 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.970
 If you 're dyed at home it's fine 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.970
 Mr. If you wake up Beauty salons Marin 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.440
 In personal power 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.450
 This ratio 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:26.220
 I can not do much here, so I am here 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.970
 A person from the home 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.200
 To be as easy to understand as possible 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.130
 Less failure 55 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.770
 Without also had 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.820
 how to 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.290
 Thinking about 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.540
 often 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.810
 I think that I want to send it out 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.690
 This experiment is 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.170
 Here are 3 hair 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:58.090
 And dry hair behind 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.010
 Here gree sold on the market 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.980
 Here 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.810
 Natto 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.610
 The 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.600
 When placed for 20 minutes 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 Together what color color brightness's 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.030
 Can you make a difference 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.880
 Look at what 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.880
 For those who do school 6 color 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.040
 Whether it is to say that were asked to in which way 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.360
 The good I 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.390
 I hope to introduce you 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:37.070
 He it is not won even finished painting Come on now 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.830
 The front half is wet and bleached, and the back is dry. 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.320
 The difference is 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.100
 There is almost nothing 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.159
 It is easy to paint that there is no difference in 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 Nonetheless, it is still best to paint 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:57.190
 Because the front half is in a wet condition , the penetration of medicine is also 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.960
 Familiar 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.030
 The amount of medicine 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.820
 You need less 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.010
 Cause of many failures 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.910
 Suddenly a bad village 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.710
 The bad village is 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.590
 Because it becomes easy to penetrate by wetting 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.500
 It will be improved a little 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.540
 Hit with 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.540
 There is no bleach on the way 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.040
 I painted this area a lot but the back 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.640
 U 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.340
 Because it was not enough 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.200
 Without seasons 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.710
 So the unevenness comes out 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.960
 I think there are many people 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.530
 Because 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.130
 I found it in this experiment 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:47.560
 Hair was wet hair and additional ration 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:53.390
 It turns out that there is no difference in making a difference so much 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.340
 If you want to bridge, you should get wet and paint smoothly 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.280
 It is easy to dye beautifully 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.650
 I introduced how to paint before 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.580
 Playlist 2 in 2 channels 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.680
 How to use form 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.350
 Based on various experiments 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.930
 Because we will be publishing 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.530
 Because it was good last time 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.780
 In the magnet 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.010
 Look at the animation of the bone of bleach color 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.890
 That 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.090
 try it 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.090
 This time is over
