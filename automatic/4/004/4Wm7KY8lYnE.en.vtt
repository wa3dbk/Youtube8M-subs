00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.100
 Welcome to the next round of the par 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.099
 was projects in the second round 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.110
 The semi-final is about 10 comments 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.700
 is called as it used to be a beautiful 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.960
 couple of gameplay with a few tips and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.910
 Tricks for you I wish you much 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.350
 enjoy it and my first tip for you 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.090
 is that your classes are good 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.980
 you have to prepare yourselves 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.109
 which web will be played which 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 mode is played what could there on 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.160
 best fits he goes to the melee 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 he goes on to make the sale 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.699
 shooting series are selected here 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 for example, a reaper kaden 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.140
 Of course not very efficient around it 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.880
 so express and that's why you do 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 your thoughts if you see what it's all about 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.090
 come create class for each one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 situation fit that you in principle 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 then only from movies is and not every 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.879
 even in the lobby search for hours 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.070
 then tinker to the classroom then catch 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.680
 We also look at the players on terminal 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.420
 with the acr free for all and mine 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.129
 next tip for you is attentive 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.510
 I knew they were 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.760
 this corner is your game now 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 back and look at the whole again to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.750
 I'll throw the room with water 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.609
 and here you see as above in the corner 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.290
 the enemy can be seen on the radar 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.390
 I remember, I just have to deal with it 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.830
 can pick me up the kill and direct her 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.170
 goes the next people we pick up with 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.700
 also him out of here and then in addition to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.770
 me in the sideway is an easy one 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 behind in the back a summer already 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.070
 times three musicals in advance thanks him 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.200
 Wearable because I really can for you 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.909
 Free for all only recommend it is 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.479
 really a great way out of it 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.220
 close 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.200
 Of course I do not have that on mine 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.880
 radar seen but the red font the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.829
 thanks to master marksman, jumping was easy 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.600
 in the eye and that's just the type 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.460
 i can give master marksman and that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 portable savior and you can in principle 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.100
 on the drone in free for all 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.600
 renounce 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.040
 What good is it for you to know that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.810
 opponents just at the other end of the map 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.939
 running around in the principle is interested yes 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.290
 only in the area in which we also 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.210
 can choose and there it is 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.220
 portable da and champion really 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.140
 super here you see again what at 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.490
 champion shooter everything is possible fast 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 I also have the report 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.880
 together as well as the heli and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.840
 I would have only with reconnaissance drone 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.909
 I would have to take with me then 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.619
 probably 357 played there I will 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.600
 already the highest so my next tip 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.180
 stay calm for you you see now 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.979
 I'm really short of the heli fled 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.140
 is in the air why should I now 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.360
 like a berserk over the cutterin and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.619
 Therefore, you still risk to die for one 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.730
 I wanted to turn to strip now 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.530
 actually wait and see that the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.180
 But now I noticed that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.940
 somebody's back there once 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.980
 brought with the secondary and then have 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.390
 I already lifeless together just yet 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.519
 a bit secure the area because 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.840
 I want to go to the Ripa and now 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.670
 that's my thing I just too 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.830
 It can be really important to give it away 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 how you do it all looks on you 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.700
 Once it's safe and then you could 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.239
 I also without hesitation in your repair 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.890
 hook us to see the whole thing again 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.390
 from outside you can see me sitting here 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.440
 to one side a safe wall behind 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.629
 I'm the pillar for me 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.220
 Relatively safe the opponents can only here 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.019
 come from the area of ​​the restaurant 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.459
 out of this aisle this shop out 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.930
 and from there they can me 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.370
 Really bad 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.140
 Of course you can also go here 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.970
 Opposite coming out of the aisle there 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.799
 I'm so seen by the package blunt 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.660
 blocked with the sight and even here 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.190
 I'm really hard at the back 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.870
 Really recognize apart from that 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.260
 names is there really nothing to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.940
 see 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.620
 behind the map is over there I need 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.660
 nothing to fear and can 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.640
 of course, to sit in peace in me and you 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.379
 have fun and my next tip for 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.970
 you also have that yoga graduation series 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.530
 Of course we use in the background 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.139
 it would be the ascendant song of the warrior 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.400
 has really recognized a great thing 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.470
 should a bit of mood in the bude 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.660
 bring and we have of course now 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.250
 let's see why the reaper why such 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.230
 complete yours when you're free for 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.880
 all or in general if you are too 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.650
 which ones really play this one 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.000
 high score and a nice kg reach 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.560
 want what is here most of you 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.970
 then go grab the tall ones 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.590
 be strictly natural 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.510
 patrick's halion leaf again quickly 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.549
 celebrated down but with a bit 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.680
 Exercise for example in ripa you can do the 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.989
 People must try things on you 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.299
 to go away before you get into it 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.739
 can complete that is so far one 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.419
 little complicated requires one 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.049
 natural good overview of the 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.389
 whole map 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.650
 but it is possible you see myrad there 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.510
 is disturbed i have to take care of mine 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.340
 Eyes leave that means I look 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.440
 first time around I can go out here it is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.359
 safe here and yes it is not it is it 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.250
 but not so there are the opponents and that 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.989
 In principle, I have the moment in which I 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.370
 really lucky that one had the one 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.930
 has brought another away when two themselves 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.549
 argue amtex and 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.799
 Of course , this text about angles 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.480
 as you just saw on course 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.949
 Main pay flow is so from heaven 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.079
 annoying it is now time unfortunately sometimes 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.789
 even with the conclusion series but the 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.470
 rapper had already brought something good out of me 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.120
 yes have a point advantage together 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.420
 A portable squad is always around 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.250
 a next run 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.560
 she pays attention to it as I always do 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.600
 Going into the pure goals before I'm in 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.520
 principle is afterwards pull my body 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.230
 so wanted because if there is an opponent 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.000
 I would have waited for myself 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.350
 time on the visor on him and should 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 just shoot and then would not 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.970
 be surprised in principle by them 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.960
 or it would come then on speed 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.130
 reaction time or what connection 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.870
 times or something 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.640
 so i'm at an advantage and you can do that 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.630
 Opponents really good and easy to get away 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.910
 just by that 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.930
 prepared in the situation here 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.250
 Do not be surprised 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.350
 my next tip is that here 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.460
 really seen everything recorded with the 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.930
 could all grenade just 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.790
 kielholen where I actually died 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.010
 now I was my secondary 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.240
 exchanged for against the p90 and that 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.580
 is really a small tip 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.650
 from me to you if you are without raiders 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.840
 then take care of you as soon as possible 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.580
 therefore possible your secondary weapon against 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.650
 a second exchange primarily for it 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.790
 if you wanted to go for kills then how 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.160
 often happened or how fast 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.560
 this is what happened to your ammunition europe 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.930
 for then all is your chosen ac 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.760
 as an example, there is no more ammunition and 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.590
 then you have to with the fmg or with the 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.120
 mp 9 or whatever running around and 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.410
 for so long after another 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.210
 primary for then you look 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.560
 you can use if you are early 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.810
 take care of that if that offers 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.100
 then you can of course then first in 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.990
 rest with the second primary weapon 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.850
 continue until you get your great 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.530
 main weapon as well as they exchange again 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.970
 My next point for you is that 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.350
 her cover you are looking for may I have the 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.940
 second reaper was here one more 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.350
 another place pointing to terminal where you 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.340
 really good and sure of his graduation 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.020
 series can use 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.670
 but of course it's also about that 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.130
 We also looked for the cover in the game 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.780
 that you always try as possible behind 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.610
 to be a cover that against you 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.650
 either can not see because there is one 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.390
 Couple a blog or something in the way 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.250
 what blocks you or you one 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.140
 half wall or box or something 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.400
 looking for her to shoot out of 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.930
 that he has less attack surface and 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.940
 less strike area for you just 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.530
 of course, so the gameplay tips 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.240
 now here the end but I am long 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.680
 I will not have with you here 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.200
 I won the source the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.150
 predator the cartridge nicely into the cockpit 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.230
 purely steered was really a nice one 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.570
 I aids really fun to me 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.590
 made the round and in principle were 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.960
 the now just a few 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.289
 basics and tips for you as the 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.430
 fix is ​​but fun has fun 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.169
 play classes that make you bock play 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.090
 Modis that make you buck plays nothing 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.889
 what excites him the tip i can tell you 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.139
 give and here at the end again a 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.330
 little extra tip for you and indeed the 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.979
 Reaper is in my opinion or the 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.870
 reaper I do not know if you the 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.180
 comments is in my opinion the 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.560
 best shooting series mw3 she is me 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.569
 really best she makes me that 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.400
 most fun and if you handle it 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:50.180
 you can really do kills 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.550
 without end 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.039
 you see here I shoot twelve times 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.690
 The repair now became eleven opponents 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.669
 So each shot a hit because of 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.380
 Angel with whom I am no children in 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.360
 principle a type of just the postage where 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.090
 I do not get marca and that is 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.500
 really the thing to do so many kills 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.750
 with a new astra is really 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.550
 absolutely recommendable and I can you 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.900
 only for free for everyone at hand 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.759
 give if now says do not drive 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.050
 necessarily with the riepe on then too 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.520
 finally the very high degree 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.870
 to go no series that I see in 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.020
 Free for all children know lower 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.789
 but purely as an example predator 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.789
 reaper I'll say cobra so now 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:26.690
 7 she loves and you have that in principle 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:28.159
 you can not lose anymore 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.750
 once he has the projects together 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:31.250
 you have the thing in the bag that is 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.070
 again a little extra tip for you 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.780
 like you really fast then 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.130
 played a lead and the 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.229
 Reaper is really a great thing 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.669
 which I can give to the hand so then 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:41.659
 but now comes slowly but itself 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.639
 always to the end 

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:45.560
 I hope you liked it, it was 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:47.180
 I really enjoyed the whole for 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.949
 get ready for this 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.719
 It was just a whole lot of work 

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.580
 have never had so much editing and too much 

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:53.900

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.530
 have given to edit very big 

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.539
