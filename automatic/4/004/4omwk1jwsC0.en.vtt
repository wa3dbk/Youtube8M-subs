find the on and off switch volume rocker

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.020 
find the on and off switch volume rocker
also<00:01:05.019> if<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.320> destroy<00:01:05.860> rotational<00:01:06.460> USB<00:01:06.880> to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
also if you destroy rotational USB to

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.340 
also if you destroy rotational USB to
USB<00:01:07.240> 3<00:01:07.690> and<00:01:07.930> HDMI<00:01:08.590> so<00:01:09.159> there's<00:01:09.340> no<00:01:09.520> vga<00:01:09.880> or

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
USB 3 and HDMI so there's no vga or

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.800 
USB 3 and HDMI so there's no vga or
network<00:01:11.350> words<00:01:11.950> in<00:01:12.400> here<00:01:12.820> then<00:01:13.330> on<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.600> bottom

network words in here then on the bottom
we<00:01:14.020> can<00:01:14.050> see<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:14.470> there<00:01:14.650> is<00:01:14.740> no

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
we can see that there is no

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.340 
we can see that there is no
possibility<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.539> use<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:17.840> with<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> docking

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
possibility to use it with a docking

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.800 
possibility to use it with a docking
station<00:01:18.380> or<00:01:19.280> it's<00:01:19.640> really<00:01:20.210> hard<00:01:20.420> like<00:01:20.509> she<00:01:20.659> to
