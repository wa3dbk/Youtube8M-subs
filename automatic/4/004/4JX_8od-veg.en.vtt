drive just got finish roasting a few
sets<00:00:18.100> of<00:00:18.190> tires<00:00:18.400> on<00:00:18.670> them<00:00:18.790> and<00:00:19.450> we're<00:00:19.600> gonna<00:00:19.720> go

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
sets of tires on them and we're gonna go

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:47.620 
sets of tires on them and we're gonna go
around<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.110> park

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.730 

so<00:00:48.630> one<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> amazing<00:00:49.110> things<00:00:49.350> we're<00:00:49.650> going

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
so one of the amazing things we're going

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.220 
so one of the amazing things we're going
to<00:00:49.800> talk<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.130> here<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.580> this<00:00:50.730> Camaro<00:00:51.060> is<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
to talk about here on this Camaro is the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
to talk about here on this Camaro is the
steering<00:00:52.590> angle<00:00:52.890> we've<00:00:53.760> gone<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.090> great

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
steering angle we've gone to great

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
steering angle we've gone to great
lengths<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.630> do<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> engineering<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
lengths to do a lot of engineering to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.650 
lengths to do a lot of engineering to
figure<00:00:56.790> out<00:00:56.910> how<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> most

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
figure out how we can get the most

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
figure out how we can get the most
amount<00:00:57.810> of<00:00:57.989> steering<00:00:58.320> possible<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
amount of steering possible out of the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.830 
amount of steering possible out of the
car<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.330> see<00:01:00.360> I<00:01:00.540> think<00:01:00.750> we've

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
car and as you can see I think we've

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.150 
car and as you can see I think we've
done<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> pretty<00:01:01.050> good<00:01:01.260> job<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.800> actually

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
done a pretty good job this actually

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
done a pretty good job this actually
isn't<00:01:02.370> quite<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> way<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:04.110> probably

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
isn't quite all the way it's probably

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.900 
isn't quite all the way it's probably
got<00:01:04.620> another<00:01:04.739> three<00:01:05.190> or<00:01:05.220> four<00:01:05.489> degrees<00:01:05.760> of

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
got another three or four degrees of

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
got another three or four degrees of
steering<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> cars<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:06.780> you're

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
steering but the cars from you're

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.780 
steering but the cars from you're
running<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> hold<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.740> way<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.640> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
running to hold it all the way so this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.190 
running to hold it all the way so this
is<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:08.940> sitting<00:01:09.360> statically<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:09.990> enough

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
is just sitting statically it's enough

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.390 
is just sitting statically it's enough
steering<00:01:10.590> angle<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.100> turn<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
steering angle that if you turn the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.620 
steering angle that if you turn the
wheel<00:01:11.550> all<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> way<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.940> low<00:01:12.090> speeds<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> will

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
wheel all the way at low speeds it will

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
wheel all the way at low speeds it will
actually<00:01:12.750> stop<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.140> car<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
actually stop the car so it's one of the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
actually stop the car so it's one of the
neat<00:01:15.390> things<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.440> see<00:01:16.470> we're<00:01:16.740> on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
neat things and as you can see we're on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
neat things and as you can see we're on
some<00:01:16.979> forgeline<00:01:17.369> zx3<00:01:18.180> ours<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
some forgeline zx3 ours it's a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.270 
some forgeline zx3 ours it's a
good-looking<00:01:19.350> wheel<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
good-looking wheel but one of the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.650 
good-looking wheel but one of the
biggest<00:01:20.490> reasons<00:01:20.910> why<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.150> picked<00:01:21.300> this<00:01:21.420> wheel

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
biggest reasons why we picked this wheel

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.389 
biggest reasons why we picked this wheel
is<00:01:21.690> its<00:01:21.960> weight<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.649> extremely<00:01:23.009> light

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
is its weight it's extremely light

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.820 
is its weight it's extremely light
extreme<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.290> our<00:01:25.410> suspension

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
extreme so as you can see our suspension

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
extreme so as you can see our suspension
setup<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.550> car<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.060> pretty<00:01:27.300> custom<00:01:27.540> we

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
setup on the car is pretty custom we

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.639 
setup on the car is pretty custom we
have<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.890> piece<00:01:29.160> billet<00:01:30.140> uprights<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.530> are

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
have one piece billet uprights that are

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.780 
have one piece billet uprights that are
made<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.130> 6061<00:01:32.970> aluminum<00:01:33.660> as<00:01:34.320> well<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
made from 6061 aluminum as well as a

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.060 
made from 6061 aluminum as well as a
custom<00:01:35.790> control<00:01:36.180> arm<00:01:36.500> weight<00:01:37.500> savings<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
custom control arm weight savings is

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.430 
custom control arm weight savings is
about<00:01:38.310> 60<00:01:38.759> pounds<00:01:39.149> total<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.690> about<00:01:39.840> 30<00:01:40.050> per

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
about 60 pounds total so about 30 per

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.230 
about 60 pounds total so about 30 per
side<00:01:40.740> over<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> factory<00:01:41.430> suspension<00:01:41.610> setup

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
side over the factory suspension setup

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.540 
side over the factory suspension setup
you<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.200> don't<00:01:43.350> lose<00:01:43.530> much<00:01:43.770> drivability

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
you really don't lose much drivability

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.150 
you really don't lose much drivability
you<00:01:45.390> will<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.690> little<00:01:45.899> tire<00:01:46.290> squeal<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
you will get a little tire squeal and

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.680 
you will get a little tire squeal and
chatter<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.700> low<00:01:47.880> speeds<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.450> you're<00:01:48.569> having

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
chatter at low speeds if you're having

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.290 
chatter at low speeds if you're having
to<00:01:48.810> turn<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> wheel<00:01:49.289> a<00:01:49.319> lot<00:01:49.729> but<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.910> biggest

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
to turn the wheel a lot but the biggest

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.790 
to turn the wheel a lot but the biggest
thing<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.720> steering<00:01:52.200> angle<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> got

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
thing is the steering angle that you got

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.949 
thing is the steering angle that you got
a<00:01:52.830> car<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.429> actually<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.270> setup<00:01:54.539> gives<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
a car and actually this setup gives the

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.469 
a car and actually this setup gives the
car<00:01:55.140> much<00:01:55.380> better<00:01:55.590> steering<00:01:55.979> response<00:01:56.479> you'll

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
car much better steering response you'll

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.850 
car much better steering response you'll
you'll<00:01:57.750> notice<00:01:58.080> if<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.289> drive<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> stock

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you'll notice if you drive a stock
