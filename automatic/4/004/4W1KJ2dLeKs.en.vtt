motor<00:00:25.410> skills<00:00:25.970> they<00:00:26.970> help<00:00:27.240> build<00:00:28.170> imagination

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
motor skills they help build imagination

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.500 
motor skills they help build imagination
and<00:00:29.310> children<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.000> build<00:00:30.300> different

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and children as they build different

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.750 
and children as they build different
things<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.260> they<00:00:31.410> want<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> build<00:00:33.110> but<00:00:34.110> also

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
things that they want to build but also

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.709 
things that they want to build but also
today<00:00:35.760> I'm<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.239> show<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> some

today I'm going to show you some

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.080 
today I'm going to show you some
activities<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.530> which<00:00:37.829> will<00:00:38.790> help<00:00:38.910> your

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
activities in which will help your

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.420 
activities in which will help your
children<00:00:39.300> develop<00:00:39.840> logic<00:00:40.320> critical<00:00:40.860> thinking

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
children develop logic critical thinking

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.600 
children develop logic critical thinking
and<00:00:41.700> visual<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.570> spatial<00:00:42.690> perception<00:00:43.610> using

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and visual and spatial perception using

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
and visual and spatial perception using
these<00:00:44.820> blocks<00:00:45.500> okay<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.600> this<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> an<00:00:48.870> activity

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
these blocks okay so this is an activity

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.779 
these blocks okay so this is an activity
here<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.899> went<00:00:51.899> ahead<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.579> built<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
here in which I went ahead and built a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.850 
here in which I went ahead and built a
giraffe<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> child<00:00:55.440> looks<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
giraffe so then the child looks at the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.670 
giraffe so then the child looks at the
model<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.390> provided<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.289> blocks

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
model and I have provided the blocks

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.619 
model and I have provided the blocks
that<00:00:58.920> they<00:00:59.160> will<00:00:59.340> need<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.730> build<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.180> exact

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that they will need to build that exact

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.619 
that they will need to build that exact
model<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.680> little<00:01:01.949> basket<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> then

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
model here in this little basket so then

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
model here in this little basket so then
the<00:01:03.809> child<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:05.040> ahead<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.549> build<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the child would go ahead and build it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.560 
the child would go ahead and build it
using<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.630> blocks<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.700> this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> good<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
using the blocks and this is good for

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.429 
using the blocks and this is good for
logic<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> good<00:01:11.310> logic<00:01:11.760> activity<00:01:12.439> visual

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
logic this is good logic activity visual

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.060 
logic this is good logic activity visual
and<00:01:13.590> spatial<00:01:13.710> perception<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.680> child

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and spatial perception and the child

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.280 
and spatial perception and the child
goes<00:01:20.790> ahead<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.299> uses<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> blocks

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
goes ahead and uses all of the blocks

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.070 
goes ahead and uses all of the blocks
and<00:01:22.759> they<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.780> hmm

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and they really have to think here hmm

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.359 
and they really have to think here hmm
is<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.560> this

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
is it like this

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.480 
is it like this
no<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.119> said<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.259> doesn't<00:01:28.560> look<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
no I said this one doesn't look like it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.289 
no I said this one doesn't look like it
and<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.689> use<00:01:31.820> their<00:01:32.820> minds

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and they really have to use their minds

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.660 
and they really have to use their minds
to<00:01:33.420> think<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.650> able<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.920> figure<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.520> this

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to think and be able to figure out this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.660 
to think and be able to figure out this
is<00:01:35.820> good<00:01:36.000> problem-solving<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.340> child

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
is good problem-solving as the child

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
is good problem-solving as the child
tries<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.150> build<00:01:39.390> your<00:01:39.750> wrath<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.990> can

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
tries to build your wrath and it can

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.810 
tries to build your wrath and it can
take<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> childhood<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:44.159> long<00:01:44.310> time<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
take a childhood really long time so I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.810 
take a childhood really long time so I
should<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.060> build<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:46.250> figuring<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
should he build this figuring it out and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
should he build this figuring it out and
here<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.530> both<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> same

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
here we have it and I have both the same

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.789 
here we have it and I have both the same
giraffe<00:01:50.369> using<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.479> blocks<00:01:53.540> okay<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:55.619> can

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
giraffe using the blocks okay so you can

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.149 
giraffe using the blocks okay so you can
also<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.909> other<00:01:57.240> things<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.020> here's<00:01:58.979> an

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
also you do other things like here's an

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.060 
also you do other things like here's an
airplane<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.469> different<00:02:01.799> colors

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
airplane and the more different colors

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
airplane and the more different colors
that<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.369> use<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.360> more<00:02:03.570> difficult<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that you use the more difficult it is to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.469 
that you use the more difficult it is to
build<00:02:05.070> because<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.579> child<00:02:05.820> has<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.180> really

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
build because the child has to really

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.040 
build because the child has to really
position<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:08.160> blocks<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> correct<00:02:09.569> spot

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
position the blocks in the correct spot

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.680 
position the blocks in the correct spot
according<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.679> color<00:02:11.120> here<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.270> sort<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.510> like

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
according to color here is sort of like

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.730 
according to color here is sort of like
a<00:02:12.720> robot

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
a robot

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.140 
a robot
for<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.160> little<00:02:15.430> ones<00:02:15.610> if<00:02:15.820> you're<00:02:15.940> first

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
for the little ones if you're first

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.720 
for the little ones if you're first
starting<00:02:16.480> on<00:02:16.600> they've<00:02:16.810> never<00:02:17.400> used<00:02:18.400> Mega

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
starting on they've never used Mega

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.010 
starting on they've never used Mega
Bloks<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.120> maybe<00:02:19.270> they<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.480> first<00:02:19.780> starting

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
Bloks so maybe they just first starting

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.260 
Bloks so maybe they just first starting
out<00:02:20.080> building<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.220> can<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:21.970> little

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
out building you can have like a little

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.060 
out building you can have like a little
small<00:02:22.390> thing<00:02:22.780> like<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.170> with<00:02:23.410> two<00:02:23.590> or<00:02:23.770> three

small thing like this with two or three
or<00:02:24.280> four<00:02:25.050> blocks<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.530> with<00:02:27.010> different<00:02:27.280> colors

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
or four blocks and with different colors

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.890 
or four blocks and with different colors
or<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.760> same<00:02:27.970> colors<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.420> have<00:02:28.600> them<00:02:28.750> build

something simple like this and again you

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.460 
something simple like this and again you
would<00:02:31.180> place<00:02:31.390> these<00:02:31.540> blocks<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.080> they<00:02:32.290> would

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
would place these blocks that they would

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.830 
would place these blocks that they would
need<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.980> build<00:02:33.490> this<00:02:33.700> exact<00:02:34.120> model<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.750> a

the child through one picture at a time
and<00:03:20.050> build<00:03:20.760> looking<00:03:21.760> at<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.180> picture<00:03:22.600> instead

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
and build looking at the picture instead

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.810 
and build looking at the picture instead
of<00:03:22.930> looking<00:03:23.470> at<00:03:23.620> an<00:03:23.740> actual<00:03:23.950> model<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.790> that

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
of looking at an actual model and that

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.170 
of looking at an actual model and that
is<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> older<00:03:26.290> children<00:03:26.320> because<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
is for the older children because the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.200 
is for the older children because the
younger<00:03:28.510> children<00:03:28.660> do<00:03:29.790> benefit<00:03:30.790> from<00:03:30.970> seeing

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
younger children do benefit from seeing

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.270 
younger children do benefit from seeing
the<00:03:31.420> actual<00:03:32.080> model<00:03:32.440> right<00:03:32.560> in<00:03:32.710> front<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:33.010> them

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
the actual model right in front of them

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.760 
the actual model right in front of them
it's<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.730> lot<00:03:33.880> easier<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.470> lot<00:03:35.620> more

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
it's a lot easier it's a lot more

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.350 
it's a lot easier it's a lot more
concrete<00:03:36.370> but<00:03:36.820> if<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.030> do<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:37.300> children

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
concrete but if you do have children

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.380 
concrete but if you do have children
that<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.280> ability<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.670> have<00:03:39.940> abstract

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
that have the ability to have abstract

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.470 
that have the ability to have abstract
thinking<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:42.280> look<00:03:42.580> at<00:03:42.670> pictures<00:03:43.150> you

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
thinking and can look at pictures you

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.090 
thinking and can look at pictures you
can<00:03:43.630> take<00:03:43.840> pictures<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.350> things<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.860> these

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
can take pictures of things of these

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.520 
can take pictures of things of these
models<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:46.540> children<00:03:46.750> build<00:03:47.230> from

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
models and have children build from

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.300 
models and have children build from
pictures<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.360> that<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.600> another<00:03:49.780> great<00:03:50.020> idea

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
pictures so that is another great idea

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.070 
pictures so that is another great idea
