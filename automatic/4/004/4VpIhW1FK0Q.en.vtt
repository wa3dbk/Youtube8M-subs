00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:06.149
 Electric car expected as next generation leader who considered environment 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.309
 The country has begun to move towards the spread of 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.309
 The country procures a weather car that has just been developed 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.689
 It will be lent out to the local government for free 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.380
 Combined with gasoline that was different from electric cars and hybrid cars 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.099
 Control 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.489
 Run only with electricity 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.689
 We can charge from household outlet 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.359
 With this type of car it will fill up in 24 hours 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.539
 It is said that it runs about 60km by one charge 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 In the Ministry of the Environment 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.380
 50% of new car sales by 2020 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.500
 I have a goal 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.060
 The first step to the spread for lending to local governments this time 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.060
 Positioned approximately 400 million yen in budget 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 Six actualities such as Kanagawa Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture and a year at a postal service company etc. 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 We rent out 52 cars for free from dawn 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.590
 Electric vehicles will be launched in full swing next year 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.410
 Electric car related 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.040
 There is an instruction 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.840
 This project leads Japan as a mathe and a senior 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.840
 It depends on you listening to the previous verse 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.390
 This rental is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.950
 Even if it goes out to the town, there is also a demonstration experiment that it is actually used 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.400
 There are also benefits for the manufacturer 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.829
 My man's maid is loaded with four batteries 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:27.660
 This year 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.830
 Because it is the first time 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.250
 Your opinion 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.240
 And Morioka 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.050
 Enter the hall 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.160
 Limited to more than him 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 Kazuo Maruyama 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 A major issue for the spread of electric vehicles is three times that of gasoline 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.710
 Price and heavy on the go 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.040
 Manufacturers' development efforts and infrastructure development are key 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.170
 That's right 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.460
 There are various issues for that 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.500
 Hanayo Next Generation Instructor 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.149
 It looks like it's finally getting started 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.670
 Because of the joint site Environment Minister 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.680
 Declared next year as electric car related, but that is the living room 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.649
 I think there is a reason not to look at 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.779
 And finally, Nishi Shin Automobile Fuji Heavy Industries 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.379
 Manager of car sales branch from the future year 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.510
 Second one 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.809
 Charging facility building 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.709
 Showa Shell is the first gas station in Kanagawa 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.099
 As it is set up, it is a US investment league third place public investment 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.149
 The development of a good weather car in that condition is included and eyes 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.429
 * So far 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.839
 Japan and the world in the world 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.079
 I wonder what that big thing is 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.390
 Also legal system for the third environment 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.500
 I want you to somehow clear the issues for economic recovery 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.430
 Is it so?
