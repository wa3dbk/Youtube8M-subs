00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.940
 welcome all users of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.950
 wisely in this frame a little 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.380
 unusual for our reviews but that 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.270
 in my opinion it binds in a particular way 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.360
 with the coat we will talk about 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.690
 thanks to dice we are testing from 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.379
 a few days this brief of paper 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.870
 nomad this is the ipad mini variant 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.410
 and it's called datterino but it's available 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.440
 also for all others to devices for 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.380
 macbook is for devices of course 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.750
 other than the apple ones including the 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.610
 kindle of amazon 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.649
 being a sliva its classic 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.020
 structure but the one that characterizes in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.290
 particular way this product is a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.129
 look and feel totally natural like this 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.710
 as the materials of which it is composed 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.710
 100 per 100 natural from the outside up 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.740
 inside in the sense that we start with 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.010
 a paper fiber for the coating 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.710
 paper fibers that can also be felt at 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.229
 feel even though it is treated for 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.299
 be resistant resistant even to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.520
 liquids in the sense that if you get wet you 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.850
 repeats short laps moistens but then yes 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.330
 re dry without let's say lose 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:38.070
 original characteristics of the product 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.840
 and then it is to this closure that it realized 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.780
 in hemp 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.720
 even if then there is a small magnet that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.670
 lets close 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.759
 the padding is in cotton and the finish 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.290
 the inner lining in wool of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.500
 sheep coating that discharge 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.479
 obviously to protect gently the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.659
 our ipad 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.079
 the designer recalls in a particular way 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.079
 this looks natural and is also 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.220
 nice and nice with these seams 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:16.200
 that go to characterize its appearance 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.269
 a particular feature of this 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.970
 product that among other things won the red 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.390
 dot design award in 2012 and it is anyway 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.700
 recently available 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.040
 in commerce it is what being of 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.940
 card can be easily 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.720
 personalized by creatives 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.660
 so anyone has a bit of age 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.840
 let's say artists who can be a 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.920
 draw on this guardian and make it 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.770
 only 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.890
 in fact I have seen videos and of 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.320
 presentation of the product with 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.720
 aesthetic solutions really very much 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.370
 beautiful even with simple texts yes 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 can make the product unique 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.910
 let's see how it behaves since 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.010
 operation point of view 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.260
 obviously a classic sleeve and therefore 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.769
 as a pocket it fits lay 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.720
 from the inside that goes up to 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.810
 fund and some remain 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.420
 millimeters for which the burgundy we say 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.519
 the closure is protected by the iPad 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.920
 effective magnetic in the sense that 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.110
 girandola does not fall but obviously yes 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.410
 go to here to insist a lot can 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.030
 happen this now with the ipad mini 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.700
 in short, we must really insist on 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.230
 let the magnet yield even if necessary 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.269
 consider that being a magnet is not 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.530
 never a closure is that it can give us one 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.630
 100 percent security with maybe 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.920
 the iphone if the magnet is the same then 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.700
 this must be seen but it could 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.989
 let's say less about the problem 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.290
 I imagine that if the magnet is always there 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.209
 same with the weight of a limited ipad 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.340
 full size the full size one 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.620
 by 7 inches could indeed be 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.910
 a bit a delicate point for how much 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.190
 regards the echo domains I see that 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.060
 actually, the yield seems to me instead 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.150
 sufficient to succeed in conditions 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.160
 normal to make sure you don't fall out 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.290
 here you have to really tease for 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.690
 tease him to be able to make him give up 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.390
 Interesting also the price of 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.609
 amazon is currently located at 20 990 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.830
 euros including shipping costs what 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.400
 suspension is therefore definitely not 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.240
 a particularly expensive price for a 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.420
 product that has a bit of a soul 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.020
 eco-sustainable that also excites 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.050
 the creativity of designers and is 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.600
 however treated to render from the point 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.240
 practical as a normal one 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.750
 slip even if it is made instead 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.990
 with natural materials and in some ways 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.680
 unusual unusual if you think that 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:59.610
 the paper fiber exterior perhaps that 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.370
 magnet on the 10-inch LED product 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.660
 10 inches and you need to check 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.480
 how much it manages to resist but is 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.570
 presumably they thought the thing 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.100
 that therefore they have equipped the slim is more 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.470
 large of a magnet suitable for weight 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.110
 of the 9.7 inch ipad however a 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.570
 definitely a good vote a good potro 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.360
 stars for this then by nomad da 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.010
 turin for ipad mini that falls 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.100
 quietly in our products 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.100
 Recommended soon as wisely
