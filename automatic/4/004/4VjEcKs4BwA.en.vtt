considering<00:00:04.720> how<00:00:04.809> many<00:00:04.870> variations<00:00:05.350> on<00:00:05.740> the

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:05.859 
considering how many variations on the

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:07.650 
considering how many variations on the
transformers<00:00:06.609> they've<00:00:06.819> been<00:00:07.059> over<00:00:07.359> the<00:00:07.450> years

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
transformers they've been over the years

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.390 
transformers they've been over the years
it<00:00:07.839> stands<00:00:08.200> to<00:00:08.350> reason<00:00:08.380> that<00:00:08.830> they're<00:00:09.040> not<00:00:09.070> all

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
it stands to reason that they're not all

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.970 
it stands to reason that they're not all
gonna<00:00:09.580> be<00:00:09.670> gold<00:00:10.150> are<00:00:10.540> they<00:00:10.900> in<00:00:11.110> fact<00:00:11.380> it's

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
gonna be gold are they in fact it's

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.980 
gonna be gold are they in fact it's
amazing<00:00:12.820> that<00:00:13.090> there<00:00:13.210> aren't<00:00:13.360> more<00:00:13.540> flat-out

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
amazing that there aren't more flat-out

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.319 
amazing that there aren't more flat-out
terrible<00:00:14.890> ones<00:00:15.100> so<00:00:15.550> let's<00:00:15.580> count<00:00:15.880> down<00:00:16.059> some

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:16.329 
terrible ones so let's count down some

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.120 
terrible ones so let's count down some
of<00:00:16.359> the<00:00:16.480> worst<00:00:16.689> transformers<00:00:17.410> that<00:00:17.589> have<00:00:17.800> ever

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
of the worst transformers that have ever

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.970 
of the worst transformers that have ever
and<00:00:18.429> will<00:00:18.880> ever<00:00:19.179> exist<00:00:19.599> with<00:00:20.470> a<00:00:20.499> few<00:00:20.740> bonus

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
and will ever exist with a few bonus

inclusions<00:00:21.640> at<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:22.179> end<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.880> do<00:00:24.970> you<00:00:25.060> say

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
inclusions at the end what do you say

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.419 
inclusions at the end what do you say
about<00:00:25.329> percept<00:00:26.079> or<00:00:26.259> in<00:00:26.619> fact<00:00:26.890> what<00:00:27.249> really

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
about percept or in fact what really

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.130 
about percept or in fact what really
needs<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:27.789> be<00:00:27.849> said<00:00:28.179> at<00:00:28.300> all<00:00:28.419> about<00:00:28.810> a<00:00:28.839> guy<00:00:29.079> who

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
needs to be said at all about a guy who

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.010 
needs to be said at all about a guy who
transforms<00:00:30.099> into<00:00:30.399> a<00:00:30.640> microscope<00:00:31.359> I<00:00:31.630> mean<00:00:31.929> I

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
transforms into a microscope I mean I

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.170 
transforms into a microscope I mean I
get<00:00:32.290> it<00:00:32.470> you're<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:32.770> science<00:00:33.460> transformer

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
get it you're the science transformer

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.430 
get it you're the science transformer
I'd<00:00:34.360> make<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.660> argument<00:00:35.050> though<00:00:35.170> that<00:00:35.200> it's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
I'd make the argument though that it's

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.770 
I'd make the argument though that it's
easier<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.890> do<00:00:36.010> science<00:00:36.460> in<00:00:36.580> robot<00:00:37.000> form<00:00:37.030> than

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
easier to do science in robot form than

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.530 
easier to do science in robot form than
it<00:00:37.900> is<00:00:38.200> as<00:00:38.380> a<00:00:38.440> microscope<00:00:39.340> or<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.760> telescope<00:00:39.850> for

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
it is as a microscope or a telescope for

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.910 
it is as a microscope or a telescope for
that<00:00:40.630> matter<00:00:40.870> which<00:00:41.170> is<00:00:41.290> another<00:00:41.470> baffling

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
that matter which is another baffling

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.370 
that matter which is another baffling
thing<00:00:42.490> that<00:00:42.640> percept<00:00:43.030> or<00:00:43.180> transforms<00:00:43.810> into<00:00:43.990> in

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
thing that percept or transforms into in

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.080 
thing that percept or transforms into in
microscope<00:00:44.950> form<00:00:45.220> he'd<00:00:45.400> still<00:00:45.610> need<00:00:45.760> someone

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
microscope form he'd still need someone

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.820 
microscope form he'd still need someone
to<00:00:46.270> place<00:00:46.540> whatever<00:00:46.870> it<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.230> he<00:00:47.350> needs<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.680> look

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
to place whatever it is he needs to look

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.220 
to place whatever it is he needs to look
at<00:00:48.040> under<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.880> lens<00:00:49.150> which<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.720> a<00:00:49.840> waste<00:00:50.080> of

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
at under the lens which is a waste of

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.690 
at under the lens which is a waste of
time<00:00:50.440> for<00:00:50.500> whoever<00:00:50.950> he's<00:00:51.220> conned<00:00:51.520> into

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
time for whoever he's conned into

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.880 
time for whoever he's conned into
assisting<00:00:52.300> him<00:00:52.450> as<00:00:52.630> well<00:00:52.960> as<00:00:53.080> my<00:00:53.260> time<00:00:53.560> now

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
assisting him as well as my time now

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.130 
assisting him as well as my time now
because<00:00:54.400> I<00:00:54.670> have<00:00:54.790> to<00:00:54.850> explain<00:00:55.390> why<00:00:55.960> that's

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
because I have to explain why that's

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.920 
because I have to explain why that's
dumb<00:00:56.710> not<00:00:57.100> only<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:57.430> percept<00:00:57.910> or<00:00:58.120> you're<00:00:58.900> a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
dumb not only that percept or you're a

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.710 
dumb not only that percept or you're a
transformer<00:00:59.829> which<00:01:00.280> means<00:01:00.610> your<00:01:01.030> eyes<00:01:01.270> or

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
transformer which means your eyes or

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.049 
transformer which means your eyes or
optics<00:01:02.410> as<00:01:02.590> you<00:01:02.890> call<00:01:03.160> them<00:01:03.190> are<00:01:03.490> surely

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
optics as you call them are surely

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.060 
optics as you call them are surely
better<00:01:04.300> than<00:01:05.019> any<00:01:05.440> human

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
better than any human

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.170 
better than any human
I'm<00:01:06.190> guessing<00:01:06.490> they've<00:01:06.580> also<00:01:06.730> got<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:06.970> pretty

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
I'm guessing they've also got a pretty

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.450 
I'm guessing they've also got a pretty
sweet<00:01:07.330> zoom<00:01:07.690> function<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.290> them<00:01:08.409> or<00:01:08.530> so<00:01:08.770> maybe

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
sweet zoom function on them or so maybe

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.610 
sweet zoom function on them or so maybe
you<00:01:09.700> could<00:01:09.850> use<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.030> instead<00:01:10.570> maybe<00:01:11.380> you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
you could use that instead maybe you

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.740 
you could use that instead maybe you
could<00:01:11.770> stop<00:01:11.950> being<00:01:12.130> such<00:01:12.340> an<00:01:12.550> idiot<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:13.360> are<00:01:13.570> a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
could stop being such an idiot you are a

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.780 
could stop being such an idiot you are a
terrible<00:01:14.260> scientist<00:01:15.070> also<00:01:15.400> I<00:01:15.550> should<00:01:15.580> mention

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
terrible scientist also I should mention

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.430 
terrible scientist also I should mention
turning<00:01:16.390> into<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.570> microscope<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.200> not<00:01:17.350> the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
turning into a microscope is not the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.800 
turning into a microscope is not the
dumbest<00:01:17.890> thing<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.310> could<00:01:18.760> find<00:01:19.030> on<00:01:19.150> percept<00:01:19.600> or

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
dumbest thing I could find on percept or

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.410 
dumbest thing I could find on percept or
it's<00:01:20.290> this<00:01:20.680> unless<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.610> pencil<00:01:21.940> transforms

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
it's this unless that pencil transforms

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's this unless that pencil transforms
into<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.630> rocket<00:01:22.960> launcher<00:01:23.350> in<00:01:23.500> which<00:01:23.680> case<00:01:23.920> I
