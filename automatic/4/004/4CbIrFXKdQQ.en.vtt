00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.330 
like you know there's something missing
there<00:05:10.550> then<00:05:10.760> at<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:10.970> bottom<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:11.510> was<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.750> really

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
there then at the bottom it was a really

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.690 
there then at the bottom it was a really
projecting<00:05:13.340> sort<00:05:13.790> of<00:05:13.910> focused<00:05:14.419> bottom<00:05:15.110> end<00:05:15.290> I

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
projecting sort of focused bottom end I

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.850 
projecting sort of focused bottom end I
like<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.940> other<00:05:17.030> Antonia<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:17.930> had<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:18.169> wish<00:05:18.590> the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
like the other Antonia I had I wish the

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.800 
like the other Antonia I had I wish the
maybe<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:19.280> could<00:05:19.550> round<00:05:19.790> it<00:05:20.030> out<00:05:20.150> of<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.510> woman

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
maybe I could round it out of the woman

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.170 
maybe I could round it out of the woman
it<00:05:20.900> seems<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.140> little<00:05:21.260> wrong<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.860> so<00:05:22.340> backed<00:05:22.880> up

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
it seems a little wrong and so backed up

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.000 
it seems a little wrong and so backed up
just<00:05:23.480> a<00:05:23.630> couple<00:05:23.870> months<00:05:24.050> ago<00:05:24.260> I<00:05:24.380> came<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.919> the

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
serious difference in the sound and when

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.950 
serious difference in the sound and when
I<00:06:17.150> played<00:06:17.450> it<00:06:17.660> first<00:06:17.990> all<00:06:18.260> thing<00:06:18.979> that<00:06:19.960> just

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
I played it first all thing that just

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.350 
I played it first all thing that just
ran<00:06:21.620> through<00:06:22.040> the<00:06:22.310> walls<00:06:22.550> now<00:06:22.850> it's<00:06:23.000> not<00:06:23.180> all

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
ran through the walls now it's not all

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.390 
ran through the walls now it's not all
about<00:06:23.510> volume<00:06:24.110> but<00:06:24.260> it's<00:06:24.380> about<00:06:24.650> presence<00:06:25.220> and

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
about volume but it's about presence and

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.450 
about volume but it's about presence and
it's<00:06:25.490> about<00:06:25.700> a<00:06:25.760> full<00:06:26.060> body<00:06:26.360> sound<00:06:27.200> and<00:06:27.470> in<00:06:28.010> hand

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
it's about a full body sound and in hand

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.500 
it's about a full body sound and in hand
and<00:06:28.640> so<00:06:28.700> I<00:06:28.760> fell<00:06:29.000> in<00:06:29.180> love<00:06:29.300> with<00:06:29.390> the

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
and so I fell in love with the

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.060 
and so I fell in love with the
instrument<00:06:29.840> because<00:06:30.080> it's<00:06:30.500> sort<00:06:30.740> of<00:06:30.800> helped

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
instrument because it's sort of helped

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.540 
instrument because it's sort of helped
me<00:06:31.360> with<00:06:32.360> equipment<00:06:32.900> to<00:06:33.080> complete<00:06:33.440> or<00:06:34.160> become

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
me with equipment to complete or become

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.790 
me with equipment to complete or become
closer<00:06:34.850> to<00:06:35.180> this<00:06:35.300> idea<00:06:35.750> of<00:06:35.870> having<00:06:36.080> a

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
closer to this idea of having a

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.580 
closer to this idea of having a
reflection<00:06:37.550> of<00:06:37.910> Chris<00:06:38.120> Collins<00:06:38.599> coming

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
reflection of Chris Collins coming

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.930 
reflection of Chris Collins coming
through<00:06:39.800> the<00:06:39.890> instrument<00:06:40.400> and<00:06:40.520> being<00:06:40.729> able<00:06:40.789> to

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
through the instrument and being able to

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.790 
through the instrument and being able to
control<00:06:41.360> tone<00:06:41.660> on<00:06:41.930> a<00:06:41.960> level<00:06:42.260> that<00:06:42.380> I<00:06:42.530> simply

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
control tone on a level that I simply

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.610 
control tone on a level that I simply
hadn't<00:06:43.520> enjoyed
