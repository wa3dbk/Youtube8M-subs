octaves go so when you're playing the
octaves<00:05:25.790> you<00:05:26.000> know<00:05:26.120> obviously<00:05:26.630> you're

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
octaves you know obviously you're

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.930 
octaves you know obviously you're
playing<00:05:27.050> two<00:05:27.770> strings<00:05:27.830> apart<00:05:28.460> here<00:05:28.790> and

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
playing two strings apart here and

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.780 
playing two strings apart here and
you're<00:05:29.420> muting<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.110> string<00:05:30.470> in<00:05:30.590> between<00:05:30.790> with

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
you're muting the string in between with

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.550 
you're muting the string in between with
this<00:05:31.940> finger<00:05:32.150> so<00:05:32.750> that<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:32.960> only<00:05:33.050> get<00:05:33.230> the<00:05:33.380> two

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
this finger so that you only get the two

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.320 
this finger so that you only get the two
octave<00:05:33.950> note<00:05:34.480> so<00:05:36.640> you're<00:05:37.640> starting<00:05:37.820> with<00:05:38.210> an

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
octave note so you're starting with an

you<00:07:07.530> play<00:07:07.740> it<00:07:07.860> slightly<00:07:08.070> differently<00:07:08.490> because

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
you play it slightly differently because

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.920 
you play it slightly differently because
