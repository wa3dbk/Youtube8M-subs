00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
time I've used it in this series so my

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.240 
time I've used it in this series so my
attachments<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> red<00:01:19.619> dot<00:01:19.799> sight<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
attachments are the red dot sight the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850 
attachments are the red dot sight the
adjustable<00:01:20.670> stock<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.240> quick-draw<00:01:21.869> now

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
adjustable stock and quick-draw now

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
adjustable stock and quick-draw now
these<00:01:23.040> three<00:01:23.280> attachments<00:01:23.850> turn<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.240> very<00:01:24.270> good

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
these three attachments turn a very good

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
these three attachments turn a very good
weapon<00:01:25.110> into<00:01:25.590> an<00:01:25.680> absolute<00:01:26.130> killing<00:01:26.400> machine

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
weapon into an absolute killing machine

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.310 
weapon into an absolute killing machine
because<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.150> attachments<00:01:27.750> help<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
because these attachments help with the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200 
because these attachments help with the
long<00:01:28.470> range<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> close-range<00:01:29.579> gunfights<00:01:30.030> as

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
long range and close-range gunfights as

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940 
long range and close-range gunfights as
well<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.930> you've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> reflex<00:01:31.740> sight

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
well so you've got the reflex sight

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.289 
well so you've got the reflex sight
which<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> add<00:01:32.939> increased

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
which is going to add increased

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
which is going to add increased
precision<00:01:33.570> ads<00:01:34.110> accuracy<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.829> also<00:01:35.040> is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
precision ads accuracy and also is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.980 
precision ads accuracy and also is
removing<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.790> circle<00:01:36.240> iron<00:01:36.390> sight<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.780> well

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
removing that circle iron sight as well

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.270 
removing that circle iron sight as well
so<00:01:37.170> having<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> reflex<00:01:37.860> sight<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so having the reflex sight is going to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.319 
so having the reflex sight is going to
allow<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.520> nice<00:01:38.729> clear<00:01:39.000> view<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
allow you a nice clear view of the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.210 
allow you a nice clear view of the
target<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.380> quick-draw<00:01:40.590> handle<00:01:40.740> because

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
target and the quick-draw handle because

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
target and the quick-draw handle because
it<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.579> an<00:01:41.640> assault<00:01:41.880> rifle<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.450> EDS<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:43.020> is

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it is an assault rifle the EDS time is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.870 
it is an assault rifle the EDS time is
quite<00:01:43.439> slow<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.399> helps<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.700> speed

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
quite slow so this just helps to speed

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
quite slow so this just helps to speed

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
use on the fowl and I know some people

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.800 
use on the fowl and I know some people
might<00:02:17.190> be<00:02:17.220> tempted<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.700> use<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.270> select<00:02:18.570> fire

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
might be tempted to use the select fire

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.510 
might be tempted to use the select fire
I<00:02:19.050> know<00:02:19.710> that's<00:02:19.860> one<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.160> more<00:02:20.280> popular

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
I know that's one of the more popular

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.250 
I know that's one of the more popular
ones<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.750> would<00:02:21.960> advise

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
ones to put on it but I would advise

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.170 
ones to put on it but I would advise
against<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.830> mainly<00:02:23.310> because<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.670> recoil<00:02:23.820> is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
against it mainly because the recoil is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.390 
against it mainly because the recoil is
increased<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.900> fire<00:02:25.200> 150<00:02:26.040> rounds<00:02:26.310> per

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
increased and you fire 150 rounds per

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.340 
increased and you fire 150 rounds per
minute<00:02:26.520> less<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.150> also<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> two-shot<00:02:28.320> kill

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
minute less and also the two-shot kill

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.050 
minute less and also the two-shot kill
range<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.950> reduced<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.400> well<00:02:29.580> meaning<00:02:29.820> going

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
range is reduced as well meaning going

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.430 
range is reduced as well meaning going
to<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.300> put<00:02:30.450> three<00:02:30.630> bullets<00:02:30.930> into<00:02:31.080> people

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
to have to put three bullets into people

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.530 
to have to put three bullets into people
at<00:02:31.530> medium<00:02:31.860> range<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.970> know<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.300> tempting

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
at medium range so I know it's tempting

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.880 
at medium range so I know it's tempting

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
to put this like fire wrong because it's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.200 
to put this like fire wrong because it's
sort<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.100> like<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.370> easy<00:02:35.520> way<00:02:35.760> out<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.060> don't

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
sort of like the easy way out you don't

have<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.360> keep<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.600> hitting<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.900> fire<00:02:37.080> button

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.290 
have to keep on hitting the fire button
ball<00:02:37.830> times<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.160> second<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.760> if<00:02:39.180> you're

faster around corners and it's been a

move faster just hop so much of an

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.770

assault rifle and it makes you a lot

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.140 
assault rifle and it makes you a lot
harder<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.200> hit<00:03:13.380> next<00:03:14.220> I've<00:03:14.460> got<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.700> pick<00:03:14.880> tier

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
harder to hit next I've got to pick tier

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.750 
harder to hit next I've got to pick tier
-<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.570> need<00:03:15.630> per<00:03:15.870> -<00:03:16.050> agreed<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.980> those<00:03:17.490> perks

- so I need per - agreed and those perks

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.240 
- so I need per - agreed and those perks
are<00:03:17.970> toughness<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.540> scavenger<00:03:19.250> now

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
are toughness and scavenger now

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.190 
are toughness and scavenger now
toughness<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.790> my<00:03:20.910> opinion<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.870> best<00:03:21.900> perk

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
toughness in my opinion is the best perk

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.630 
toughness in my opinion is the best perk
in<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> game<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.980> they<00:03:23.070> have<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.400> pretty

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
in the game and they have it on pretty

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.060 
in the game and they have it on pretty
much<00:03:23.790> 95%<00:03:24.240> of<00:03:24.690> my<00:03:24.750> classes<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> only<00:03:25.440> one<00:03:26.040> I

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
much 95% of my classes the only one I

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.160 
much 95% of my classes the only one I
think<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.610> r870<00:03:27.450> time<00:03:27.690> frame<00:03:27.900> from<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
think is the r870 time frame from the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.930 
think is the r870 time frame from the
hip<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.130> pretty<00:03:29.430> much<00:03:29.520> anything<00:03:29.760> else

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
hip but on pretty much anything else

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.430 
hip but on pretty much anything else
they<00:03:30.150> have<00:03:30.240> toughness<00:03:30.600> on<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.959> especially

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
they have toughness on and especially

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.020 
they have toughness on and especially
with<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.650> file<00:03:31.830> class<00:03:32.070> when<00:03:32.370> every<00:03:32.850> bullet

firing all over the place and scavenger
is<00:03:39.060> needed<00:03:39.360> because<00:03:39.510> half<00:03:39.990> you<00:03:40.140> pick<00:03:40.350> ten

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
is needed because half you pick ten

revolves<00:03:41.070> around<00:03:41.160> your<00:03:41.400> guns<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.000> last

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
revolves around your guns so the last

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.310 
revolves around your guns so the last
thing<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.510> want<00:03:42.660> you'd<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.050> pick<00:03:43.170> up

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
thing you want you'd have to pick up

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.449 
thing you want you'd have to pick up
another<00:03:43.530> gun<00:03:43.770> off<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.890> ground<00:03:44.250> that's

another gun off the ground that's

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.190 
another gun off the ground that's

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
probably the worst case scenario when

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.290 
probably the worst case scenario when
using<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.590> class<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.430> scavenger<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.060> there

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300
