00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
definitely recommend you having if

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
you're going for if you're going for

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
you're going for if you're going for
doing<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.890> lot<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.399> damage<00:01:56.759> killing<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> lot<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
doing a lot of damage killing a lot of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.980 
doing a lot of damage killing a lot of
mobs<00:01:57.659> getting<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.170> lot<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:59.780> crystal<00:02:00.780> stuff

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
mobs getting a lot of that crystal stuff

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.319 
mobs getting a lot of that crystal stuff
that<00:02:01.110> makes<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.380> diamonds<00:02:01.880> one<00:02:02.880> thing<00:02:03.149> you're

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
that makes you diamonds one thing you're

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.850 
that makes you diamonds one thing you're
gonna<00:02:03.450> need<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:05.450> very<00:02:06.450> destroyed<00:02:06.930> now<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.770> do

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
gonna need is a very destroyed now I do

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.240 
gonna need is a very destroyed now I do
discover<00:02:08.819> they<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.270> video<00:02:09.629> actually

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
discover they do in this video actually

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.890 
discover they do in this video actually
axes<00:02:11.250> here<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.360> testing<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.750> because

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
axes here are just testing out because

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.850 
axes here are just testing out because
business<00:02:13.260> shortage<00:02:13.530> could

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
business shortage could

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.080 
business shortage could
which<00:02:13.980> were<00:02:14.100> not<00:02:14.250> working<00:02:14.460> they<00:02:14.790> are<00:02:14.820> not

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
which were not working they are not

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.140 
which were not working they are not
fully<00:02:15.570> calibrated<00:02:15.930> yet<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:17.340> there<00:02:17.940> are<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
fully calibrated yet so there are the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.910 
fully calibrated yet so there are the
messed<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.630> there<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.200> think<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.800> get

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
messed up there like I think here I get

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.320 
messed up there like I think here I get
one<00:02:20.070> yeah<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> get<00:02:20.520> one<00:02:20.610> my<00:02:20.730> dear<00:02:20.910> but<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:24.090> thing

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that can kill the zombies and to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.330 
that can kill the zombies and to
something<00:02:34.230> as<00:02:34.350> strong<00:02:34.560> as<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.830> stored<00:02:35.040> and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
something as strong as it stored and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580 
something as strong as it stored and
something<00:02:35.880> stronger<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.360> stored<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.840> an<00:02:37.260> axe

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
something stronger this stored is an axe

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.520 
something stronger this stored is an axe
that<00:02:38.040> hat<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.490> an<00:02:38.790> axe<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.450> has<00:02:39.600> passed<00:02:40.260> one

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
that hat is an axe that has passed one

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.160 
that hat is an axe that has passed one
efficiency<00:02:41.220> I've<00:02:41.910> got<00:02:42.390> an<00:02:42.480> accent<00:02:42.780> possible

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
efficiency I've got an accent possible

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.650 
efficiency I've got an accent possible
efficiency<00:02:43.410> at<00:02:43.800> plus<00:02:44.040> one<00:02:44.310> I'm<00:02:44.490> breaking<00:02:44.970> it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
efficiency at plus one I'm breaking it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.540 
efficiency at plus one I'm breaking it
was<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.080> was<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> level<00:02:46.620> 10<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:46.950> chairman<00:02:47.370> axe

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
was it was a level 10 in chairman axe

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.580 
was it was a level 10 in chairman axe
and<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.240> can<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.420> one<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.690> exactly<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.170> it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and you can be one of the exactly is it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.920 
and you can be one of the exactly is it
is<00:02:49.770> just<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:50.220> powerful<00:02:50.400> as<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> sword<00:02:51.180> now<00:02:51.900> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
is just as powerful as a sword now I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.300 
is just as powerful as a sword now I
don't<00:02:52.140> know<00:02:52.320> if<00:02:52.410> that's<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.800> bug<00:02:53.100> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
don't know if that's like a bug that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.190 
don't know if that's like a bug that
they're<00:02:53.400> gonna<00:02:53.520> fix<00:02:53.820> or<00:02:54.180> whatever<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.020> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
they're gonna fix or whatever but I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.810 
they're gonna fix or whatever but I
don't<00:02:55.230> know<00:02:55.440> why<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.700> powerful

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
don't know why that is this powerful

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.660 
don't know why that is this powerful
destroy<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.440> current<00:02:58.830> version<00:02:59.340> it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
destroy but in this current version it

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.290 
destroy but in this current version it
is<00:02:59.700> it<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.690> powerful<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:02.300> would

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
is it is this powerful so I would

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.510 
is it is this powerful so I would
definitely<00:03:03.840> recommend<00:03:03.900> having<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.950> axe<00:03:05.160> if

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
definitely recommend having that axe if

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.850 
definitely recommend having that axe if
you<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:05.760> not<00:03:05.910> all<00:03:06.060> your<00:03:06.209> locked<00:03:06.450> stored

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
you have not all your locked stored

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.750 
you have not all your locked stored
because<00:03:07.860> by<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.070> time<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.550> get<00:03:08.640> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
because by the time that you get the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.320 
because by the time that you get the
materials<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.300> actually<00:03:09.690> build<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:11.330> Nexus

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
materials to actually build the Nexus

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.380 
materials to actually build the Nexus
you're<00:03:13.140> going<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.800> most<00:03:14.130> likely<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.580> enough

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
you're going to most likely have enough

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.150 
you're going to most likely have enough
materials<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.050> enough<00:03:16.170> levels<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.709> make<00:03:16.920> an

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
materials and enough levels to make an

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.880 
materials and enough levels to make an
axe<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:18.080> now<00:03:19.080> stories<00:03:19.440> didn't<00:03:19.680> seem<00:03:19.799> to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
axe like that now stories didn't seem to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.710 
axe like that now stories didn't seem to
do<00:03:20.040> as<00:03:20.190> much<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.670> didn't<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.120> fully

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
do as much but I didn't have a fully

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.580 
do as much but I didn't have a fully
enchanted<00:03:22.230> store<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.739> didn't<00:03:23.010> make<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:24.590> by

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
enchanted store I didn't make one so by

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.630 
enchanted store I didn't make one so by
the<00:03:25.650> way<00:03:25.799> that's<00:03:25.980> how<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.370> seen<00:03:26.519> in<00:03:26.580> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
the way that's how you be seen in the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.390 
the way that's how you be seen in the
background<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:27.330> how<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.450> tried<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.930> make

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
background is it's how I tried to make

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.490 
background is it's how I tried to make
that's<00:03:29.400> for<00:03:29.580> 15<00:03:29.940> waves<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.540> only<00:03:31.290> three

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
that's for 15 waves and only three

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.220 
that's for 15 waves and only three
explosion<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.370> got<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.580> lot<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.090> damage<00:03:33.299> done<00:03:33.600> so

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
explosion it got a lot of damage done so

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.780 
explosion it got a lot of damage done so
I<00:03:34.260> would<00:03:34.650> not<00:03:34.769> recommend<00:03:34.980> building<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.580> tower

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
I would not recommend building a tower

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.610 
I would not recommend building a tower
at<00:03:36.060> all<00:03:36.180> although<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.810> does<00:03:37.019> look<00:03:37.260> cool<00:03:37.440> but

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
at all although it does look cool but

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.920 
at all although it does look cool but
you<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.830> see<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.100> holes<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.430> are<00:03:38.489> there

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
you can see all the holes that are there

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.880 
you can see all the holes that are there
it<00:03:39.930> was<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.080> pretty<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.470> was<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.590> fully

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
it was a pretty it was a fully

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.710 
it was a pretty it was a fully
functional<00:03:41.430> Tower<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.940> now<00:03:42.420> it's<00:03:42.630> just

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
functional Tower and now it's just

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.800 
functional Tower and now it's just
completely<00:03:43.110> destroyed<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.549> another<00:03:45.299> key

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
completely destroyed so another key

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.150 
completely destroyed so another key
thing<00:03:46.080> you're<00:03:46.380> gonna<00:03:46.530> want<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.769> do<00:03:46.920> is

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
thing you're gonna want to do is

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.789 
thing you're gonna want to do is
gathering<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.790> rift<00:03:48.120> flux<00:03:48.480> during<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
gathering the rift flux during the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.250 
gathering the rift flux during the
battle<00:03:50.160> now<00:03:50.820> this<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.209> very<00:03:51.360> important<00:03:51.930> for

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
battle now this is very important for

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.940 
battle now this is very important for
many<00:03:53.220> reasons<00:03:53.480> most<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.690> all<00:03:54.870> most<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.739> all<00:03:55.860> why

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
many reasons most of all most of all why

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.910 
many reasons most of all most of all why
this<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:56.880> important<00:03:57.360> is<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.620> want<00:03:58.860> to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
this is so important is that you want to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.390 
this is so important is that you want to
be<00:03:59.130> able<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.400> have<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.610> steady<00:03:59.940> supply<00:04:00.209> of

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
be able to have a steady supply of

be able to have a steady supply of
really<00:04:02.400> whatever<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.750> whatever<00:04:04.380> kind<00:04:04.650> of

really whatever it is whatever kind of
weapon<00:04:05.040> you're<00:04:05.160> having<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.610> riff<00:04:06.570> flux<00:04:06.900> can

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
weapon you're having and riff flux can

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.170 
weapon you're having and riff flux can
make<00:04:07.350> diamonds<00:04:07.650> so<00:04:08.370> if<00:04:08.700> you're<00:04:08.850> going<00:04:09.000> with

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
make diamonds so if you're going with

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.690 
make diamonds so if you're going with
the<00:04:09.269> axe<00:04:09.420> because<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.440> don't<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:11.040> have<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.489> check

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the axe because I don't I have to check

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.130 
the axe because I don't I have to check
what<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.030> cheaper<00:04:12.390> but<00:04:12.570> if<00:04:12.900> you're<00:04:13.019> going

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
what it's cheaper but if you're going

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.620 
what it's cheaper but if you're going
with<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.350> axe<00:04:13.530> then<00:04:14.370> you're<00:04:15.299> gonna<00:04:15.390> want<00:04:15.600> to

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
with the axe then you're gonna want to

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.719 
with the axe then you're gonna want to
me<00:04:16.260> diamonds<00:04:16.650> for<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.799> new<00:04:16.950> axe<00:04:17.160> after<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.609> get

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
me diamonds for a new axe after you get

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.060 
me diamonds for a new axe after you get
a<00:04:17.760> bunch<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.090> kills<00:04:18.299> because<00:04:18.540> trust<00:04:18.900> me<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
a bunch of kills because trust me in the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.610 
a bunch of kills because trust me in the
tower<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.239> went<00:04:22.020> for<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.200> very<00:04:22.349> long<00:04:22.590> time

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
tower I went for a very long time

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.529 
tower I went for a very long time
because<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.370> way<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.520> built<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> tower

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
because of the way I built the tower

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.260 
because of the way I built the tower
loving<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.440> lava<00:04:25.620> pit

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
loving the lava pit

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.480 
loving the lava pit
but<00:04:27.870> there's<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.560> below<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:28.979> there<00:04:29.220> was<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.340> lot

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
but there's it below it there was a lot

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.879 
but there's it below it there was a lot
of<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.610> pin<00:04:29.789> around<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.620> just<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.710> way<00:04:31.860> that

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
of a pin around it and just the way that

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.999 
of a pin around it and just the way that
was<00:04:32.099> built<00:04:32.340> but<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.759> think<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:34.470> better

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
was built but I think that a better

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.189 
was built but I think that a better
method<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.550> doing<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:35.819> kind<00:04:36.180> of<00:04:36.840> design

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
method of doing this kind of design

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.010 
method of doing this kind of design
where<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.680> hole<00:04:37.889> would<00:04:38.669> be<00:04:38.819> a<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.780> make<00:04:39.900> the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
where it's a hole would be a to make the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.730 
where it's a hole would be a to make the
hole<00:04:40.169> deeper<00:04:40.590> because<00:04:41.389> they<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:43.229> monsters

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
hole deeper because they the monsters

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.460 
hole deeper because they the monsters
they<00:04:43.979> do<00:04:44.039> not<00:04:44.940> get<00:04:45.210> directly<00:04:45.690> killed<00:04:45.990> we're

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
they do not get directly killed we're

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
they do not get directly killed we're
gonna<00:04:46.650> get<00:04:46.740> deep<00:04:46.860> enough<00:04:46.889> so<00:04:47.099> that<00:04:47.190> they<00:04:47.400> get

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
gonna get deep enough so that they get

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.999 
gonna get deep enough so that they get
killed<00:04:47.699> as<00:04:47.849> soon<00:04:47.970> as<00:04:48.060> they<00:04:48.150> fall<00:04:48.360> down<00:04:48.569> and<00:04:49.009> you

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
killed as soon as they fall down and you

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.100 
killed as soon as they fall down and you
want<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.430> make<00:04:50.580> your<00:04:51.360> little<00:04:51.539> room<00:04:51.870> in<00:04:52.020> the

want to make your little room in the

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.520 
want to make your little room in the
back<00:04:52.289> you<00:04:52.919> don't<00:04:53.099> want<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.580> just<00:04:53.610> be<00:04:54.530> you

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
back you don't want it to just be you

back you don't want it to just be you
don't<00:04:55.650> want<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.889> to<00:04:55.979> just<00:04:56.009> be<00:04:56.460> like<00:04:58.099> just<00:04:59.099> a

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
don't want it to just be like just a

dream like this you know what I'm
recommending<00:05:00.930> doing<00:05:01.620> is<00:05:01.710> making<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:02.300> true<00:05:03.300> wide

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
recommending doing is making a true wide

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.339 
recommending doing is making a true wide
too-tall<00:05:04.229> hallway<00:05:05.300> that's<00:05:06.349> approximately

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
too-tall hallway that's approximately

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.939 
too-tall hallway that's approximately
somewhere<00:05:07.979> around<00:05:08.190> 10<00:05:08.970> blocks<00:05:09.270> long<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:10.020> what

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
somewhere around 10 blocks long and what

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.710 
somewhere around 10 blocks long and what
this<00:05:11.099> is<00:05:11.220> gonna<00:05:11.310> do<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.849> is<00:05:11.880> it's<00:05:12.150> gonna

very important if you want to make it

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.710 
very important if you want to make it
one<00:05:16.500> why<00:05:16.710> -<00:05:16.770> hi<00:05:17.220> that<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:17.970> perfectly<00:05:18.419> fine

but I prefer to get more the kill to get
more<00:05:20.970> kills<00:05:21.210> rather<00:05:21.900> than<00:05:22.400> hold<00:05:23.400> off<00:05:23.550> the

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
more kills rather than hold off the

more kills rather than hold off the
spiders<00:05:24.060> it<00:05:24.180> completely<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:26.190> then<00:05:26.849> at<00:05:27.060> the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
spiders it completely and then at the

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.240 
enchanting table and you're also gonna
want<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.150> have<00:05:44.930> so<00:05:45.930> I<00:05:45.960> you're<00:05:46.740> also<00:05:46.830> gonna<00:05:47.039> want

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
want to have so I you're also gonna want

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.899 
want to have so I you're also gonna want
to<00:05:47.340> have<00:05:47.550> your<00:05:48.270> Nexus<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:48.990> that<00:05:49.979> will<00:05:50.310> in<00:05:50.610> my

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
to have your Nexus and that will in my

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:52.879 
to have your Nexus and that will in my
opinion<00:05:51.300> be<00:05:51.419> extremely<00:05:52.020> easier<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.560> defend

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
opinion be extremely easier to defend

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:00.350 
opinion be extremely easier to defend
now<00:05:53.759> I<00:05:54.259> think<00:05:55.259> that<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:58.190> big<00:05:59.190> dudes<00:05:59.789> should<00:06:00.240> be

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
now I think that the big dudes should be

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.480 
now I think that the big dudes should be
able<00:06:00.509> to<00:06:00.690> fit<00:06:01.020> through<00:06:01.289> there<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:01.979> can<00:06:02.370> see

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
able to fit through there I can see

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.890 
able to fit through there I can see
you're<00:06:02.610> up<00:06:02.729> here<00:06:02.880> my<00:06:03.000> axe<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.419> an<00:06:03.960> axe<00:06:04.490> with<00:06:05.900> I

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
you're up here my axe and an axe with I

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.600 
you're up here my axe and an axe with I
don't<00:06:07.620> know<00:06:07.740> if<00:06:07.830> I'm<00:06:07.889> mission<00:06:08.099> set<00:06:08.340> in<00:06:08.520> this

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
don't know if I'm mission set in this

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.920 
don't know if I'm mission set in this
video<00:06:08.880> put<00:06:09.360> an<00:06:09.479> axe<00:06:09.810> with<00:06:10.729> one<00:06:11.810> one<00:06:12.810> I'm

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
video put an axe with one one I'm

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.249 
video put an axe with one one I'm
breaking<00:06:13.380> and<00:06:13.620> one<00:06:13.979> I<00:06:14.219> think<00:06:14.490> it's<00:06:15.080> it's<00:06:16.080> not

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
breaking and one I think it's it's not

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.439 
breaking and one I think it's it's not
going<00:06:16.469> to<00:06:16.530> go<00:06:16.590> ahead<00:06:16.680> it's<00:06:16.949> in<00:06:17.159> one<00:06:17.819> efficiency

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
going to go ahead it's in one efficiency

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.390 
going to go ahead it's in one efficiency
there's<00:06:19.080> just<00:06:19.380> as<00:06:19.500> good<00:06:19.620> as<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.860> stored<00:06:20.130> and

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
there's just as good as the stored and

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.980 
there's just as good as the stored and
it<00:06:20.490> might<00:06:20.699> be<00:06:20.849> cheaper<00:06:21.090> I<00:06:21.300> have<00:06:21.419> to<00:06:21.539> check<00:06:21.719> in

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
it might be cheaper I have to check in

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.080 
it might be cheaper I have to check in
but<00:06:22.530> it<00:06:22.620> might<00:06:22.710> be<00:06:22.770> easier<00:06:22.830> to<00:06:23.130> get<00:06:23.400> that<00:06:23.729> kind

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
but it might be easier to get that kind

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.529 
but it might be easier to get that kind
of<00:06:24.150> axe<00:06:24.389> then<00:06:25.020> to<00:06:25.560> actually<00:06:25.919> get<00:06:26.039> this<00:06:26.130> stored

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
of axe then to actually get this stored

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.620 
of axe then to actually get this stored
so<00:06:27.680> just<00:06:28.680> a<00:06:28.740> quick<00:06:28.889> note<00:06:28.949> there<00:06:29.490> this<00:06:30.000> video<00:06:30.389> is

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.450 
more interesting in the rest of this
video<00:06:56.770> to<00:06:57.160> be<00:06:57.190> completely<00:06:57.640> honest<00:06:58.110> but<00:06:59.460> that

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
video to be completely honest but that

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.330 
video to be completely honest but that
will<00:07:01.060> be<00:07:01.270> it<00:07:01.480> for<00:07:01.810> this<00:07:02.230> video<00:07:02.470> I<00:07:02.620> believe<00:07:02.710> yeah

I got a couple more seconds here boom so
again<00:07:07.450> this<00:07:07.720> is<00:07:07.900> not<00:07:07.930> a<00:07:08.080> foolproof<00:07:08.470> idea<00:07:08.800> I

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
again this is not a foolproof idea I

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.500 
again this is not a foolproof idea I
just<00:07:09.070> want<00:07:09.340> to<00:07:09.400> get<00:07:09.460> first<00:07:09.730> video<00:07:10.030> out<00:07:10.150> and<00:07:10.180> I
