00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.249 
just just to make it easy for me and for
you<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.670> hear<00:01:26.850> me<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.479> believe<00:01:28.080> me<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you to hear me but you believe me that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.050 
you to hear me but you believe me that
this<00:01:28.470> has<00:01:28.680> full<00:01:28.920> sound<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this has full sound so you can see that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
this has full sound so you can see that
we<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> video<00:01:30.540> playing<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.320> very<00:01:31.500> crisp

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we have the video playing and very crisp

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.160 
we have the video playing and very crisp
very<00:01:32.040> clean<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.270> what's<00:01:33.689> really<00:01:33.840> interesting

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
very clean and what's really interesting

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.469 
very clean and what's really interesting
is<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> again<00:01:34.890> you've<00:01:35.250> got<00:01:35.430> full<00:01:35.670> multitasking

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
is it again you've got full multitasking

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.420 
is it again you've got full multitasking
so<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> video<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.770> playing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
so we can see the video actually playing

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.399 
so we can see the video actually playing
in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.210> background<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.720> same<00:01:39.930> time<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
in the background the same time as the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.230 
in the background the same time as the
other<00:01:40.500> applications<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.850> fact<00:01:42.030> those

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
other applications and in fact those

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.440 
other applications and in fact those
interested

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.610 

I

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.490 

we're<00:01:49.620> not<00:01:49.740> even<00:01:49.860> at<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> good<00:01:50.280> part<00:01:50.520> yet<00:01:51.500> so

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
we're not even at the good part yet so

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.990 
we're not even at the good part yet so
you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.830> see<00:01:52.980> here<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.370> hear<00:01:53.730> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you can see here you can hear you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.400 
you can see here you can hear you
probably<00:01:54.270> can't<00:01:54.450> hear<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.170> video

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
probably can't hear but that the video

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.510 
probably can't hear but that the video
is<00:01:55.530> actually<00:01:55.680> playing<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> background

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
is actually playing in the background

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.480 
is actually playing in the background
right<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.350> we're<00:01:58.350> sitting<00:01:58.470> here<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> in

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
right now we're sitting here in the in

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.620 
right now we're sitting here in the in
the<00:01:59.550> picture<00:01:59.910> of<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.030> parent<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.510> can

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
the picture of the parent we can

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.540 
the picture of the parent we can
actually<00:02:00.720> slide<00:02:01.140> slide<00:02:01.800> swipe<00:02:02.160> from<00:02:02.400> the

other<00:02:02.670> applications<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.510> move<00:02:03.690> as<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.290> can

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
other applications to move as you can

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.660 
other applications to move as you can
see<00:02:04.560> us<00:02:04.650> actually<00:02:04.830> going<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
see us actually going in and out of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.370 
see us actually going in and out of
these<00:02:05.760> applications<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:06.690> we<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
these applications or we can you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
these applications or we can you
actually<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.729> actual

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
actually see that the actual

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.240 
actually see that the actual
applications<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> task<00:02:10.110> switcher<00:02:10.500> okay

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
applications in the task switcher okay

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.580 
applications in the task switcher okay
very<00:02:11.670> simple<00:02:12.060> very<00:02:12.120> easy<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.600> use<00:02:12.750> let's<00:02:13.290> look

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
very simple very easy to use let's look

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.320 
very simple very easy to use let's look
will<00:02:13.740> kill<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> filipino<00:02:14.670> player<00:02:14.880> watch<00:02:15.150> it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
will kill the filipino player watch it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.000 
will kill the filipino player watch it
go<00:02:15.420> into<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.690> camera<00:02:15.900> here<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.770> reason<00:02:16.890> I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
go into the camera here and the reason I

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.350 
go into the camera here and the reason I
want<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.190> show<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.490> camera<00:02:17.850> it's<00:02:17.970> not<00:02:18.180> so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
want to show you the camera it's not so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.730 
want to show you the camera it's not so
much<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:19.080> know<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.320> I'm<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.590> take<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
much you know that I'm going to take a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.900 
much you know that I'm going to take a
picture<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.250> want<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.459> give<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.640> an<00:02:20.790> idea

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
picture but I want to give you an idea

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.180 
picture but I want to give you an idea
of<00:02:21.360> what's<00:02:21.690> possible<00:02:21.750> with<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.740> cameras<00:02:23.100> you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
of what's possible with the cameras you

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.230 
of what's possible with the cameras you
can<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.459> you're<00:02:23.580> obviously<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.030> black

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
can see you're obviously it's black

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.480 
can see you're obviously it's black
that's<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.740> cameras<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> back

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
that's because the cameras on the back

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.490 
that's because the cameras on the back
so<00:02:27.330> now<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.570> take<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> picture<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.350> all<00:02:28.440> of

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
so now I can take a picture of all of

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.100 
so now I can take a picture of all of
you<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.800> course<00:02:28.980> but<00:02:29.390> i'll<00:02:30.390> save<00:02:30.630> yourselves

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you of course but i'll save yourselves

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.630 
you of course but i'll save yourselves
what<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.470> really<00:02:31.740> wanted<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.010> show<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.310> also<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
what I really wanted to show is also the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.820 
what I really wanted to show is also the
fact<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.240> show<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:34.410> front<00:02:34.680> camera

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
fact that you can show the front camera

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.650 
fact that you can show the front camera
this<00:02:35.459> probably<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.120> don't<00:02:36.270> get<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.510> many

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
this probably do you don't get it many

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.900 
this probably do you don't get it many
shows<00:02:36.930> hi<00:02:39.140> nice<00:02:40.140> lights<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.620> above<00:02:40.860> what<00:02:41.790> you

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
shows hi nice lights up above what you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.130 
shows hi nice lights up above what you
can<00:02:42.060> also<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.570> can<00:02:42.690> switch<00:02:42.930> back<00:02:43.080> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
can also do is you can switch back and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.449 
can also do is you can switch back and
forth<00:02:43.320> between<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.770> camera<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.220> video

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
forth between the camera and the video

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.130 
forth between the camera and the video
camera<00:02:44.850> very<00:02:45.090> simply<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.600> easily<00:02:45.810> right

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
camera very simply and easily right

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.900 
camera very simply and easily right
within<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.530> same<00:02:46.680> application<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.760> can

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
within the same application and I can

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.280 
within the same application and I can
click<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.209> button<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.630> start<00:02:48.959> recording

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
click that button we can start recording

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.400 
click that button we can start recording
again<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:50.010> video<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.240> application<00:02:51.780> so

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
again a video of this application so

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.229 
again a video of this application so
you're<00:02:52.860> very<00:02:53.100> easy<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.459> use<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.820> what<00:02:53.970> what's

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
you're very easy to use and what what's

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.670 
you're very easy to use and what what's
unique<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.810> you'll<00:02:55.230> actually<00:02:55.320> be<00:02:55.560> able

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
unique is that you'll actually be able

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.070 
unique is that you'll actually be able
to<00:02:55.890> start<00:02:56.040> capturing<00:02:56.310> both<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.720> front<00:02:57.930> and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
time and then make it disappear if you

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.680 
time and then make it disappear if you
don't<00:04:03.610> want<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.849> to<00:04:03.909> be<00:04:04.000> on<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.209> screen<00:04:04.450> so

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
don't want it to be on the screen so

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.390 
don't want it to be on the screen so
kind<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.140> full<00:04:05.319> control<00:04:05.650> over<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.980> states<00:04:06.250> and

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
kind of full control over the states and

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.039 
kind of full control over the states and
how<00:04:06.489> that<00:04:06.549> works<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.120> can<00:04:07.269> see<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.480> at

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
how that works and you can see that at

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.780 
how that works and you can see that at
the<00:04:08.200> web<00:04:08.349> page<00:04:08.560> voted<00:04:08.950> without<00:04:09.190> any<00:04:09.400> trouble

so it's very easy and very simple to use

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.449 
so it's very easy and very simple to use
now<00:04:13.299> this<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:13.870> perhaps<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.680> most<00:04:14.799> exciting

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
now this is perhaps the most exciting

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.279 
now this is perhaps the most exciting
part<00:04:15.670> for<00:04:15.730> me<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.479> as<00:04:16.570> we've<00:04:16.750> mentioned<00:04:16.959> this

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
part for me so as we've mentioned this

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.759 
part for me so as we've mentioned this
is<00:04:17.440> going<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.650> support<00:04:17.979> opengl<00:04:18.639> 2.0<00:04:19.180> and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
is going to support opengl 2.0 and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.110 
is going to support opengl 2.0 and
what's<00:04:20.769> exciting<00:04:21.039> about<00:04:21.250> OpenGL<00:04:21.639> is<00:04:22.030> of

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
what's exciting about OpenGL is of

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.330 
what's exciting about OpenGL is of
course<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.810> richness<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.530> graphics<00:04:23.770> and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
course the richness and the graphics and

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.100 
course the richness and the graphics and
the<00:04:24.400> experience<00:04:24.910> we've<00:04:25.090> got<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:25.840> what<00:04:25.960> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
the experience we've got and so what the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.680 
the experience we've got and so what the
vendor<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:27.130> chip<00:04:27.639> manufacturer<00:04:28.210> using<00:04:28.630> is

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
vendor of the chip manufacturer using is

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.510 
vendor of the chip manufacturer using is
actually<00:04:28.810> built<00:04:29.169> up<00:04:29.410> some<00:04:29.620> very<00:04:29.830> simple<00:04:30.100> open

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
actually built up some very simple open

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.060 
actually built up some very simple open
GL<00:04:30.760> graphics<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.930> showcase<00:04:32.350> what's<00:04:32.620> possible

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
GL graphics to showcase what's possible

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.740 
GL graphics to showcase what's possible
on<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.340> tips<00:04:33.639> at<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.120> platform<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:34.690> you

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
on the tips at in the platform so you

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.330 
on the tips at in the platform so you
can<00:04:34.900> see<00:04:35.050> here<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.410> very<00:04:35.710> kind<00:04:35.979> of<00:04:36.039> simple

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
can see here a very kind of simple

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.219 
can see here a very kind of simple
global<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.150> earth<00:04:37.300> spinning<00:04:37.630> around<00:04:37.870> and

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
global the earth spinning around and

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.529 
global the earth spinning around and
then<00:04:38.380> shady<00:04:38.860> because<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.490> that<00:04:39.669> so<00:04:40.150> we<00:04:40.270> go<00:04:40.360> down

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
then shady because of that so we go down

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.760 
then shady because of that so we go down
we<00:04:40.570> can<00:04:40.810> actually<00:04:40.960> will<00:04:41.260> start<00:04:41.440> up<00:04:41.560> another

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
we can actually will start up another

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.159 
we can actually will start up another
one<00:04:41.979> so<00:04:42.160> start<00:04:42.400> up<00:04:42.520> one<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.169> showcases

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
one so start up one that showcases

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.200 
one so start up one that showcases
flowers<00:04:44.740> again<00:04:45.370> remember<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:45.910> I've<00:04:46.000> got<00:04:46.120> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
flowers again remember that I've got the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.070 
flowers again remember that I've got the
yellow<00:04:46.330> one<00:04:46.510> running<00:04:46.750> in<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:46.960> background

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
yellow one running in the background

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.830 
yellow one running in the background
okay<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:48.130> this<00:04:48.430> one's<00:04:48.669> also<00:04:48.849> building<00:04:49.240> flowers

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
okay so this one's also building flowers

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.330 
okay so this one's also building flowers
as<00:04:50.080> part<00:04:50.500> of<00:04:50.530> what<00:04:50.680> it's<00:04:50.800> doing<00:04:51.039> it<00:04:51.130> will<00:04:51.220> come

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
as part of what it's doing it will come

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.279 
as part of what it's doing it will come
back<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.699> one<00:04:51.820> in<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.060> second<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:53.139> then

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
back to that one in a second and then

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.689 
back to that one in a second and then
you've<00:04:53.440> got<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:53.740> one<00:04:53.949> called<00:04:54.190> sheeter<00:04:54.460> view

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
you've got this one called sheeter view

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:55.800 
you've got this one called sheeter view
which<00:04:54.820> is<00:04:54.940> actually<00:04:55.090> pictures<00:04:55.630> in<00:04:55.750> the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
which is actually pictures in the

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.779 
which is actually pictures in the
background<00:04:56.229> and<00:04:56.320> windows<00:04:56.830> will<00:04:57.400> actually

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
background and windows will actually

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.400 
background and windows will actually
move<00:04:57.970> across<00:04:58.300> those<00:04:58.599> pictures<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.020> actually

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
move across those pictures and actually

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.020 
move across those pictures and actually
change<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.919> so<00:05:00.039> you<00:05:00.130> can<00:05:00.250> actually<00:05:00.340> seen<00:05:00.699> in

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
change it so you can actually seen in

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.140 
change it so you can actually seen in
real<00:05:01.570> time<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:02.800> that<00:05:02.830> she<00:05:03.280> know<00:05:03.729> here's

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
real time that that she know here's

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.750 
real time that that she know here's
what's<00:05:04.389> really<00:05:04.479> impressive<00:05:05.139> you<00:05:06.070> can't<00:05:06.490> find

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
what's really impressive you can't find

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:15.320 
what's really impressive you can't find
a<00:05:06.940> platform<00:05:07.510> that<00:05:07.599> does<00:05:07.900> that

for<00:05:30.599> you<00:05:30.840> just<00:05:31.710> for<00:05:31.770> a<00:05:31.919> little<00:05:32.039> bit<00:05:32.159> of<00:05:32.340> fun

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
for you just for a little bit of fun

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.369 
for you just for a little bit of fun
we're<00:05:33.270> going<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.449> give<00:05:33.539> you<00:05:33.629> a<00:05:33.659> taste<00:05:33.930> of<00:05:34.169> some

we're going to give you a taste of some

we're going to give you a taste of some
of<00:05:34.469> the<00:05:34.530> types<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:34.860> things<00:05:35.009> you<00:05:35.189> can<00:05:35.310> expect<00:05:35.430> I

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
of the types of things you can expect I

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.490 
of the types of things you can expect I
think<00:05:36.060> from<00:05:36.150> a<00:05:36.270> game<00:05:36.449> perspective<00:05:36.629> in<00:05:37.439> terms

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
think from a game perspective in terms

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.719 
think from a game perspective in terms
of<00:05:37.770> what's<00:05:37.949> going<00:05:38.099> to<00:05:38.189> be<00:05:38.250> possible<00:05:38.400> this

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
of what's going to be possible this

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.760 
of what's going to be possible this
platform<00:05:39.000> had<00:05:39.840> one<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.199> guys<00:05:40.379> on<00:05:40.590> my<00:05:40.620> team

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
platform had one of the guys on my team

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.140 
platform had one of the guys on my team
actually<00:05:41.219> spent<00:05:41.580> a<00:05:41.639> little<00:05:41.759> bit<00:05:41.879> of<00:05:42.030> time

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
actually spent a little bit of time

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.939 
actually spent a little bit of time
porting<00:05:42.689> over<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.110> existing<00:05:43.319> quake<00:05:43.710> engine

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
porting over the existing quake engine

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.129 
porting over the existing quake engine
and<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:44.430> can<00:05:44.849> see<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.090> running<00:05:45.629> again<00:05:45.930> in

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
and you can see that running again in

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.249 
and you can see that running again in

so<00:06:00.360> we're<00:06:01.260> not<00:06:01.380> done<00:06:01.530> in<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.710> play<00:06:01.860> with<00:06:02.040> yet

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
so we're not done in the play with yet

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.700 
so we're not done in the play with yet
but<00:06:02.490> I<00:06:03.120> am<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:03.600> one<00:06:04.140> of<00:06:04.230> the<00:06:04.290> things<00:06:04.350> that<00:06:04.560> I

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
but I am and one of the things that I

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.780 
but I am and one of the things that I
wanted<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.070> actually<00:06:05.310> give<00:06:05.640> you<00:06:05.700> an

wanted to actually give you an

wanted to actually give you an
opportunity<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.300> show<00:06:06.510> you<00:06:06.540> is<00:06:06.780> that<00:06:06.840> as<00:06:07.260> we<00:06:07.440> go

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
opportunity to show you is that as we go
