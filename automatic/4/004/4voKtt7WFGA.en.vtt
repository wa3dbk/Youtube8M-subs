things

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
things

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.100 
things
and<00:03:47.100> just<00:03:48.100> talking<00:03:48.550> about<00:03:48.790> them<00:03:48.940> from<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.600> place

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
and just talking about them from a place

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.760 
and just talking about them from a place
of<00:03:50.760> not<00:03:51.760> watering<00:03:52.150> them<00:03:52.420> down<00:03:52.660> right<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.500> so
