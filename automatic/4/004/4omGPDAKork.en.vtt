we've got the DNA bond which i'd say i'd

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.469 
we've got the DNA bond which i'd say i'd
say<00:01:36.560> i'd<00:01:36.740> like<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.369> DNA<00:01:37.729> bomb<00:01:37.909> coming<00:01:38.119> back<00:01:38.360> in

say i'd like the DNA bomb coming back in
the<00:01:38.570> game<00:01:38.689> a<00:01:38.930> simple<00:01:39.439> fact<00:01:39.799> of<00:01:39.979> this<00:01:40.460> if<00:01:40.939> the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
the game a simple fact of this if the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.390 
the game a simple fact of this if the
DNA<00:01:41.299> bomb<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.720> back<00:01:41.930> in<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.229> game<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:43.189> means

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
DNA bomb is back in the game it means

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.800 
DNA bomb is back in the game it means
we've<00:01:43.579> got<00:01:43.700> like<00:01:43.820> nuclear<00:01:44.210> where<00:01:44.479> it's<00:01:44.600> hard

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
we've got like nuclear where it's hard

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.960 
we've got like nuclear where it's hard
to<00:01:44.930> get<00:01:45.020> it's<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.229> 30<00:01:45.470> kill<00:01:45.799> streak<00:01:46.040> ba<00:01:46.729> gun

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
to get it's a 30 kill streak ba gun

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.460 
to get it's a 30 kill streak ba gun
street<00:01:47.270> but<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:47.540> at<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.689> same<00:01:47.750> time<00:01:48.170> it's

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
street but then at the same time it's

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.450 
street but then at the same time it's
not<00:01:48.590> like<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.130> impossible<00:01:49.790> um<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:51.070> also<00:01:52.070> it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
not like it's impossible um and also it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.130 
not like it's impossible um and also it
doesn't<00:01:52.759> ruin<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.180> map<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.509> lets<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:53.780> call<00:01:53.990> in

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
doesn't ruin the map it lets you call in

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.600 
doesn't ruin the map it lets you call in
something<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.560> enemy<00:01:54.829> team<00:01:55.009> actually<00:01:55.220> know

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
something the enemy team actually know

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.330 
something the enemy team actually know
you<00:01:55.670> dn8<00:01:56.390> them<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> means<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.070> map

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
you dn8 them but it means that the map

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.999 
you dn8 them but it means that the map
doesn't<00:01:58.790> get<00:01:59.119> destroyed<00:01:59.299> or<00:02:00.110> ruined<00:02:00.829> with

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
doesn't get destroyed or ruined with

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.630 
doesn't get destroyed or ruined with
vision<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:02.240> also<00:02:02.869> it's<00:02:03.049> not<00:02:03.259> like<00:02:03.619> 24<00:02:04.399> kills

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
vision and also it's not like 24 kills

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.920 
vision and also it's not like 24 kills
in<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.850> row<00:02:04.880> which<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.509> be<00:02:05.600> honest<00:02:05.810> that's

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
in a row which to be honest that's

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.199 
in a row which to be honest that's
pretty<00:02:06.170> easy<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.560> do<00:02:06.680> 30<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.549> lot<00:02:07.790> harder<00:02:07.969> i

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
pretty easy to do 30 is a lot harder i

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.850 
pretty easy to do 30 is a lot harder i
know<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:08.509> only<00:02:08.570> six<00:02:08.929> more<00:02:09.049> kills<00:02:09.290> but<00:02:09.619> still

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
know it's only six more kills but still

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.220 
know it's only six more kills but still
and<00:02:10.070> then<00:02:10.880> along<00:02:11.390> with<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.780> quite<00:02:12.049> like

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
and then along with that I quite like

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.360 
and then along with that I quite like
the<00:02:12.320> idea<00:02:12.350> of<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.739> vicious<00:02:13.040> medal<00:02:13.280> when

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
the idea of the vicious medal when

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.530 
the idea of the vicious medal when
you're<00:02:13.489> kill<00:02:13.670> streets<00:02:13.880> go<00:02:14.060> toward<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.360> at<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
you're kill streets go toward it at the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.820 
you're kill streets go toward it at the
end<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.720> each<00:02:14.810> unique<00:02:15.140> but<00:02:15.349> it<00:02:15.440> doesn't<00:02:15.680> let

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
end of each unique but it doesn't let

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.330 
end of each unique but it doesn't let
you<00:02:15.920> call

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
you call

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.430 
you call
it<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:17.269> gives<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:17.629> medal<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.989> think<00:02:18.230> that

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
it just gives you a medal I think that

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.809 
it just gives you a medal I think that
was<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> very<00:02:18.800> clever<00:02:19.040> thing<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.430> they<00:02:19.550> did<00:02:19.610> an

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
was a very clever thing that they did an

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.059 
was a very clever thing that they did an
advanced<00:02:20.060> warfare<00:02:20.450> but<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.290> personally<00:02:21.920> think

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
advanced warfare but I personally think

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.380 
advanced warfare but I personally think
this<00:02:22.250> would<00:02:22.370> be<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.459> clever<00:02:22.700> idea<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.060> know<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.269> lot

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
this would be a clever idea I know a lot

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.610 
this would be a clever idea I know a lot
of<00:02:23.450> people<00:02:23.540> send<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.989> order<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.349> in<00:02:24.410> advance

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
of people send the order this in advance

of people send the order this in advance

game<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.629> actually<00:02:38.840> like<00:02:39.230> stop<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.160> gayness

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
game it actually like stop the gayness

game it actually like stop the gayness
lightly<00:02:40.760> MW<00:02:41.120> tunic<00:02:41.420> only<00:02:41.720> gonna<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.080> it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
lightly MW tunic only gonna get it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.220 
lightly MW tunic only gonna get it
through<00:02:42.230> gun<00:02:42.530> kills<00:02:42.799> obviously<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.489> then

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
through gun kills obviously and then

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.509 
through gun kills obviously and then
also<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.440> think<00:02:45.830> there<00:02:45.950> should<00:02:46.099> be<00:02:46.129> another

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
also I think there should be another

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.759 
also I think there should be another
thing<00:02:46.910> where<00:02:47.090> it's<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.269> 60<00:02:47.660> kill<00:02:47.900> streak<00:02:48.230> it's

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
thing where it's a 60 kill streak it's

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.140 
thing where it's a 60 kill streak it's
like<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.980> vicious<00:02:49.250> mellow<00:02:49.430> but<00:02:49.549> you<00:02:49.640> get<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.790> 60

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
like the vicious mellow but you get a 60

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.789 
like the vicious mellow but you get a 60
kill<00:02:50.299> streak<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.660> get<00:02:50.780> unstoppables<00:02:51.380> then

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
kill streak so you get unstoppables then

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.470 
kill streak so you get unstoppables then
the<00:02:51.920> movie<00:02:52.099> hits<00:02:52.280> 60<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.819> get<00:02:52.970> another<00:02:53.209> metal

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
the movie hits 60 you get another metal

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.210 
the movie hits 60 you get another metal
and<00:02:53.599> then<00:02:53.690> another<00:02:54.140> medal<00:02:54.500> when<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.680> hit<00:02:54.829> 90

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and then another medal when you hit 90

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.190 
and then another medal when you hit 90
120<00:02:55.940> etcetera<00:02:56.480> etcetera<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:56.840> think<00:02:57.019> I'd<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.170> a
