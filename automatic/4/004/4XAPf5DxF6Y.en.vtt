00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
you're just solving puzzles getting to

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.180 
you're just solving puzzles getting to
the<00:00:57.729> exit<00:00:58.180> with<00:00:58.600> help<00:00:58.839> of<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.140> portal<00:00:59.650> gun<00:00:59.680> and

the exit with help of a portal gun and

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.070 
the exit with help of a portal gun and
how<00:01:00.729> this<00:01:00.879> gun<00:01:01.030> works<00:01:01.239> as<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:01.540> pick<00:01:01.720> it<00:01:01.809> up<00:01:01.869> and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
you eventually power it up so you two

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.789 
you eventually power it up so you two
portals<00:01:04.089> at<00:01:04.180> once<00:01:04.390> one<00:01:04.780> blue<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.049> one<00:01:05.260> orange

and you can walk through these portals
to<00:01:07.930> kind<00:01:08.110> of<00:01:08.170> warp<00:01:08.380> yourself<00:01:08.710> around<00:01:08.950> these

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
to kind of warp yourself around these

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.100 
to kind of warp yourself around these
different<00:01:09.250> levels<00:01:09.760> physics<00:01:10.540> also<00:01:10.750> comes<00:01:10.960> into

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
different levels physics also comes into

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.990 
different levels physics also comes into
play<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.649> momentum<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.310> force<00:01:12.399> and<00:01:12.880> stuff

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
play and momentum and force and stuff

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.429 
play and momentum and force and stuff
like<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.299> where<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:13.840> know<00:01:13.930> you're<00:01:14.079> shooting

a portal on the floor and you have
another<00:01:15.609> one<00:01:15.759> up<00:01:15.880> high<00:01:16.060> you'll<00:01:16.359> jump<00:01:16.930> down

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
another one up high you'll jump down

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.810 
another one up high you'll jump down
into<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.439> hole<00:01:17.590> pick<00:01:17.859> up<00:01:17.950> some<00:01:18.100> speed<00:01:18.460> before

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
into the hole pick up some speed before

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.770 
into the hole pick up some speed before
you<00:01:18.880> hit<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.060> one<00:01:19.119> on<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.299> floor<00:01:19.479> then<00:01:19.659> come

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
you hit the one on the floor then come

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.139 
you hit the one on the floor then come
flying<00:01:20.140> out<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.439> one<00:01:20.560> on<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.710> top<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.189> the

flying out the one on the top and the

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.819 
flying out the one on the top and the
game<00:01:22.299> really<00:01:22.509> plays<00:01:22.840> off<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.350> these<00:01:23.439> different

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829

puzzle<00:01:24.250> elements<00:01:24.579> really<00:01:24.729> well<00:01:24.939> to<00:01:25.119> form<00:01:25.420> a

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
puzzle elements really well to form a

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.779 
puzzle elements really well to form a
really<00:01:26.259> interesting<00:01:26.829> kind<00:01:27.039> of<00:01:27.159> mind-bending

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
really interesting kind of mind-bending

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.240 
really interesting kind of mind-bending
game<00:01:28.329> but<00:01:29.140> what<00:01:29.289> really<00:01:29.439> stands<00:01:29.799> out<00:01:29.979> about

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
game but what really stands out about

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.039 
game but what really stands out about
portal<00:01:30.700> in<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.119> lot<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.270> ways<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.750> writing
