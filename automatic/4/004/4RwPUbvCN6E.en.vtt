construction of a steamer bot something
it<00:00:11.969> takes<00:00:12.150> advantage<00:00:12.330> if<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.019> price<00:00:13.320> that's

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
it takes advantage if a price that's

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.240 
it takes advantage if a price that's
moving<00:00:13.969> in<00:00:14.969> very<00:00:15.330> rapidly<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.160> that

you're<00:00:51.390> probably<00:00:51.570> familiar<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
you're probably familiar with the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.529 
you're probably familiar with the
concept<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> steamer<00:00:53.430> basically<00:00:54.059> your

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
concept of a steamer basically your

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.410 
concept of a steamer basically your
horse<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.960> being<00:00:55.199> backed<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
horse is being backed and because a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.849 
horse is being backed and because a
horse<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.750> being<00:00:57.870> back<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> other<00:00:58.379> people<00:00:58.710> back

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
horse is being back to other people back

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.349 
horse is being back to other people back
their<00:00:59.100> horse<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> pulls<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> price<00:01:00.149> in

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
their horse and it pulls the price in

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.939 
their horse and it pulls the price in
and<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> price<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.530> coming<00:01:01.800> in

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and because the price is coming in

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.470 
and because the price is coming in
people<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:02.969> think<00:01:03.149> hmm

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
people see that and think hmm

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
people see that and think hmm
market<00:01:04.170> knows<00:01:04.320> something<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.250> they

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
market knows something I don't so they

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.620 
market knows something I don't so they
jump<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> back<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> back<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
jump on the back and back it and the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
jump on the back and back it and the
whole<00:01:06.780> thing<00:01:06.810> goes<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> little<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> them

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
whole thing goes but a little of them

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
whole thing goes but a little of them
and<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.400> price<00:01:08.610> comes<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> comes<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and the price comes in and comes in and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.000 
and the price comes in and comes in and
comes<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.930> quite<00:01:10.170> dramatic<00:01:10.590> too<00:01:10.650> before<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
comes in quite dramatic too before the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.640 
comes in quite dramatic too before the
off<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.180> we're<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> benefit<00:01:13.409> from

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
off so if we're going to benefit from

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.770 
off so if we're going to benefit from
that<00:01:13.740> opportunity<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:15.090> need<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> place<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> back

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that opportunity we need to place a back

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
that opportunity we need to place a back
bet<00:01:16.049> first<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.979> exit<00:01:17.369> much<00:01:17.729> later<00:01:17.970> on

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
bet first and then exit much later on

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
bet first and then exit much later on
with<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> lay<00:01:18.540> bet<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.990> hedging<00:01:19.950> our<00:01:20.040> position

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
with a lay bet or hedging our position

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.890 
with a lay bet or hedging our position
so<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> first<00:01:21.210> thing<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.450> need<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.780> this

so the first thing we need to do on this

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
so the first thing we need to do on this
rule<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.920> need<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> general<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.850> we

a<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.979> need<00:01:44.189> some<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
a bit because we need some time for the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.030 
a bit because we need some time for the
move<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.750> continue<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.560> fact<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:46.950> I'm

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
move to continue so in fact what I'm

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.609 
move to continue so in fact what I'm
going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.640> I'm<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.390> say<00:01:48.619> operate

going to do is I'm going to say operate

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.679 
going to do is I'm going to say operate
this<00:01:49.829> rule<00:01:50.220> between<00:01:50.670> 10<00:01:51.090> minutes<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> 30

out<00:02:20.299> we're<00:02:20.989> going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.200> be<00:02:21.349> looking<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.890> place<00:02:22.099> a

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
out we're going to be looking to place a

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.850 
out we're going to be looking to place a
back<00:02:22.400> bet<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.110> we're<00:02:24.110> going<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.290> do<00:02:24.409> that<00:02:24.560> for

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
back bet and we're going to do that for

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.860 
back bet and we're going to do that for
10<00:02:25.010> pound<00:02:25.280> now<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:26.299> is<00:02:26.450> where<00:02:26.629> we<00:02:26.750> introduce

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
10 pound now this is where we introduce

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.750 
10 pound now this is where we introduce
the<00:02:27.470> clever<00:02:27.709> bit<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.099> rule<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.400> rule<00:02:28.549> that

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
the clever bit of the rule the rule that

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.149 
the clever bit of the rule the rule that
determines<00:02:29.450> what<00:02:30.019> triggers<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.500> back<00:02:30.920> there

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
determines what triggers that back there

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.690 
determines what triggers that back there
and<00:02:31.370> if<00:02:32.299> we<00:02:32.480> look<00:02:32.980> under<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.099> conditions<00:02:34.489> here

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
and if we look under the conditions here

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.569 
and if we look under the conditions here
and<00:02:35.030> we<00:02:35.239> go<00:02:35.359> to<00:02:35.420> new<00:02:35.840> apply<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:36.859> new<00:02:37.129> condition

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
and we go to new apply a new condition

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.640 
and we go to new apply a new condition
to<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.879> market<00:02:38.269> we're<00:02:38.989> going<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.200> apply<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
to the market we're going to apply the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.149 
to the market we're going to apply the
historic<00:02:40.370> relative<00:02:40.909> odds<00:02:41.150> condition<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.159> bit

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
historic relative odds condition a bit

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.220 
historic relative odds condition a bit
of<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.310> mouthful<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:43.909> what<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:44.870> does<00:02:44.930> is

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
of a mouthful but what this does is

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.110 
of a mouthful but what this does is
allows<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.799> look<00:02:45.980> back<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.519> see<00:02:46.700> where<00:02:46.970> her

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
allows you to look back to see where her

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.440 
allows you to look back to see where her
price<00:02:47.420> has<00:02:47.659> been<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.459> then<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.849> trigger<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.209> bit

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
price has been and then to trigger a bit

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.199 
price has been and then to trigger a bit
upon<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:50.989> condition<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.760> if<00:02:52.879> we<00:02:52.970> look<00:02:53.090> at

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
upon that condition so if we look at

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.000 
upon that condition so if we look at
this<00:02:53.680> we<00:02:54.680> are<00:02:54.709> saying<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.670> current<00:02:57.010> selection

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
this we are saying the current selection

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.119 
this we are saying the current selection
that<00:02:58.250> we<00:02:58.370> have<00:02:58.989> its<00:02:59.989> last<00:03:00.290> traded<00:03:00.769> price<00:03:00.799> you

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
that we have its last traded price you

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.530 
that we have its last traded price you
can<00:03:01.280> see<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.549> can<00:03:01.700> select<00:03:01.849> from<00:03:02.090> back<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.329> a

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
can see you can select from back to a

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.839 
can see you can select from back to a
price<00:03:02.810> or<00:03:03.019> last<00:03:03.170> traded<00:03:03.530> price<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.730> last

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
price or last traded price the last

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.170 
price or last traded price the last
traded<00:03:05.299> price<00:03:05.329> 60<00:03:06.260> seconds<00:03:06.650> ago<00:03:06.859> is<00:03:07.180> greater

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
traded price 60 seconds ago is greater

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.399 
traded price 60 seconds ago is greater
than<00:03:08.530> its<00:03:09.530> current<00:03:10.010> price<00:03:10.189> now<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.290> what<00:03:12.290> we

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
than its current price now and what we

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.589 
than its current price now and what we
can<00:03:12.590> actually<00:03:12.799> do<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.159> we<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:13.430> say<00:03:13.639> plus<00:03:14.299> or

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
can actually do is we can say plus or

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.099 
can actually do is we can say plus or
minus<00:03:14.720> X<00:03:15.530> number<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:15.980> ticks<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.480> or<00:03:17.840> we<00:03:17.959> could

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
minus X number of ticks so or we could

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.689 
minus X number of ticks so or we could
actually<00:03:18.230> do<00:03:18.530> odds<00:03:18.769> if<00:03:19.010> we<00:03:19.129> wanted<00:03:19.400> if<00:03:19.579> we

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
actually do odds if we wanted if we

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.059 
actually do odds if we wanted if we
wanted<00:03:19.879> to<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.030> fixed<00:03:20.449> value<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.769> we're

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
wanted to a fixed value so we're

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.009 
wanted to a fixed value so we're
basically<00:03:22.190> saying<00:03:22.609> here<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.419> last<00:03:23.599> traded

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
basically saying here the last traded

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.860 
basically saying here the last traded
price<00:03:24.049> sixty<00:03:24.620> seconds<00:03:25.010> ago<00:03:25.299> is<00:03:26.299> greater<00:03:26.629> than

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
price sixty seconds ago is greater than

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.460 
price sixty seconds ago is greater than
the<00:03:26.989> current<00:03:27.139> price<00:03:27.609> plus<00:03:28.609> five<00:03:29.569> ticks<00:03:29.930> so

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
the current price plus five ticks so

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.869 
the current price plus five ticks so
what<00:03:30.620> we're<00:03:30.739> saying<00:03:30.889> here<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.400> 60

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
what we're saying here is that 60

currently<00:03:37.129> is<00:03:37.340> now<00:03:37.780> now<00:03:38.780> when<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.139> implement

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
currently is now now when you implement

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.050 
currently is now now when you implement
this<00:03:39.680> rule<00:03:39.919> you're<00:03:40.310> going<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.519> have<00:03:40.669> to<00:03:40.790> decide

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
this rule you're going to have to decide

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.809 
this rule you're going to have to decide
whether<00:03:41.449> you<00:03:41.599> want<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.840> use<00:03:42.489> ticks<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.639> odds

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
whether you want to use ticks and odds

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.080 
whether you want to use ticks and odds
and<00:03:44.090> how<00:03:44.359> much<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.810> want<00:03:45.109> this<00:03:45.889> value<00:03:46.729> to<00:03:46.940> be

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
and how much you want this value to be

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.969 
and how much you want this value to be
so<00:03:47.389> maybe<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.870> want<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.079> use<00:03:48.139> 10<00:03:48.440> 20<00:03:48.769> ticks

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
so maybe you want to use 10 20 ticks

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.860 
so maybe you want to use 10 20 ticks
maybe<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.340> want<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:49.909> know<00:03:50.000> big<00:03:50.329> move<00:03:50.659> in

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
maybe you want to you know big move in

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.979 
maybe you want to you know big move in
the<00:03:50.959> last<00:03:51.109> 60<00:03:51.530> seconds<00:03:51.859> or<00:03:52.069> maybe<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.780> want<00:03:53.959> to

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989

the last 60 seconds or maybe you want to
look<00:03:54.139> two<00:03:54.650> minutes<00:03:54.949> ago<00:03:55.510> it's<00:03:56.510> up<00:03:56.659> to<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:56.959> how

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
look two minutes ago it's up to you how

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.599 
look two minutes ago it's up to you how
you<00:03:57.500> set<00:03:57.769> those<00:03:57.859> parameters<00:03:58.340> I'm<00:03:58.459> just

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
you set those parameters I'm just

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.699 
you set those parameters I'm just
showing<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.299> basic<00:03:59.810> rule<00:04:00.019> here<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.560> you

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
showing you a basic rule here that you

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.059 
showing you a basic rule here that you
can<00:04:00.889> use<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.750> if<00:04:02.840> we<00:04:02.930> apply<00:04:03.229> this<00:04:03.290> rule<00:04:03.650> now

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
can use so if we apply this rule now

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.949 
can use so if we apply this rule now
what's<00:04:04.280> going<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.489> happen<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.780> going<00:04:05.900> to

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
what's going to happen is it's going to

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.080 
what's going to happen is it's going to
be<00:04:06.109> looking<00:04:06.409> to<00:04:06.440> place<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.709> back<00:04:06.979> bet<00:04:07.280> between

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
to do that for 10 pan at the best

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.920 
to do that for 10 pan at the best
available<00:04:12.349> price<00:04:12.979> and<00:04:13.419> it's<00:04:14.419> going<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.720> be

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
available price and it's going to be

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.830 
available price and it's going to be
looking<00:04:15.319> at<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.489> price<00:04:16.729> of<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.030> favorite<00:04:17.449> 60

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
looking at the price of the favorite 60

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.649 
looking at the price of the favorite 60
seconds<00:04:18.199> ago<00:04:18.409> and<00:04:18.760> it's<00:04:19.760> going<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.940> see<00:04:20.389> if

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
seconds ago and it's going to see if

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.140 
seconds ago and it's going to see if
that<00:04:20.989> price<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:22.130> greater<00:04:22.580> than<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.000> current

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
that price is greater than the current

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.320 
that price is greater than the current
price<00:04:23.389> plus<00:04:23.900> 5

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
price plus 5

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.200 
price plus 5
tics<00:04:24.509> so<00:04:25.439> it's<00:04:25.590> basically<00:04:25.919> gonna<00:04:26.099> say<00:04:26.370> was<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
tics so it's basically gonna say was the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.570 
tics so it's basically gonna say was the
price<00:04:27.419> sixty<00:04:27.810> seconds<00:04:28.169> ago<00:04:28.379> five<00:04:29.159> ticks<00:04:29.430> or

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
price sixty seconds ago five ticks or

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.809 
price sixty seconds ago five ticks or
more<00:04:30.110> bigger<00:04:31.110> than<00:04:31.439> it<00:04:31.949> currently<00:04:32.129> worse<00:04:32.520> if

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
more bigger than it currently worse if

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.939 
more bigger than it currently worse if
so<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.120> will<00:04:33.419> place<00:04:33.629> this<00:04:33.810> bet<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.289> with<00:04:34.770> that

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
so I will place this bet and with that

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.100 
so I will place this bet and with that
we<00:04:35.069> can<00:04:35.189> apply<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.639> rule<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.900> can<00:04:37.020> see

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
we can apply the rule so you can see

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.409 
we can apply the rule so you can see
place<00:04:37.349> a<00:04:37.379> back<00:04:37.650> bet<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:38.310> details<00:04:39.060> all<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.330> the

start this process 10 seconds before the
start<00:05:19.440> or<00:05:19.620> something<00:05:19.800> just<00:05:20.759> to<00:05:20.909> make<00:05:21.060> sure<00:05:21.180> it

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
start or something just to make sure it

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.170 
start or something just to make sure it
hedges<00:05:21.509> once<00:05:21.719> and<00:05:21.960> then<00:05:22.050> again<00:05:22.319> if<00:05:22.740> necessary

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
hedges once and then again if necessary

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.129 
hedges once and then again if necessary
and<00:05:24.180> that's<00:05:24.389> all<00:05:24.509> we<00:05:24.629> need<00:05:24.779> to<00:05:24.810> do<00:05:24.930> with<00:05:25.020> that

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
and that's all we need to do with that

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.230 
and that's all we need to do with that
rule<00:05:25.400> we<00:05:26.400> don't<00:05:26.490> need<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.729> do<00:05:26.849> anything<00:05:27.029> else

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
rule we don't need to do anything else

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.230 
rule we don't need to do anything else
so<00:05:27.419> we<00:05:27.539> can<00:05:27.569> apply<00:05:27.840> that<00:05:27.930> rule<00:05:28.580> so<00:05:29.580> this<00:05:30.029> rule

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
so we can apply that rule so this rule

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.360 
so we can apply that rule so this rule
as<00:05:30.419> it<00:05:30.449> stands<00:05:30.810> will<00:05:31.110> basically<00:05:31.319> place<00:05:32.039> a<00:05:32.069> back

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
as it stands will basically place a back

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.879 
as it stands will basically place a back
bet<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:34.620> conditions<00:05:35.069> are<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:37.199> price<00:05:37.500> 60

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
bet the conditions are that the price 60

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.980 
bet the conditions are that the price 60
seconds<00:05:38.219> ago<00:05:38.340> was<00:05:38.520> greater<00:05:38.849> than<00:05:39.029> the<00:05:39.449> current

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
seconds ago was greater than the current

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.019 
seconds ago was greater than the current
price<00:05:40.080> plus<00:05:40.830> 5<00:05:41.099> ticks<00:05:41.430> so<00:05:41.610> we're<00:05:41.729> saying<00:05:41.879> it's

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
price plus 5 ticks so we're saying it's

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.010 
price plus 5 ticks so we're saying it's
moved<00:05:42.270> at<00:05:42.419> least<00:05:42.539> 5<00:05:42.839> ticks<00:05:43.110> in<00:05:43.349> this<00:05:44.219> direction

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
moved at least 5 ticks in this direction

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.140 
moved at least 5 ticks in this direction
and<00:05:46.020> if<00:05:46.110> it<00:05:46.229> has<00:05:46.379> done<00:05:46.560> 5<00:05:47.099> ticks<00:05:47.310> or<00:05:47.460> more<00:05:47.669> then

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
and if it has done 5 ticks or more then

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.459 
and if it has done 5 ticks or more then
it<00:05:48.180> will<00:05:48.389> basically<00:05:48.569> back<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.199> because<00:05:49.349> it

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
it will basically back it because it

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.309 
it will basically back it because it
thinks<00:05:49.710> it's<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:49.949> steamer<00:05:50.219> and<00:05:50.490> then<00:05:51.449> 10

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
thinks it's a steamer and then 10

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.140 
thinks it's a steamer and then 10
seconds<00:05:52.710> before<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:53.069> start<00:05:53.310> of<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.610> race<00:05:53.789> it

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
seconds before the start of the race it

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.249 
seconds before the start of the race it
will<00:05:54.240> basically<00:05:54.419> hedge<00:05:54.870> all<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.139> our

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
will basically hedge all of our

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.550 
will basically hedge all of our
positions<00:05:55.969> so<00:05:56.969> that<00:05:57.000> is<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.779> construction<00:05:58.229> of

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
positions so that is the construction of

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.499 
positions so that is the construction of
this<00:05:59.250> particular<00:05:59.580> rule<00:06:00.409> so<00:06:01.409> we<00:06:02.190> will<00:06:02.509> save

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
this particular rule so we will save

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.529 
this particular rule so we will save
that<00:06:03.719> particular<00:06:03.990> rule<00:06:04.379> and<00:06:04.879> then<00:06:05.879> we<00:06:06.360> will

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
that particular rule and then we will

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.129 
that particular rule and then we will
apply<00:06:06.839> it<00:06:06.900> to<00:06:07.889> all<00:06:08.129> these<00:06:08.310> markets<00:06:09.050> that<00:06:10.050> we

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
apply it to all these markets that we

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.779 
apply it to all these markets that we
have<00:06:10.319> available<00:06:10.830> to<00:06:10.949> us<00:06:10.979> at<00:06:11.190> the<00:06:11.250> moment<00:06:11.370> so<00:06:11.610> if

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
have available to us at the moment so if

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.329 
have available to us at the moment so if
I<00:06:11.909> select<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.509> rule<00:06:12.710> applied<00:06:13.710> to<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:13.949> market

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:14.339 
I select the rule applied to the market

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.990 
I select the rule applied to the market
and<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:15.120> will<00:06:15.270> start<00:06:16.610> activating<00:06:17.610> for<00:06:17.759> us<00:06:17.849> as

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
and that will start activating for us as

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.939 
and that will start activating for us as
soon<00:06:18.150> as<00:06:18.300> it<00:06:18.419> can<00:06:18.659> but<00:06:19.139> I'm<00:06:19.229> also<00:06:19.379> going<00:06:19.680> to<00:06:19.800> do

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
soon as it can but I'm also going to do

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.659 
soon as it can but I'm also going to do
here<00:06:20.250> is<00:06:21.080> I'm<00:06:22.080> going<00:06:22.379> to<00:06:22.710> get<00:06:23.190> Bettinger<00:06:23.520> to

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
here is I'm going to get Bettinger to

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.790 
here is I'm going to get Bettinger to
switch<00:06:23.879> to<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:24.120> market<00:06:24.419> automatically<00:06:25.080> so

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
switch to the market automatically so

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.579 
switch to the market automatically so
basically<00:06:26.279> when<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.580> next<00:06:26.849> race<00:06:27.120> is<00:06:27.360> upon<00:06:28.229> us

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:28.589 
basically when the next race is upon us

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:31.040 
basically when the next race is upon us
we<00:06:29.520> basically<00:06:29.699> switch<00:06:30.089> to<00:06:30.270> that<00:06:30.389> market<00:06:30.810> and

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
we basically switch to that market and

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.699 
we basically switch to that market and
activate<00:06:31.409> this<00:06:31.560> rule<00:06:31.800> and<00:06:32.009> then<00:06:32.669> we<00:06:32.789> can<00:06:33.709> have

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:34.709 
activate this rule and then we can have

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:36.139 
activate this rule and then we can have
a<00:06:34.740> look<00:06:34.889> and<00:06:35.099> see<00:06:35.339> if<00:06:35.430> this<00:06:35.550> rule<00:06:35.759> activates

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:36.149 
a look and see if this rule activates

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:37.399 
a look and see if this rule activates
because<00:06:36.449> of<00:06:36.539> course<00:06:36.659> the<00:06:36.779> price<00:06:36.990> could<00:06:37.229> drift

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
because of course the price could drift

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:38.090 
because of course the price could drift
and<00:06:37.589> therefore<00:06:37.860> the

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
and therefore the

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.330 
and therefore the
we'll<00:06:38.280> never<00:06:38.460> activate<00:06:39.470> but<00:06:40.470> likewise<00:06:40.950> it

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
we'll never activate but likewise it

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.640 
we'll never activate but likewise it
could<00:06:41.520> be<00:06:41.730> that<00:06:42.090> it<00:06:42.840> picks<00:06:43.110> up<00:06:43.230> on<00:06:43.440> the

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
could be that it picks up on the

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.510 
could be that it picks up on the
activity<00:06:44.160> and<00:06:44.450> then<00:06:45.710> activates<00:06:46.710> the<00:06:47.040> bet<00:06:47.220> and

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
activity and then activates the bet and

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.400 
activity and then activates the bet and
then<00:06:47.580> the<00:06:47.730> price<00:06:47.940> starts<00:06:48.750> to<00:06:48.900> move<00:06:49.020> in<00:06:49.200> from

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
then the price starts to move in from

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.380 
then the price starts to move in from
there<00:06:49.680> we<00:06:50.520> don't<00:06:50.700> know<00:06:50.790> that<00:06:50.820> at<00:06:51.030> this<00:06:51.150> stage

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.390 
there we don't know that at this stage

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.640 
there we don't know that at this stage
but<00:06:51.660> that's<00:06:51.900> obviously<00:06:52.170> what<00:06:52.350> the<00:06:52.440> rule<00:06:52.620> is

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
but that's obviously what the rule is

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.830 
but that's obviously what the rule is
designed<00:06:53.160> to<00:06:53.490> do<00:06:53.640> other<00:06:54.330> things<00:06:54.600> you<00:06:54.690> may<00:06:54.810> want

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
designed to do other things you may want

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.940 
designed to do other things you may want
to<00:06:55.020> do<00:06:55.140> is<00:06:55.230> you<00:06:55.320> may<00:06:55.410> want<00:06:55.440> to<00:06:55.620> apply<00:06:55.710> it<00:06:55.860> to

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
to do is you may want to apply it to

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.100 
to do is you may want to apply it to
more<00:06:56.190> than<00:06:56.310> one<00:06:56.520> runner<00:06:56.790> yeah<00:06:57.540> you<00:06:57.870> could<00:06:58.020> do

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
more than one runner yeah you could do

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.540 
more than one runner yeah you could do
the<00:06:58.230> opposite<00:06:58.500> you<00:06:58.620> can<00:06:58.740> make<00:06:58.920> it<00:06:59.040> a<00:06:59.130> drifting

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
the opposite you can make it a drifting

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.480 
the opposite you can make it a drifting
bot<00:07:00.380> but<00:07:01.380> basically<00:07:01.740> we've<00:07:02.010> just<00:07:02.250> set<00:07:02.340> up<00:07:02.430> a

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
bot but basically we've just set up a

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.340 
bot but basically we've just set up a
very<00:07:02.700> simple<00:07:02.910> version<00:07:03.180> of<00:07:03.480> it<00:07:03.600> here<00:07:03.630> so<00:07:04.200> let's

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
very simple version of it here so let's

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.930 
very simple version of it here so let's
go<00:07:04.500> and<00:07:04.650> see<00:07:04.860> what<00:07:05.340> happens

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
go and see what happens
