different<00:01:49.120> bridges<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.660> can<00:01:49.810> get<00:01:49.990> that's<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
different bridges you can get that's the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.930 
different bridges you can get that's the
highway<00:01:50.620> one<00:01:52.290> some<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.410> hump<00:01:53.650> bridge<00:01:53.980> and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
highway one some of the hump bridge and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.490 
highway one some of the hump bridge and
that's<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.360> low<00:01:55.510> one<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.990> figures<00:01:56.320> do

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
that's the low one and the figures do

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.140 
that's the low one and the figures do
stay<00:01:56.800> better<00:01:57.070> on<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.400> low<00:01:57.520> ones<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:58.060> I'd

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
stay better on the low ones so I'd

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.300 
stay better on the low ones so I'd
suggest<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.930> buy<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.260> low<00:01:59.500> ones<00:02:02.130> bit<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.250> a

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
suggest you buy the low ones bit of a

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.830 
suggest you buy the low ones bit of a
lake<00:02:03.490> there<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:04.210> get<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.390> nice<00:02:04.540> bit<00:02:04.810> of

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
lake there you get a nice bit of

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.980 
lake there you get a nice bit of
reflection<00:02:05.440> in<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.740> looks<00:02:05.980> quite<00:02:06.190> realistic

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
reflection in that looks quite realistic

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:17.940 
reflection in that looks quite realistic
and<00:02:07.990> some<00:02:08.770> more<00:02:08.980> mountains

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.570 

and<00:02:18.160> again<00:02:19.590> bits<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> castle

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
and again bits of the castle

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.550 
and again bits of the castle
oh<00:02:21.610> I've<00:02:22.270> quite<00:02:22.510> liked<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.810> castle<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.380> think

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
oh I've quite liked the castle I think

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.460 
oh I've quite liked the castle I think
it's<00:02:23.650> very<00:02:23.800> good<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:25.349> certainly<00:02:27.959> adds<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.349> the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
it's very good it certainly adds to the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.410 
it's very good it certainly adds to the
whole<00:02:30.360> scenario<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.459> four<00:02:33.670> come<00:02:33.880> over<00:02:34.270> this

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
whole scenario so four come over this

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.840 
whole scenario so four come over this
way<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:35.680> not<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> bit<00:02:36.069> here<00:02:36.280> I've<00:02:36.459> just<00:02:36.489> done

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
way it's not a bit here I've just done

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.550 
way it's not a bit here I've just done
with<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.209> streams<00:02:38.970> individual<00:02:39.970> hills<00:02:40.560> double

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
with the streams individual hills double

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:53.940 
with the streams individual hills double
hills<00:02:41.830> mountains<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.760> come<00:02:49.000> round<00:02:49.239> here<00:02:52.950> see

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
hills mountains just come round here see

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.850 
hills mountains just come round here see
how<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.040> stream<00:02:54.519> split<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.620> roads

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
how the stream split you and the roads

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.979 
how the stream split you and the roads
are<00:02:57.100> exactly<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.700> same<00:02:57.940> as<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.239> streams<00:02:58.569> but

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
are exactly the same as the streams but

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.660 
are exactly the same as the streams but
just<00:03:00.090> paint<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.299> differently

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:16.780 

give<00:03:06.670> me<00:03:06.790> some<00:03:07.030> idea<00:03:07.420> there
