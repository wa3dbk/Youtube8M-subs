I'm<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> make<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.270> scrap<00:01:18.630> plywood

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 

the<00:01:23.070> real<00:01:23.220> strength<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:24.000> scrap<00:01:24.540> card<00:01:24.840> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the real strength of this scrap card is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.590 
the real strength of this scrap card is
going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.229> come<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> base<00:01:26.270> there's<00:01:27.270> two

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
going to come from the base there's two

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.270 
going to come from the base there's two
seats<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.110> quarter<00:01:28.409> inch<00:01:28.440> plywood<00:01:28.830> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
seats of quarter inch plywood and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.660 
seats of quarter inch plywood and
sandwiched<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.390> between<00:01:30.420> them<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> lot<00:01:32.400> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
sandwiched in between them is a lot of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
sandwiched in between them is a lot of
half-inch<00:01:33.270> tall<00:01:33.570> by<00:01:33.930> inch<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> half<00:01:34.440> wide

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
half-inch tall by inch and a half wide

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.270 
half-inch tall by inch and a half wide
pieces<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.090> wood<00:01:36.630> basically<00:01:37.440> just<00:01:37.650> scrap<00:01:38.009> wood

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
pieces of wood basically just scrap wood

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.790 
pieces of wood basically just scrap wood
and<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.520> cut<00:01:38.759> half<00:01:38.970> an<00:01:39.149> inch<00:01:39.300> thick<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:40.740> is

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
and I cut half an inch thick this is

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.920 
and I cut half an inch thick this is
called<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> torsion<00:01:41.640> box<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.540> designed

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
called a torsion box and it's designed

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.280 
called a torsion box and it's designed
to<00:01:43.050> withstand<00:01:43.220> high<00:01:44.220> amounts<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.820> torque<00:01:45.290> high

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
to withstand high amounts of torque high

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.570 
to withstand high amounts of torque high
weights<00:01:46.649> without<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.899> bending<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.170> moving

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
weights without really bending or moving

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.160 
weights without really bending or moving
the<00:01:50.580> way<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> works<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.899> so

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the way it works is that you have so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
the way it works is that you have so
much<00:01:52.320> glue<00:01:52.590> surface<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.310> both<00:01:53.340> sides<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.240> this

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
much glue surface on both sides of this

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.900 
much glue surface on both sides of this
core<00:01:54.720> design<00:01:55.050> that<00:01:55.860> once<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.490> glued<00:01:56.610> into

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
core design that once it's glued into

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.749 
core design that once it's glued into
place<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:58.050> glue<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> dry<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:59.429> thing

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
place and the glue is dry this thing

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.960 
place and the glue is dry this thing
will<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.149> move<00:02:00.659> at<00:02:00.990> all

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
will not move at all

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.279 
will not move at all
you'll<00:02:02.970> see<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.330> video<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.810> how<00:02:03.960> well<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
you'll see in the video just how well it

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.190 
you'll see in the video just how well it
works<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.149> then<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.539> it<00:02:06.570> mobile<00:02:07.050> of

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
works and then to make it mobile of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:34.990 
works and then to make it mobile of
course<00:02:07.619> casters

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.280 

so<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.030> put<00:02:36.210> together<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.630> core<00:02:36.900> for<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
so I put together the core for the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.780 
so I put together the core for the
torsion<00:02:37.710> box<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.280> going<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.460> be<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> base<00:02:38.760> of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
torsion box it's going to be the base of

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.180 
torsion box it's going to be the base of
the<00:02:39.000> scrap<00:02:39.300> cart<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.930> ripped<00:02:40.500> everything<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the scrap cart I ripped everything to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.250 
the scrap cart I ripped everything to
about<00:02:41.490> half<00:02:41.910> an<00:02:42.090> inch<00:02:42.180> thick<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.960> top

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
about half an inch thick on the top

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.560 
about half an inch thick on the top
Smith<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:44.640> I'm<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.820> going<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.150> stapling

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
Smith and now I'm just going to stapling

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.660 
Smith and now I'm just going to stapling
it<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.810> place<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.830> staples<00:02:47.190> aren't<00:02:47.340> designed

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
it in place the staples aren't designed

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.010 
it in place the staples aren't designed
to<00:02:47.760> keep<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.060> from<00:02:48.180> moving<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.480> at<00:02:48.600> all<00:02:48.720> it's

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
to keep it from moving in at all it's

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.320 
to keep it from moving in at all it's
just<00:02:49.260> designed<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.860> hold<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.340> together<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:51.000> I

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
just designed to hold it together so I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.780 
just designed to hold it together so I
can<00:02:51.630> pick<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:51.960> up<00:02:52.220> throw<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.280> some<00:02:53.400> glue<00:02:53.610> on

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
can pick this up throw up some glue on

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:37.710 
can pick this up throw up some glue on
it<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.090> put<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> skin

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.240 

let's<00:03:38.720> see<00:03:38.870> just<00:03:39.050> how<00:03:39.170> strong<00:03:39.230> is<00:03:39.710> torsion<00:03:40.100> box

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
let's see just how strong is torsion box

00:03:40.250 --> 00:04:00.100 
let's see just how strong is torsion box
this<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:45.290> feels<00:03:45.740> pretty<00:03:46.069> during<00:03:46.459> so

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.360 

some<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.260> edges<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.680> wood<00:04:01.950> are<00:04:02.160> pre

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
some of the edges of this wood are pre

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.430 
some of the edges of this wood are pre
rough<00:04:02.670> gaps<00:04:03.330> are<00:04:03.600> up<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.959> an<00:04:04.050> eighth<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.319> an

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
rough gaps are up to an eighth of an

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.309 
rough gaps are up to an eighth of an
inch<00:04:04.530> or<00:04:04.770> so<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:05.450> really<00:04:06.450> wished<00:04:06.690> there<00:04:06.990> is<00:04:07.080> some

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
inch or so I really wished there is some

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.260 
inch or so I really wished there is some
kind<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.680> thicker<00:04:08.100> glue<00:04:08.520> something<00:04:09.030> little

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
kind of thicker glue something little

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.260 
kind of thicker glue something little
thicker<00:04:09.510> than<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:10.110> yellow<00:04:10.830> glue<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.940> had<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
thicker than a yellow glue that had the

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.750 
thicker than a yellow glue that had the
strength<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.840> screws<00:04:13.170> or<00:04:13.410> nails<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:14.069> call<00:04:14.640> it

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
strength of screws or nails I call it

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.180 
strength of screws or nails I call it
something<00:04:15.090> like<00:04:15.120> fluid<00:04:15.959> nail<00:04:16.260> or<00:04:16.709> liquid

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
something like fluid nail or liquid

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:56.340 
something like fluid nail or liquid
screw<00:04:17.669> or<00:04:17.910> something<00:04:23.120> thank<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.300> dear

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.620 

now<00:04:57.350> let's<00:04:57.620> glue<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:57.860> up<00:04:58.040> I'm<00:04:58.910> gonna<00:04:59.180> go<00:04:59.270> inside

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
now let's glue it up I'm gonna go inside

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.420 
now let's glue it up I'm gonna go inside
because<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:00.380> liquid<00:05:00.740> nail<00:05:00.890> is<00:05:01.040> making<00:05:01.340> me

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
because this liquid nail is making me

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:51.380 
because this liquid nail is making me
high<00:05:01.700> as<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.910> kite

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.230 

finally<00:05:52.390> I<00:05:52.630> have<00:05:53.140> all<00:05:53.320> my<00:05:53.530> wits<00:05:53.830> sorted<00:05:54.490> I'm
