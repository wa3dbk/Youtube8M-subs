as well as you could say that's your
spindle<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.580> turned<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.000> on

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.210 

that's<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.490> low<00:01:52.670> range<00:01:52.940> right<00:01:53.270> there<00:01:53.570> boy<00:01:54.409> go

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
that's the low range right there boy go

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.750 
that's the low range right there boy go
for<00:01:55.520> it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
for it

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.690 
for it
okay<00:01:58.440> let's<00:01:59.440> gonna<00:01:59.620> put<00:01:59.890> into<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.100> higher<00:02:00.400> range

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
okay let's gonna put into a higher range

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.219 
okay let's gonna put into a higher range
now<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:06.520> are<00:02:06.670> three<00:02:06.910> ranges<00:02:07.270> up<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.540> 1800

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
now there are three ranges up to 1800

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:24.790 
now there are three ranges up to 1800
rpm<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.979> middle<00:02:09.220> range

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.030 

4:25

that's<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.150> reverse<00:03:56.770> ceaseless<00:03:57.770> yep<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:59.180> we

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
that's the reverse ceaseless yep so we

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.570 
that's the reverse ceaseless yep so we
did<00:03:59.450> forward<00:03:59.780> reverse<00:03:59.960> high<00:04:00.890> low<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.460> medium
