00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 

the<00:01:19.200> middle<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.740> super<00:01:20.100> thick<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.579> it's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the middle is super thick like it's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.029 
the middle is super thick like it's
always<00:01:21.000> been<00:01:21.329> even<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:21.810> I've<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.039> relaxers

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
always been even when I've had relaxers

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:29.480 
always been even when I've had relaxers
it<00:01:23.369> was<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> curls<00:01:25.979> are<00:01:28.310> trying<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> think

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it was and the curls are trying to think

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
it was and the curls are trying to think
about<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.060> they're<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> little<00:01:30.840> bit

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
about it I think they're a little bit

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
about it I think they're a little bit
wider<00:01:31.740> than<00:01:31.920> they<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> front<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
wider than they are in the front and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.929 
wider than they are in the front and
also<00:01:33.630> I'll<00:01:33.810> show<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.170> picture<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.939> um

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
also I'll show you a picture of that um

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.450 
also I'll show you a picture of that um
so<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.780> could<00:01:36.990> compare<00:01:37.679> it<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> front<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so you could compare it to the front and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.309 
so you could compare it to the front and
so<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> could<00:01:39.030> compare<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> last<00:01:39.810> month's

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
so you could compare it to last month's

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:50.980 
so you could compare it to last month's
hopefully<00:01:40.799> -<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.399> still<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> pictures
