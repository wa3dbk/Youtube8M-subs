by<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.670> placing<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:34.079> heap<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> repeaters<00:01:35.210> like

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
by just placing a heap of repeaters like

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.969 
by just placing a heap of repeaters like
this<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:38.119> putting<00:01:39.119> them<00:01:39.299> all<00:01:39.450> 24<00:01:42.979> now

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
this and then putting them all 24 now

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
this and then putting them all 24 now
like<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> then<00:01:46.229> put<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> piece<00:01:46.619> of

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
like that and then put a piece of

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.720 
like that and then put a piece of
redstone<00:01:47.899> back<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> other<00:01:49.110> way

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.490 

and<00:01:54.730> then<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.570> can<00:01:55.690> put<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.020> in<00:01:56.170> your<00:01:56.200> server

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
and then you can put this in your server
