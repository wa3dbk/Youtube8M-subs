00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:16.810
 today test ford b-max diesel from 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.869
 Processing her a bit 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.130
 You might have plastic 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.189
 can do little better here goes 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.200
 again a center console 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:32.680
 otherwise from the processing of a 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:36.719
 Steering wheel right standard I stop 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.410
 family car and now let's see 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.410
 how the thing goes 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.220
 the first gear one is quite good 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.820
 Steering and missing customers street 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:13.479
 I like that quite calmly 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:23.009
 here and there administration is right 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:25.409
 The city runs smoothly and narrow streets 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.729
 neat what you have to get used to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:40.450
 so a little bit higher sits in such a 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:44.170
 small car on base so on the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.340
 Highway with the little nemax look 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.340
 what the little Lisa gives 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.940
 you put this man 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940
 think 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.290
 it will be a bit long 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.200
 place 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.850
 40 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.850
 Actually behaves completely 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.260
 did not notice it 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.260
 lived 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.180
 live love 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.600
 pretty much done 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.920
 60 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.890
 Bad cars drove 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.490
 concerned 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.750
 the whole soup 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.400
 important point agreed 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.040
 Family cars is that you are sure 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.040
 to not confirm 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.990
 slow down too much 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.680
 elevated position 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.680
 and say yes 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.520
 this character you 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.780
 a little bit 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.780
 abgucken 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.720
 right 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.630
 very well 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.210
 pauli train we test still stood 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.790
 once again 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:41.430
 a bit on the highway or in 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.430
 the city pure and already done 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.910
 30 a little bit already jerking 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.970
 left little man it seems good too 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:06.800
 his 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:06.800
 so tell from the outside where from behind 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:21.519
 let's take a look at the side 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:31.420
 including the entry of two funds resp 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:34.050
