been<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.050> difficult<00:00:49.260> project<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
been a very difficult project from that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.920 
been a very difficult project from that
sense<00:00:50.760> from<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> very<00:00:51.420> beginning<00:00:51.809> because

sense from the very beginning because
we're<00:00:52.230> trying<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.649> teach<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:53.010> something

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
we're trying to teach them something

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.770 
we're trying to teach them something
which<00:00:53.399> isn't<00:00:53.670> traditionally<00:00:54.329> taught<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
schools a fuse lab were imagining what

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.779 
schools a fuse lab were imagining what
life<00:00:57.719> might<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> new<00:00:58.680> planet<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
life might be like on a new planet and I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
life might be like on a new planet and I
was<00:01:00.120> kind<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> leading<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.840> through<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
was kind of leading them through the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
was kind of leading them through the
paces<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> challenges<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.270> set

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
paces and the challenges that we set

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
paces and the challenges that we set
every<00:01:03.690> day<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.470> try<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.460> think<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.729> said

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
every day to try and really think I said

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.120 
every day to try and really think I said
in<00:01:06.030> box<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.720> come<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.140> new<00:01:07.200> ideas<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.770> as

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in box and come up with new ideas and as

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.580 
in box and come up with new ideas and as
new<00:01:08.369> innovations<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.000> would<00:01:09.150> exist<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.750> on

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
new innovations that would exist and on

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.710 
new innovations that would exist and on
this<00:01:10.890> planet<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.700> could<00:01:11.850> take<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> to

this planet that we could take and to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.450 
this planet that we could take and to
think<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.439> resources<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.159> might<00:01:14.310> only

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
think about what resources we might only

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.570 
think about what resources we might only
think<00:01:14.729> about<00:01:14.970> using<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> new<00:01:17.040> planet<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
think about using on a new planet to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.820 
think about using on a new planet to
build<00:01:17.790> civilizations<00:01:18.170> habitats<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.560> what

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
build civilizations habitats and what

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.640 
build civilizations habitats and what
food<00:01:20.159> people<00:01:20.549> might<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.960> 75<00:01:22.470> hours

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
food people might want to it's 75 hours

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.990 
food people might want to it's 75 hours
we<00:01:22.860> start<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> countdown<00:01:23.310> clock<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.880> they're

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
we start a countdown clock when they're

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.660 
we start a countdown clock when they're
live<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:25.049> start<00:01:25.380> giving<00:01:25.590> ideas<00:01:26.220> from

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
live and they start giving ideas from

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.590 
live and they start giving ideas from
straight<00:01:26.939> away<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> first<00:01:27.509> night

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
straight away on the first night

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.539 
straight away on the first night
throughout<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.500> days<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.829> followed<00:01:29.369> their

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
throughout the days that followed their

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.249 
throughout the days that followed their
imagination<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.479> incredible<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
imagination which is incredible and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.960 
imagination which is incredible and
actually<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.950> an<00:01:32.040> imagination<00:01:32.610> back<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
actually not just an imagination back to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.880 
actually not just an imagination back to
the<00:01:33.210> reality<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> their<00:01:34.020> ability<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the reality and their ability to a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.280 
the reality and their ability to a
five-out<00:01:35.549> imagination<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.540> every<00:01:36.810> practical

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
five-out imagination and every practical

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.560 
five-out imagination and every practical
sense<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.369> there's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.640> couple<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.060> activities

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
sense so there's a couple of activities

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.880 
sense so there's a couple of activities
today<00:01:39.780> where<00:01:40.110> they've<00:01:40.229> been<00:01:40.380> working<00:01:40.530> with

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.170 
also be social innovation projects that
sort<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.350> thing<00:02:03.410> so<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:04.550> all<00:02:04.670> about<00:02:04.730> giving

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180

so<00:02:10.040> that<00:02:10.070> they<00:02:10.250> can<00:02:10.520> understand<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.330> key

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
so that they can understand the key

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.320 
so that they can understand the key
quite<00:02:12.200> subtle<00:02:12.670> requirements<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.820> people<00:02:14.150> who

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
quite subtle requirements of people who

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.680 
quite subtle requirements of people who
actually<00:02:14.630> go<00:02:15.350> out<00:02:15.530> there<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.980> create<00:02:16.690> things

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
in the real world these are really

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.400 
in the real world these are really
encompass<00:02:20.210> quite<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.540> lot<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.870> things<00:02:21.080> like<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
encompass quite a lot of things like the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.250 
encompass quite a lot of things like the
marketing<00:02:21.920> at<00:02:22.070> I'm<00:02:22.540> well<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.570> didn't<00:02:23.990> even<00:02:24.050> know

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
marketing at I'm well I didn't even know

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.080 
marketing at I'm well I didn't even know
about<00:02:24.350> science<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.920> having<00:02:25.220> market<00:02:25.640> products

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
about science and having market products

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.400 
about science and having market products
and<00:02:26.270> things<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.990> found<00:02:27.260> that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
and things like that so I found that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.950 
and things like that so I found that
really<00:02:27.470> am<00:02:27.920> Jason<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.760> came<00:02:29.330> into<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.630> process

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
really am Jason I came into the process

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.810 
really am Jason I came into the process
hanging<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.380> wasn't<00:02:30.530> creative<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.490> didn't

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
hanging on wasn't creative and I didn't

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.280 
hanging on wasn't creative and I didn't
know<00:02:31.910> how<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.120> do<00:02:32.360> these<00:02:32.540> things<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.080> that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
know how to do these things and that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.850 
know how to do these things and that
science<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.250> just<00:02:35.350> experiments<00:02:36.350> in<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.530> lab

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
science is just experiments in the lab

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.440 
science is just experiments in the lab
so<00:02:37.220> i<00:02:37.250> think<00:02:37.370> i'm<00:02:37.640> going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.880> take<00:02:38.240> up<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
so i think i'm going to take up the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.960 
so i think i'm going to take up the
signs<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.590> very<00:02:39.770> artistic<00:02:40.400> if<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.790> can

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
signs of very artistic if you can

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.970 
signs of very artistic if you can

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
there's lots of things involved with it

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.970 
there's lots of things involved with it
when<00:02:43.790> they<00:02:43.940> leave<00:02:44.150> here<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.660> want<00:02:45.290> them<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.590> go

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
when they leave here I want them to go

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.460 
when they leave here I want them to go
away<00:02:46.100> having<00:02:46.930> experienced<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.990> whole<00:02:48.140> bunch<00:02:48.350> of

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
away having experienced a whole bunch of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.710 
away having experienced a whole bunch of
things<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:49.370> stimulate<00:02:50.060> them<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.570> think

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
things that stimulate them to think

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.110 
things that stimulate them to think
differently<00:02:51.110> about<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.440> world<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.120> I'm

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
differently about the world and I'm

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.480 
differently about the world and I'm
hoping<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:54.050> amongst<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.620> 75<00:02:55.250> hours

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
hoping that in amongst the 75 hours

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.090 
hoping that in amongst the 75 hours
worth<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:56.030> new<00:02:56.330> ideas<00:02:56.530> there<00:02:57.530> are<00:02:57.680> one<00:02:57.920> two

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
worth of new ideas there are one two

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.460 
worth of new ideas there are one two
three<00:02:58.520> or<00:02:58.640> four<00:02:58.670> maybe<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.840> they<00:03:00.020> really

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
three or four maybe that they really

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.820 
three or four maybe that they really
feel<00:03:01.130> an<00:03:01.340> affinity<00:03:02.300> for<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:03.200> don't<00:03:03.410> think<00:03:03.740> we

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
feel an affinity for I don't think we

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.520 
feel an affinity for I don't think we
could<00:03:03.950> have<00:03:03.980> really<00:03:04.310> imagined<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.090> meet<00:03:05.240> for<00:03:06.230> a

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
could have really imagined to meet for a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.490 
could have really imagined to meet for a
more<00:03:06.980> people<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.520> we're<00:03:08.510> going<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.720> infuse

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
more people that we're going to infuse

more people that we're going to infuse
so<00:03:09.680> many<00:03:09.860> ideas<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.400> make<00:03:10.520> it<00:03:10.640> seem<00:03:10.850> so

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
so many ideas and make it seem so

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.090 
so many ideas and make it seem so
realistic<00:03:11.390> I've<00:03:12.020> got<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.320> hope<00:03:12.530> for<00:03:12.950> the

future of idea of makers I thinkers and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.070 
future of idea of makers I thinkers and
scientists<00:03:16.700> if<00:03:16.880> these<00:03:17.090> guys<00:03:17.300> are<00:03:17.360> around<00:03:17.630> I

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
scientists if these guys are around I

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.680 
scientists if these guys are around I
feel<00:03:18.350> alright

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
feel alright
