native<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> Provence<00:02:25.890> region<00:02:26.160> we<00:02:26.940> have

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
native to the Provence region we have

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.510 
native to the Provence region we have
increased<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.960> calcium<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.069> soil<00:02:29.100> with

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
increased the calcium in the soil with

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.920 
increased the calcium in the soil with
oyster<00:02:29.880> shells<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.330> also<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.780> reflection

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
oyster shells and also the reflection

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.620 
oyster shells and also the reflection
and<00:02:31.620> these<00:02:32.220> English<00:02:32.610> Lavender<00:02:32.850> have<00:02:33.360> just

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
and these English Lavender have just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.780 
and these English Lavender have just
reduced<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.560> many<00:02:34.740> flowers<00:02:35.010> we've<00:02:35.430> had<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
reduced so many flowers we've had to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.430 
reduced so many flowers we've had to
trim<00:02:36.000> around<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.330> body<00:02:36.540> made<00:02:36.900> him<00:02:37.050> little

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
trim around the body made him little

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.830 
trim around the body made him little
microclimate<00:02:38.430> yeah<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.819> shells<00:02:39.090> are<00:02:39.360> really

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
microclimate yeah the shells are really

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.620 
microclimate yeah the shells are really
good<00:02:40.080> for<00:02:40.319> reflecting<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> heat<00:02:41.209> if<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.450> a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
good for reflecting the heat if it a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.570 
good for reflecting the heat if it a
great<00:02:43.080> resource<00:02:43.470> here<00:02:43.770> on<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.920> peninsula<00:02:44.040> and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
great resource here on the peninsula and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.730 
great resource here on the peninsula and
we<00:02:45.360> thought<00:02:45.540> we'd<00:02:45.720> experiment<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:46.350> them<00:02:46.530> I

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
we thought we'd experiment with them I

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.650 
we thought we'd experiment with them I
understand<00:02:47.460> it's<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.910> we'll<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.420> same

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
understand it's and we'll do the same

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.420 
understand it's and we'll do the same
thing<00:02:48.960> she<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.440> white<00:02:49.650> there<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.160> white

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
thing she can be white there a white

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.160 
thing she can be white there a white
sound<00:02:50.760> will<00:02:50.880> do<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> same<00:02:51.330> thing<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:51.870> that's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
sound will do the same thing but that's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.690 
sound will do the same thing but that's
much<00:02:52.410> more<00:02:52.590> expensive<00:02:52.770> than<00:02:53.070> these<00:02:53.280> oyster

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
much more expensive than these oyster

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.490 
much more expensive than these oyster
shells<00:02:53.910> oh<00:02:54.390> look<00:02:54.840> at<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.020> this<00:02:55.200> white

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
shells oh look at all this white

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.590 
shells oh look at all this white
lavender<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.310> very<00:02:56.610> seldom<00:02:56.850> see<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.390> much

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
lavender and very seldom see that much

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.980 
lavender and very seldom see that much
white

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
white

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.900 
white
lavender<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.470> one<00:02:58.650> place<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.460> beautiful

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
lavender in one place it's beautiful

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.940 
lavender in one place it's beautiful
contrast<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.990> garden<00:03:01.320> if<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.470> have<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.740> lot

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
contrast in a garden if you have a lot

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.490 
contrast in a garden if you have a lot
of<00:03:01.980> lavenders<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.820> it's<00:03:03.330> very<00:03:03.840> very<00:03:04.110> frank

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
of lavenders and it's very very frank

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.410 
of lavenders and it's very very frank
with<00:03:04.560> variety<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.430> now<00:03:05.610> look<00:03:05.820> at<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.150> you've

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
with variety and now look at this you've

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.990 
with variety and now look at this you've
really<00:03:06.810> burned<00:03:07.710> this<00:03:07.920> lavender<00:03:08.370> back<00:03:08.700> that's

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
really burned this lavender back that's

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.640 
really burned this lavender back that's
one<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.390> things<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.810> find<00:03:10.020> very<00:03:10.440> difficult

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
one of the things I find very difficult

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.250 
one of the things I find very difficult
well<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:11.940> difficult<00:03:12.240> Emily<00:03:12.990> last

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
well it's not that difficult Emily last

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.930 
well it's not that difficult Emily last
week<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.740> harvested<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.340> for<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> fresh

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
week we harvested this for the fresh

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.120 
week we harvested this for the fresh
market<00:03:15.210> well<00:03:15.690> yeah<00:03:15.960> it's<00:03:16.560> critical<00:03:17.100> that

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
market well yeah it's critical that

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.620 
market well yeah it's critical that
you're<00:03:17.370> very<00:03:17.490> aggressive<00:03:17.670> with<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.390> pruning

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
you're very aggressive with the pruning

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.840 
you're very aggressive with the pruning
if<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.050> take<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.800> plant<00:03:20.070> down<00:03:20.340> where<00:03:20.640> there's

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
if you take the plant down where there's

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.430 
if you take the plant down where there's
only<00:03:21.030> about<00:03:21.420> an<00:03:21.600> inch<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:21.990> half<00:03:22.020> or<00:03:22.410> two

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
only about an inch and a half or two

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.410 
only about an inch and a half or two
inches<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.550> year's<00:03:23.820> growth<00:03:24.090> left

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
inches of the this year's growth left

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.660 
inches of the this year's growth left
it'll<00:03:25.050> ensure<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:25.770> real<00:03:26.010> dense<00:03:26.310> plant

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
it'll ensure you have a real dense plant

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.640 
it'll ensure you have a real dense plant
the<00:03:26.820> next<00:03:27.090> year<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.660> print<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.050> when<00:03:28.530> do

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the next year and you print it when do

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.990 
the next year and you print it when do
you<00:03:28.710> prune<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.130> well<00:03:29.340> we<00:03:29.430> prune<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.730> when<00:03:29.880> we

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
you prune it well we prune it when we

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.030 
you prune it well we prune it when we
harvest<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.900> printed<00:03:31.230> again<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.800> fall

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
harvest we printed again in the fall

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.800 
harvest we printed again in the fall
when<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.370> have<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.550> second<00:03:32.940> harvest<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.690> then<00:03:33.780> I
