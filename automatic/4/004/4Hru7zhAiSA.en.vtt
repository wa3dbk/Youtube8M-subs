00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.840
 and your heart is barely 18 inches 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.780
 almost 47 centimeters from your brain not very 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.120
 far true then why will it be so 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.490
 difficult not only to read the Bible but also 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.710
 actually understand it from the depth 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.090
 of its origin because it takes us so much 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.700
 time to understand the way in which 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.160
 transform our lives there 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.560
 probably many reasons but this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 It's a very good 200 years before 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.369
 Christ a Greek translation of the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.530
 bible divided whole books into 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.839
 small sections so all would fit in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 one roll the order of the books 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.249
 changed sometimes simply from the most 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.440
 long to shorter in the 13th century 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:46.289
 the books were divided into chapters 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.260
 in the 15th century the division by 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.079
 verses so that there would be more text 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.339
 they divided the pages into two columns 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.920
 notes and comments were added 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.350
 Over time the footers also 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.989
 and the red ink rose boom with the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.620
 spend time and where we 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.989
 took all this 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.700
 bible of the present filled with many more 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.010
 addictions all with good intentions 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.869
 but it does not feel like more like a 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.940
 reference book that a story of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.619
 love we are not for the good of the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.049
 bible only bits instead of reading 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.430
 the whole story of god then we 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.470
 we asked what if we could 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.790
 return the time pages to 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.409
 free the bible from the many 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.509
 additions that history has made 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.490
 it will be that then the word of God 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.540
 and flow more freely from the head 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.550
 up to the heart 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.619
 we started by putting the books in a 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.479
 best historical order the books that 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.060
 they had been separated we came back 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.619
 to count them we eliminate the red ink the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.270
 division by verses the foot of 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.429
 page the notes up to the number of 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.220
 chapters we put everything in one 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.560
 column like the original and we call it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.210
 the bible books such a bible 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.929
 innovative but that had existed 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.000
 always then we keep thinking that 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.830
 such if we do not perform more if 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.710
 we experience the word of God in 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.409
 community then we decided to design a 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.819
 10-day daily reading plan 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.130
 invite you to come together in community 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.649
 once a week to talk about your 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.539
 questions and discoveries in only eight 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.060
 weeks you will have read all the new 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.709
 testament as you never imagined it to 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.170
 this experience in community the 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.970
 we call the word cool the best 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.220
 way to move the truths of God 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.590
 from your head to the place where 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.050
 really belong the books of the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.810
 bible and community experience 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.230
 the word cool very soon in your 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.230
 heart
