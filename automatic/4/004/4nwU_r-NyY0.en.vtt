grip<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.270> bottom<00:00:42.480> saves<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> lot<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.860> space

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
grip on the bottom saves a lot of space

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.470

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.490 
it on my camera here it's quite a tight
fit<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.449> but<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.600> sliding<00:00:54.870> quite<00:00:55.289> nicely

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
fit there but it's sliding quite nicely

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.750 
fit there but it's sliding quite nicely
and<00:00:57.079> just<00:00:58.079> tighten<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.730> a

finger or thumb and to be honest you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.820 
finger or thumb and to be honest you
don't<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.930> need<00:01:07.049> any<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.500> than<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
don't really need any more than a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.899 
don't really need any more than a
fingernail<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:09.390> tighten<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:10.729> I'd<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
fingernail to tighten that up I'd be a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.789 
fingernail to tighten that up I'd be a
bit<00:01:12.090> worried<00:01:12.390> about<00:01:12.600> tearing<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> leather<00:01:13.560> if

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
bit worried about tearing the leather if

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.080 
bit worried about tearing the leather if
I<00:01:13.950> did<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> any<00:01:14.700> tighter<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:17.280> last<00:01:17.490> video<00:01:17.820> might

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
I did a any tighter the last video might

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.469 
I did a any tighter the last video might
have<00:01:18.210> saw<00:01:19.670> about<00:01:20.670> brightening<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.240> frame

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
have saw about brightening the frame

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.149

using manual focus lenses I did actually

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.520 
using manual focus lenses I did actually
have<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.119> case<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.570> while<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:28.200> using<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
tripod so it's quite stable enough the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
tripod so it's quite stable enough the
leather<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:32.579> helps<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> grip<00:01:33.479> onto<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
leather actually helps it grip onto the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.539 
leather actually helps it grip onto the
tripod<00:01:34.740> plate<00:01:35.250> which<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.610> quite<00:01:35.820> nice

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
tripod plate which is quite nice

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.870

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.840 
for me I've got fairly big hands it
actually<00:01:42.390> adds<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:43.740> tiny<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.820> on

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
actually adds that little tiny bit on

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
actually adds that little tiny bit on
the<00:01:45.090> bottom<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.600> which<00:01:46.110> makes<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.740> my

to take it off to get the memory card or

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.670 
to take it off to get the memory card or
the<00:02:30.530> battery<00:02:30.920> out<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.959> would<00:02:33.200> be<00:02:33.230> nice<00:02:33.470> if

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
the battery out it would be nice if

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.080 
the battery out it would be nice if
there<00:02:33.800> was<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:34.130> hole<00:02:34.400> here<00:02:34.430> see<00:02:35.060> that

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
there was a little hole here see that

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.110 
there was a little hole here see that
you<00:02:35.330> could<00:02:35.450> get<00:02:36.130> sorry<00:02:37.130> other<00:02:37.489> side<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.060> you

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
you could get sorry other side so you

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.199 
you could get sorry other side so you
could<00:02:38.300> get<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:39.370> USB<00:02:40.370> port<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.030> see

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
could get to the USB port and so on see

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.210 
could get to the USB port and so on see
wouldn't<00:02:41.510> have<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.930> necessarily<00:02:42.350> take<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.100> off

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
wouldn't have to necessarily take it off

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.479 
wouldn't have to necessarily take it off
to<00:02:43.370> download<00:02:43.760> your<00:02:43.880> images<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.190> I've

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
to download your images but I I've

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.490 
to download your images but I I've
noticed<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.120> bottom<00:02:47.720> my<00:02:47.810> camera<00:02:48.230> was

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
noticed the the bottom my camera was

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.050 
noticed the the bottom my camera was
getting<00:02:48.800> scratched<00:02:49.250> when<00:02:49.640> I'm<00:02:49.730> putting<00:02:49.940> it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
getting scratched when I'm putting it

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.460 
getting scratched when I'm putting it
down<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:50.620> surfaces<00:02:51.620> when<00:02:51.830> I'm<00:02:51.920> out<00:02:52.100> shooting

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
down on surfaces when I'm out shooting

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.600 
down on surfaces when I'm out shooting
this<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.620> going<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.830> protect<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.280> bottom<00:02:55.459> of

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
this is going to protect the bottom of

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.030 
this is going to protect the bottom of
the<00:02:55.670> camera<00:02:55.870> hopefully<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.650> know<00:02:57.769> when<00:02:57.950> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the camera hopefully you know when the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.650 
the camera hopefully you know when the
time<00:02:58.250> comes<00:02:58.580> I'll<00:02:58.790> be<00:02:58.820> able<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.120> sit<00:02:59.299> on<00:02:59.420> for<00:02:59.600> a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
time comes I'll be able to sit on for a

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.810 
time comes I'll be able to sit on for a
bit<00:02:59.810> more<00:03:00.070> when<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.250> not<00:03:01.400> covering<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
bit more when it's not covering the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.930 
bit more when it's not covering the
scratches<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:04.040> me<00:03:04.130> it's<00:03:04.280> an<00:03:04.430> investment

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
scratches so for me it's an investment

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.320 
scratches so for me it's an investment
and<00:03:05.200> it's<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.470> cheapest<00:03:06.860> one<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.040> found<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.790> it

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
and it's the cheapest one I found and it

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.360 
and it's the cheapest one I found and it
looks<00:03:08.690> really<00:03:09.200> good<00:03:09.350> out<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.190> looks

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
looks really good out of it it looks

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.539 
looks really good out of it it looks
really<00:03:10.610> nice<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.860> I'll<00:03:12.860> put<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.070> link<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.459> the
