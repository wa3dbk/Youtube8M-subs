00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:13.389
 another part of my project series Photoshop about Cow questions me 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.539
 Today I want to show you 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.220
 I in my pictures 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.940
 certain contrasts can increase locally 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.579
 I'll show you this by example as you see it 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.140
 to the little example Bönig 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.120
 Pace the contrast really targeted to specific places of a height 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.510
 To be able to represent the contrast around the picture much more plastically 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.280
 whenever I have pictures that have such contrast strong areas 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 so 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.220
 if that is now without his stone figure with a flowing robe or if that 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.240
 Portrait photo are 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.579
 where the persons 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.670
 mm 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.149
 things-lasting percent the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.940
 Strong wrinkles throw up here strengthened, sheens reports 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.450
 with hawk-trainer or back 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.530
 then you have the opportunity to work with this technique here 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.840
 First of all, never add new levels for you 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.100
 Peter Tass new levels icon 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 and fill this level now with 50 percent Kroupa 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.430
 that could be over 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.950
 Control of the 5 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.230
 or with punk construction work 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.230
 Fill area » 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.280
 in which above 50% mourning 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.990
 confirm with ok and set the levels for with or on each other 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.049
 Copying through the 50% grape is based in this level with or nothing at all 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.030
 a neutral gray and now he has the opportunity 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.400
 either with a tip very high with doping 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.530
 belongs to black and white color to dismiss certain areas 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.460
 lighten 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.690
 darkened with Schwartz I ran only the whole time now more 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.240
 with such black net but you can darken here is important here 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 even that in the very low opacity here so represents 12 to 15 percent 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.670
 we see if I just give it that darkened and if I'm with 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.189
 white color times 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.259
 the whole thing gets lightened here 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:17.289
 Alternatively, you can do the unwind and the laugh 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.479
 it works the same way with the 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.889
 From neither tool I light up certain areas 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.879
 how's it easy in your picture the areas rows are already bright and 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.779
 He keeps that up even further 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.129
 So here you see the area the gorgeous still on 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.169
 Dr book here the gorgeous on the is not quite as accurate 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.819
 Brendan land go 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.819
 You see, I work here relatively quickly and quickly 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:52.019
 and so firefight I go to the cheap tool and go the dark edges 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:52.710
 here 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.739
 after round 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.139
 draw your draw after 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.009
 When you're done, it looks like this 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.019
 just out 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.699
 Here you see that 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:09.579
 Previous comparison after you can here Pels whole according to your wishes 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.659
 and if that's too strong for you now, the opacity could be hers 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.740
 Tillich continuously stepless set 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.740
 and adapt to your wishes 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.809
 in addition to this 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.829
 Graul level here is still a black and white level inserted even with the low 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.869
 the force of just under 20 percent to just the road surface bit of exterior 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.269
 rauszunehmen 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.549
 i show you so sat out it was relative 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.669
 strong in color that's why I have here 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.340
 APA of the power from the black and white plane 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.250
 lowered a bit and thus discovered a little less color 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.930
 yes you can with this technique could share their parts 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.770
 over the circumference lower the 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.310
 Such contrasting areas have education 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:02.479
 Rothenstein structures be it portrait pictures persons the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.819
 Throw things that throw the strong wrinkles that you can here with this 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.140
 Technology wonderful 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.800
 highlight and 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.640
 create a very special look
