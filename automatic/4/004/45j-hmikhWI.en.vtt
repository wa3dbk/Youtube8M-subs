00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.990
 Hello, this time I'm going to show you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.960
 how do I make chairs for model 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.750
 with paper battery 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.530
 it's a very simple design that I'm going to 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.530
 show them 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.050
 The first thing we need is 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.890
 select the thickness of the paper battery 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.890
 what are we going to use 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.230
 I'm going to use a medium thickness 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.560
 the piece was needed 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.140
 and a pencil sharpener 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:57.220
 let's sharpen our pencil 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.010
 to make thinner strokes and we're going to 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.850
 mark the width of our chair with 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 Scale help I'm plotting 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:14.230
 40 centimeters to scale 1 50 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.230
 Do not use the scale you need 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:22.990
 I made several dots for later with 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.170
 the help of a rule join them 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.189
 then proceed to cut them with the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.189
 cutter help 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.250
 since you have a band-aid with the width of 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.690
 your chair you are going to use again the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.430
 scaler 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.780
 and you are going to draw 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.280
 the backrest the height and space of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.530
 seat that has your chair I used 80 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.530
 40 and 45 centimeters 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.080
 then you are going to cut those little ones 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.080
 pieces 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.650
 the small pieces I do not use a 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.420
 rule only me and with the lines of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.420
 can of my cutting board 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.330
 since you have those pieces 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.330
 let's stick them 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.980
 I will use liquid silicone you use 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.240
 the glue you prefer, let's go 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.420
 to need a needle 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.610
 unclogs the needle from the back and 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.730
 fill it with the glue that you're going to 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.730
 use 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:02.250
 once you fill your syringe lid 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.250
 and we are going to remove the needle carefully 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.400
 I show it in the video until it 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.400
 detach the needle 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.350
 in this way 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.260
 You can place small amounts of 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.260
 Glue on the pieces that you need 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.040
 Ideally, you would give me your 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:32.830
 backrest 45 centimeters to paste 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.830
 Part I figured I only 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.190
 save your chair as shown in the 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.190
 video 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.610
 wait for it to dry 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.180
 and now let's paint 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.940
 this time I will use paint what 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.000
 I'm going to paint with coffee so use 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.870
 water and coffee 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.810
 until you have a mixture 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.810
 that you can use to paint 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.130
 The darker the mix, the more 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.480
 thick it will be but you can achieve many 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.730
 tones painting with coffee 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.730
 paint your piece perfectly 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.830
 and hope that I know that I will show you 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.170
 another option 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.860
 If you do not want to leave the squares so 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:43.540
 you can make some cuts like 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.540
 the ones that I'm showing in the video 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.040
 if the cutter seems uncomfortable 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.689
 you can use an exact that is more 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.409
 delgadito 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.409
 and sharp 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.440
 you are going to cut one like 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.100
 which I will use a mold on 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.540
 my back of the chair 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.540
 so that they remain the same 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.430
 so there will also cut your ship 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:27.120
 you have those pieces 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.680
 you are going to paste it also only what 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.680
 calculate not measured 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.600
 Wait for it to dry and paint 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:47.130
 to this chair I want a lighter tone 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.130
 so my mixture will be more liquid 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.680
 perfectly paints your chair 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:09.080
 and you can get different tones 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.080
 using coffee 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.480
 then only repeat the 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.510
 procedure how many times do you need it 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.450
 and you are finished 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.150
 It's a very simple design but I hope 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.180
 let them serve 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.620
 and that the video you liked
