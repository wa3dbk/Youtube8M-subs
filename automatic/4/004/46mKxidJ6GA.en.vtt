basically taking what we liked about the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.910 
basically taking what we liked about the
Lumia<00:00:14.280> 1520<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.389> an<00:00:15.509> ATT<00:00:16.049> exclusive<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
Lumia 1520 which is an ATT exclusive and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.380 
Lumia 1520 which is an ATT exclusive and
distilling<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.609> down<00:00:17.760> into<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> slightly

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
distilling it down into a slightly

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.660 
distilling it down into a slightly
smaller<00:00:18.660> form<00:00:19.170> factor<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.310> still<00:00:20.490> get<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
smaller form factor so you still get a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
get the same 20 megapixel your view

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
get the same 20 megapixel your view
camera<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> back<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.769> shrunken

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
with us on the 15 20 which means you
also<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.780> lots<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.290> digital<00:01:46.500> zoom<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> if

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
also get lots as digital zoom and if

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.910 
also get lots as digital zoom and if
you're<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> maximum<00:01:48.659> broadest<00:01:49.500> wireless

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you're at the maximum broadest wireless

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.410 
you're at the maximum broadest wireless
image<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.460> also<00:01:50.579> use<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> oversampling

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
image you can also use the oversampling

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.410 
image you can also use the oversampling
and<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:51.960> shoot<00:01:52.170> over<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.310> 19<00:01:53.700> megapixel

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and it will shoot over to a 19 megapixel

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.749 
and it will shoot over to a 19 megapixel
and<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> 5<00:01:54.990> megapixel<00:01:55.200> photo<00:01:55.860> simultaneously

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and the 5 megapixel photo simultaneously

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.060 
and the 5 megapixel photo simultaneously
so<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> smaller<00:01:57.329> megapixel<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> designed

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
so the smaller megapixel one is designed

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
so the smaller megapixel one is designed
for<00:01:59.159> instant<00:01:59.579> sharing<00:02:00.049> there's<00:02:01.049> wireless
