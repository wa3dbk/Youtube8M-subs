00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
this is what the case looks like with

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.240 
this is what the case looks like with
the<00:00:40.649> iphone<00:00:41.100> plus<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.760> place<00:00:42.469> very<00:00:43.469> very<00:00:43.980> nice

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
i like the way that the red comes around

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
i like the way that the red comes around
the<00:00:46.680> front<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> iphone<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.539> gives

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the front of the iphone and just gives

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.160 
the front of the iphone and just gives
it<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.840> nice<00:00:49.140> frame<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.329> also<00:00:51.329> i<00:00:51.750> like

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
it that nice frame to it and also i like
the<00:00:52.320> way<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> power<00:00:53.309> button<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the way that the power button is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.049 
the way that the power button is
slightly<00:00:54.570> raised<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> i

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
also like the way obviously that the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
also like the way obviously that the
volume<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.699> down<00:00:59.760> buttons<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.390> done<00:01:00.539> in

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
black plastic now one of the things I'm

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.670 
black plastic now one of the things I'm
not<00:01:25.770> too<00:01:26.250> keen<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.049> has<00:01:28.409> got<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
not too keen on is that this has got a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
not too keen on is that this has got a
slight<00:01:29.100> discoloration<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.360> portion

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
slight discoloration to this portion

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.880 
slight discoloration to this portion
whether<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> leathers<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.770> bit

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
whether the leathers a little bit

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
whether the leathers a little bit
thinner<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.460> would<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.060> liked<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.780> have

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
thinner I would have liked that to have

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.630 
thinner I would have liked that to have
been<00:01:34.110> more<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.680> less<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> same<00:01:34.920> colors<00:01:35.460> that

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
been more or less the same colors that

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.060 
been more or less the same colors that
almost<00:01:36.090> wasn't<00:01:36.659> visible<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> other

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
almost wasn't visible and then the other

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
almost wasn't visible and then the other
negative<00:01:38.670> point<00:01:38.939> happens<00:01:39.900> down<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> bottom

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
negative point happens down the bottom

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.889 
negative point happens down the bottom
edge<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.369> bottom<00:01:41.640> edge<00:01:42.060> has<00:01:42.479> got<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
edge now the bottom edge has got a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380 
edge now the bottom edge has got a
really<00:01:43.500> large<00:01:43.890> cutout<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.820> makes<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> easy

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
really large cutout which makes it easy

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.260 
really large cutout which makes it easy
to<00:01:45.540> put<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> phone<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> case

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
this case probably not I would probably

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.810 
this case probably not I would probably
look<00:02:45.540> elsewhere<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.350> something<00:02:47.100> with<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> bit

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
look elsewhere for something with a bit

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.240
