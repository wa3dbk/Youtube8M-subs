00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello my name is sergey i am 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.480
 I represent the company console and now I 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 tell you what are the types of marine 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.520
 containers than they differ and most importantly 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.410
 how to choose a shipping container 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.400
 him by yourself and learn all of him 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.500
 specifications 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 advantages and disadvantages let's 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 consider the type represented here is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.810
 40 foot shipping container 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.040
 Ie 12 meter we will open it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.460
 let's go inside 1 on what we pay 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.410
 attention is a flat wooden floor need 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.100
 go to the end of the containers to see 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.190
 does he have any failures in mitino 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.920
 rotten floor well, and no such 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.149
 corrosion then pay attention to 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.690
 the walls and the ceiling that is first 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.589
 visually we look around to look 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.010
 kantegir thread 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.269
 to keep as little rust as possible 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.979
 to not necessarily on the floor 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.880
 no wet spots 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.710
 no water just the easiest one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 of the easiest and most effective ways 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.590
 is the closing of the containers from the inside 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.420
 I'll show you on camera now 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.240
 this will also be seen in the container not 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.500
 there should be no light if 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:31.770
 accordingly, the light hit the container 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:33.090
 respectively 2 that is, holes to the end 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.280
 we close it don't need all she 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.009
 seeps let's pay attention 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.840
 nowhere on this part of the light 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.039
 get it tells us about top super 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.409
 tenere sealed to look at 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.329
 the door and accordingly I need 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.780
 close from the inside but do not do it yourself 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.210
 I can 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.810
 then in this band of light too 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.969
 will disappear 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.619
 it tells us that the gum and 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.049
 door seals 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.759
 very well fit most container 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.630
 and the container can even float with cargo 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.219
 on the water for what will happen to them 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.560
 also need to pay attention 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.720
 big on the container door since 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.910
 container with time sea containers 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.070
 more precisely are under all the time 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.040
 exposure to sea water then faster 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.730
 just do not rot let's see 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.730
 close from 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.730
 as you see all the locks hit the slots 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.459
 all seals at the door on site also 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.970
 can do a general inspection of the container 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.680
 go look all dents rust 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.390
 outside 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.440
 Well, for example, here's a look along 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.790
 container look again day 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.800

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.880

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.370
 individual number 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.049

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.170

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.910

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.299
 container matching data 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.220
 characteristics but it can be either 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.150
 better or worse is at the discretion
