working on a book I'll do small
thumbnail<00:01:11.400> sketches<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.380> I'll<00:01:13.380> take

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
thumbnail sketches and then I'll take

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
thumbnail sketches and then I'll take
those<00:01:13.860> sketches<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.580> make<00:01:14.729> them<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> little

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
those sketches and make them a little

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
those sketches and make them a little
bit<00:01:15.390> larger<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.110> legible<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.100> I'll

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
bit larger more legible and then I'll

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
bit larger more legible and then I'll
paint<00:01:17.729> over<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.390> paint<00:01:18.659> over<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> and

then if I need to I paint over that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.060 
then if I need to I paint over that
again<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.080> it'll<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> three<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.680> four<00:01:22.860> step

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
again so it'll be a three or four step

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.390 
again so it'll be a three or four step
process<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.850> usually<00:01:24.689> spend<00:01:24.869> about<00:01:25.650> three<00:01:26.369> or

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
process I usually spend about three or

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960 
process I usually spend about three or
four<00:01:26.790> months<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.390> book<00:01:28.040> but<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.280> book<00:01:29.549> was

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
four months on a book but this book was

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.690 
four months on a book but this book was
a<00:01:30.030> very<00:01:30.329> different<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.990> nature<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
a very different one in nature I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
a very different one in nature I
literally<00:01:32.700> had<00:01:33.090> 10<00:01:33.390> days<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> artwork

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
literally had 10 days to do the artwork

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.649 
literally had 10 days to do the artwork
it's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> lot<00:01:35.220> looser<00:01:35.640> than<00:01:35.670> anything<00:01:36.479> I've

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
it's a lot looser than anything I've

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
it's a lot looser than anything I've
done<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.079> picture<00:01:37.740> books<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> lot<00:01:38.549> more

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
done in picture books it's a lot more

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.450 
done in picture books it's a lot more
flowing<00:01:39.270> lot<00:01:39.689> freer<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> idea

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
flowing lot freer and that was the idea

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460 
flowing lot freer and that was the idea
for<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> book<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> very

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
for the book was to be a very

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.100 
for the book was to be a very
spontaneous<00:01:44.280> celebration<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.630> moment

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
spontaneous celebration of this moment

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.109 
spontaneous celebration of this moment
in<00:01:46.200> history<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.670> thinking<00:01:47.909> about<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
in history I was thinking about that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
in history I was thinking about that
magic<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> air<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.680> night<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
magic I was in the air that night so I

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.469 
magic I was in the air that night so I
wanted<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> save<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.180> bit<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
wanted to save a little bit of that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
wanted to save a little bit of that
magic<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> into<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> artwork<00:01:53.189> for

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
magic and put it into the artwork for

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.610 
magic and put it into the artwork for
the<00:01:53.430> book

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
the book

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.880 
the book
it<00:01:55.250> was<00:01:55.370> a<00:01:55.400> really<00:01:55.730> magical<00:01:56.360> night<00:01:56.930> it's<00:01:57.740> great
