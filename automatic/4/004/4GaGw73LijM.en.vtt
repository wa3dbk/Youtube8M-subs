00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
today we're gonna show you how to make a

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.679 
today we're gonna show you how to make a
traditional<00:00:05.319> English<00:00:06.220> autumn<00:00:06.970> game<00:00:07.240> called

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:07.689 
traditional English autumn game called

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.420 
traditional English autumn game called
conquers<00:00:08.140> and<00:00:08.650> basically<00:00:09.130> you<00:00:09.340> need

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.430 
conquers and basically you need

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.400 
conquers and basically you need
chestnuts<00:00:10.059> or<00:00:10.180> conquers<00:00:10.630> in<00:00:10.720> the<00:00:10.809> UK<00:00:11.140> with<00:00:11.380> a

chestnuts or conquers in the UK with a

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.570 
chestnuts or conquers in the UK with a
bit<00:00:11.530> of<00:00:11.620> string<00:00:11.830> through<00:00:12.070> them<00:00:12.250> and<00:00:12.460> then

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
bit of string through them and then

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.100 
bit of string through them and then
we'll<00:00:12.700> show<00:00:12.880> you<00:00:12.910> how<00:00:13.090> the<00:00:13.390> how<00:00:13.750> you<00:00:13.810> play<00:00:14.080> with

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
we'll show you how the how you play with

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.600 
we'll show you how the how you play with
it<00:00:14.290> but<00:00:14.560> the<00:00:14.650> tricky<00:00:14.950> bit<00:00:15.070> is<00:00:15.100> actually<00:00:15.460> being

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
it but the tricky bit is actually being

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.929 
it but the tricky bit is actually being
the<00:00:15.730> string<00:00:16.029> in<00:00:16.269> so<00:00:17.260> what<00:00:17.410> we<00:00:17.529> use<00:00:17.920> is<00:00:18.130> a<00:00:18.220> skewer

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
the string in so what we use is a skewer

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.210 
the string in so what we use is a skewer
which<00:00:19.690> is<00:00:19.810> sharp<00:00:20.080> so<00:00:20.230> clearly<00:00:20.650> parents<00:00:21.100> should

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
which is sharp so clearly parents should

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.400 
which is sharp so clearly parents should
do<00:00:21.340> this<00:00:21.490> and<00:00:21.700> help<00:00:21.820> your<00:00:22.030> kids<00:00:22.270> if<00:00:22.780> you<00:00:22.930> heat<00:00:23.199> a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
do this and help your kids if you heat a

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.470 
do this and help your kids if you heat a
skewer<00:00:23.770> this<00:00:23.980> is<00:00:24.100> the<00:00:24.220> trick<00:00:24.520> it<00:00:25.030> actually

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
skewer this is the trick it actually

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.560 
skewer this is the trick it actually
goes<00:00:25.600> through<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.680> conker<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.340> lot<00:00:27.670> easier<00:00:28.360> so

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
goes through the conker a lot easier so

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.740 
goes through the conker a lot easier so
I'm<00:00:28.660> gonna<00:00:28.779> heat<00:00:29.020> it<00:00:29.140> up<00:00:29.199> a<00:00:29.320> bit<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:31.359> concur

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
I'm gonna heat it up a bit the concur

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.849 
I'm gonna heat it up a bit the concur
that<00:00:31.779> I<00:00:31.900> have<00:00:32.050> in<00:00:32.140> front<00:00:32.230> of<00:00:32.379> me<00:00:32.469> I've<00:00:32.649> really

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:32.859 
that I have in front of me I've really

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.439 
that I have in front of me I've really
prepared<00:00:33.309> I've<00:00:33.489> really<00:00:33.820> started<00:00:34.000> making<00:00:34.270> a

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
prepared I've really started making a

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.779 
prepared I've really started making a
small<00:00:34.690> hole<00:00:34.930> in<00:00:34.960> it<00:00:35.229> so<00:00:35.800> it<00:00:35.920> can<00:00:36.039> go<00:00:36.219> in<00:00:36.399> a<00:00:36.550> bit

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
small hole in it so it can go in a bit

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:46.469 
small hole in it so it can go in a bit
to<00:00:36.909> quicker<00:00:44.159> I<00:00:45.159> would<00:00:45.609> say<00:00:45.789> take<00:00:45.999> care<00:00:46.329> when

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
to quicker I would say take care when

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.000 
to quicker I would say take care when
here<00:00:46.719> we<00:00:46.749> go<00:00:46.899> let's<00:00:47.109> come<00:00:47.319> through<00:00:47.559> ready<00:00:47.769> take

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
here we go let's come through ready take

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.819 
here we go let's come through ready take
care<00:00:48.190> when<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.339> do<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.579> I<00:00:48.760> pull<00:00:49.389> it<00:00:49.510> through

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
care when you do it I pull it through

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.009 
care when you do it I pull it through
just<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:50.889> tidy<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.460> I<00:00:51.789> push<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.269> skewer<00:00:52.539> in

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
just to tidy it I push the skewer in

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.770 
just to tidy it I push the skewer in
again<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:58.059> then<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.569> really

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
again like that and then the really

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.270 
again like that and then the really
tricky<00:00:58.929> bit<00:00:59.199> one<00:00:59.469> of<00:00:59.499> the<00:00:59.589> boys<00:00:59.769> asked<00:01:00.039> me<00:01:00.159> but

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
tricky bit one of the boys asked me but

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.919 
tricky bit one of the boys asked me but
how<00:01:00.519> do<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.819> get<00:01:00.999> the<00:01:01.179> string<00:01:01.389> in<00:01:01.600> it's<00:01:01.749> so

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
how do you get the string in it's so

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.229 
how do you get the string in it's so
tricky<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.249> best<00:01:03.609> of<00:01:03.699> it<00:01:03.789> you<00:01:03.879> can<00:01:03.999> do<00:01:04.119> is

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
tricky so the best of it you can do is

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.300 
tricky so the best of it you can do is
you<00:01:04.330> get<00:01:04.449> some<00:01:04.600> normal<00:01:04.930> rope<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.440> then<00:01:06.010> you

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
you get some normal rope and then you

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.620 
you get some normal rope and then you
wrap<00:01:06.580> some<00:01:06.760> sellotape<00:01:07.000> around<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.450> like<00:01:07.510> you

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
wrap some sellotape around it like you

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.180 
wrap some sellotape around it like you
would<00:01:07.720> on<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.900> shoot<00:01:08.170> but<00:01:08.530> basically<00:01:08.800> creating

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
would on a shoot but basically creating

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.370 
would on a shoot but basically creating
a<00:01:09.220> shoelace<00:01:09.580> effect<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.360> by<00:01:10.960> doing<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.320> I

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
a shoelace effect and by doing that I

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.260 
a shoelace effect and by doing that I
did<00:01:11.620> two<00:01:11.830> layers<00:01:12.040> of<00:01:12.130> Cilla<00:01:12.370> tape<00:01:12.640> so<00:01:13.150> you've

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
did two layers of Cilla tape so you've

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.790 
did two layers of Cilla tape so you've
got<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.630> whole<00:01:13.780> width<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.380> concur

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
got that the whole width of the concur

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.910 
got that the whole width of the concur
and<00:01:15.370> then<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.580> can<00:01:15.700> just<00:01:15.880> push<00:01:16.060> it<00:01:16.240> through

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and then you can just push it through

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.770 
and then you can just push it through
how'd<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.100> make<00:01:18.280> so<00:01:18.340> many<00:01:18.760> cool<00:01:19.150> how'd<00:01:19.690> you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
how'd you make so many cool how'd you

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.030 
how'd you make so many cool how'd you
make<00:01:19.930> so<00:01:19.990> will<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.380> have<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.560> find<00:01:20.770> them<00:01:20.890> in

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
make so will you have to find them in

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.450 
make so will you have to find them in
the<00:01:21.100> park<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.110> then<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.920> tie<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.130> little<00:01:24.370> bit

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
the park and then you tie a little bit

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.220 
the park and then you tie a little bit
at<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.700> end<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.420> we're<00:01:25.690> gonna<00:01:25.780> show<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.080> in<00:01:26.200> a
