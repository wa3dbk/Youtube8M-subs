00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.359
 Ronnie earlier 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.510
 interview we say and something brought your 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.550
 follow brought from 225 to almost 300 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.710
 pounds last how old is a bodybuilder 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.080
 getting bigger and bigger up 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.990
 such a condition that officials and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 sb decided that now they are too 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.660
 big 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.900
 because it's impossible to walk with weight in 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.550
 300 pounds while little is something 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
 the more the tighter is found in this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.140
 year they said that everything should be far away 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.180
 go out with narrow italy nobody is enough 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.309
 swollen belly and constantly taking 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 carbohydrate do you understand that something 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.239
 changed this year because I never 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.340
 I won't be so narrow either 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.210
 the latter will lose and how did you manage 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.640
 with what efforts did it give walls 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.940
 I started right after winning last 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.710
 week and once went to a restaurant and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:58.649
 Immediately began figure I was on a diet 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.010
 here year I like her as I eat when 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.619
 I 'm starting to prepare for Olympus, that is, for 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.159
 10 12 weeks usually then contest I ate 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.080
 the same is also the first reception 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.119
 corn porridge second ingestion chicken 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.880
 third reception repent fourth reception 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.770
 steak fifth reception protein shake 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.409
 it's not raining fifth reception 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.810
 turkey and 6 reception about that know cocktail 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.220
 eating the same thing the same food 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.250
 nothing changed a little less than 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.790
 usually that is, we season you are liberal 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.310
 such weight I gained the same weight another 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.490
 the thing that I ate no less than 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.299
 I usually ate a little smaller portions than 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.470
 usual for example if previously settled for 1 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.060
 14 ounces now always ten to twelve 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.420
 and so of the year 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.240
 so all year sand you say that you 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.610
 chose the same weight Mrs. Weston was 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.910
 just cleaner without fat up 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.660
 less fat more mass i whispered 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.300
 better proportions beyond that last 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.350
 olympias julie darling next predicted 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.590
 wear a belt but always tint 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.590
 don't take it off serious yes never I 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.680
 take off and always pick up here on 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.470
 training is not important even if you are 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.870
 driving a car or just sitting at home and 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.690
 watching TV here a tremor that's 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.120
 which we watch last night 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.160
 webcast and disassemble u 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.050
 I guess I posed for her a lot 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.030
 comments and say what you are watching for now 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.040
 not excavators but also divisions so 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.880
 further so on you think this whole 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.610
 approach worked 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.700
 I know that the approach for the work because 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.780
 you yourself saw how I look on stage 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:58.650
 so I’ll tell you everything I’ve been on a diet 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 all year as the competition ate more 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.830
 in small portions 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.180
 didn't try to just develop any 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.160
 at the price of naturally vesa were great 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.650
 otherwise the oil would fall so 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.549
 trained so hard but ate 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.410
 qualitatively clean and sat on 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.160
 precompetitive diet and not gorge 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.170
 any rubbish 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.860
 so scored clean is 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.130
 more difficult 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.130
 probably because it is dieting 12 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.350
 days 11 months it's us weeks ourselves 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.720
 others would probably start complaining that 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.690
 it is difficult purely psychologically 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.209
 no of course it's harder the night I want 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.040
 get better i have to do everything 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.780
 possible as mr olympia should 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.470
 make it possible to get better with 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.410
 every year 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.540
 this was the main motivation that is 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.750
 place for weakness there is no place for 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.820
 weakness Gaddafi number one want it 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.010
 stay number one will you do 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.810
 best to keep 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.480
 title 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.450
 This is my job I have long enough 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.130
 I know already I see that you're all the same hands 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.700
 a corr remains the champions and earn 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.790
 money 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.840
 new friends starts to hurt stellar 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.950
 illness and so on and you're still the same 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.080
 mundane it's related to yours 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.560
 upbringing 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.130
 maybe yes in many ways is education 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:32.290
 also the place where grew but most importantly 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.690
 my faith I said earlier that it is me 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.420
 I like to study very much 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.350
 bodybuilding I was created precisely for 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.530
 all of this for everyone 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.340
 your vocation 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.200
 god called not to earth do emirates and 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.080

 because you are the national tea and he you 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.150
 adore everywhere these were loves and never 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.130
 didn't see an athlete with so much 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.060
 fans only you have this you do not 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:07.840
 I heard I told you the same as 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.390
 all and do not consider myself to be any special 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.690
 they are different than other people just 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.290
 slightly larger just significantly larger 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.290
 just much bigger
