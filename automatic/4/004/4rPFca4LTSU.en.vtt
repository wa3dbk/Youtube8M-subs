 I am really happy because 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.519

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.059
 dessert that I hope you like so much 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.299

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.100
 I hope you will be excited to do well what 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.250
 that we are going to need are cookies already 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.920
 be sweet or salty condensed milk 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.580
 colorful candies or but also a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.809
 little scratched and this is optional if you 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.830
 you want you can throw rum or tequila or 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.780
 pisco de armenta chocolate milk 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.170
 anything the point is that you owe it to a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 special taste and now we are going to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 crush the cookies I 'm going to give you a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.360
 advice that I spend doing is never 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.479
 Shred the hatches uncover the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.820
 blender use the lid is much better 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.640
 once the cookies are already crushed 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.170
 let's pour the condensed milk here 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.059
 if you are going to calculate the amount 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.519
 needed they need right 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.010
 condensed so that these cookies are 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.590
 make a dough and with little tumans 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.229
 clean passed to knead and you're going to continue 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.299
 throwing it condensed as you see it 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.510
 is doing this a brand and a voice 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.670
 throw the red pisco or tequila 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.710
 whatever you want it to be from 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 ico does not need to be with me but 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.250
 well you can give him the one you want 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.410
 the pulse spirit of this mass 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.380
 if it is with textures it is also achieved if 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.530
 you only use condensed milk but I 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.720
 I wanted to use this to give it a flavor 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.670
 digested in the funniest part 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.890
 start now let's access with this 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.350
 mass pellets and then we're going to 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.910
 damage it in the colorful candies or if 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.860
 not in the grated coconut and I've wanted 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.290
 do them in both ways so I 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.510
 an hour with colorful candies and 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.490
 another with little and so on if 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.740
 you feel that the mass hits you then 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.660
 mucus a little his hands and that's how 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.399
 it's staying but I see it a little 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.160
 so sad that he decided to grab a 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.410
 little football and throw it simple one 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.380
 for one if some look like 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.690
 eyes but good when the tests is very 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.810
