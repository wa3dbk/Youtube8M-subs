00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.309
 2014 that amazon has finally arrived 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.230
 that the paid 43 euros per day one and one 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.400
 that was some genoa but just time 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.750
 of the shipment arrives from some 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.340
 day late 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.439
 so let's see on the paper then I do 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.810
 see a make the game cover example 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.269
 I've already tried 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.820
 if you want to see how there is also a video 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.820
 taken from the beta on my channel 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.899
 for this reason we too give of that time 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.480
 this is the new cover as the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.030
 written with 2014 in light blue is written 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.950
 in white there's always coaches like that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.170
 portrait while the indication on board 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.719
 field with field as day requires 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 a very nice solid cover this one 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 it's the shoulder and this is the back like 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.329
 you obviously see everything in English 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.640
 9 in short, new introductions though 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.830
 there is very little substantial stuff 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.040
 new the news that interests me most 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.049
 they are finally the support with short 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.030
 the spearhead mo with steam with the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.530
 steam workshop and what they can 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.060
 download graphic updates and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.540
 anything else directly from steam 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 in theory and above all the drugs in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.229
 cloud for which no time is needed 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.509
 to copy the save to the memory stick if 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.400
 you want to do in the other bike but it will be there 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.360
 saving directly to the cloud 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.280
 steam 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.159
 these are the most important news now 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.360
 open we see it for a moment then there is 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.070
 also some rebels some news a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.630
 level of gameplay but if you wanted to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.640
 venditti when it is a member that I already have 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.200
 done then took game disc 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.110
 obviously single gas disc 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 ok and here is the manu in lon is beautiful 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 big wait for eurofer mini code 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.460
 I do not see it beautiful manual 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.520
 I must say full-bodied 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.570
 quite a few pages about twenty pages 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.570
 which explain a bit all good 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.149
 this was May instead of back 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.550
 cute cover very pretty and ne 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.140
 will think of the fast football box 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.940
 manager 2014 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.590
 I wanted to say something to everyone 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.260
 They asked I began a career 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.670
 I started it with the basel though 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.890
 I advise you gravedona 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.739
 I really liked the master and I like it 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.390
 beginning i was saint also good in 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.620
 championship but I got tired of it soon 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.780
 because the Swiss league is 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.510
 they are really depressing 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.580
 8 teams go to 8 returns is really 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.030
 a bit more depressing in a team 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.560
 competitive so I 'll start now 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.790
 probably perhaps the right la rome 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.920
 Florentine we will see 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.690
 I will start something I don't know when why 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.989
 you need to find the time to play the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.340
 his game however video will arrive 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.150
 I don't know when, but rest assured that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.150
 something will come 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.760
 I thank you for following me there 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.760
