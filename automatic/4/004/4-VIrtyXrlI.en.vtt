00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'm going to be 20 years old every month. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.349
 I had to say tighten a little to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.790
 spend a month I covered the creed and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.760
 so it was 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.850
 already tried for the month and in the sequence 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.859

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.140
 prefer and save 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.430
 So when someone asks me there 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
 How do you do it? 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.840

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.219
 something you do 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.290
 But when there is a problem, we 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.380
 it goes there too hard the skin of pounds 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.170
 because there we teach and the person comes 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.870
 Sometimes we go there in the afternoon and we 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.300

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.600
