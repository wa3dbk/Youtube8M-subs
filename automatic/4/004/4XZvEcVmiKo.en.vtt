this jailbroken ipod not booting because

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.390 
this jailbroken ipod not booting because
Apple<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.720> detect<00:00:22.140> our<00:00:22.350> jailbreak<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> very

Apple can detect our jailbreak at a very
low<00:00:23.609> level<00:00:23.840> but<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:24.990> I'll<00:00:25.109> apply<00:00:25.350> our<00:00:25.619> paths

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
low level but then I'll apply our paths
