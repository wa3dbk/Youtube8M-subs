00:00:09.428 --> 00:00:14.397
Stay, let's. Stay and warm me.

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:17.643
The winter is so cold,

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:24.177
and without you I'll perish by cold soon.

00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:27.291
Baby, do you remember the first time,

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:30.917
was a long time ago.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:37.117
I saw you on a day like today.

00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:42.410
When winter came, and you came,

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:46.248
as a snowstorm to me.

00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:53.769
Kiss me Angel! Love me on this winter night.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.693
Until the ice will melt in me,

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.421
and snow caress my skin.

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:06.022
Kiss Me angel. Love me,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.742

00:01:12.064 --> 00:01:13.185
This night!

00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:24.968
Stay, come stay forever.

00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:28.246
And show me how you kiss.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.170
Show us that you are eternal.

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.959
And who thinks only in the spring

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.029
we will float on clouds.

00:01:42.513 --> 00:01:47.972
It was so in December, as we had never was seen.

00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:52.711
When winter came, and you came,

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:56.594

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.381
