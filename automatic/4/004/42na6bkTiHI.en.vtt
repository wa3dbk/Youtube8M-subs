00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
range is nice and wide I expect I'm

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.519 
range is nice and wide I expect I'm
gonna<00:00:25.180> be<00:00:25.330> able<00:00:25.510> to<00:00:25.570> do<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:25.750> fair<00:00:26.080> chunk<00:00:26.320> of

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
gonna be able to do a fair chunk of

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.950 
gonna be able to do a fair chunk of
peeling<00:00:27.010> and<00:00:27.189> floating<00:00:27.609> and<00:00:27.910> obviously<00:00:28.630> it's

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
peeling and floating and obviously it's

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.069 
peeling and floating and obviously it's
gonna<00:00:29.109> be<00:00:29.289> a<00:00:29.320> huge<00:00:29.650> SPR<00:00:30.310> so<00:00:31.210> it's<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.840> kind<00:00:31.960> of

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
gonna be a huge SPR so it's the kind of

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.989 
gonna be a huge SPR so it's the kind of
spot<00:00:32.289> where<00:00:32.500> I<00:00:32.529> don't<00:00:32.829> really<00:00:33.250> hate<00:00:33.639> just

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:33.999 
spot where I don't really hate just

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.879 
spot where I don't really hate just
going<00:00:34.239> for<00:00:34.449> a<00:00:34.510> flat<00:00:34.749> here<00:00:35.050> there<00:00:35.409> are<00:00:35.559> players

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:35.889 
going for a flat here there are players

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:37.770 
going for a flat here there are players
where<00:00:36.159> I<00:00:36.190> will<00:00:36.489> Restall<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.269> not<00:00:37.420> gonna<00:00:37.569> say

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
where I will Restall and not gonna say

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.930 
where I will Restall and not gonna say
too<00:00:37.839> much<00:00:38.199> about<00:00:38.260> that<00:00:38.769> either<00:00:38.979> assuming<00:00:39.819> that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
too much about that either assuming that

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.180 
too much about that either assuming that
you<00:00:40.030> think<00:00:40.239> it's<00:00:40.329> gonna<00:00:40.479> be<00:00:40.659> decent<00:00:41.079> but<00:00:41.979> by

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
you think it's gonna be decent but by

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.829 
you think it's gonna be decent but by
the<00:00:42.249> same<00:00:42.489> token<00:00:42.699> don't<00:00:43.120> feel<00:00:43.359> like<00:00:43.479> you<00:00:43.569> can't

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
the same token don't feel like you can't

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.110 
the same token don't feel like you can't
flatten<00:00:44.260> this<00:00:44.589> spots<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.429> again<00:00:45.699> it's<00:00:45.909> just

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
flatten this spots and again it's just

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.939 
flatten this spots and again it's just
because<00:00:46.600> I<00:00:46.659> expect<00:00:47.139> your<00:00:47.260> edges<00:00:47.559> are<00:00:47.620> gonna<00:00:47.799> be

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
because I expect your edges are gonna be

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.099 
because I expect your edges are gonna be
really<00:00:48.129> really<00:00:48.370> nice<00:00:48.639> in<00:00:48.909> your<00:00:49.030> favor<00:00:49.299> and<00:00:49.600> I

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
really really nice in your favor and I

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.139 
really really nice in your favor and I
think<00:00:50.319> it<00:00:50.440> will<00:00:50.530> be<00:00:50.709> decent<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.519> profitable

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
think it will be decent and profitable

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.899 
think it will be decent and profitable
for<00:00:52.209> most<00:00:52.600> players<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.489> we<00:00:54.609> end<00:00:54.729> up<00:00:54.819> getting

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
for most players but we end up getting

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.719 
for most players but we end up getting
flatted<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.899> up<00:00:56.049> going<00:00:56.319> here<00:00:56.739> he<00:00:57.010> checks<00:00:57.369> in

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
flatted and up going here he checks in

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.639 
flatted and up going here he checks in
here<00:00:58.089> decides<00:00:58.479> to<00:00:58.780> bet<00:00:59.109> sir

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
here decides to bet sir

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.069 
here decides to bet sir
now<00:00:59.889> when<00:01:00.309> hero<00:01:00.549> continuation<00:01:01.420> bets<00:01:01.629> here

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
now when hero continuation bets here

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.259 
now when hero continuation bets here
it's<00:01:02.319> not<00:01:02.619> really<00:01:03.069> for<00:01:03.309> value<00:01:03.699> in<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.089> sense

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
it's not really for value in the sense

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's not really for value in the sense
the<00:01:04.449> worse<00:01:04.629> hands<00:01:04.900> will<00:01:05.110> continue<00:01:05.560> because

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
the worse hands will continue because

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.529 
the worse hands will continue because
let's<00:01:06.250> be<00:01:06.310> honest<00:01:06.759> he<00:01:06.969> is<00:01:07.060> an<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.359> just

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
let's be honest he is an it just

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:08.910 
let's be honest he is an it just
probably<00:01:08.079> not<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.229> tremendous<00:01:08.680> amount<00:01:08.890> of

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
probably not a tremendous amount of

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.740 
probably not a tremendous amount of
second-best<00:01:09.399> hands<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:09.969> are<00:01:10.000> even<00:01:10.420> in<00:01:10.509> his

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
second-best hands that are even in his

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.200 
second-best hands that are even in his
range<00:01:11.020> yet<00:01:11.799> alone<00:01:12.009> would<00:01:12.310> continue<00:01:12.880> things

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
range yet alone would continue things

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.870 
range yet alone would continue things
like<00:01:13.420> pocket<00:01:13.869> eights<00:01:14.049> or<00:01:14.259> fourth<00:01:14.680> pair<00:01:14.979> pocket

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
like pocket eights or fourth pair pocket

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.719 
like pocket eights or fourth pair pocket
sevens<00:01:16.240> same<00:01:16.450> concept<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.579> everything<00:01:18.579> else

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
sevens same concept and everything else

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.609 
sevens same concept and everything else
is<00:01:19.000> probably<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.570> hit<00:01:19.869> unless<00:01:20.140> yeah<00:01:20.409> like

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
is probably a hit unless yeah like

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.580 
is probably a hit unless yeah like
exactly<00:01:21.130> King<00:01:21.490> Queen<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.810> it's<00:01:23.229> one<00:01:23.380> of<00:01:23.409> those

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
exactly King Queen so it's one of those

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.560 
exactly King Queen so it's one of those
where<00:01:23.890> I'm<00:01:24.189> not<00:01:24.490> getting<00:01:24.880> better<00:01:25.090> hands<00:01:25.359> to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
where I'm not getting better hands to

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.660 
where I'm not getting better hands to
fold<00:01:25.719> I<00:01:25.960> don't<00:01:26.140> expect<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.530> fold<00:01:26.770> Jack<00:01:27.039> X<00:01:27.340> or

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
fold I don't expect to fold Jack X or

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.569 
fold I don't expect to fold Jack X or
Queens<00:01:28.000> or<00:01:28.420> tens<00:01:28.740> every<00:01:29.740> single<00:01:30.070> time<00:01:30.249> and

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
Queens or tens every single time and

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.489 
Queens or tens every single time and
besides<00:01:30.820> we<00:01:31.179> block<00:01:31.420> out<00:01:31.659> some<00:01:31.990> of<00:01:32.109> those<00:01:32.229> with

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
besides we block out some of those with

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.249 
besides we block out some of those with
our<00:01:32.710> tender<00:01:33.130> hand<00:01:33.490> I'd<00:01:34.149> never<00:01:34.509> expect<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.049> fold

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
our tender hand I'd never expect to fold

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.080 
our tender hand I'd never expect to fold
an<00:01:35.380> ace<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.070> it's<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.340> kind<00:01:36.520> of<00:01:36.549> situation

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
an ace so it's the kind of situation

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.910 
an ace so it's the kind of situation
where<00:01:37.270> I'm<00:01:37.570> not<00:01:37.810> folding<00:01:38.200> better<00:01:38.409> I'm<00:01:38.740> not

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
where I'm not folding better I'm not

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.130 
where I'm not folding better I'm not
getting<00:01:39.189> continuance<00:01:39.729> from<00:01:39.909> worse<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.840> thus

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
getting continuance from worse and thus

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.690 
getting continuance from worse and thus
my<00:01:41.320> bet<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.710> little<00:01:41.950> bit<00:01:42.070> more<00:01:42.219> of<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.429> semi

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
my bet is a little bit more of a semi

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.120 
my bet is a little bit more of a semi
Bluff<00:01:43.030> than<00:01:43.210> anything<00:01:43.420> else<00:01:43.719> and<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.890> reason

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
Bluff than anything else and the reason

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.800 
Bluff than anything else and the reason
why<00:01:45.249> I<00:01:45.280> go<00:01:45.490> through<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:45.880> thought<00:01:46.119> process<00:01:46.179> of

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
why I go through that thought process of

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.179 
why I go through that thought process of
thinking<00:01:47.020> about<00:01:47.350> okay<00:01:47.560> what<00:01:47.740> does<00:01:47.829> my<00:01:47.979> bed

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
thinking about okay what does my bed

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.039 
thinking about okay what does my bed
accomplish<00:01:48.789> is<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.299> can<00:01:49.539> really<00:01:49.840> start

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
accomplish is so I can really start

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.749 
accomplish is so I can really start
thinking<00:01:50.770> about<00:01:50.890> ranges<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.520> start

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
thinking about ranges and start

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.219 
thinking about ranges and start
understanding<00:01:51.880> what<00:01:52.479> my<00:01:52.899> bets<00:01:53.079> are

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
understanding what my bets are

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.630 
understanding what my bets are
accomplishing<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:53.979> if<00:01:54.069> I'm<00:01:54.249> taking<00:01:54.579> in

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
accomplishing and if I'm taking in

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.429 
accomplishing and if I'm taking in
situations<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.329> aren't<00:01:55.719> particularly<00:01:56.140> good

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
situations that aren't particularly good

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.099 
situations that aren't particularly good
so<00:01:57.429> if<00:01:57.639> nothing<00:01:57.850> else<00:01:58.149> always<00:01:58.600> understand

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
so if nothing else always understand

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.870 
so if nothing else always understand
what<00:01:59.259> your<00:01:59.380> bet<00:01:59.560> does<00:01:59.859> accomplish<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.729> make

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
what your bet does accomplish and make

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.580 
what your bet does accomplish and make
sure<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.299> makes<00:02:01.420> sense<00:02:01.810> for<00:02:02.170> your<00:02:02.319> goals

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
sure that it makes sense for your goals

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.440 
sure that it makes sense for your goals
and<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.280> actual<00:02:03.700> opponent<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:04.329> you're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
and the actual opponent that you're

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.870 
and the actual opponent that you're
playing<00:02:04.719> against<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:06.639> end<00:02:06.729> up<00:02:06.759> getting

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
playing against so we end up getting

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.869 
playing against so we end up getting
called<00:02:07.270> turn<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.319> 10<00:02:08.740> not<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.160> bad<00:02:09.399> card<00:02:09.759> at

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
called turn is a 10 not a bad card at

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.899 
called turn is a 10 not a bad card at
all<00:02:09.970> he<00:02:10.539> checks<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.260> here<00:02:11.799> decides<00:02:12.129> to<00:02:12.280> bet

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
all he checks and here decides to bet

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.670 
all he checks and here decides to bet
so<00:02:13.909> once<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.299> get<00:02:14.359> here<00:02:14.689> I'm<00:02:14.870> also<00:02:15.109> going<00:02:15.439> to<00:02:15.530> be

so once I get here I'm also going to be

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.039 
so once I get here I'm also going to be
betting<00:02:16.069> as<00:02:16.189> well<00:02:16.430> again<00:02:17.359> just<00:02:17.599> hoping<00:02:17.870> it

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.720 
of things
that's<00:02:27.709> really<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:28.189> I'm<00:02:28.280> hoping<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.609> get

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
that's really what I'm hoping to get

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.640 
that's really what I'm hoping to get
looked<00:02:28.909> up<00:02:29.060> by<00:02:29.239> here<00:02:29.540> maybe<00:02:29.870> two<00:02:30.109> hearts<00:02:30.439> if<00:02:30.560> he

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
looked up by here maybe two hearts if he

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.020 
looked up by here maybe two hearts if he
has<00:02:30.799> it<00:02:31.040> although<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.340> wouldn't<00:02:31.639> expect<00:02:31.790> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
has it although I wouldn't expect a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.490 
has it although I wouldn't expect a
tremendous<00:02:32.540> amount<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.019> given<00:02:33.409> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
tremendous amount of that given the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.949 
tremendous amount of that given the
board<00:02:33.709> texture<00:02:34.329> so<00:02:35.329> it's<00:02:35.540> just<00:02:35.659> the<00:02:35.750> kind<00:02:35.840> of

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
board texture so it's just the kind of

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.420 
board texture so it's just the kind of
situation<00:02:36.439> I'm<00:02:36.530> trying<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.829> get<00:02:36.950> looked<00:02:37.099> up<00:02:37.250> by

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
situation I'm trying to get looked up by

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.459 
situation I'm trying to get looked up by
those<00:02:37.700> couple<00:02:38.269> of<00:02:38.359> combos<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.079> I<00:02:39.170> think<00:02:39.349> it's

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
those couple of combos and I think it's

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.899 
those couple of combos and I think it's
realistic<00:02:39.769> that<00:02:40.069> we<00:02:40.129> can<00:02:40.280> get<00:02:40.400> looked<00:02:40.579> up<00:02:40.760> by

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
realistic that we can get looked up by

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.839 
realistic that we can get looked up by
those<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:42.109> we<00:02:42.260> end<00:02:42.379> up<00:02:42.469> facing<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.549> this

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
those but we end up facing this and this

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.210 
those but we end up facing this and this
is<00:02:44.060> really<00:02:44.569> gross<00:02:44.930> really<00:02:45.319> disgusting<00:02:46.040> we're

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
is really gross really disgusting we're

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.830 
is really gross really disgusting we're
getting<00:02:46.459> four<00:02:46.700> point<00:02:46.939> one<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.269> one<00:02:47.419> on<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.569> call

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
getting four point one to one on a call

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.379 
getting four point one to one on a call
here<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.859> what<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.549> actually<00:02:49.849> want<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.209> talk

now you may be wondering why hero shoved
and<00:02:56.239> let's<00:02:56.569> just<00:02:56.720> talk<00:02:56.840> about<00:02:56.959> it

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
and let's just talk about it

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.839 
and let's just talk about it
mathematically<00:02:57.319> for<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> second<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.549> go<00:02:58.639> from

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
mathematically for a second and go from

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.220 
mathematically for a second and go from
there<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.510> pull<00:02:59.750> out<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.900> fold<00:03:00.109> equity

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
there so pull out a fold equity

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.789 
there so pull out a fold equity
calculator<00:03:00.829> pull<00:03:01.159> out<00:03:01.310> stove<00:03:01.609> go<00:03:02.090> from<00:03:02.299> there

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
calculator pull out stove go from there

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.649 
calculator pull out stove go from there
so<00:03:03.799> in<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.099> situation<00:03:04.340> we<00:03:04.849> are<00:03:04.879> shoving<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
so in this situation we are shoving the

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.429 
so in this situation we are shoving the
12.5<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:07.129> effective<00:03:07.760> pot<00:03:08.510> right<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:08.989> moment

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
12.5 the effective pot right this moment

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.399 
12.5 the effective pot right this moment
is<00:03:09.620> 33<00:03:10.370> plugged<00:03:10.760> those<00:03:10.939> in<00:03:11.209> estimated<00:03:12.019> equity

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
is 33 plugged those in estimated equity

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.709 
is 33 plugged those in estimated equity
get<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.650> from<00:03:12.799> stove<00:03:13.129> so<00:03:13.819> remember<00:03:14.359> this<00:03:14.510> is

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
get it from stove so remember this is

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.050 
get it from stove so remember this is
the<00:03:14.870> range<00:03:15.079> that<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.469> think<00:03:15.799> he<00:03:16.010> would<00:03:16.219> call

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
the range that we think he would call

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.909 
the range that we think he would call
with<00:03:17.239> preflop<00:03:17.629> I'm<00:03:18.229> sure<00:03:18.440> he<00:03:18.590> would<00:03:18.739> raise

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
with preflop I'm sure he would raise

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.710 
with preflop I'm sure he would raise
with<00:03:19.159> preflop<00:03:19.489> call<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.120> three<00:03:20.389> been<00:03:20.569> out<00:03:20.690> of

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
with preflop call the three been out of

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.520 
with preflop call the three been out of
position

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
position

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.439 
position
check<00:03:21.769> call<00:03:21.979> the<00:03:22.099> flop<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.609> then<00:03:22.819> check<00:03:23.180> raise

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
check call the flop and then check raise

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.259 
check call the flop and then check raise
and<00:03:23.810> call<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.290> shelf<00:03:24.530> on<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.799> turn<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:26.209> a

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
and call the shelf on the turn so it's a

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.729 
and call the shelf on the turn so it's a
lot<00:03:26.449> of<00:03:26.479> stuff<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:26.989> let's<00:03:27.169> just<00:03:27.319> give<00:03:27.530> him

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
lot of stuff but let's just give him

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.559 
lot of stuff but let's just give him
kind<00:03:28.040> of<00:03:28.129> a<00:03:28.220> very<00:03:28.430> strong<00:03:28.790> range<00:03:29.090> let's<00:03:29.359> give

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
kind of a very strong range let's give

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.610 
kind of a very strong range let's give
him<00:03:29.900> jacks

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
him jacks

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.339 
him jacks
let's<00:03:30.919> give<00:03:31.129> him<00:03:31.310> tens<00:03:31.819> let's<00:03:32.479> give<00:03:32.720> him<00:03:33.019> a

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
let's give him tens let's give him a

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.699 
let's give him tens let's give him a
squeeze<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:34.280> he's<00:03:34.489> Jack<00:03:35.049> probably<00:03:36.049> he's<00:03:36.260> ten

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
squeeze and he's Jack probably he's ten

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.839 
squeeze and he's Jack probably he's ten
suited<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:38.000> let's<00:03:38.780> give<00:03:39.139> him<00:03:39.470> King<00:03:40.010> Queen<00:03:40.459> of

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849

Hearts exactly and he can't have King
Jack<00:03:44.689> of<00:03:44.870> Hearts<00:03:44.900> because<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.409> Jack<00:03:45.620> of

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
Jack of Hearts because the Jack of

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
Hearts is already on board maybe you

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.089 
Hearts is already on board maybe you

could have King 10 of hurts

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.339 
could have King 10 of hurts
and<00:03:49.909> let's<00:03:50.209> just<00:03:50.389> go<00:03:50.509> with<00:03:50.659> that<00:03:50.720> for<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.139> time

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
and let's just go with that for the time

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.110 
and let's just go with that for the time
being<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:52.129> notice<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.430> we<00:03:52.609> have<00:03:52.699> thirty<00:03:52.909> two

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
being so notice that we have thirty two

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.280 
being so notice that we have thirty two
percent<00:03:53.299> equity<00:03:54.129> submit<00:03:55.129> it<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.549> this<00:03:56.479> shove

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
percent equity submit it and this shove

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.140 
percent equity submit it and this shove
is<00:03:57.439> gonna<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.769> plus<00:03:57.949> CV<00:03:58.310> even<00:03:58.699> if<00:03:58.819> he<00:03:58.939> never

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
is gonna be a plus CV even if he never

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.149 
is gonna be a plus CV even if he never
ever<00:03:59.359> folds<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.139> that's<00:04:00.349> obviously<00:04:00.919> a<00:04:00.979> good

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
ever folds and that's obviously a good

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.670 
ever folds and that's obviously a good
thing<00:04:01.400> for<00:04:01.669> us<00:04:01.729> but<00:04:02.090> by<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.299> same<00:04:02.569> token<00:04:02.680> is

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
thing for us but by the same token is

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.069 
thing for us but by the same token is
his<00:04:04.400> range<00:04:04.669> really<00:04:05.329> really<00:04:05.629> looking<00:04:06.019> like

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
his range really really looking like

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.420 
his range really really looking like
that<00:04:06.409> does<00:04:06.769> his<00:04:07.069> range<00:04:07.370> have<00:04:07.790> things<00:04:08.750> like

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
that does his range have things like

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.659 
that does his range have things like
King<00:04:10.430> 10<00:04:10.989> have<00:04:11.989> ace<00:04:12.560> 10

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
King 10 have ace 10

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.569 
King 10 have ace 10

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
if he were the kind of guy

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.880 
if he were the kind of guy
probably<00:04:18.840> has<00:04:18.960> for<00:04:19.230> his<00:04:19.380> town<00:04:19.560> let's<00:04:19.800> be

honest if he is the kind of guy that's
going<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.860> call<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.700> Rhys<00:04:23.940> teal<00:04:24.180> preflop<00:04:24.810> out<00:04:25.140> of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
going to call a Rhys teal preflop out of

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.140 
going to call a Rhys teal preflop out of
position<00:04:25.740> with<00:04:25.890> he's<00:04:26.100> queen<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.760> then<00:04:26.910> check

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
position with he's queen and then check

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.180 
position with he's queen and then check
all<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.420> fob<00:04:27.630> he's<00:04:28.020> taking<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.440> very<00:04:28.650> showdown

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
all the fob he's taking a very showdown

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.280 
all the fob he's taking a very showdown
value<00:04:29.220> line<00:04:29.760> with<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.780> can<00:04:30.990> we<00:04:31.110> be

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
value line with it so can we be

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.900 
value line with it so can we be
guaranteed<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:31.830> he's<00:04:32.160> always<00:04:32.400> gonna<00:04:32.640> have

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
guaranteed that he's always gonna have

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.240 
guaranteed that he's always gonna have
that<00:04:33.210> well<00:04:33.780> maybe<00:04:34.320> maybe<00:04:34.620> not

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
that well maybe maybe not

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.730 
that well maybe maybe not
so<00:04:35.640> let's<00:04:35.820> run<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.180> if<00:04:36.330> we<00:04:36.480> take<00:04:36.990> out<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.260> decent

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
so let's run it if we take out a decent

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.060 
so let's run it if we take out a decent
amount<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.900> Queen<00:04:39.900> I'm<00:04:40.200> sorry<00:04:40.530> ace<00:04:40.710> Queen

amount of the Queen I'm sorry ace Queen
and<00:04:41.880> run<00:04:42.300> our<00:04:42.420> equity<00:04:42.840> against<00:04:43.290> that<00:04:43.440> notice

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
and run our equity against that notice

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.840 
and run our equity against that notice
that<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.550> drops<00:04:44.850> significantly<00:04:45.710> fifteen<00:04:46.850> boom

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
that it drops significantly fifteen boom

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.150 
that it drops significantly fifteen boom
boom<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.510> now<00:04:48.600> also<00:04:48.810> we<00:04:49.170> need<00:04:49.320> some<00:04:49.590> folds<00:04:49.950> for

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
boom and now also we need some folds for

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.700 
boom and now also we need some folds for
this<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.430> be<00:04:50.550> breakeven<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:52.170> against<00:04:52.590> an

this to be breakeven and against an
idiot<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.160> player<00:04:53.430> can<00:04:53.700> we<00:04:53.820> really<00:04:54.060> expect

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
idiot a player can we really expect

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.620 
idiot a player can we really expect
those<00:04:54.810> faults<00:04:55.260> probably<00:04:56.130> not<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.970> what<00:04:57.540> I'm

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
those faults probably not so what I'm

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.240 
those faults probably not so what I'm
really<00:04:57.750> trying<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.110> highlight<00:04:58.470> here<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.800> the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
really trying to highlight here is the

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.030 
really trying to highlight here is the
more<00:04:59.490> things<00:04:59.850> like<00:05:00.180> East<00:05:00.690> King<00:05:01.050> ace<00:05:01.590> Queen

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
more things like East King ace Queen

enough things like East Queen and this

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.330 
enough things like East Queen and this
actually<00:05:36.900> could<00:05:37.170> be<00:05:37.200> a<00:05:37.350> situation<00:05:37.620> where<00:05:38.070> it's

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
actually could be a situation where it's

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.700 
actually could be a situation where it's
really<00:05:38.670> a<00:05:38.880> vomit<00:05:39.510> bet<00:05:39.750> fold<00:05:40.050> with<00:05:40.290> two<00:05:40.440> pair

because his check raised stack off range
is<00:05:43.760> unfortunately<00:05:44.760> just<00:05:44.850> gonna<00:05:45.150> be<00:05:45.300> too

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
is unfortunately just gonna be too

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.050 
is unfortunately just gonna be too
strong<00:05:45.840> too<00:05:46.140> often<00:05:46.620> so<00:05:47.580> what<00:05:47.790> I'm<00:05:47.880> really

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
strong too often so what I'm really

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.580 
strong too often so what I'm really
trying<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.300> show<00:05:48.450> you<00:05:48.510> here<00:05:48.750> again<00:05:49.050> look<00:05:49.500> at

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
trying to show you here again look at

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.950 
trying to show you here again look at
the<00:05:49.650> preflop<00:05:50.010> line<00:05:50.340> post<00:05:51.090> flop<00:05:51.270> understanding

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
the preflop line post flop understanding

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.810 
the preflop line post flop understanding
with<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.080> flop<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.530> accomplishes<00:05:53.190> turn<00:05:53.610> bed

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
with a flop that accomplishes turn bed

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.730 
with a flop that accomplishes turn bed
is<00:05:53.940> usually<00:05:54.090> pretty<00:05:54.480> standard<00:05:54.960> but<00:05:54.990> once<00:05:55.530> you

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
is usually pretty standard but once you

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.730 
is usually pretty standard but once you
face<00:05:56.010> that<00:05:56.180> aggression<00:05:57.180> from<00:05:57.450> him<00:05:57.810> really

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
face that aggression from him really

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.530 
face that aggression from him really
saying<00:05:59.010> okay<00:05:59.310> is<00:05:59.370> my<00:05:59.640> hand<00:05:59.910> good<00:06:00.120> enough<00:06:00.360> at

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
saying okay is my hand good enough at

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.840 
saying okay is my hand good enough at
I'm<00:06:00.780> what<00:06:01.080> kind<00:06:01.290> of<00:06:01.350> range<00:06:01.530> you<00:06:01.650> using<00:06:02.220> using

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
I'm what kind of range you using using

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.450 
I'm what kind of range you using using
math<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.090> proof<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.750> shove<00:06:04.050> and<00:06:04.440> then<00:06:05.100> just<00:06:05.310> go

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
math to proof the shove and then just go

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.250 
math to proof the shove and then just go
in<00:06:05.610> from<00:06:05.850> there<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.300> think<00:06:06.360> too<00:06:06.720> many<00:06:06.900> people

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
in from there I think too many people

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.880 
in from there I think too many people
get<00:06:07.470> caught<00:06:07.800> up<00:06:08.040> in<00:06:08.370> just<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:10.440> fact<00:06:10.650> that<00:06:10.800> they

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
get caught up in just the fact that they

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.860 
get caught up in just the fact that they
have<00:06:10.980> to<00:06:11.160> pair<00:06:11.430> as<00:06:11.640> opposed<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.270> really<00:06:12.630> saying

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
have to pair as opposed to really saying

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.870 
have to pair as opposed to really saying
okay<00:06:13.260> I<00:06:13.470> think<00:06:13.920> you're<00:06:14.280> Radian<00:06:14.670> range

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
okay I think you're Radian range

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.300 
okay I think you're Radian range
actually<00:06:15.420> beats<00:06:15.780> my<00:06:15.990> two<00:06:16.050> pair<00:06:16.410> too<00:06:16.590> often<00:06:17.040> I'm

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
actually beats my two pair too often I'm

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.430 
actually beats my two pair too often I'm
reduced<00:06:17.730> to<00:06:18.000> a<00:06:18.030> very<00:06:18.210> small<00:06:18.810> amount<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.230> equity

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
reduced to a very small amount of equity

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.770 
reduced to a very small amount of equity
and<00:06:19.950> I<00:06:20.520> unfortunately<00:06:20.670> this<00:06:21.270> is<00:06:21.390> gonna<00:06:21.600> be<00:06:21.750> a

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
and I unfortunately this is gonna be a

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.720 
and I unfortunately this is gonna be a
better<00:06:22.050> spot<00:06:22.440> to<00:06:22.470> just<00:06:22.830> go<00:06:22.980> for<00:06:23.190> a<00:06:23.250> bet<00:06:23.430> fold

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
better spot to just go for a bet fold

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.240 
better spot to just go for a bet fold
instead
