that<00:01:15.390> kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.570> set<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> tone<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> match

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that kind of set the tone of the match

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.230 
that kind of set the tone of the match
and<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.880> supposed<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> let

difficult<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> find<00:01:21.810> angles<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> find<00:01:22.320> shots

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
