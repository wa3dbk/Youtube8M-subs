00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.769
 go it's gone for them great tournament 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.299
 this decision 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.109
 he takes over the catholic portel who desire 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.619
 learn randomly congratulations to all the years I want to see her 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.699
 alas this card 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.159
 I'll never lose it by k -o for the season so we see the front 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.579
 I lose all my players 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.680
 jean coutu does not work bad tackle that you can think of those who is 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:33.850
 rich and multiple 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.899
 Control 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.750
 hand in hand today 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.010
 five years ago 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.700
 by going to see very 80's anywhere at any place of the old me 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.950
 I can not know 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 we will not calm the game 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.320
 as part of his car 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.330
 and then to roll 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.630
 because it's quite ordinary in london 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.939
 back to AIDS 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:07.810
 van rompuy 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.640
 Sunday 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.590
 so you're going to hold the car in hand that you thought very hard with 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.600
 Art 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 bassil car detective of the world that speaks that your card 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.090
 as for the prices they had converted smart match 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.980
 so we'll see what's going to happen 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.410
 in the first case the car is then to know if you backed back so you 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.410
 see put your finger on it actually 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.420
 for bob peeters having lifted 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.780
 can also 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.640
 we can rarely a little bit launched on November 12 citizens have 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.250
 backward she can not move forward can not move forward 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.429
 in that case 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.080
 and imagine the thought 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.430
 what if your TV dog 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.900
 or the danger 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.580
 but from the outset security the fact that he is not I patinates 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 I am confident that following 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.950
 Lagarde calls at any point in the game I can not know 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.949
 I'm not even saying it's 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.729
 so this car 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.699
 I want to see my part 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.099
 in front the bridegroom amah married tehoua flowerbeds if you thought 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.099
 very loud with a small morning was at the time m 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.309
 arar 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.079
 the only thing to do to the she 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.359
 in which segel Ã  la carte 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.149
 she knows she's not here 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.979
 and that's because it's not uncommon to get bored 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.889
 so we can mix again 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.979
 no tangled 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.469
 so I did not want a good knowledge of the content 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.199
 so we are made 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.929
 indeed catherine stands the boat has a way for them like that by 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.289
 example 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.539
 if you burn 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.539
 what danger 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.019
 again with the car and ride six times a week a canvas gap 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.359
 red 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.169
 you can put yourself anywhere 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.499
 you can advance 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.579
 that you are blah blah blah blah blah stop on the breakthrough of the grenelle 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.899
 it's like that 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.899
 we push we push we push we push a little blur 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.469
 here 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.209
 the answer is + no no it works 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.099
 abbassi alone voice alone in front 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.509
 so it's a mere mortal 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.829
 so useful and would be more successful she does not want to know anything she has achieved 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.459
 at the death of m 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.349
 what can you tell me there for the first time mangas five of 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.719
 heart is a war 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.670
 because that's what the chaos said m 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.659
 the head 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.409
 recognize the head 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.859
 that of caen that's mine 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.719
 the hotel itself 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.949
 who can do that is a message that had earned him in ireland 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.659
 you do not have to tell you that there is something I did not like about dakar 29 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.279
 Dec 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:02.229
 he points out that lurking has not denied 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.849
 normal maintenance 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.579
 2 if you take any type of supernova 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.579
 it was enough to think about it very hard and the car and that's the case 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.659
 For the little story 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.439
 titled without problem 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.309
 that was a quarterback detective car
