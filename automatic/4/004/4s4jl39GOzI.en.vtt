out a paradox super gold bush mohave and

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.310 
out a paradox super gold bush mohave and
i<00:00:14.099> was<00:00:14.730> shocked<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.330> see<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.750> guy's<00:00:15.990> head

out actually yesterday afternoon just
could<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.809> glimpses<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.539> pigment<00:00:57.539> on

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
could see glimpses of this pigment on

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.889 
could see glimpses of this pigment on
his<00:00:58.289> face<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.980> thought<00:00:59.910> oh<00:01:00.120> gosh<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
his face and thought oh gosh this is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.250 
his face and thought oh gosh this is
pretty<00:01:01.260> cool<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.629> anyway<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.899> thought<00:01:04.019> i'd

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
pretty cool so anyway just thought i'd

share this with you guys this guy's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.390 
share this with you guys this guy's
still<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.260> his<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.560> coming<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> egg

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
still on his way coming out of the egg

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.210 
still on his way coming out of the egg
but<00:01:08.820> since<00:01:09.090> he<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.390> peeking<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:10.740> i<00:01:10.890> show

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
but since he was peeking out if i show

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.090 
but since he was peeking out if i show
you<00:01:11.250> guys<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> sneak<00:01:11.729> preview<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.500> paradox

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you guys a sneak preview of this paradox

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.090 
you guys a sneak preview of this paradox
and<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> second<00:01:16.100> paradox

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and this is actually the second paradox

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.050 
and this is actually the second paradox
that<00:01:17.250> I've<00:01:17.400> produced<00:01:18.080> from<00:01:19.850> gold<00:01:20.850> blush

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that I've produced from gold blush

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.700 
that I've produced from gold blush
Mojave<00:01:21.920> actually<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.189> years<00:01:23.400> ago<00:01:23.520> produced<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
Mojave actually two years ago produced a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.960 
Mojave actually two years ago produced a
paradox<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> other<00:01:26.220> side<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
paradox on the other side of the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.060 
paradox on the other side of the
spectrum<00:01:27.090> where<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.869> actually<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> mohave

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
spectrum where it was actually a mohave

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.640 
spectrum where it was actually a mohave
bred<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> normal<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> pretty

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
bred to a normal and this was a pretty

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.780 
bred to a normal and this was a pretty
well<00:01:31.890> pigmented<00:01:34.009> sort<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.130> combination<00:01:35.369> of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
well pigmented sort of a combination of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.560 
well pigmented sort of a combination of
a<00:01:35.909> Mojave<00:01:36.530> with<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:38.299> hint<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.500> normal<00:01:40.500> pattern

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
a Mojave with a hint of normal pattern

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
a Mojave with a hint of normal pattern
pigmentation<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.320> had<00:01:43.590> blue<00:01:44.340> eyes<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
pigmentation it had blue eyes and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.109 
pigmentation it had blue eyes and
splashes<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> white<00:01:46.340> like<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> sort<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
splashes of white like a sort like a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
splashes of white like a sort like a
pipe<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.420> wasn't<00:01:49.229> applied<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:49.770> throwing

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
pipe that wasn't applied it was throwing

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.399 
pipe that wasn't applied it was throwing
like<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> pinto<00:01:50.460> horse<00:01:51.829> but<00:01:52.829> anyway<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
like a pinto horse but anyway here is a

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.350 
like a pinto horse but anyway here is a
super<00:01:55.409> goal<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.920> paradox<00:01:56.430> super<00:01:56.880> cold<00:01:57.149> blush

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
super goal of paradox super cold blush

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.270 
super goal of paradox super cold blush
Mojave<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> super<00:01:58.530> gold<00:01:58.710> blush<00:01:58.920> Mojave

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
Mojave or a super gold blush Mojave

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.760 
Mojave or a super gold blush Mojave
paradox<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.810> really<00:02:01.020> sure<00:02:01.170> how<00:02:01.380> you'd<00:02:01.530> say

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
paradox not really sure how you'd say

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.719 
paradox not really sure how you'd say
that<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.540> it<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> paradox<00:02:04.189> all<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.460> same

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that but it is a paradox all the same

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.830 
that but it is a paradox all the same
and<00:02:06.259> pretty<00:02:07.259> excited<00:02:07.710> about<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:09.119> little<00:02:09.330> guy

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
and pretty excited about this little guy

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.780 
and pretty excited about this little guy
and<00:02:11.140> actually<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.739> same<00:02:11.980> clutch<00:02:12.459> there's

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and actually in the same clutch there's

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.600 
and actually in the same clutch there's
actually<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.180> set<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.629> twins<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.459> at<00:02:15.459> this

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
actually a set of twins that at this

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.949 
actually a set of twins that at this
point<00:02:15.819> in<00:02:15.910> time<00:02:16.090> doesn't<00:02:16.480> look<00:02:16.599> like<00:02:16.780> it's

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
point in time doesn't look like it's

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.040 
point in time doesn't look like it's
going<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.260> make<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.680> very<00:02:18.420> premature<00:02:21.000> babies

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
going to make it very premature babies

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.100 
going to make it very premature babies
but<00:02:23.050> anyway<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:25.209> thought<00:02:25.390> i'd<00:02:25.660> share<00:02:25.900> this
