because like the surface pro 3 itself it

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.720 
because like the surface pro 3 itself it
has<00:04:04.780> just<00:04:05.200> gotten<00:04:05.410> better<00:04:05.710> in<00:04:05.980> every

has just gotten better in every
iteration<00:04:06.910> it<00:04:07.630> is<00:04:07.780> expensive<00:04:08.670> 115<00:04:09.670> pounds<00:04:09.880> but

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
iteration it is expensive 115 pounds but

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.300 
iteration it is expensive 115 pounds but
you've<00:04:10.630> got<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.990> little<00:04:11.290> Ridge<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.890> top<00:04:12.100> so<00:04:12.280> you

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
you've got a little Ridge up top so you

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.400 
you've got a little Ridge up top so you
can<00:04:12.430> have<00:04:12.790> your<00:04:12.970> keyboard<00:04:13.480> at<00:04:13.630> an<00:04:13.750> angle<00:04:14.140> it<00:04:14.290> is
