00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.060
 then we can switch to bechamel 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.630
 or initially warmed the milk 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.430
 because this is why we will use 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.459
 butter and flour that we're going to throw in 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.540
 already warm milk or what to see so

 with 30 grams of affection flour and it does 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.110
