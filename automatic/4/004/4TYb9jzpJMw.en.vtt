00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello love island friends diesel in hd 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.810
 and in color and in this video show 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.069
 I'll give you an easter egg from far cry 3 and 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.139
 Although I have a reference here 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.290
 Assassin's creed 3 discovered and what you do 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.740
 the additional content is required for this 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.359
 lost expedition the lost expedition 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.220
 and that was with me with the pc version 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.199
 here limited edition i believe each one 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.240
 version is limited is already the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 code is in any case you take 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.349
 then just go to the code 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.539
 options menu sachs there exclusive content 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.279
 and enter the code here 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.130
 With it you switch two new emissions 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 free and one of them includes the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.370
 reference to assassin's creed 3 and that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.989
 I'll show you now and with it the video 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.180
 we are not too short 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.980
 a short borgt out that means I show 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.140
 Just look at them 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.809
 which somebody may hang 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 You never know 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.449
 and then again after a game 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.670
 You're changing here? 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.110
 lost explosion of one of the two 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.730
 missions and that's where we want to go 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.750
 the symbol that comes up automatically 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.640
 your card that's why 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.579
 coordinates are not really important because 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 you simply can not miss it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.049
 I'm right now, this is the one 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.880
 input to this additional mission and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.200
 right at the beginning of the entrance we find 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.540
 Even the first reference is still 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.310
 I know the symbol so Jason has 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.600
 apparently somehow 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.330
 Neat it is a script doubled 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.250
 and what we have to do before I go now 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.860
 it 'll probably be explained in a nutshell you're supposed to be here 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.659
 Find four parts of the document and first 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.610
 Let's make the first room empty and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.530
 I cut short the four threaten 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.090
 together with the documents 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.470
 if you're chosing at one of them 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.570
 stallion or you still missing one 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.159
 have seen dual times in the video and yes 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.040
 the symbol that we saw that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.369
 is the company logo of the company abstergo 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.380
 industries and abstergo industries 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.530
 of course Assassin's creed 3 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.329
 they have all this animus technology 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.360
 which as a reminder back 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.100
 sends invented and they are from the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.469
 Templar I think founded or 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.719
 at least part of the Templars and so on 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.689
 of course the enemies of the assassins why 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.180
 a book with a corner belongs and yes that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.700
 logo this is the easter egg the reference 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.170
 course questionable is why let 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.550
 I'm so familiar and here I am 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.980
 just on the way 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.170
 for the fourth and last rest here 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.720
 the last document after that you follow 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.820
 Just go back to the quest mark on the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.740
 map are you a few hours are here 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.870
 below through greek and over here 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.370
 Jump to the electric shocks 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.480
 they do not really make much difference 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.970
 damage is not as bad a 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.400
 little bit but what if you get it 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.380
 can avoid to be shocked 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.990
 You do that too and animal dives again 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.820
 the logo on abstergo industries and 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.200
 then wire becomes the ladder 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.390
 a few people are flattening you here 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.890
 come to this box with the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.290
 interact and then go back 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.600
 Schleuser on this one sees now briefly 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.190
 and here I think four people join 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.040
 Two of us then ran to you 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.090
 that makes the melee leaf and back 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.060
 then there are two left 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.330
 I have snipers with mine 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.790
 favorite weapon made with the bow 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.100
 and well it is if you indirectly here 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.270
 he probably shoots just like that and me in the head 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.810
 I 'm unlikely to have much here 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.640
 abbekommen 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.410
 In any case, now runs where the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.840
 Two sharpshooters stood and there 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.180
 you will find the first chest of the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.220
 next three you need and the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.350
 second tourist here the elevator down 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.060
 there is again the logo in the conversation 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.950
 and then we start on the way 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.020
 a last peace and on the way to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.900
 Finally , there is still a corpse around 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.250
 so what such a one military coup and was 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.650
 already at the entrance if it you 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.920
 I'm not sure if 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.000
 which really fits far cry 3 here 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.100
 are still surprising few opponents 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.390
 been that really to far cry 3 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.489
 it fits or maybe it will 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.260
 be any reference to anything 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.480
 should not if you are not sure 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.730
 a bit resourceful like the ones like that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.830
 japanese which one finds for these meadows 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.239
 the letters of the abandoned do not know 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.390
 In any case, this is the last one 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.830
 mission item and then there I stand 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.480
 put the inclusion of this 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.670
 so-called scientist in question her 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.500
 fibers some of eden splinters and of 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.420
 elsons experiments with a kind 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.220
 genetic memory i trust them 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.570
 not and I closed the lab 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.950
 you should have the secured room 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.620
 want to enter or leave like that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.540
 please use this q 12 21 12 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.280
 please be in touch with these 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.070
 foreign devils extremely 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.450
 Carefully this is the message that is 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.650
 so to speak, the conclusion 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.470
 the mission and the code is I think 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.020
 again a reference to the end of the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.030
 world of mayas, therefore also of the 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.420
 Mayan Calendar You know what I mean 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.850
 my 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.010
 after the American spelling the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.750
 Write the month of the month day and day 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.670
 then not the year as we day month 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.980
 and the year and that would be here then 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.320
 21 12 2012 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.370
 the code and with this know chic 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.410
 I also thank you for the end of the mission 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.600
 there is the exit here we enter 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.500
 the code and with that we have the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.130
 first of the two missions meets the 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.450
 the additional the pleasure expedition with itself 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.400
 Now brings an elevator again 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.710
 out there for it is also a success 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.760
 and neat xp if you have it on the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.240
 still need around 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.620
 want to unlock crafting points 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.820
 and yes I found it quite funny the 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.230
 I still have a mission to do it 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.250
 bit late, somehow 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.930
 I had overlooked that a bit 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.540
 that I do not code content here yet 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.950
 In any case, I would like to have you lying down 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.510
 Have fun with neighbors and I hope 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.510
 see you in the next video again
