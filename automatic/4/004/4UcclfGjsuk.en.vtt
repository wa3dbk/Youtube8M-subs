00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 today at lunch dozens of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.720
 characters jumped from books to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.940
 move from the patriarch's square to the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.130
 heart of the city incarnated by 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.509
 dancers of the group stage one of the most 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.490
 popular country 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.420
 they caught the attention of these people 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.449
 always so hurried on the square in the center 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.730
 de são paulo turned the stage and will not see 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.410
 At lunch time he tells us a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.029
 family history 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.029
 first the angels 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:43.140
 later came the Portuguese, although the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.140
 my lilo there are no blacks and the jesuits 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.460
 later the black slaves and the court 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.530
 who hurried past and stopped to 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.970
 follow this mixture to recognize a 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.970
 nothing is lost 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.100
 since it was set up 30 years ago 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.650
 the show was the stuff of Brazil 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.350
 saga by hundreds of dancers who 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.960
 spent the ballet stagium debuted at the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.960
 municipal theater traveled through 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 south for the whole brazil in são paulo was 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.390
 staged in and out of theaters very 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.820
 more outside than inside 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.490
 at least 300 times that 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.509
 show was set away from the stage 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.240
 conventional 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.080
 over the company's trajectory was 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.170
 dance schools in hospitals and so on. 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.479
 square for everyone to see a way to 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.050
 tell the story of Brazil very good 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.399
 very good but I think it's cool to destroy it 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.789
 people are with the world 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.119
 The real ones think I'm on the street. 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.360
 trajectory of our ancestors 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.020
 so diverse culture 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.020
 and became of inheritance 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.070
 ae 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.800
 It's a joke, we're talking about a 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.720
 more critical playful way is there too I 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.580
 I think it's a lot to see, we talk. 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.580
 much that he would prove would also speak
