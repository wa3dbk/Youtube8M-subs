hi and welcome to the linear drumming

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.640 
hi and welcome to the linear drumming
section<00:00:17.520> ok<00:00:17.910> linear<00:00:18.390> drumming<00:00:18.810> means<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.440> at

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
section ok linear drumming means that at

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.679 
section ok linear drumming means that at
no<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.759> any<00:00:21.000> subdivision

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
no time on any subdivision

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.329 
no time on any subdivision
are<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.900> ever<00:00:22.050> playing<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.589> than<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:23.009> drum

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:23.339 
are you ever playing more than one drum

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.640 
are you ever playing more than one drum
okay<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.089> all<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.839> beats<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.349> was<00:00:25.470> playing

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
okay so all the beats that I was playing

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.859 
okay so all the beats that I was playing
before<00:00:26.099> that's<00:00:26.849> sixteenth<00:00:27.329> note<00:00:27.539> figures

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
before that's sixteenth note figures

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
before that's sixteenth note figures
like<00:00:30.890> okay<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.919> was<00:00:32.279> linear<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.970> was<00:00:33.060> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
like okay that was linear that was a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
like okay that was linear that was a
linear<00:00:33.420> beat<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.989> you'll<00:00:34.440> notice<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.829> no

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
linear beat and you'll notice that no

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.680 
linear beat and you'll notice that no
time<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.579> ever<00:00:35.700> playing<00:00:35.970> like<00:00:36.210> bass<00:00:36.480> drum

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
time was I ever playing like bass drum

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.200 
time was I ever playing like bass drum
and<00:00:36.840> hi-hats<00:00:37.170> together<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:38.610> hats<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and hi-hats together like or hats and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.810 
and hi-hats together like or hats and
snare<00:00:39.530> okay<00:00:40.530> linear<00:00:41.040> beats<00:00:41.280> whether<00:00:41.610> it's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
snare okay linear beats whether it's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.340 
snare okay linear beats whether it's
sixteenth<00:00:42.300> notes<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.720> triplets<00:00:43.170> or

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
sixteenth notes or triplets or

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.320 
sixteenth notes or triplets or
thirty-second<00:00:44.070> note<00:00:44.190> triplets<00:00:44.580> everything

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
thirty-second note triplets everything

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.120 
thirty-second note triplets everything
is<00:00:45.420> broken<00:00:45.630> up<00:00:45.900> so<00:00:46.110> you're<00:00:46.260> only<00:00:46.410> playing<00:00:46.830> one

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
is broken up so you're only playing one

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.460 
is broken up so you're only playing one
drum<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.730> any<00:00:48.060> given<00:00:48.360> subdivision<00:00:48.990> so<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
drum on any given subdivision so a

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.110 
drum on any given subdivision so a
sixteenth<00:00:49.980> note<00:00:50.040> pattern<00:00:50.550> which<00:00:50.730> might<00:00:50.940> be

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
sixteenth note pattern which might be

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.480 
sixteenth note pattern which might be
one<00:00:51.480> E<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:52.110> two<00:00:52.140> E<00:00:52.380> and<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.980> three

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
one E and a two E and a three

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.130 
one E and a two E and a three
you<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.120> split<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.660> between<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you have to split it up between the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
you have to split it up between the
limbs<00:00:55.350> okay<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.040> that<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.490> kind<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
limbs okay and and that can kind of in

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.510 
limbs okay and and that can kind of in
itself<00:00:57.710> be<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.740> little<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.220> skill<00:00:59.460> that

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
itself be a little bit of a skill that

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.890 
itself be a little bit of a skill that
you're<00:00:59.700> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.060> to<00:01:00.180> learn<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.660> even

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
you're going to have to learn or even

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.990 
you're going to have to learn or even
unlearn<00:01:01.440> sort<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.860> playing<00:01:02.190> together<00:01:02.490> all<00:01:02.880> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
unlearn sort of playing together all the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
unlearn sort of playing together all the
time<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.540> what<00:01:04.170> we're<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
time and what we're going to do first of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.929 
time and what we're going to do first of
all<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.780> learn<00:01:06.780> about<00:01:07.259> four<00:01:07.650> basic<00:01:08.100> units<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
all is learn about four basic units that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
all is learn about four basic units that
I've<00:01:09.119> observed<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.810> own<00:01:09.960> playing<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.469> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I've observed in my own playing and a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560 
I've observed in my own playing and a
lot<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> popular<00:01:11.280> linear<00:01:11.609> beats<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.149> be<00:01:12.329> sort

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
lot of popular linear beats to be sort

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.529 
lot of popular linear beats to be sort
of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.749> main<00:01:13.850> patterns<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.179> will<00:01:15.359> or

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
of the main patterns if you will or

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.380 
of the main patterns if you will or
units<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.829> most<00:01:17.189> beats<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.789> made<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
units that most beats are made up of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.109 
units that most beats are made up of
okay<00:01:18.749> most<00:01:19.049> linear<00:01:19.320> beats<00:01:19.649> so<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.609> first<00:01:20.850> two

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
okay most linear beats so the first two

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.480 
okay most linear beats so the first two
are<00:01:21.479> very<00:01:21.509> similar<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.710> first<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.460> just

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
are very similar the first one is just

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.779 
are very similar the first one is just
bass<00:01:24.030> drum<00:01:24.329> snare<00:01:24.689> drum<00:01:25.109> hi-hat<00:01:25.590> okay<00:01:26.429> so<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
bass drum snare drum hi-hat okay so and

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.010 
bass drum snare drum hi-hat okay so and
that's<00:01:26.969> even<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> feel<00:01:27.569> that<00:01:27.749> you're<00:01:27.869> probably

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that's even a feel that you're probably

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.480 
that's even a feel that you're probably
you<00:01:28.289> know<00:01:28.380> used<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> playing<00:01:28.920> around<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.310> kid

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you know used to playing around the kid

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
you know used to playing around the kid
on<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:29.729> Tom's<00:01:29.969> and<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.359> very<00:01:30.840> common

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
on the Tom's and so on very common

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.379 
on the Tom's and so on very common
pattern<00:01:31.380> okay<00:01:32.069> so<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> these

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:33.389 
pattern okay so with all of these

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:35.480 
pattern okay so with all of these
exercises<00:01:33.719> by<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:34.499> we'll<00:01:34.920> always<00:01:35.159> be

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
exercises by the way we'll always be

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.950 
exercises by the way we'll always be
playing<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> left<00:01:36.090> hand<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.389> the<00:01:36.450> snare<00:01:36.569> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
playing the left hand on the snare and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.929 
playing the left hand on the snare and
the<00:01:37.289> right<00:01:37.499> hand<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> high<00:01:38.069> hats<00:01:38.340> okay<00:01:38.729> so

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the right hand on the high hats okay so

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.749 
the right hand on the high hats okay so
the<00:01:39.210> first<00:01:39.359> pattern<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.170> bass<00:01:40.679> rum<00:01:40.979> snare

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the first pattern is just bass rum snare

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.020 
the first pattern is just bass rum snare
drum<00:01:41.999> hi-hat<00:01:42.719> so<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.889> used<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.429> yes

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
drum hi-hat so just get used to that yes

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
drum hi-hat so just get used to that yes
it's<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.389> pattern<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.719> three<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.499> can<00:01:46.679> think

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it's a pattern of three so you can think

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.529 
it's a pattern of three so you can think
of<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.159> triplets<00:01:47.609> in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.819> start<00:01:48.119> but

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
of it as triplets in the start but

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.969 
of it as triplets in the start but
ultimately<00:01:49.049> we're<00:01:49.289> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.499> be<00:01:49.590> playing<00:01:49.859> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
ultimately we're going to be playing it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.949 
ultimately we're going to be playing it
not<00:01:50.159> only<00:01:50.459> in<00:01:50.579> triplet<00:01:50.909> patterns<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.719> a

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
not only in triplet patterns but as a

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.539

at this point don't worry about ghosting

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.390 
at this point don't worry about ghosting
you<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> snare<00:02:10.590> drum<00:02:10.800> or<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.009> hi-hat<00:02:11.370> or

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
you know the snare drum or the hi-hat or

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.250 
you know the snare drum or the hi-hat or
anything<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:12.330> get<00:02:12.480> used<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.959> pattern

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
anything just get used to that pattern

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.290 
anything just get used to that pattern
once<00:02:13.860> it's<00:02:14.040> comfortable<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> really<00:02:15.030> slow

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
once it's comfortable at a really slow

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.910 
once it's comfortable at a really slow
tempo<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.959> course<00:02:16.290> practice<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.890> a

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
tempo of course practice it to a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:27.430 
tempo of course practice it to a
metronome<00:02:17.270> gradually<00:02:18.270> build<00:02:18.480> up<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> speed

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.110 

okay<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.500> that's<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.130> first<00:02:29.160> pattern<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
okay so that's the first pattern the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.090 
okay so that's the first pattern the
second<00:02:30.569> pattern<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.500> opposite<00:02:31.980> of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
second pattern is just the opposite of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.710 
second pattern is just the opposite of
that<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:32.459> far<00:02:32.670> as<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.880> hands<00:02:33.180> go<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.690> again

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that as far as the hands go so again

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.840 
that as far as the hands go so again
it's<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.350> pattern<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.709> three<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> as

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
it's a pattern of three think of it as

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.520 
it's a pattern of three think of it as
triplets<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> beginning<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.260> just

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
triplets in the beginning and you just

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.520 
triplets in the beginning and you just
play<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:38.010> bass<00:02:38.310> drum<00:02:38.340> hi-hat<00:02:39.300> snare<00:02:40.170> drum

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
play the bass drum hi-hat snare drum

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.040 
play the bass drum hi-hat snare drum
instead<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.280> bass<00:02:41.880> drum<00:02:42.180> snare<00:02:42.450> drum<00:02:42.810> hi-hat

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
instead of bass drum snare drum hi-hat

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.050 
instead of bass drum snare drum hi-hat
okay<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:43.920> you're<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.459> swapping<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.850> hands

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
okay so you're just swapping the hands

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.790 
okay so you're just swapping the hands
around<00:02:45.390> okay<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.170> sounds<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.500> little<00:02:46.620> bit

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
around okay and it sounds a little bit

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.380 
around okay and it sounds a little bit
different<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> high<00:02:47.670> hats<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:48.000> coming<00:02:48.300> in

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
different the high hats are coming in

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.780 
different the high hats are coming in
straight<00:02:48.690> up<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.050> kick<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:50.040> get<00:02:50.220> bass

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
straight up for the kick so we get bass

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.410 
straight up for the kick so we get bass
drum<00:02:51.120> hi-hat<00:02:51.720> snare<00:02:52.500> drum<00:02:52.890> bass<00:02:53.489> drum<00:02:53.790> hi-hat

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
drum hi-hat snare drum bass drum hi-hat

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.990 
drum hi-hat snare drum bass drum hi-hat
snare<00:02:55.170> drum<00:03:00.980> okay<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.040> that's<00:03:02.459> that's<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
snare drum okay so that's that's the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.640 
snare drum okay so that's that's the
first<00:03:03.269> two<00:03:03.480> patterns<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.079> any<00:03:04.230> time<00:03:04.470> I'm

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
first two patterns and any time I'm

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.930 
first two patterns and any time I'm
playing<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.980> beat<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:07.370> okay<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.730> was

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
playing a beat like okay there I was

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.390 
playing a beat like okay there I was
playing<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.299> first<00:03:09.450> pattern<00:03:09.780> just<00:03:09.989> going

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.800 

okay<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.430> that's<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.120> first<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:15.540> that's<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
okay so that's the first but that's the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.680 
okay so that's the first but that's the
first<00:03:15.959> two<00:03:16.230> patterns<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.130> third<00:03:17.760> pattern<00:03:18.060> is

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
first two patterns the third pattern is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.539 
first two patterns the third pattern is
just<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.680> we<00:03:19.860> are<00:03:20.010> actually<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.489> to

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
just this is we are actually going to

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.310 
just this is we are actually going to
incorporate<00:03:21.060> some<00:03:21.239> internal<00:03:21.750> dynamics<00:03:22.200> into

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
incorporate some internal dynamics into

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.080 
incorporate some internal dynamics into
this<00:03:22.470> third<00:03:22.709> pattern<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.579> pattern<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:24.060> a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
this third pattern the pattern is a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.330 
this third pattern the pattern is a
sixteenth<00:03:24.660> note<00:03:24.750> pattern<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.380> we<00:03:25.860> play<00:03:26.100> on

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
sixteenth note pattern and we play on

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.370 
sixteenth note pattern and we play on
the<00:03:26.400> high<00:03:26.670> hats<00:03:26.910> on<00:03:27.120> all<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> downbeats<00:03:28.200> as

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
the high hats on all of the downbeats as

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.500 
the high hats on all of the downbeats as
an<00:03:28.680> accent<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:29.220> we<00:03:29.670> play<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> shoulder<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.480> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
an accent so we play the shoulder of the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.270 
an accent so we play the shoulder of the
stick<00:03:30.600> on<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.170> edge<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.650> high<00:03:31.799> hats<00:03:32.040> and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
stick on the edge of the high hats and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.280 
stick on the edge of the high hats and
we<00:03:32.610> get<00:03:32.820> one<00:03:33.470> two<00:03:34.549> three<00:03:35.549> four<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.870> we're

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
we get one two three four and we're

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.990 
we get one two three four and we're
subdividing<00:03:37.920> sixteenth<00:03:38.370> notes<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:38.850> we're

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
subdividing sixteenth notes so we're

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.840 
subdividing sixteenth notes so we're
thinking<00:03:39.920> one-e-and-a<00:03:40.920> two-e-and-a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
thinking one-e-and-a two-e-and-a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.720 
thinking one-e-and-a two-e-and-a
three-e-and-a<00:03:42.840> four-e-and-a<00:03:43.739> one<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.549> is

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
three-e-and-a four-e-and-a one this is

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.110 
three-e-and-a four-e-and-a one this is
the<00:03:44.820> third<00:03:45.000> pattern<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.769> 1e<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.370> each<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
the third pattern on 1e and each of the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.420 
the third pattern on 1e and each of the
e<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.660> sixteenth<00:03:49.380> notes<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:49.890> every<00:03:50.040> beat

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
e and sixteenth notes for every beat

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.400 
e and sixteenth notes for every beat
we're<00:03:50.850> gonna<00:03:50.970> play<00:03:51.269> two<00:03:51.329> ghost<00:03:51.900> notes<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.290> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
we're gonna play two ghost notes on the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.590 
we're gonna play two ghost notes on the
snare<00:03:52.470> drum<00:03:52.680> okay<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.609> means<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.150> we

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
snare drum okay and that means that we

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.390 
snare drum okay and that means that we
drop<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> stick<00:03:55.260> from<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.620> really<00:03:55.950> low<00:03:56.130> height

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
drop the stick from a really low height

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.280 
drop the stick from a really low height
whatever<00:03:56.700> we<00:03:56.970> want<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.209> play<00:03:57.359> soft<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:58.079> just

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
whatever we want to play soft we just

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.840 
whatever we want to play soft we just
drop<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.650> stick<00:03:58.859> from<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.070> low<00:03:59.220> high<00:03:59.430> because

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
drop the stick from a low high because

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.759 
drop the stick from a low high because
you<00:04:00.000> can't<00:04:00.269> really<00:04:00.510> play<00:04:00.810> loud<00:04:01.109> from<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.620> low

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
you can't really play loud from a low

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.910 
you can't really play loud from a low
height<00:04:01.980> unless<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.940> snap<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.450> stick<00:04:03.859> okay<00:04:04.859> so

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
height unless you snap the stick okay so

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.500 
height unless you snap the stick okay so
that's<00:04:05.220> that's<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.640> way<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.850> guarantee<00:04:06.239> that

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
that's that's a way to guarantee that

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.930 
that's that's a way to guarantee that
you'll<00:04:06.810> get<00:04:06.989> those<00:04:07.140> softer<00:04:07.530> notes<00:04:07.709> okay<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:08.430> on

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
you'll get those softer notes okay so on

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.860 
you'll get those softer notes okay so on
e<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.500> we<00:04:10.769> play<00:04:10.980> ghost<00:04:11.250> notes<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.910> we<00:04:12.030> get

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
e and and we play ghost notes so we get

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.939

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
and one okay and one E and AH the a fee

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.080 
and one okay and one E and AH the a fee
for<00:04:22.260> each<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> four<00:04:22.919> beats<00:04:23.160> is<00:04:23.490> played<00:04:23.940> on

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
for each of the four beats is played on

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.270 
for each of the four beats is played on
the<00:04:24.180> bass<00:04:24.360> drum<00:04:24.389> nice<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.169> solid<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.620> we<00:04:26.100> get

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
the bass drum nice and solid and we get

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.950 
the bass drum nice and solid and we get
one<00:04:27.060> E<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.419> two<00:04:28.169> E<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.680> three<00:04:29.340> E<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:29.940> four<00:04:30.630> E

and<00:04:31.229> a<00:04:31.830> one<00:04:32.160> okay<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.120> there<00:04:33.810> I'd<00:04:34.020> use<00:04:34.290> that

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
and a one okay so there I'd use that

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.530 
and a one okay so there I'd use that
pattern<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:34.889> something<00:04:35.220> like<00:04:41.180> okay<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.240> that's

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
pattern in something like okay so that's

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.050 
pattern in something like okay so that's
the<00:04:42.660> third<00:04:42.930> basic<00:04:43.260> unit<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:44.280> fourth<00:04:44.610> basic

the third basic unit the fourth basic

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.879 
the third basic unit the fourth basic
unit<00:04:45.389> doesn't<00:04:45.750> use<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.990> hi-hats<00:04:46.380> at<00:04:46.530> all<00:04:46.680> it

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
unit doesn't use the hi-hats at all it

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.590 
unit doesn't use the hi-hats at all it
just<00:04:47.220> uses<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.699> bass<00:04:47.910> drum<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.449> snare

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
just uses the bass drum and the snare

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.600 
just uses the bass drum and the snare
drum<00:04:49.080> ghost<00:04:49.320> notes<00:04:49.590> we're<00:04:50.070> still<00:04:50.310> going<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:50.520> be

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
drum ghost notes we're still going to be

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.400 
drum ghost notes we're still going to be
playing<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.940> ghost<00:04:51.150> notes<00:04:51.419> on<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.750> E<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.260> the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
beats one two three and four we play

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.930 
beats one two three and four we play
bass<00:04:57.090> drum<00:04:57.389> and<00:04:57.570> on<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.199> one<00:04:58.410> E<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.680> AH<00:04:59.070> all<00:04:59.669> of

bass drum and on the one E and AH all of
the<00:05:00.060> athletes<00:05:00.270> we<00:05:00.960> play<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.289> bass<00:05:01.470> drum<00:05:01.500> as

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
the athletes we play the bass drum as

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.290 
the athletes we play the bass drum as
well<00:05:01.979> so<00:05:02.729> really<00:05:02.760> slow<00:05:03.360> we<00:05:03.900> get<00:05:04.139> one<00:05:04.830> E<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.310> AH

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
well so really slow we get one E and AH

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.360 
well so really slow we get one E and AH
two<00:05:06.690> E<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:07.760> three<00:05:08.760> E<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.660> four<00:05:10.560> E<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.850> AH<00:05:12.750> one

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
two E and three E and four E and AH one

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.400 
two E and three E and four E and AH one
okay<00:05:14.370> so<00:05:14.430> once<00:05:15.000> you've<00:05:15.150> got<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.539> nice<00:05:16.169> and

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
okay so once you've got that nice and

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.620 
okay so once you've got that nice and
even<00:05:16.680> at<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.860> slow<00:05:17.190> tempo<00:05:17.490> again<00:05:17.910> with<00:05:18.240> all<00:05:18.450> of

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
even at a slow tempo again with all of

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.779 
even at a slow tempo again with all of
this<00:05:18.750> stuff<00:05:19.050> it's<00:05:19.500> crucial<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.039> it's<00:05:20.280> really

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
this stuff it's crucial that it's really

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.969 
this stuff it's crucial that it's really
nice<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:21.300> even<00:05:21.570> at<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.750> slow<00:05:22.020> tempo<00:05:22.050> these

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
nice and even at a slow tempo these

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.890 
nice and even at a slow tempo these
patterns<00:05:23.460> because<00:05:23.789> they're<00:05:23.970> quite<00:05:24.240> busy<00:05:24.510> they

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
patterns because they're quite busy they

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.900 
patterns because they're quite busy they
will<00:05:25.169> not<00:05:25.410> work<00:05:25.590> unless<00:05:25.919> they're<00:05:26.370> even<00:05:26.700> and

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
will not work unless they're even and

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.029 
will not work unless they're even and
they<00:05:27.000> sound<00:05:27.510> like<00:05:27.539> a<00:05:27.720> dog's<00:05:27.990> breakfast<00:05:28.470> if<00:05:28.800> you

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
they sound like a dog's breakfast if you

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.070 
they sound like a dog's breakfast if you
don't<00:05:29.310> have<00:05:29.490> them<00:05:29.669> dead<00:05:29.880> even<00:05:29.910> okay<00:05:30.630> so<00:05:30.690> the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
don't have them dead even okay so the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.870 
don't have them dead even okay so the
way<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.320> do<00:05:31.590> that<00:05:31.710> used<00:05:31.919> to<00:05:31.979> always<00:05:32.039> slow<00:05:32.760> it

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
way to do that used to always slow it

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.000 
way to do that used to always slow it
down<00:05:32.910> practice<00:05:33.570> it<00:05:33.870> with<00:05:34.050> a<00:05:34.080> metronome<00:05:34.169> really

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
down practice it with a metronome really

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.070 
down practice it with a metronome really
slow<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:35.520> gradually<00:05:36.330> speed<00:05:36.570> it<00:05:36.660> up<00:05:36.780> when

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
slow so gradually speed it up when

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.960 
slow so gradually speed it up when
you're<00:05:37.169> comfortable<00:05:37.380> with<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.740> pattern<00:05:38.039> one

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
you're comfortable with the pattern one

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:51.020 
you're comfortable with the pattern one
E<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:39.330> two<00:05:40.020> E<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.620> three<00:05:41.280> E<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:41.910> four<00:05:42.479> E<00:05:42.840> and

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:59.160 

so<00:05:52.030> that<00:05:52.210> might<00:05:52.390> be<00:05:52.420> something<00:05:52.720> like<00:05:58.110> okay<00:05:59.110> so

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
so that might be something like okay so

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.230 
so that might be something like okay so
they're<00:05:59.590> the<00:05:59.770> four<00:05:59.980> basic<00:06:00.370> units<00:06:00.730> let's<00:06:01.030> now

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
they're the four basic units let's now

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.060 
they're the four basic units let's now
have<00:06:01.420> a<00:06:01.480> look<00:06:01.540> at<00:06:01.750> some<00:06:01.870> exercises<00:06:02.590> that<00:06:02.620> deal

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
have a look at some exercises that deal

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.760 
have a look at some exercises that deal
with<00:06:03.250> just<00:06:03.610> unit<00:06:03.970> one<00:06:04.150> and<00:06:04.420> just<00:06:05.020> unit<00:06:05.350> 2<00:06:05.530> and

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
with just unit one and just unit 2 and

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.400 
with just unit one and just unit 2 and
then<00:06:06.130> unit<00:06:06.430> one<00:06:06.610> and<00:06:06.880> two<00:06:07.150> but<00:06:07.630> instead<00:06:08.050> of<00:06:08.260> a

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
then unit one and two but instead of a

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.880 
then unit one and two but instead of a
units<00:06:08.830> one<00:06:08.980> and<00:06:09.010> two<00:06:09.600> being<00:06:10.600> triplets<00:06:11.230> okay

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
units one and two being triplets okay

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.230 
units one and two being triplets okay
we're<00:06:12.100> going<00:06:12.220> to<00:06:12.280> put<00:06:12.490> those<00:06:12.670> three<00:06:13.060> notes

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
we're going to put those three notes

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.780 
we're going to put those three notes
those<00:06:13.570> cycling<00:06:14.200> three<00:06:14.470> notes<00:06:14.710> into<00:06:15.280> sixteenth

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
those cycling three notes into sixteenth

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.910 
those cycling three notes into sixteenth
note<00:06:16.000> phrases<00:06:16.450> okay<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.230> the<00:06:17.350> counting<00:06:17.800> is

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
note phrases okay so the counting is

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.280 
note phrases okay so the counting is
going<00:06:18.160> to<00:06:18.280> be<00:06:18.520> if<00:06:19.360> we've<00:06:19.540> got<00:06:19.720> it<00:06:19.840> our<00:06:19.960> pulse

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
going to be if we've got it our pulse

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.570 
going to be if we've got it our pulse
just<00:06:20.470> ticking<00:06:20.830> over<00:06:21.100> one<00:06:21.760> two<00:06:22.570> three<00:06:23.530> four<00:06:24.340> a

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
just ticking over one two three four a

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.510 
just ticking over one two three four a
little<00:06:24.820> bit<00:06:24.910> slower<00:06:25.470> one-e-and-a

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
little bit slower one-e-and-a

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.670 
little bit slower one-e-and-a
two-e-and-a<00:06:27.570> three-e-and-a<00:06:28.570> for<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.410> pulse

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
two-e-and-a three-e-and-a for the pulse

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.220 
two-e-and-a three-e-and-a for the pulse
is<00:06:29.890> going<00:06:30.010> to<00:06:30.130> be<00:06:30.220> like<00:06:30.370> this<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.820> accents<00:06:31.450> for

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
is going to be like this the accents for

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.810 
is going to be like this the accents for
those<00:06:32.380> three<00:06:32.680> notes<00:06:32.830> cycling<00:06:33.310> over<00:06:33.430> are<00:06:33.790> going

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
those three notes cycling over are going

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.230 
those three notes cycling over are going
to<00:06:33.970> be<00:06:34.090> as<00:06:34.180> follows<00:06:34.680> one<00:06:35.680> E<00:06:35.980> and<00:06:36.010> a<00:06:36.490> two<00:06:36.610> E<00:06:37.120> and

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
to be as follows one E and a two E and

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.510 
to be as follows one E and a two E and
three<00:06:37.840> E<00:06:38.200> and<00:06:38.470> four<00:06:39.100> E<00:06:39.460> and<00:06:39.730> one<00:06:42.150> three<00:06:43.290> four

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
three E and four E and one three four

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.210 
three E and four E and one three four
one<00:06:45.520> okay<00:06:46.060> so<00:06:46.120> that's<00:06:46.450> how<00:06:46.600> that<00:06:46.660> works<00:06:47.220> okay

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
one okay so that's how that works okay

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.460 
one okay so that's how that works okay
so<00:06:48.250> in<00:06:48.790> all<00:06:49.090> of<00:06:49.120> these<00:06:49.360> exercises<00:06:49.960> where<00:06:50.320> we're

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
so in all of these exercises where we're

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.350 
so in all of these exercises where we're
using<00:06:50.500> just<00:06:50.950> the<00:06:51.100> basic<00:06:51.490> first<00:06:51.760> two<00:06:51.940> units

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
using just the basic first two units

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.270 
using just the basic first two units
don't<00:06:52.840> worry<00:06:53.140> so<00:06:53.410> much<00:06:53.470> about<00:06:53.620> internal

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
don't worry so much about internal

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.860 
don't worry so much about internal
dynamics<00:06:54.790> these<00:06:54.970> these<00:06:55.270> patterns<00:06:55.720> are<00:06:55.840> just

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
dynamics these these patterns are just

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.410 
dynamics these these patterns are just
designed<00:06:56.470> to<00:06:56.620> get<00:06:57.310> you<00:06:57.490> used<00:06:57.670> to<00:06:57.790> splitting<00:06:58.240> up

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
designed to get you used to splitting up

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.760 
designed to get you used to splitting up
your<00:06:58.450> hands<00:06:58.810> so<00:06:59.020> you'll<00:06:59.170> be<00:06:59.260> playing<00:06:59.530> things

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
your hands so you'll be playing things

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.130 
your hands so you'll be playing things
like<00:07:03.180> okay<00:07:04.180> don't<00:07:04.390> worry<00:07:04.630> so<00:07:04.930> much<00:07:04.960> about

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
like okay don't worry so much about

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.750 
like okay don't worry so much about
dropping<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:05.860> stick<00:07:06.100> from<00:07:06.220> a<00:07:06.340> really<00:07:06.610> low

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
dropping the stick from a really low

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.460 
dropping the stick from a really low
height<00:07:07.030> okay<00:07:07.450> either<00:07:07.720> with<00:07:07.990> the<00:07:08.080> snare<00:07:08.290> drum

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
height okay either with the snare drum

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.930 
height okay either with the snare drum
or<00:07:08.590> the<00:07:08.710> high<00:07:08.860> hats<00:07:09.100> again<00:07:09.490> these<00:07:09.670> are<00:07:09.910> just

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
or the high hats again these are just

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.390 
or the high hats again these are just
beginning<00:07:10.240> exercises<00:07:11.200> just<00:07:11.560> to<00:07:11.680> learn<00:07:11.950> how<00:07:12.370> to

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
beginning exercises just to learn how to

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.130 
beginning exercises just to learn how to
split<00:07:12.790> up<00:07:12.910> the<00:07:13.000> hands<00:07:13.240> okay<00:07:13.510> so<00:07:13.570> trying<00:07:14.020> to

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
split up the hands okay so trying to

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:21.060 
split up the hands okay so trying to
break<00:07:14.350> you<00:07:14.500> away<00:07:14.740> from<00:07:14.800> playing<00:07:19.860> okay<00:07:20.860> things

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
break you away from playing okay things

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.100 
break you away from playing okay things
like<00:07:21.280> that<00:07:21.460> so<00:07:21.790> let's<00:07:22.360> have<00:07:22.480> a<00:07:22.540> look<00:07:22.690> now<00:07:22.870> at

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
like that so let's have a look now at

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.350 
like that so let's have a look now at
these<00:07:23.230> first<00:07:23.470> basic<00:07:23.920> patterns<00:07:24.250> okay<00:07:25.000> we've

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
these first basic patterns okay we've

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.180 
these first basic patterns okay we've
had<00:07:25.480> a<00:07:25.540> look<00:07:25.750> at<00:07:25.930> some<00:07:26.140> basic<00:07:26.170> patterns<00:07:26.860> let's

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190 
had a look at some basic patterns let's

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.010 
had a look at some basic patterns let's
now<00:07:27.370> have<00:07:27.580> a<00:07:27.640> look<00:07:27.700> at<00:07:28.060> incorporating<00:07:28.390> all

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
now have a look at incorporating all

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.500 
now have a look at incorporating all
four<00:07:29.440> units<00:07:29.950> into<00:07:30.460> some<00:07:30.670> actual<00:07:31.060> beats<00:07:31.360> that

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:31.510 
four units into some actual beats that

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.720 
four units into some actual beats that
you<00:07:31.540> probably<00:07:31.870> use<00:07:32.020> okay<00:07:32.770> so<00:07:32.830> now<00:07:33.520> we're<00:07:33.640> going

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:33.730 
you probably use okay so now we're going

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:41.369 
you probably use okay so now we're going
to<00:07:33.820> be<00:07:33.910> looking<00:07:34.180> more<00:07:34.390> at<00:07:34.630> things<00:07:34.930> like

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:41.379 

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:43.809 

okay<00:07:42.379> some<00:07:42.589> actual<00:07:42.949> Bates<00:07:43.189> way<00:07:43.399> you<00:07:43.459> would<00:07:43.789> use

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:43.819 
okay some actual Bates way you would use

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:47.289 
okay some actual Bates way you would use
this<00:07:44.269> linear<00:07:44.689> style<00:07:44.959> plane
