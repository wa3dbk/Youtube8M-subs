operates so it operates off one double-a

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.400 
operates so it operates off one double-a
battery<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:32.809> we're<00:00:32.930> gonna<00:00:33.020> go<00:00:33.199> ahead<00:00:33.260> and

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
battery so we're gonna go ahead and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.739 
battery so we're gonna go ahead and
stick<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.649> sanyo<00:00:34.190> eneloop<00:00:34.340> in<00:00:34.760> there<00:00:34.909> I'll<00:00:35.690> show

you<00:00:35.960> how<00:00:36.050> this<00:00:36.170> thing<00:00:36.879> goes<00:00:37.879> through<00:00:38.120> its

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
you how this thing goes through its

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.959 
you how this thing goes through its
different<00:00:38.569> modes<00:00:39.039> so<00:00:40.039> it's<00:00:40.159> a<00:00:40.249> twisty<00:00:40.639> there's

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
different modes so it's a twisty there's

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.939 
different modes so it's a twisty there's
no<00:00:41.210> push<00:00:41.659> button<00:00:41.960> on<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.170> end<00:00:42.319> so<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:42.649> do

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
no push button on the end so you do

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.340 
no push button on the end so you do
everything<00:00:43.309> by<00:00:43.460> twisting<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:43.940> head<00:00:44.199> what<00:00:45.199> you

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
everything by twisting the head what you

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.319 
everything by twisting the head what you
do<00:00:45.499> is<00:00:45.679> when<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:46.280> first<00:00:46.370> tighten<00:00:46.909> it<00:00:46.999> it's

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
do is when you first tighten it it's

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.299 
do is when you first tighten it it's
going<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.569> turn<00:00:47.809> on<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.199> then<00:00:48.889> if<00:00:49.010> you<00:00:49.100> want<00:00:49.249> to

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
going to turn on and then if you want to

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.590 
going to turn on and then if you want to
actually<00:00:49.399> change<00:00:49.729> the<00:00:49.879> brightness<00:00:50.059> because

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
actually change the brightness because

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.789 
actually change the brightness because
you<00:00:50.780> can<00:00:50.899> change<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.199> brightness<00:00:51.319> on<00:00:51.649> this

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
you can change the brightness on this

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:52.180 
you can change the brightness on this
thing

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
thing

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.129 
thing
just<00:00:52.579> turn<00:00:52.760> it<00:00:52.879> off<00:00:52.969> and<00:00:53.030> on<00:00:53.299> real<00:00:53.510> quickly<00:00:53.690> and

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
just turn it off and on real quickly and

just turn it off and on real quickly and
you'll<00:00:54.649> see<00:00:54.799> it<00:00:54.920> start<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.219> ramp<00:00:55.399> through<00:00:55.579> the

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:55.639 
you'll see it start to ramp through the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.840 
you'll see it start to ramp through the
different<00:00:55.909> brightnesses<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:57.729> what<00:00:58.729> it's

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
different brightnesses and what it's

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.399 
different brightnesses and what it's
going<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:58.999> do<00:00:59.179> is<00:00:59.329> gonna<00:00:59.510> flash<00:00:59.809> when<00:01:00.170> it's<00:01:00.289> all

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409

and I just keep on going through all the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.859 
and I just keep on going through all the
different<00:01:04.430> brightnesses<00:01:04.940> now<00:01:05.510> when<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.720> see

to that until you go through the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.740 
to that until you go through the
brightness<00:01:13.280> changing<00:01:13.670> again<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.570> off<00:01:14.720> and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
brightness changing again so the off and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.420 
brightness changing again so the off and
on<00:01:14.990> really<00:01:15.350> quickly<00:01:15.710> when<00:01:15.860> it's<00:01:16.010> already<00:01:16.280> on

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
on really quickly when it's already on

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.700 
on really quickly when it's already on
and<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:17.450> can<00:01:17.720> do<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.930> brightness<00:01:18.350> changing

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
and you can do the brightness changing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.100 
and you can do the brightness changing
again<00:01:18.860> but<00:01:19.520> if<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.790> don't<00:01:19.970> do<00:01:20.120> that<00:01:20.270> if<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:20.870> set

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
again but if you don't do that if I set

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.230 
again but if you don't do that if I set
it<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:21.500> it's<00:01:22.010> gonna<00:01:22.160> be<00:01:22.340> on<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:22.490> every

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
it to that it's gonna be on that every

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.900 
it to that it's gonna be on that every
time<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:23.450> turn<00:01:23.690> it<00:01:23.810> on<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:25.280> let's<00:01:25.400> open<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.790> up

this little guy outside and we'll show
you<00:01:56.450> how<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> EZ<00:01:57.050> double-a<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.890> new<00:01:58.040> version

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
you how the EZ double-a the new version

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.340 
you how the EZ double-a the new version
of<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.610> does<00:01:58.790> outside<00:01:59.180> alright<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.200> we've<00:02:00.320> got

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
of it does outside alright so we've got

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.380 
of it does outside alright so we've got
the<00:02:00.620> EZ<00:02:00.770> double-a<00:02:01.370> r5<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.090> then<00:02:02.180> we're<00:02:02.270> going

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
the EZ double-a r5 and then we're going

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.840 
the EZ double-a r5 and then we're going
to<00:02:02.420> be<00:02:02.690> comparing<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.260> to<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.500> standard<00:02:03.890> 4<00:02:04.700> d

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
to be comparing it to the standard 4 d

away tree this 100 feet away as normal
you<00:02:15.379> can<00:02:15.439> see<00:02:15.650> what's<00:02:15.799> going<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.069> in<00:02:16.219> this

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
you can see what's going on in this

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.130 
you can see what's going on in this
that<00:02:16.730> hotspot<00:02:16.879> this<00:02:17.329> is<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.629> tightly<00:02:17.870> focused

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
that hotspot this is as tightly focused

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.349 
that hotspot this is as tightly focused
as<00:02:18.439> he<00:02:18.530> gets<00:02:18.739> but<00:02:19.609> not<00:02:19.730> much<00:02:19.879> more<00:02:20.060> around<00:02:20.239> that

let's<00:02:25.819> go<00:02:25.939> ahead<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.180> try<00:02:26.329> that<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:27.290> easy

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
let's go ahead and try that that easy

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.470 
let's go ahead and try that that easy
double-a<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:28.819> see<00:02:29.030> how<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.269> does<00:02:29.299> so<00:02:31.359> you<00:02:32.359> can

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
double-a and see how it does so you can

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.470 
double-a and see how it does so you can
see<00:02:32.659> really<00:02:33.049> great<00:02:33.170> beam<00:02:33.409> on<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.799> it<00:02:34.790> easily

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
see really great beam on that it easily

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.629 
see really great beam on that it easily
lights<00:02:35.750> up<00:02:35.930> more<00:02:36.200> than<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.709> much<00:02:37.430> much

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
lights up more than that much much

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.569 
lights up more than that much much
larger<00:02:37.879> light<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:39.709> does<00:02:39.889> it<00:02:40.069> really<00:02:40.430> well

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
larger light and it does it really well

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.240 
larger light and it does it really well
with<00:02:40.849> a<00:02:40.909> really<00:02:41.120> nice<00:02:41.269> beam<00:02:42.069> looks<00:02:43.069> pretty

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
with a really nice beam looks pretty

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.800 
with a really nice beam looks pretty
good<00:02:43.370> out<00:02:43.430> there<00:02:43.579> so<00:02:44.359> there's<00:02:44.599> your<00:02:44.750> little

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
good out there so there's your little

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.229 
good out there so there's your little
bush<00:02:45.290> 15<00:02:45.769> feet<00:02:45.950> away<00:02:46.069> tree<00:02:46.760> that's<00:02:46.939> hundred

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
bush 15 feet away tree that's hundred

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.909 
bush 15 feet away tree that's hundred
feet<00:02:47.389> away<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.840> can<00:02:48.319> see<00:02:48.349> all<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.680> stuff

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
feet away I can see all that stuff

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.640 
feet away I can see all that stuff
really<00:02:49.069> clearly<00:02:49.549> so<00:02:50.329> let's<00:02:50.480> go<00:02:50.599> ahead<00:02:50.689> and<00:02:50.900> let

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
really clearly so let's go ahead and let

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.390 
really clearly so let's go ahead and let
it<00:02:51.769> ran<00:02:51.859> through<00:02:51.889> the<00:02:52.099> different

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
it ran through the different

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.619 
it ran through the different
brightnesses<00:02:52.819> you<00:02:53.060> can<00:02:53.180> kind<00:02:53.329> of<00:02:53.389> see<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
brightnesses you can kind of see the

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:00.550 
brightnesses you can kind of see the
difference<00:02:53.930> between<00:02:54.049> them<00:02:54.349> all<00:02:59.379> let<00:03:00.379> it<00:03:00.470> go

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
difference between them all let it go

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.780 
difference between them all let it go
through<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.859> a<00:03:00.889> couple<00:03:01.129> times<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:01.549> so<00:03:01.669> you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
through that a couple times just so you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.479 
through that a couple times just so you
can<00:03:01.879> see<00:03:02.000> it

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
can see it

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.789 
can see it
I'll<00:03:04.489> just<00:03:04.700> trap<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.329> back<00:03:05.450> on<00:03:05.629> max<00:03:05.870> that's<00:03:06.500> it

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
I'll just trap it back on max that's it

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.759 
I'll just trap it back on max that's it
on<00:03:06.919> max<00:03:07.159> again<00:03:08.049> so<00:03:09.049> that's<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.379> for<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.620> easy

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
on max again so that's it for the easy

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.259 
on max again so that's it for the easy
