00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.230
 Hello everyone and in this video I will show you 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.599
 how to clean the throttle on 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.440
 audi a6 c5 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.470
 and so we already throttle removed 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.080
 with audi on how to remove the throttle 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.050
 flap you can read by going on 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.609
 this link in the description there honestly 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.519
 nothing complicated just need to be removed 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:33.420
 intake hose and unscrew 4 bolts here 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.940
 they are 1 2 3 4 4 bolts and you have a valve 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.649
 will be in the hands 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.680
 how do you see the flap 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.860
 never seen starred and very 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.489
 so dirty she is in this donkey because of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.579
 the fact that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.149
 audi is arranged in such a way that here 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.719
 crankcase ventilation supplied 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.670
 before the valve that is the valve you have 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.890
 so here it is worth it so the valve 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.600
 running opens from here is served 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.309
 air so that's it 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.560
 crankcase ventilation 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.119
 goes before the valve so all the oil 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.369
 which ventilation sucks it on everything 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.229
 come across the service therefore her 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.909
 periodically recommend taking and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530
 brush and now i will show how it is 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.390
 to make 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 everything is done very simply I bought the first 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.890
 got 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.140
 not a carburetor cleaner and we will 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.740
 spray it all did throttle 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.479
 damper 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.479
 Well, let's get started 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.510
 so you see we sprayed a little 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.730
 and already the flap becomes clean so 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.140
 in the same way completely knock down everything 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.140
 whip all the dirt 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.210
 doing the same from the back 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.990
 also do not forget to open the flap and 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.990
 churn mud out 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.720
 immediately tell you that all the dirt you 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.530
 knock down will not work therefore leftovers 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.890
 just take a rag and wipe it 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.770
 everything 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.500
 a rag and so throttle 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.820
 we washed as you can see she became 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:40.870
 neat here and here with this 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:46.870
 parties if you notice look 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:50.489
 how much dirt from her mud was shot down well 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.130
 and when installing I recommend to replace 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:59.110
 intake manifold gasket which 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.770
 goes to the flap as well as the intake 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.100
 nipple 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.880
 flap here special attention as u 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.120
 always have me all 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.130
 the flap is present oil is the one who 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.480
 then laying here you can see these as 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.850
 she was always in oil and 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.310
 just cracked torn and so 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.050
 began to see it completely rude for 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.500
 three hardened therefore 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.810
 It could suck the air and fall were 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.840
 what is the dirt to you in the inlet 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.840
 collector 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.360
 on this i clean my own 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.500
 throttle valves and watch out for 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.500
 by car for now
