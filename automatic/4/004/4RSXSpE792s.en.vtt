00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello and welcome to the tango 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.620
 Technique I'm hammam and explain you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.480
 today the tango leg with it a feeling 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.610
 I can still give you that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.080
 a base exercises show this 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.080
 okay let's start 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.210
 ok before we start I want the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.920
 explain conceptuality and indeed 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.710
 I use it when I tango the tango 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.510
 use this starts immediately above 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.310
 the breast on or here mean 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.520
 shoulder blades always peeks from behind 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.250
 It is not in the basin in here 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.510
 but it pulls up here and up 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.640
 if I do the exercise then I kick 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.340
 always that that my tango thalia 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.410
 Here is my tango hip 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.230
 the knee is then again the foot 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.270
 also as we know it 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.610
 if I move the two says I want 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.190
 then before I do that from the side 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.960
 if I do not do it, then I will 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.860
 in everyday life actually my shoulders 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.320
 over the hip 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.229
 but if I activated that tango leg 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.090
 then that goes under the breast 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.860
 or comes in to rotationally 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.369
 I speak my tank I have right 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.700
 ahead 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.110
 that turns left and right here 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.210
 I'll just stay there I want 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.539
 but stay with my partner but it is 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.220
 not that but it is here 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:30.520
 Turned up under the breast 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.040
 and to practice that , there is a beautiful one 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 basic exercise that is quite simple 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.979
 cross 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.049
 So I speak here now 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.729
 Right left leg was my the game 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.380
 I'm a bit backwards here already 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.909
 you see this rotation in it again 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.320
 that both are not up to here but 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.939
 It's all up here 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.880
 and now I try in four steps 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.490
 to cross before going from up here so 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.680
 he speaks Italy piece forward because 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.080
 the hip then the knee 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.420
 last but not least the foot who the 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.950
 you have to do a lot of tension here 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.659
 feel that it is up to the breast 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.590
 it pulls the oblique abdominal muscle here 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.450
 famous ps let that go over the hips 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.769
 The shoulder is because there is no tension 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.530
 then the legs are talking 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.590
 But I want it up here then 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.010
 walk change and the same from here 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.670
 again 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.090
 he is the waist the hip the knee 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.870
 The foot has to spiral up 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.590
 right up there, foot changes and moves 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.239
 again 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.310
 the you already know to make the music 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.880
 waist hip knee foot 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.650
 of course, which is normally 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.959
 so 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.720
 fluid movement but so we can do this 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.470
 all really nice once 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.870
 it is more beautiful 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.430
 takes apart 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.709
 You can also do it all backwards 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.329
 then make the spiral of 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.549
 below so I'm looking forward to up here 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.590
 otherwise my hip is gone immediately but 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.870
 I drive here with my foot 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.980
 then I take that knee then namely the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.739
 hip last but not least Italy and then 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.510
 I'll put my foot on my knee again 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.220
 hip d'italia 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.690
 So it's exhausting, too 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.819
 because I'm permanently here the center 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.310
 must hold and the movement up here 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.889
 Do this up as soon as you make that effort 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.400
 or this voltage dissolves falls 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.629
 hip here again in the horizontal 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.620
 horizontal but I'll go forward 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.510
 under the shoulders 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.909
 That's what the body wants to do 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.129
 in tambow it up here 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.650
 if you this tango in fact always 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.760
 used up here then you have 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.090
 long legs 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.560
 with the help much longer 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.870
 if you only 162 big i hope that 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.480
 video has new insights and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.940
 inspiring practice is practice practicing 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.220
 so that it also from the head in the body 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.889
 you can find more videos in 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.889
