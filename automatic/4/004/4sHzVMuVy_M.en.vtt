00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.410
 hello together dear spectators today 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.460
 it starts with a small stretch 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.680
 on the subject of sensor cleaning earlier 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.740
 yes, at the latest after 24 or 36 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.809
 make a thing made namely the 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.660
 film changed reinput a bit 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.940
 And with the new movie was also something 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.970
 There was a new film in the camera 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.890
 Unfortunately today it does not go away anymore 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.660
 our camera use them and what 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.180
 stays in the whole year over 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.620
 camera the sensor and what happens when 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.370
 my camera is used and the sensor becomes 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 not changed 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.850
 Of course, there are always great ones 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.119
 photos out but repressed with time 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.650
 the sensor sensor dirt is ours 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.780
 problem what it is today to edit 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.940
 and I just want my little one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.340
 lance break that to do it yourself and also 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.399
 just give the right instructions 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.380
 how to do what right or what 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.040
 where can sensor dirt at all 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 arise 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.479
 point number one know few is but 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.160
 also no end of the world with new ones 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.360
 Cameras can still do it internally 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.869
 decrease take place for example on 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.210
 shutter 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.979
 and that can make that whole 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.409
 slightly fine dust on the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.610
 Sensor comes the real evil stuff 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.010
 but actually come at 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.500
 lens change if you have your 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.850
 Camera uses and then the lens 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.640
 then what happens can happen 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.220
 big dust grains have any fluff in it 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.630
 the camera come in and get on the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.700
 store the sensor 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.350
 yes, there is usually in the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.090
 today's cameras always called a so-called 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.430
 clinic or sensor clinic function 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.780
 Most of the time , the sensor becomes whole 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.119
 Shaken fast in the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.330
 ultrasonic range or any 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.010
 Shaker then put the dirt away 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.080
 but you can shake yourselves 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.150
 he can not imagine a sensor 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.970
 somehow make harik sheikh 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.830
 but it's just that the big ones 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.690
 things still remain on it and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.799
 that is what it is today about ourselves 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.989
 to make off by hand 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.269
 many of you will be out there 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.220
 certainly with a lot of dirt 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.280
 on your sensor in your camera around 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.760
 take pictures and tell me for that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.310
 not at all 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.769
 that 's right because sensor dirt or 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.870
 any particles before the sensor 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.170
 you do not always see that depends on two 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.850
 criteria from whether you see the dirt on 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.370
 the photos the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.010
 Point number one would be the motive 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.980
 So imagine you have a flood 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.950
 in front of the sensor and take a picture 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.170
 long hair carpet lint run in 2000 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.030
 are in the motive he will hardly this 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.820
 a little plane is on 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.350
 recognize the picture or a tree 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.480
 or shred something very much 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.970
 chaotic what texture very 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.090
 is messed up and schwuppdiwupp that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.210
 swallow your dust particles in the image in 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.220
 Motive itself would be the second point of the 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.060
 the chosen aperture you can do that 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.010
 imagine like a little bit 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.690
 studio photography you have any 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.370
 object and takes an extremely large 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.990
 light wave then generates this 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.700
 almost no shadow 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.620
 Do you have a little light wave and 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.480
 tumble light with the whole paten 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.960
 something then produces the very strong 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.490
 shadow 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.080
 it is the same with the 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.610
 Dirt or with any particles 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.890
 for example, a little hair in front of the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.540
 sensor you have a big blind one 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.400
 open aperture is selected then the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.960
 light wave so great that this one 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.730
 Particles are not really in the picture 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.200
 Visible he can still be seen 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.760
 its depends on the size but it is 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.470
 diminished visibly compared to 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.610
 a closed blind the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.740
 works like a small one 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.480
 flashlight on the particle on it 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.250
 lights up and the whole thing much stronger 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.400
 So lets it be noticed 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.840
 two things to motive, it must 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.220
 as plan as possible as uniformly as possible 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.960
 do not distract anything 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.330
 and then, of course, to the chosen one 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.120
 Aperture should be as small as possible 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.040
 let's do it all and do and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.300
 on the basis of this camera would like to now in the 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 following videos also cleaning 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.200
 really show good 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.780
 point number one i need a photo 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.460
 on which I even see where is 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.930
 sensor carries that is the step number 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.430
 One you have to do at all 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.770
 time to look how dirty is because the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.760
 sensor that makes her next I do 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.930
 not here one to one with you 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.120
 but I'll just give you one 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.920
 few small instructions that works a lot 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.370
 faster and more efficiently their 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.990
 Video 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.420
 you take an objective with as possible 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.940
 small aperture 22 32 or maybe 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.320
 even more closed then you choose 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.210
 put a piece of white paper on what 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.770
 possible uniformly and evenly 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.030
 so it should not be lighted 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.520
 dark course or something 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.190
 and then you just report a photo 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.500
 on normal bright gray on this 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.960
 wise paper of course with closed 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.460
 Avoid if possible with iso 5500 or 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.539
 20 million because then 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.090
 you have sometime no plan what 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.500
 rushing or what is dirt but you 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.729
 I also like to illuminate it from five 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.270
 minutes does not matter 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.470
 and then you have a photo on yours 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.160
 calculator is and you can 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.289
 watch now 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.009
 but there is a little stumbling block 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.599
 built-in because we know from ours 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.860
 basics photography training and 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.449
 everything your books and foto 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.030
 otherwise have read something and 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.580
 have learned that a motive about that 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.380
 objectively mirrored and right 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.500
 left and above 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.330
 So the camera sees what you are with 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.530
 your human eye looks up both 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.190
 the head as well as the right left 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.430
 reversed 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.229
 if I have a photo now then became 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.240
 Of course, that corrects me 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.680
 computer or the processes in the camera 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.780
 has automatically come back 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.940
 changed if so now one 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.979
 stain on the bottom left then see that is 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.570
 not left down to your camera but 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.580
 in fact, he is on the top right 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.090
 namely above and below right 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.979
 inverted now comes again thicker 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.150
 and that if you clean the camera 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.580
 then you do not hold the camera like that 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.979
 but you turn it around once 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.320
 even turn it and with this and 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.940
 lie down on your table before you would have 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.590
 you've done something you've done 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.539
 ever a reflection namely right 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.500
 left or right left, right left 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.380
 or left right 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.969
 you would have done something about both 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.550
 would be left over what would be 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.479
 miss right that reflect above 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.070
 and we did that here 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.560
 take a photo here with the camera 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.280
 recorded and that's the photo what 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.280
 came out 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.099
 You can see different types of dirt here 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.800
 You can see worms and little beetles here 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:31.169
 and wish are easier to remove 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.210
 as beetle beetles are not so nice 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.509
 yes, these are fluffy and that is 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.590
 real dirt particles 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.050
 most of the time, the big treks are particles 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.849
 not so nice fluff are mostly like that 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.680
 off to the very bottom , we'll come to that 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:46.020
 good now is that the picture from the 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.969
 Camera and what else I have to do around 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.880
 to prepare that perfectly for 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:52.889
 my cleaning is i need it 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.570
 So fold mirror up, down, then 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.849
 We also did that 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.500
 that the dirt point from down here is the 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.860
 found yourself here on the next 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.849
 picture up here in the corner on the left is yes 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.919
 and if you are now 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.809
 camera takes and the picture next to the 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:09.399
 Camera sets then the point of you 

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:11.050
 now on the picture up here 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:13.389
 I hold it so that the camera 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.520
 That's what this point up here looks like 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.129
 two dirt particles located 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.899
 now here on the same 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.939
 transferred position on the sensor her 

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:24.399
 So it was done you see how 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.110
 dirty is your sensor and b where 

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:29.529
 is in the housing at all 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.240
 this dirt point and how you have to 

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:32.709
 you all tackle it with it 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.459
 the right place cleans and not 

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:35.319
 somewhere wrong 

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:37.179
 We would have laid the foundation stone 

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:38.800
 for all the following videos where it 

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:40.629
 really it is the finished camera 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.800
 open up and rummage around in it 

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:43.659
 but we do not need to be afraid 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.439
 Every step will be really accurate 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:46.179
 to explain 

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:47.649
 but what is important is what we have in this 

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:50.110
 video have already said that 

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:52.899
 Know about the pollution itself 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.759
 Know where you have to do something with it 

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:56.860
 you get exactly this basic picture around 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.149
 properly and efficiently to clean and 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.129
 maybe he will take the picture first 

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:01.419
 I would advise you if the photo is not 

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:02.889
 really looks like that i said oh 

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:04.569
 god oh god, there I only see 

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:06.369
 soiling then release too 

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:08.469
 partly prefer the fingers off a two 

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:09.819
 you have three little things in the picture 

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:11.409
 actually on every camera even though 

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:13.979
 she directly fresh from a profi 

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:13.979
 cleaning comes
