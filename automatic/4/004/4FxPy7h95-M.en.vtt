the<00:00:17.850> first<00:00:18.060> iteration<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> technology

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the first iteration of the technology

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.020 
the first iteration of the technology
was<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.290> emergency<00:00:20.100> services<00:00:20.550> comment<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
was a emergency services comment and

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.700 
was a emergency services comment and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
cyclists and we all went skiing and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
cyclists and we all went skiing and
snowboarding<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.250> saw<00:00:38.430> these<00:00:38.640> devices<00:00:39.510> on

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
snowboarding we saw these devices on

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
snowboarding we saw these devices on
everyone's<00:00:39.989> helmets<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.530> thought<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:41.190> has

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
everyone's helmets we thought there has

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.280 
everyone's helmets we thought there has
to<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.580> a<00:00:41.610> better<00:00:41.760> solution<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.629> firstly

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to be a better solution to this firstly

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.160 
to be a better solution to this firstly
of<00:00:43.440> course<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.949> has<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> full<00:00:44.850> HD<00:00:45.090> camera<00:00:46.019> which

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

you are and how good you are as an
athlete<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.699> put<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.970> into<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.300> app<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.659> has

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
athlete and put it into an app it has

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.649 
athlete and put it into an app it has
great<00:00:55.589> 3d<00:00:56.010> audio<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.580> you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.940> actually<00:00:57.089> hear

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
great 3d audio so you can actually hear

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:58.700 
great 3d audio so you can actually hear
where<00:00:57.870> people<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.320> when<00:00:58.589> you're

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
where people are when you're

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.350 
where people are when you're

need them the biggest problem with this
kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.190> technology<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.780> were<00:01:09.870> paying<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
kind of technology is you were paying a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
kind of technology is you were paying a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
expensive the shell and the foam you can

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.349 
expensive the shell and the foam you can
put<00:01:37.079> together<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.439> under<00:01:37.590> $100<00:01:38.149> and<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:39.180> can
