00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
to do it because i already have it

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.719 
to do it because i already have it
installed<00:00:44.059> but<00:00:45.050> when<00:00:45.229> you<00:00:45.320> install<00:00:45.769> it<00:00:45.800> you

installed but when you install it you
have<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.000> make<00:00:47.149> sure<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:48.350> it's<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:48.649> your<00:00:48.859> c

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.899 
have to make sure that it's in your c
drive<00:00:49.899> because<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.229> can't<00:00:51.710> install<00:00:52.039> to<00:00:52.549> a<00:00:52.579> path

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
drive because it can't install to a path

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.779 
drive because it can't install to a path
that<00:00:53.269> has<00:00:53.420> spaces<00:00:53.809> in<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.100> it's<00:00:55.640> just

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
that has spaces in it so it's just

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.670 
that has spaces in it so it's just
easier<00:00:56.149> to<00:00:56.210> install<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:56.659> in<00:00:56.869> your<00:00:56.899> c<00:00:57.229> drive<00:00:58.420> so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
easier to install it in your c drive so

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.639

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
using just to resize it now the sizes

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.059 
using just to resize it now the sizes
they<00:01:25.039> have<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.369> be<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.759> multiple<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.299> 16<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.979> you

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
they have to be a multiple of 16 so you

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:35.980 
they have to be a multiple of 16 so you
can<00:01:28.390> have<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.539> 30<00:01:29.959> to<00:01:30.259> 48<00:01:30.920> 64<00:01:31.789> 8<00:01:32.170> e96<00:01:33.729> 128<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:34.990> so

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
can have it 30 to 48 64 8 e96 128 and so

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
try to to try it out I went to see mean

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.080 
try to to try it out I went to see mean
I<00:04:28.040> played<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.610> server<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:31.160> tried<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:31.940> do<00:04:32.060> a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
I played a server and I tried to do a

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.780 
I played a server and I tried to do a
spray<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.960> wouldn't<00:04:33.320> work<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:33.770> I<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.400> came

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
spray and it wouldn't work so I I came

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.350 
spray and it wouldn't work so I I came
back<00:04:35.090> into<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.260> I<00:04:37.010> think<00:04:37.640> this<00:04:37.910> that

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
back into this and I think this that

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.970 
back into this and I think this that
file<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.600> just<00:04:38.720> delete<00:04:39.140> it<00:04:39.170> was<00:04:39.350> back<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:39.890> i

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
file I just delete it was back so i

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.240 
file I just delete it was back so i
deleted<00:04:40.160> again<00:04:40.790> and<00:04:41.380> then<00:04:42.380> i<00:04:42.410> went<00:04:42.860> back<00:04:43.040> into

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
deleted again and then i went back into

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.040 
deleted again and then i went back into
a<00:04:43.370> server<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:43.910> played<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.390> then<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.780> spray

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
a server and played and then the spray

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.220 
a server and played and then the spray
worked<00:04:45.380> perfect<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:47.150> if<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.750> doesn't<00:04:48.020> work<00:04:48.110> on

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
worked perfect so if it doesn't work on

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.020 
worked perfect so if it doesn't work on
your<00:04:48.380> first<00:04:48.620> try<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:49.100> might<00:04:49.280> have<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.610> get<00:04:49.880> out

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
your first try you might have to get out

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.060 
your first try you might have to get out
of<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.450> then<00:04:51.050> come<00:04:51.260> back<00:04:51.290> to<00:04:51.530> this<00:04:51.830> folder

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
of it and then come back to this folder

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.380

in<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.320> counter<00:05:00.680> strike<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:02.060> should<00:05:02.390> work

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
in to counter strike and it should work

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.100
