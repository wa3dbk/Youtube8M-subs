00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.019
 good today we are going to prepare a recipe 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.480
 of spaghetti with vegetables that you like 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.990
 make my mother is a healthy recipe 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.610
 low fat ideal for day to day 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.049
 It also has soy sauce so it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.049
 we give to see the pasta very rich 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.880
 besides these vegetables you can put 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.430
 others of your preference or change 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.260
 one by another use different types of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.960
 peppers and even bear fruit 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.509
 dried 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.070
 we will start cleaning the vegetables and 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.070
 cutting them into equal pieces 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.500
 the vegetables cooked in a skillet 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.570
 medium fire with oil starting with the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.770
 eggplant and at 23 minutes I'm going 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.770
 adding the rest of the ingredients 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.110
 salted and cooked over medium low heat 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.360
 until it is well poached and stirring 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.310
 every once in a while when it's almost to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.220
 point we add an abundant stream of 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.129
 soy sauce and apart we make the pasta 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.900
 as the manufacturer says once the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.580
 I also like to pass by a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.870
 pan with a little butter or 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.820
 margarine since that gives it a lot of flavor 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.220
 and we can already serve our pasta 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.950
 we put some spaghetti in the base 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.140
 above the amount of vegetables that 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.700
 we want and to finish off I like 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.700
 put a little more sauce that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.380
 if you do not have any type of allergy 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.340
 lactose intolerance you can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.340
 add some cheese 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.350
 and it would be ready as you see it is a 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.150
 Very simple and quick recipe to make 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.580
 what can we do for day to day and 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.850
 that comes out of its typical spaghetti to the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.380
 Bolognese or with tomato sauce but that 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.330
 try it because they are very rich and we 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.549
 we see in the next video do not forget 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.920
 I like to subscribe and 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.270
 share it on social networks 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.580
