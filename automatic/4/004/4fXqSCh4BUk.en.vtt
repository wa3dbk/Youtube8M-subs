there's<00:00:47.269> something<00:00:47.690> about<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:48.019> steam<00:00:48.379> engine

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.080 

they<00:02:11.799> almost<00:02:11.980> sound<00:02:14.489> when<00:02:15.489> looking<00:02:15.819> at<00:02:15.939> the

so<00:02:23.829> let's<00:02:24.099> look<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.610> at<00:02:25.030> what's<00:02:25.329> involved<00:02:25.620> in

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
so let's look now at what's involved in

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.270 
so let's look now at what's involved in
both<00:02:27.310> electric<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.150> steam<00:02:29.140> driven<00:02:29.769> localizer

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
both electric and steam driven localizer

under control stop it where you want I

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.900 
under control stop it where you want I
could<00:02:37.560> go<00:02:37.890> with<00:02:38.130> you

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
could go with you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.860 
could go with you
you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.420 

many<00:02:43.870> will<00:02:44.170> be<00:02:44.349> familiar<00:02:44.560> with<00:02:45.219> this

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
many will be familiar with this

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:56.220 
many will be familiar with this

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.890 
not taken away the speed early now has
caused<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.190> crowd<00:03:03.000> trying<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.239> same<00:03:04.510> move

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
caused this crowd trying the same move

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.100 
caused this crowd trying the same move
from<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.470> shorter<00:03:06.160> distance<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:07.239> still<00:03:07.569> very

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
difficult now let's see what we can do

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.290 
difficult now let's see what we can do
with<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.450> electric<00:03:13.720> system<00:03:14.489> two<00:03:15.489> engines<00:03:15.940> on

the whistle which indicates the engine

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.750 
the whistle which indicates the engine
is<00:03:41.380> going<00:03:41.650> into<00:03:41.920> reverse<00:03:42.280> gear<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:45.430> have<00:03:45.610> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
is going into reverse gear you have to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.789 
is going into reverse gear you have to
know<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.120> engines<00:03:46.540> characteristics<00:03:47.530> they're

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
know the engines characteristics they're

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.890 
know the engines characteristics they're
all<00:03:47.950> different<00:03:48.310> like<00:03:48.700> full-sized<00:03:49.360> engines

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
all different like full-sized engines

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.930 
all different like full-sized engines
you<00:03:50.560> have<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.920> take<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.310> speed<00:03:51.580> away

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
you have to take the speed away

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.440 
you have to take the speed away
according<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.870> how<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:53.140> engine<00:03:53.799> performs

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
according to how that engine performs

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.880 
according to how that engine performs
bringing<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.569> down<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.140> reasonable<00:03:56.500> speed

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
bringing it down to a reasonable speed

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.920 
bringing it down to a reasonable speed
so<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.610> will<00:03:57.730> pick<00:03:57.970> up<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.269> luggage<00:03:58.510> fan

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
so it will pick up the luggage fan

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.479 
so it will pick up the luggage fan
without<00:03:59.410> any<00:03:59.709> difficulty<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.859> same<00:04:06.190> move

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
without any difficulty now the same move

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.910 
without any difficulty now the same move
again<00:04:06.940> running<00:04:07.480> back<00:04:07.690> picking<00:04:08.079> up<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.500> parcel

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
again running back picking up the parcel

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.300 
again running back picking up the parcel
vein<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.579> then<00:04:09.760> driving<00:04:10.090> off<00:04:10.829> first<00:04:11.829> is<00:04:12.130> the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
vein and then driving off first is the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:21.500 
vein and then driving off first is the
electric<00:04:12.790> engine<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:18.329> away<00:04:19.329> we<00:04:19.630> go

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
electric engine and away we go

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.719 
electric engine and away we go
next<00:04:22.510> comes<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.020> steam<00:04:23.260> engine<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:24.010> lot<00:04:24.640> to

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
next comes the steam engine a lot to

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.340 
next comes the steam engine a lot to
point<00:04:25.000> out<00:04:25.180> this<00:04:25.330> was<00:04:25.510> all<00:04:25.660> done<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:25.930> one<00:04:26.050> tight

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
point out this was all done in one tight

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.350 
point out this was all done in one tight
so<00:04:29.350> now<00:04:29.590> fiddling<00:04:30.190> or<00:04:30.340> cutting<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.090> reef

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360
