00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.750
 Hi, I 'm the country andrade with that for 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.129
 tail where I play from Thursday to Sunday 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.560
 already nine years 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.880
 this here was agreement the frp xe and I 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.199
 I want to talk a little bit because I 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.199
 I started this color yesterday 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.960
 the band sounds in seven musicians is very 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.220
 the accordion complicated the medium 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.780
 of so many instruments 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.250
 I 've always used it because the acoustic 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.010
 had a lot of problem with the sound 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.170
 microphone with the weight is much lighter 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.870
 with the traditional cogerh this model 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.970
 is 18 the gifts were that the throw 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.559
 not have microphone if you put the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.309
 cable out playing all here one 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.019
 transmitter 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.670
 so I woke up from the podium ahead and 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.309
 put in front the pea in closed 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.440
 microphone and no noise is a 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.070
 Beauty also has the issue of timbres 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.050
 huh 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.899
 has several acoustic accordion timbres 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.550
 it is one only if you have the records and such 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.890
 but he is the accordion 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.080
 this model of the route region holds 21 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.509
 types of accordion within it 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.590
 has 21 acoustic occasions within the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.810
 shop accordion 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.729
 Besides that, the orchestral sounds 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.259
 so can your keyboard player then I can 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.210
 play many times that I played in 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.399
 keyboard I can play with accordion can 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.880
 make the team from missing the team from the front 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.069
 huh 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.069
 another nice thing here too 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.590
 it works the same as the acoustic accordion 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.990
 so this is how you have many advantages 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.790
 it maintains the main characteristics 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.430
 one thing an acoustic 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:48.759
 only the announcement you have all these 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:50.110
 advantages the accordionist draw the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.240
 forum does not work, can not do it 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.549
 that gives dreamed to do something else 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.979
 super cool also beyond the timbres that 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.299
 it already has several sounds 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.430
 he has an input for pen drive 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.060
 It is also the route of a partnership with la 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.490
 foot 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.189
 you have this pen drive here you put 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.350
 the USB drive and you have the 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.179
 then expansions beyond the sounds you already have 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.280
 shoulders again and have the expansions 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.640
 adhp in that most famous of 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.640
 accordion 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.980
 if you pick up the acoustic guitar, he'll 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.750
 tune the reed break if you have 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.239
 an expense when I used with the acoustic 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.519
 I used to be five hundred reais 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.650
 to tune sometimes lasted three to be 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.480
 four months of holding up a little 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.400
 a little less and you had to go 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.319
 there for this money to send after all 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.970

 the palettes, it's 100% digital, it 's a 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.170
 simulation does not off you can travel 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.049
 get her to rock in the car on the bus 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.269

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.870
 And then you already have a stamp and then you have the 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.870
 variations of the musÃ©e des

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.400

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.800
 who is starting suddenly or 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.660
 classical accordionist is accustomed to 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.370
