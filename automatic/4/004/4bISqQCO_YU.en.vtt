definitely<00:02:07.479> didn't<00:02:08.479> come<00:02:08.600> out<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.899> good

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
definitely didn't come out to a good

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.199 
definitely didn't come out to a good
start<00:02:09.290> and<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:09.530> kind<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.770> set<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:09.950> tone<00:02:10.040> and<00:02:10.520> it

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
start and I kind of set the tone and it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.840 
start and I kind of set the tone and it
was<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.450> very<00:02:11.510> disappointing<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:16.670> left

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
was just very disappointing we left

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.580 
was just very disappointing we left
three<00:02:17.060> point<00:02:17.270> shooters<00:02:17.600> come<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.810> at<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
three point shooters come in at the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.900 
three point shooters come in at the
beginning<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.980> game<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.520> they'd<00:02:19.610> gotten<00:02:19.820> a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
beginning the game so they'd gotten a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.610 
beginning the game so they'd gotten a
little<00:02:20.090> lead<00:02:20.330> just<00:02:21.230> stuff<00:02:21.440> like<00:02:21.500> that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
little lead just stuff like that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.180 
little lead just stuff like that
defensively<00:02:22.160> really<00:02:22.910> hurt<00:02:23.060> us
