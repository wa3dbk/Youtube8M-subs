00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
is dead it'll come up I actually think I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.210 
is dead it'll come up I actually think I
kept<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> screen<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:16.920> you'll<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.189> how

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
kept on the screen so you'll know how

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.469 
kept on the screen so you'll know how
many<00:01:17.460> people<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.150> you've<00:01:18.270> got<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
many people of these like you've got a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.260 
many people of these like you've got a
kill<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.259> I'm<00:01:19.500> pretty<00:01:19.950> sure<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.430> only<00:01:20.580> 15<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
kill but I'm pretty sure it's only 15 of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
kill but I'm pretty sure it's only 15 of
16<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> huge<00:01:23.340> amount<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.729> not

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
16 it's not like a huge amount it's not

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.130 
16 it's not like a huge amount it's not
really<00:01:24.240> hard<00:01:25.009> there<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.000> kill<00:01:27.330> 15<00:01:27.840> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
really hard there is so it's kill 15 so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.530 
really hard there is so it's kill 15 so
I<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.409> close<00:01:28.680> 15<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.700> once<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.970> kill<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.390> all

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
I was close 15 so once you kill them all

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.710 
I was close 15 so once you kill them all
you<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.200> head<00:01:31.590> over<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
you want to do is head over to the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
you want to do is head over to the
