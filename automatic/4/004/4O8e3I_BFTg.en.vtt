00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
11 hours for it to finish hatching which

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.130 
11 hours for it to finish hatching which
sucks<00:01:04.909> but<00:01:05.909> last<00:01:06.299> time<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:06.750> trying<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
sucks but last time I was trying to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.070 
sucks but last time I was trying to
decide<00:01:07.409> between<00:01:07.670> him<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:11.630> jungle<00:01:12.630> let

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
decide between him and the jungle let

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.890 
decide between him and the jungle let
the<00:01:13.260> jungle<00:01:13.650> that's<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.820> let's<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.780> do

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the jungle that's right so let's just do

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.609 
the jungle that's right so let's just do
that<00:01:15.930> now<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> those<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:18.869> most<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> basic

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that now so those are most of the basic

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.039 
that now so those are most of the basic
light<00:01:20.310> dragon<00:01:20.720> combinations<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.900> have

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
light dragon combinations that you have

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.920 
light dragon combinations that you have
to<00:01:22.140> deal<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> reason<00:01:24.720> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to deal with for now but the reason that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.469 
to deal with for now but the reason that
this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> happening<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
this is happening is because it's the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
this is happening is because it's the
one<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:27.509> where<00:01:28.049> I've<00:01:28.229> come<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:29.100> home<00:01:29.369> from

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
Comets per note of three I said this

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.170 
Comets per note of three I said this
pool<00:05:27.070> but<00:05:27.190> I<00:05:27.250> probably<00:05:27.580> weren't<00:05:27.700> getting<00:05:28.090> up

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
pool but I probably weren't getting up

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.550 
pool but I probably weren't getting up
palm<00:05:28.390> dragon<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.790> there's<00:05:30.960> too<00:05:31.960> many<00:05:32.140> gifts

palm dragon and there's too many gifts
to<00:05:32.680> give<00:05:33.810> so<00:05:34.810> i<00:05:34.840> will<00:05:35.230> probably<00:05:35.410> end<00:05:35.770> up<00:05:35.860> doing

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
to give so i will probably end up doing

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.550 
to give so i will probably end up doing
that<00:05:36.250> later<00:05:36.750> have<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.870> always<00:05:37.960> hit<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.320> next

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
that later have you always hit the next

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.310 
that later have you always hit the next
milestone<00:05:38.740> where<00:05:39.370> 3,000<00:05:40.030> off<00:05:40.180> ah<00:05:40.510> they'll

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
milestone where 3,000 off ah they'll

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:49.050 
milestone where 3,000 off ah they'll
probably<00:05:41.350> put<00:05:41.830> me<00:05:41.980> up<00:05:42.070> there<00:05:42.100> ah<00:05:45.510> but<00:05:47.940> like<00:05:48.940> i

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
probably put me up there ah but like i

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
probably put me up there ah but like i
said<00:05:49.090> last<00:05:49.600> time<00:05:53.280> we<00:05:54.280> were<00:05:54.520> just<00:05:55.080> patching

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
said last time we were just patching

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.380 
said last time we were just patching
these<00:05:56.230> fire<00:05:56.470> dragons<00:05:57.040> but<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:57.940> best<00:05:58.090> way<00:05:58.330> to

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
these fire dragons but the best way to

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.120 
these fire dragons but the best way to
get<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:59.020> level<00:05:59.320> up<00:05:59.410> dragon<00:05:59.740> just<00:05:59.920> keep

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
get the level up dragon just keep

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.740 
get the level up dragon just keep
hatching<00:06:00.460> fire<00:06:00.640> dragons<00:06:01.090> and<00:06:01.240> then<00:06:01.330> leveling

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
hatching fire dragons and then leveling

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.950 
hatching fire dragons and then leveling
them<00:06:01.870> up<00:06:02.050> but<00:06:03.010> since<00:06:03.400> it<00:06:03.550> reset<00:06:04.270> we<00:06:04.750> need<00:06:04.870> to

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
them up but since it reset we need to

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.300 
them up but since it reset we need to
open<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.260> time<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:05.650> reset<00:06:05.950> we<00:06:06.040> can't<00:06:06.190> really

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
open the time to reset we can't really

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.860 
open the time to reset we can't really
do<00:06:06.610> that<00:06:06.640> at<00:06:06.820> the<00:06:06.910> moment<00:06:08.010> but<00:06:09.420> that<00:06:10.420> is<00:06:10.660> mostly

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
do that at the moment but that is mostly

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.440 
do that at the moment but that is mostly
for<00:06:11.260> this<00:06:11.380> episode<00:06:11.650> I<00:06:12.100> know<00:06:12.790> this<00:06:13.060> one's<00:06:13.270> been

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
for this episode I know this one's been

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.090 
for this episode I know this one's been
short<00:06:13.720> as<00:06:13.810> well<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.200> lot<00:06:14.350> of<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.590> episodes

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
short as well a lot of the episodes

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.370 
short as well a lot of the episodes
recently<00:06:15.580> had<00:06:15.670> been<00:06:15.820> shorter<00:06:16.210> because<00:06:16.390> I've

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
recently had been shorter because I've

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.450 
recently had been shorter because I've
been<00:06:17.440> bringing<00:06:17.770> them<00:06:17.980> out<00:06:18.070> a<00:06:18.130> lot<00:06:18.310> more

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
been bringing them out a lot more

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.910 
been bringing them out a lot more
frequently<00:06:19.030> than<00:06:19.120> I<00:06:19.330> was<00:06:19.540> before<00:06:19.740> for<00:06:20.740> obvious

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
frequently than I was before for obvious

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.360 
frequently than I was before for obvious
reasons<00:06:21.790> of<00:06:22.510> course<00:06:22.870> but<00:06:25.200> until<00:06:26.200> next<00:06:27.070> time

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
reasons of course but until next time

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.110 
reasons of course but until next time
there<00:06:28.330> won't<00:06:28.690> be<00:06:28.900> any<00:06:28.990> camera<00:06:29.320> next<00:06:29.470> time

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
there won't be any camera next time

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.850 
there won't be any camera next time
just<00:06:30.690> so<00:06:30.810> you<00:06:30.900> know<00:06:30.930> but<00:06:32.000> we<00:06:33.000> will<00:06:33.240> be<00:06:33.389> back<00:06:33.600> ah

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.170 

actually<00:06:37.860> I<00:06:38.070> have<00:06:38.220> to<00:06:38.340> be<00:06:38.460> awake<00:06:38.669> in<00:06:38.820> six<00:06:39.030> hours

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
actually I have to be awake in six hours

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.060 
actually I have to be awake in six hours
so<00:06:39.479> these<00:06:39.660> dragons<00:06:40.380> will<00:06:40.530> not<00:06:40.650> be<00:06:40.770> ready<00:06:40.949> for

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
so these dragons will not be ready for

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.700 
so these dragons will not be ready for
