00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
now how do you think these tasty gummy

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.220 
now how do you think these tasty gummy
bears<00:00:11.160> get<00:00:11.460> their<00:00:11.639> form<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.300> why<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.660> they<00:00:12.929> so

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
bears get their form and why are they so

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.660 
bears get their form and why are they so
delicious<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:15.330> answer<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.289> gelatin<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.310> fact

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
delicious the answer is gelatin in fact

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.550 
delicious the answer is gelatin in fact
without<00:00:18.060> gelatin<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.660> none<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.869> these<00:00:19.199> would

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
without gelatin is none of these would

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.300 
without gelatin is none of these would
be<00:00:19.680> possible

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
be possible

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.390 
be possible
however<00:00:21.270> gelatin<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> not<00:00:22.619> an<00:00:22.890> artificial

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
however gelatin is not an artificial

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.509 
however gelatin is not an artificial
additive<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.210> natural<00:00:24.570> foodstuff

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
collagen that binds these products

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740 
collagen that binds these products
together<00:00:32.040> gives<00:00:32.669> them<00:00:32.969> their<00:00:33.180> form<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
together gives them their form and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.440 
together gives them their form and
allows<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> melt<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.309> deliciously<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
allows them to melt so deliciously in

marshmallows or licorice candies gelatin

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.240 
marshmallows or licorice candies gelatin
is<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.540> only<00:01:12.750> gelling<00:01:13.320> agent<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:14.070> only

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
is the only gelling agent that not only

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
is the only gelling agent that not only
remains<00:01:14.640> nicely<00:01:15.180> elastic<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.020> cooling<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
remains nicely elastic on cooling it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.940 
remains nicely elastic on cooling it
becomes<00:01:17.280> liquid<00:01:17.909> again<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.710> rewarming

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.530 

therefore<00:01:22.950> gummy<00:01:23.700> bears<00:01:23.880> melt<00:01:24.330> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
therefore gummy bears melt so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020 
therefore gummy bears melt so
deliciously<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> mouth<00:01:25.770> since<00:01:26.520> gelatin

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
deliciously in the mouth since gelatin

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
deliciously in the mouth since gelatin
melts<00:01:27.210> already<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:28.080> body<00:01:28.380> temperature<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
melts already at body temperature and in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.390 
melts already at body temperature and in
doing<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.420> sets<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.110> various<00:01:31.829> aromas

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
doing so it sets all the various aromas

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.850 
doing so it sets all the various aromas
free<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> each<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.869> every<00:01:37.110> gummy<00:01:37.290> bear<00:01:37.560> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
free so each and every gummy bear is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
free so each and every gummy bear is
pure<00:01:38.369> enjoyment<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> that's<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:40.290> gives<00:01:40.530> us

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
pure enjoyment and that's what gives us

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.560 
pure enjoyment and that's what gives us
so<00:01:40.860> much<00:01:40.979> pleasure

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.389 

however<00:01:45.570> fruit<00:01:45.899> gums<00:01:46.170> are<00:01:46.439> only<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
however fruit gums are only one of the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.060 
however fruit gums are only one of the
numerous<00:01:47.729> applications<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.720> gelatin

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
numerous applications for gelatin

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.800 
numerous applications for gelatin
what<00:01:51.070> though<00:01:51.399> holds<00:01:52.000> all<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.420> these<00:01:52.570> together

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
what though holds all of these together

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.969 
what though holds all of these together
it's<00:01:53.649> gelatin<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.520> provides<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.329> form<00:01:55.979> this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
it's gelatin that provides the form this

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.130 
it's gelatin that provides the form this
is<00:01:57.220> why<00:01:57.399> gelatin<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:58.210> popular<00:01:58.840> throughout

these<00:02:20.800> are<00:02:21.069> what<00:02:21.190> make<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.550> products<00:02:22.030> so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
these are what make the products so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.140 
these are what make the products so
