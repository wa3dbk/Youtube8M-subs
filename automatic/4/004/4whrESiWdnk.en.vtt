00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 he 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.360
 one everyone goes to jazz 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.310
 center today for a new out of 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.099
 map late earlier for three new 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 fab spotlights on stand off then 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.730
 for that you must first get out of there 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.040
 because of course so there you see I 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.660
 go out with the method of the halls breach 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.589
 as strategic 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.760
 so here I am going to make you a little 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.559
 slow motion for you to see well 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.699
 how my package is positioned because 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.739
 that I always position the 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.140
 causes in this way see a package that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 is inclined like this and suddenly when the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.019
 next parcel falls it will not fall 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.629
 directly to you but still 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.159
 tell this word about you that will roll so 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.409
 you're crushing it's not going to kill you 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.689
 then you will see the package going 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.070
 arrive and I will pass in notes of 

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:00.720
 mac so I'm doing it all the time like 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.700
 that to get out of 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.410
 map two blackhawks 2 simply 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.460
 because it's going so much faster 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.500
 a lot easier all that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.180
 so here is a little tip for those 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.640
 who can not get out of the cards 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.920
 because obviously it's not it's not 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.690
 a super easy tennis so so that's 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.770
 out of was not found by the nba 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.090
 for two dogs are of course there 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.360
 has already gone on agly every case 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.070
 but finally yes it is one of the first in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 more so here I'm going to show you the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.860
 three spots that I told you about 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 video start so the first one is there 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.080
 I struggled a little at first because 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.520
 I had more too how to close 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.140
 so you have to jump on the small post 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 so it's going to see you jump on the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.150
 wall is on the pole and then we 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 jumps on the sort of grave status 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.220
 of sculpture you call it like you 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.680
 then, here we are we are on it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.660
 does a pretty little junon heart that's it 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.940
 little cool thing is one of the few map 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.040
 in celebration or outside the map 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.780
 you have objects that are paulo bre 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.509
 so chase where there is way to go 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.940
 on it without dying so here I you 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.170
 quickly shows the only hole I have 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.369
 found around a vab so 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.470
 obviously there are many more 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.580
 so this is really the only trap that 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.440
 you have to be careful if you 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.300
 go out and you do not have better your 1 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.679
 it really is really the galley 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.110
 this place is just a little hole there 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.489
 not see at all finally they go a little 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.810
 when we see the limits and all but 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.280
 when you run you do not see him and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.830
 then you fake the nose and it's death 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.380
 so here I show you a second spot 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.330
 in off pape then for that it is enough 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.250
 to stack of colina montpied through on 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.450
 just do not care they just have enough 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.280
 of height to jump on this little 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.410
 edge and that's it it's good we're there 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.459
 frankly he is nice too and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.080
 now we go to the third leach 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.360
 wings with strategic flying parcels 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.400
 see we hacker had from below we take 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.260
 that of the tube or the inverted has changin and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.090
 here we come on top of this little 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.970
 roof so frankly still a little 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.350
 very nice spot so that was the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.090
 last spot I hope you have 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.920
 enjoyed the video is also the small 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.299
 advice at the beginning of the video because you have to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.620
 know that data breach halls 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.540
 strategic it's a very technical 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.160
 very hard the first book I have 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.810
 did but it took me more than five hours 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.980
 to succeed I have not done five hours 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.360
 in a row match will play in front of a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.970
 time I was trying I'm not going 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.230
 give up everything then here is thanks to 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.020
 this technique I'm going out a lot more 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.310
 easily from my 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.230
 and I hope it will be the same for you 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.040
 we'll meet for future videos 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.040
 that of the world
