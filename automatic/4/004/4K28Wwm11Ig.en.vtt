00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.870
 tramp defender just like that 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.629
 translated london defender rollerball which 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.400
 has become 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.869
 most likely a symbol in the world off road 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.019
 Defender's brutal design does not change 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.780
 their children for half a century now 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.990
 all the same solid aluminum lines 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.360
 steel body frame angled hood 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.060
 and the couple give out in this car real 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.689
 menâ€™s car 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.189
 limited edition parking lot with design 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.520
 more modern but in essence it's all 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.270
 also land rover the truth inside has changed 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.770
 much in the cabin is no longer that Spartan 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.730
 minimalism which was inherent in this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.750
 car many decades plans 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.520
 certainly not the top of the cinema bodies in 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.570
 versus gender military asceticism 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.320
 the past model pretty well everything is simple and 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.850
 readable even tape recorder what they 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.339
 court details migrated to discovery 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:50.260
 it's good 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.489
 the fact that it is not the first time the car 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.960
 present closely 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.750
 this is a bad particular nation 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.600
 exercises called insert 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.130
 key lock 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.230
 ignition interesting shifting the steering wheel to the right 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.060
 it was impossible to move left 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.300
 former dividends were problems with 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.720
 cabin heating frost 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.420
 but in the new model of such troubles 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.040
 No, the temperature has become better 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.850
 engine by the way is also new 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.500
 four-cylinder diesel engine up to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.400
 a full four tenths of a liter and a power of 122 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.380
 horsepower borrowed from 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.859
 Ford's 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.019
 and is able to consume almost any 

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.269
 six-speed combination diesel 

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:28.739
 mechanics defender has become much economical 

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:30.879
 fuel consumption is only 13 

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.720
 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.880
 off-road and philanthropist still 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.800
 hard to find rub clearance 32 centimeters 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.310
 makes defender practical 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.720
 ATVs able to conquer any 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.490
 barriers 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.970
 suspension travel allows 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.890
 overcome bumps and bumps without 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.380
 unpleasant vibrations and discomfort 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.979
 driving defender m is unusual at first and 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.250
 gave a little shifted to the left and tight 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.880
 pressed and the gearshift lever switches from 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 noticeable effort but brakes the British 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.060
 Germans 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.930
 I was tormented by two questions why 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.149
 the British have good roads such 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.970
 all-terrain vehicle 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.810
 and why is he such a consequence 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.090
 in the west the People's Republic of China still remains 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.739
 a stranger 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.989
 turtles dynamics does not give you a ride 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.099
 with the wind to the first hundred car 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.139
 accelerates in 16 seconds 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.099
 on a good road also leaves much to be 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.340
 best high speed car 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.149
 filled with anathe 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.599
 insulation during the course was better but still 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.059
 far from modern standards she 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.349
 speeds close to maximum starting 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.659
 China 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.669
 Alexander Kotov and changed but in soul 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.669
 all the same, freedom remained in the afternoon 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.370
 off-road conqueror but here 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.400
 only who will buy it most likely 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.879
 wealthy farmer 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.510
 rather than the usual peasant
