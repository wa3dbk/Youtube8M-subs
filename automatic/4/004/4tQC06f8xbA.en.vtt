00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
happening very fast so i think what we

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.490 
happening very fast so i think what we
sort<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> learned<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.600> maybe<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
sort of learned is that maybe we want to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.760 
sort of learned is that maybe we want to
go<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:32.100> fast<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.670> fast<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:34.560> kind

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
go not very fast but fast or some kind

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
go not very fast but fast or some kind
of<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.890> medium<00:01:35.310> thing<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.820> little<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.210> slower

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
of a medium thing a little bit slower

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.999 
of a medium thing a little bit slower

that you'll notice on this slide that we
have<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:07.860> numbers<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:09.959> two

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
have some numbers here you have one two

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.160 
have some numbers here you have one two
three<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.030> order<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.690> which

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
three this is just the order in which

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.970 
three this is just the order in which
the<00:02:13.760> animation<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.880> going<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.330> happen<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the animation is going to happen so and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.640 
the animation is going to happen so and
I<00:02:17.099> can<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.239> will<00:02:18.450> move<00:02:18.750> these<00:02:18.989> around<00:02:19.050> if<00:02:19.530> I

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
I can if you will move these around if I

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.199 
I can if you will move these around if I
wanted<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> I'm<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.760> leave<00:02:20.940> them<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
wanted to I'm going to leave them the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.820 
wanted to I'm going to leave them the
way<00:02:21.239> they<00:02:21.360> are<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.959> could<00:02:22.230> move<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.530> Moran

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
way they are but I could move the Moran

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.559 
way they are but I could move the Moran
so<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.069> can<00:02:23.220> have<00:02:23.370> something<00:02:23.640> come<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.270> the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
so I can have something come in the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.570 
so I can have something come in the
bottom<00:02:24.930> something<00:02:25.349> than<00:02:25.530> middle<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
bottom something than middle then in the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.220 
bottom something than middle then in the
top<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.150> then<00:02:27.270> go<00:02:27.360> back<00:02:27.540> down<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.080> bottom

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
top and then go back down to the bottom

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.180 
top and then go back down to the bottom
again<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:30.390> may<00:02:30.569> very<00:02:30.810> well<00:02:31.190> utilize

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
