an<00:01:44.780> original<00:01:46.000> youtube<00:01:47.000> video<00:01:47.359> so<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.770> sit<00:01:49.399> there

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
an original youtube video so I sit there

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.050 
an original youtube video so I sit there
and<00:01:49.700> like<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.240> wanna<00:01:50.719> make<00:01:50.990> response<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:52.060> some

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.360 

so<00:02:00.540> under<00:02:00.840> threat<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.770> raise<00:02:02.010> your<00:02:02.040> loose

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
so under threat you raise your loose

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.880 
so under threat you raise your loose
basically<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.990> view<00:02:04.230> all<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.470> things<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
basically you view all the things that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.580 
basically you view all the things that
the<00:02:05.040> red<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.550> so<00:02:05.940> she's<00:02:06.390> something<00:02:06.780> makes<00:02:07.500> you

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the red and so she's something makes you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.130
