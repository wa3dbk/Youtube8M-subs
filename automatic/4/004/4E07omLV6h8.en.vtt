00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello people i introduce you today 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 shader motto with this mod you can 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.189
 as you can see your minecraft 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.639
 just make it cool even if it is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.620
 only that the full text is shady 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.509
 we can see everything moves 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.460
 there is shade there is sunshine 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.010
 you do not even see the sun because 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.109
 that is so bright and so on and so on 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.260
 So it's really a beautiful one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.519
 However, the important thing is that you have a pc 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.099
 who could have a little bit of power 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.860
 but later adjust yes I show 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.649
 Now you, like you, install it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 the mod so we need in the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.680
 description stand three left allowed 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.850
 you have to download a few things 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.969
 then you are a bit on me 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.039
 to be happy, yes, we need it first 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.860
 the minecraft forge is important to you 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.930
 download the installer 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 because that saves a lot of work 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.820
 then you press the windows button and he 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.250
 is 1 percent off tata percent 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.920
 So no before the points minecraft 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.059
 folder so if your minecraft is there 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.260
 So we just have to minecraft now 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.479
 start but we need that we 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.600
 Anyway, it's him anyway 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.939
 recommended to start this 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.430
 ring of play that then makes sure that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.689
 a few things can be installed 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.570
 just the forbes yourself 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.390
 It is also important that you have a few mods 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.310
 delete or just the mod alone 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.189
 used because it can be really pretty 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.659
 Hard crash come with other mods and 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.079
 then it may be that nothing works 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.850
 yes now we need our shaders 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.820
 you find yourself in one of the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.979
 mine on one of the sides pulls 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.360
 easy in the mods in the first place so must 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.850
 you look for that a bit then 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.260
 is not hard to find because easy 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.590
 look under downloads and then just 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.910
 download now yes we start again 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.460
 our minecraft if we have this in here 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.240
 have pulled maxlrain 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.540
 important is that we are here at our 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.120
 profile 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.340
 the latest versions of ford 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.260
 Select installed on then 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.630
 save for fire and then play because 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.360
 We make sure that everything 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.610
 Properly with the progress at 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.560
 otherwise the power is ignored so 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.830
 Now you can create a world in the walls 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.830
 go 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.200
 Now you see nothing but we do 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.560
 Now sk sk and then go to options 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.540
 in the shaker folder and they belong 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.470
 open shade of tax demands that we can 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.000
 make here about so look now 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.980
 not because you did not open that first 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.080
 it's a pity there you can do it that way 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.170
 no you can not care about everyone either 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.760
 Case top shader packs or something I have to 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.440
 For closing my because my ubs 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.450
 for fun and there we just pull on 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.790
 cello waving in 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.910
 so i put it and the skaterpark that 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:06.010
 also works for 1.602 that finds 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.220
 you in the last link yes that are then so 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.920
 green as colored two color 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.600
 Drawn in color marks the left 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.459
 we can do our minecraft again 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.459
 start because everything is now in it 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.709
 come in yet 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.150
 he is a world pure again 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.360
 if it is not loaded 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.210
 Just go back here in the shaders 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.920
 folder or a state of shadows 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.520
 subdirectory in my own river 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.200
 and will then pack your new shader here 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.030
 I would recommend you though 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.420
 then choose your pc performance level 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.470
 the cius from therefore also for 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.380
 bad on the side for 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.770
 worse pcs now to the resin 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.170
 say yes because it could easily select 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.260
 then click on ladies - and we'll see 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.050
