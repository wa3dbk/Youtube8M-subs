00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi people thanks a lot to turn on 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.140
 that was just presented fresh 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.639
 iphone 5 there is a small improvement of the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 iphone 5 and we want it of course 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.440
 Look closely what does it look like 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.179
 what is it for specification and worth it 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.550
 to demarcate it yes or no 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.010
 you can see that in this video a lot of fun 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 let's start with that in general 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.910
 The display is a four inch retina 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.789
 display with 1136 x 640 pixels and the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.679
 gives 326 pixels per inch is the same 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.739
 display that we also at the predecessor 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:41.100
 When looking at the iPhone 5 is the whole thing 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.030
 Part 123 8 mm 58 6 mm is wide and 76 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 mm is 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 it weighs 112 grams as known 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.469
 Measured from the iphone 5 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.180
 newly added is a fingerprint 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 scanner to which i already have a video 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.329
 did how he works what he does 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.649
 so can and so on 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.559
 definitely on 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.270
 it continues with the newly introduced 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.199
 Of course, processor is the apple ace 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.240
 7 So about 7 a 64 bit chip and so 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.159
 the first opened up to come 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.350
 an apple ems seven motion core 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.540
 processor of especially for incredible 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.610
 great artwork needs to work and the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.580
 should recognize at the same time whether one drives 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.280
 stands or sits to a memory comes 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.710
 you already know that 16 32 or 64 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 gigabyte internal and of course not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.820
 expandable and as a platform we find 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.619
 apple ios 7 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.290
 the camera was heavily revised 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.540
 but still exists on five lenses 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.180
 her name is of course apple ice age camera 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.509
 with 8 megapixels on it comes a f 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.850
 2.2 aperture and the levels are and 15 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.430
 micrometer los backside illumination 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.740
 So a bsi sensor is also included 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 for better pictures in the dark and videos 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 can be included in full hd at 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.979
 30 pictures per second 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.500
 newly added is now a dual led 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.259
 which are called as a true tower 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.119
 so two leds one cool and pointing 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.610
 she was different and amber 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.770
 Also new is in burst mode 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.110
 Now I'm open ten photos per second 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.270
 just if we stick from cuba 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.550
 Slow motion videos can be recorded 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.870
 in hd at 102 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.090
 frames per second and 28 megapixels 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.400
 Panoramic photos also a front camera or 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.350
 Kate can you have we with 12 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.450
 megapixel resolves the to 1280 x 960 pixels 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.210
 videos can be recorded in HD 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.590
 and we also have a bsi sensor 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.630
 and on it goes with the well 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.580
 main page first, connectivity 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.320
 lte is now finally in germany 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.510
 arrived but not only at the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.090
 Telecom not only in the city because we 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.850
 are in 1800 1800 1800 frequencies 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.880
 on the way, of course, comes hspa plus 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.180
 for the people who no ltm wlan 802.11 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.890

 tied in 245 gn and bluetooth 4.0 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.400
 continues to use a nano sense 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:05.130
 everything that is bigger does not fit in 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.280
 we get time to praise the I 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.300

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.780
 Revised version of the iphone 5 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.580

 In the USA Australia Canada finally

 For the first time that means more for her 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.760

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.380
 France with us in Germany the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.450

 and there is also the iphone 5 c 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.610
 why you'll see a video right now 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.239
 which virtually replaces the iphone 5 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.489

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.140

 partially trimmed functions the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.920
 people that's it for iphone 5 only when 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.980
 you ask me a really very much 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.900
 Of course it became weak expansion 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.000
 again developed at the camera 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.160
 but it is a little faster 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.080
 very good is a new color to it 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.189
 actually there is the golden one 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.900
 version must of course be addressed 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.610
 but the whole thing is absolutely 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.129
 not so much coal again 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.189
 throw out for a completely new 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:36.990
 product if you ask me yes 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.370
 of course, each one's own opinion 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.229
 let that be it in any case you 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.229
