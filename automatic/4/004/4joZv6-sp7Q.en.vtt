like<00:02:12.150> many<00:02:12.330> games<00:02:12.540> okay<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:13.500> there's<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.220> few

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
like many games okay so there's a few

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.580 
like many games okay so there's a few
things<00:02:14.610> now<00:02:15.270> one<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.510> them<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.870> didn't<00:02:16.470> get<00:02:16.560> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
things now one of them I didn't get a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.620 
things now one of them I didn't get a
chance<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.010> yet<00:02:17.270> maybe<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> future

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
chance to do yet maybe in the future

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.710 
chance to do yet maybe in the future
I'll<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:19.560> time<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.920> try<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.459> do<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.510> if

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
I'll have time to try to do it now if

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.479 
I'll have time to try to do it now if
you<00:02:21.750> ever<00:02:21.959> play<00:02:22.170> Super<00:02:22.440> Mario<00:02:22.620> Sunshine<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
you ever play Super Mario Sunshine the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.070 
you ever play Super Mario Sunshine the
console<00:02:24.150> was<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.390> ride<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> rollercoaster

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
console was to ride like a rollercoaster

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.710 
console was to ride like a rollercoaster
have<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.430> guess<00:02:26.790> mecha<00:02:27.090> bowser<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
have like I guess mecha bowser in the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.240 
have like I guess mecha bowser in the
center<00:02:27.959> but<00:02:28.170> instead<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.590> mecha<00:02:28.800> Basile<00:02:29.160> you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
center but instead of mecha Basile you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.839 
center but instead of mecha Basile you
have<00:02:29.400> glass<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.480> objective<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.140> ride

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
have glass and the objective is to ride

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.550 
have glass and the objective is to ride
the<00:02:33.050> rail<00:02:34.050> carts

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the rail carts

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.589 
the rail carts
shoot<00:02:35.040> mecha<00:02:35.880> bowser<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.300> while<00:02:36.450> you're

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
shoot mecha bowser and while you're

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.390 
shoot mecha bowser and while you're
writing<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.110> then<00:02:37.319> break<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.920> center<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
writing it and then break the center and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.520 
writing it and then break the center and
then<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.640> win<00:02:38.790> or<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.959> could<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.500> with

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
then you win or you could have it with

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.600 
then you win or you could have it with
teams

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
teams

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.280 
teams
I<00:02:41.640> guess<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.330> team<00:02:42.569> has<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.870> break<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> glass

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
I guess one team has to break the glass

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.680 
I guess one team has to break the glass
before<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.830> other<00:02:43.950> one<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:45.180> glass<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.660> be

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
before the other one the glass can be

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
before the other one the glass can be
like<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.140> thick<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.739> can<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:46.920> very<00:02:47.250> thick<00:02:47.549> and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
like this thick it can be very thick and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.340 
like this thick it can be very thick and
it<00:02:47.819> may<00:02:47.940> take<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.209> few<00:02:48.330> tries<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.840> get<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
it may take a few tries to get to the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.500 
it may take a few tries to get to the
center<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.069> once<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.940> get<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.299> center

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
center and once you get to the center

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.229 
center and once you get to the center
you<00:02:51.540> win<00:02:51.840> or<00:02:52.140> something<00:02:52.590> similar<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.940> guess

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
you win or something similar to I guess

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.539 
you win or something similar to I guess
I<00:02:54.870> think<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:55.680> called<00:02:55.860> break<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.160> monument

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
I think it's called break the monument

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.280 
I think it's called break the monument
of<00:02:56.760> course<00:02:57.599> most<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.019> break<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
of course most of the break the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.229 
of course most of the break the
monuments<00:02:58.709> have<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> city<00:02:59.580> in<00:02:59.730> more<00:02:59.910> than<00:03:00.030> glass

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
monuments have a city in more than glass

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.150 
monuments have a city in more than glass
but<00:03:00.480> similar<00:03:00.780> concept<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.799> just<00:03:01.980> use<00:03:02.130> it

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
but similar concept you can just use it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.059 
but similar concept you can just use it
break<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.180> win<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.840> make<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.739> water<00:03:04.890> for

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
break it you win and make the water for

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.539 
break it you win and make the water for
them<00:03:05.390> there's<00:03:06.390> many<00:03:06.599> applications<00:03:07.590> when<00:03:08.459> it

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
them there's many applications when it

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.820 
them there's many applications when it
