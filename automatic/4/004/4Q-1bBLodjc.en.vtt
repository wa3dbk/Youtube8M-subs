00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:09.980
 h 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.280
 this time they urged on the rice 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.070
 lighter than I'm going to try because to 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.810
 start your weight fell 77 megabytes your 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.770
 installation is fast works everything 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.270
 perfectly but they have taken it away 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.770
 by saying application and things continue 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.820
 for example the wallpapers that 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.869
 send without them has been taken away for 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.789
 to make it lighter 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.340
 Montse Ros is called hydric is a bit 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.800
 have a few months good 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.930
 liked to bring you 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.530
 good here analyzing what is based 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.090
 in 7.2 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.700
 We're going here, well, I've put this in 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.880
 configuration of him 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.710
 of this here we go let it arrive 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.120
 different nobody else because he has his 4 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 does not have four tabs as sick 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.480
 xperia then in his eyelashes we can 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.510
 add for example in in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.550
 icons that we want 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.040
 running as if they were the 4 that is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.440
 we usually have here 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.300
 we have the call here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.050
 we have the message here 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.670
 we have here the very fast contacts 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.700
 to see how such contacts move 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.380
 and everything very fast 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.450
 what yes wifi all in 370 then 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.450
 we already have to add this 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.010
 well over there then let's add here 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.890
 we have here for example and here and 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.110
 we play isabel just to eliminate them 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.820
 good contract is not that here we have 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.250
 been by completely a very influenced 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.980
 come on now notifications we find 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.740
 the topless one can always be 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.340
 configure in the settings we go here in 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 the settings 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.060
 7 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.870
 is the name of iris and fernando 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.050
 developer 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.880
 good application performance 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.100
 for me are the applications a type 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.000
 xperia is called this button for those who 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.000
 they are installed 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.740
 I love it because it always gives it to another 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.720
 that has no function to the anchor 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.200
 any failure I have and always never 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.200
 love 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.760
 so that it does not arrive fast enough 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.680
 It is very good because we take advantage of the 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.680
 keyboard and this 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.710
 for example 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.659
 but we know that we are three 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.380
 on the basic keyboard 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.380
 I will have my good 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:10.970
 is very well has a failure none 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:13.330
 let's analyze some others in the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.330
 camera 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.049
 the solution has to work 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.049
 perfectly 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.689
 it also entered perfectly 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.470
 this little box so that the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.709
 performance that has already this is not 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.290
 It is very very fluid I love Felix 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.250
 that he has and that he is very light for some 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.030
 moment for those who like things 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.680
 It is very very good 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.680
 to play perfect too 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:12.560
 at this time 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.670
 the battery very well normal until the day 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.569
 one 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.109
 soft 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:23.490
 I loaded it and in the race 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.750
 by day because I am all morning at 9 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.750
 until 3 o'clock 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.900
 we'll see 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.690
 here for two thousand 472 good 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.060
 comment if a greeting is written
