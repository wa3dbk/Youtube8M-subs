 national time of collected 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.430

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.430
 no where do you wake up from the game 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.519

 cr7 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.100
 the senior referee does not mark it 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:34.990
 simply the one from portugal 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.380
 that play and that corner lash is 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.380
 a mistake 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.350
 brasil now there are some things that we 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.350

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.380
 we found things that could 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.810
 it's worth buying a proxy how 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.630

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.300

 they have all the parties however 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:35.590
 we realized that independently 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.630
 whatever is in air signal 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.909
 It has many very good applications in 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.960
 the xbox one like this business the 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.909

 but to see all the matches there are 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.500
 Free apps like the vision 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.770
 what does the xbox one have 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.909
 for example this 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.909

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.450
 univision sports this application the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.040

 there is no 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.659
 It does not have very good quality 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.180
 I'm going to close this application by not 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.830
 walk 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.500

 and applying univision stays 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.630

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.960
 But I want Mexico here in peace we 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.960
 We're seeing 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.160
 the image of the mission of prohibition 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.080
 it's really not very good it takes a lot with 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.670
 which will be about a minute or so 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.910
 in which the television in which the image 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.910
 this 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.709
 with good definition 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.590

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.840
 mike place as increases the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.150
 time I can increasing the best of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.440
 time commenting on order quality 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.180
 of the speed that each one has his 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.410
 I already have a contract here for 3 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.060
 megas of the month 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:31.140
 but this application and spy 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.700
 about the same time 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.150
 here with the new one of life that has 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.150
 several options 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.260
 are this 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.769
 well I do not know are videos with demand without 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.950
 But in this part you have white light 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.290
 TV 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.600
 so we can see live what is 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.580
 right now but the viceroy of this one 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.320
 of this live broadcast of them 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.530
 well-informed welfare is similar to what 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.340
 that we see in the satellite bitrate of 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.710
 skype or from assisi and we have here several 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.910
 live options with different audios 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.410
 between say Korean Portuguese 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.890
 a tactical camera is electrical 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.660
 let's see that there is a little bit in 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.590
 load 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.590
 what is this 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.590
 here the council is independent of 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.820
 the applications that you already bring 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.320
 internally the 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.630
 but the actions that they have 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.490
 internally the application section 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.620
 of spy 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.350
 is that we have all the games here 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.390
 in the xbox 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.530
 here there are no narrators is the first time 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.530
 that I put this camera 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.290
 himself was improving 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.580

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:14.639

 Sports in Spanish then we have here 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:22.530
 I do not know why but this is supported 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.690
 by street and of houses in the USA but what 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.790
 We currently have available in Mexico 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.400
 before the television prevents 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.590
 screams and they take it from us and it can be a 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.529
 very good pretext for those who are 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.969
 undecided of buying an xbox juan 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.969
 that is a good excuse 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.550
 Now following the hobby ball
