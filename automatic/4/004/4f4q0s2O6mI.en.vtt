but<00:02:19.379> it's<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.099> know<00:02:20.219> one<00:02:20.700> side<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.359> then

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
but it's just you know one side and then

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.030 
but it's just you know one side and then
do<00:02:21.659> it<00:02:21.780> from<00:02:21.930> multiple<00:02:22.319> layers<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.620> give<00:02:22.859> it<00:02:22.950> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
do it from multiple layers to give it a

3d<00:02:23.579> look<00:02:23.609> you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.599> what<00:02:24.689> I<00:02:24.750> mean<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.379> can

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
3d look you know what I mean so you can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.110 
3d look you know what I mean so you can
see<00:02:25.769> if<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.069> look<00:02:26.099> at<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.430> top<00:02:26.640> view<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:26.909> can

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
see if you look at the top view you can

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.259 
see if you look at the top view you can
see<00:02:27.329> it's<00:02:27.739> like<00:02:28.739> an<00:02:28.920> X<00:02:29.159> there's<00:02:29.430> four<00:02:29.790> actual

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
see it's like an X there's four actual

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.119 
see it's like an X there's four actual
pieces<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.780> that's<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.079> duplicated<00:02:31.799> around

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
pieces and that's just duplicated around

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.339 
pieces and that's just duplicated around
to<00:02:32.670> give<00:02:32.879> you<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.180> textured<00:02:33.719> look<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.230> make

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
to give you that textured look to make

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.369 
to give you that textured look to make
it<00:02:34.379> look<00:02:34.709> like<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.489> 3d<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.780> difference

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
it look like it's 3d the difference

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.740 
it look like it's 3d the difference
between<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:41.239> monumentous<00:02:42.239> now

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
between that and this is monumentous now

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.780 
between that and this is monumentous now
this<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.439> I<00:02:43.560> said<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.099> huge<00:02:44.519> but

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790

it's<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:16.919> it's<00:03:17.609> not<00:03:17.699> even<00:03:17.909> the<00:03:18.060> details<00:03:18.419> I'm

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
it's not it's not even the details I'm

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.670 
it's not it's not even the details I'm
not<00:03:18.659> talking<00:03:18.930> about<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.199> fact<00:03:19.409> that<00:03:19.470> it's

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
not talking about the fact that it's

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.129 
not talking about the fact that it's
like<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:20.159> know<00:03:20.280> photo<00:03:20.579> realism<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:21.419> the

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
like you know photo realism it's the

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.219 
like you know photo realism it's the
fact<00:03:22.409> that<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.799> actually<00:03:23.280> more<00:03:23.940> 3d<00:03:24.720> like

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
fact that it's actually more 3d like

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.680 
fact that it's actually more 3d like
multiple<00:03:25.769> levels<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:26.280> looks<00:03:26.699> actually<00:03:27.000> 3d

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
multiple levels and looks actually 3d

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.199 
multiple levels and looks actually 3d
now<00:03:28.109> if<00:03:28.229> you<00:03:28.319> look<00:03:28.500> closely<00:03:28.799> at<00:03:29.189> it<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:30.090> know

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
now if you look closely at it you know

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.000 
now if you look closely at it you know
if<00:03:30.659> you<00:03:30.810> look<00:03:30.959> at<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.199> leaves<00:03:31.439> they're<00:03:31.680> still

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
if you look at the leaves they're still

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.159 
if you look at the leaves they're still
thin<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:32.879> because<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.419> multiple<00:03:33.959> layers

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
thin but because of the multiple layers

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.559 
thin but because of the multiple layers
and<00:03:34.650> how<00:03:35.099> closely<00:03:35.699> they're<00:03:35.970> sort<00:03:36.329> of<00:03:36.419> put

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
and how closely they're sort of put

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.449 
and how closely they're sort of put
together<00:03:36.659> it<00:03:37.260> creates<00:03:38.129> this<00:03:38.669> impressive<00:03:39.389> 3d

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
together it creates this impressive 3d

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.710 
together it creates this impressive 3d
image<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.669> what<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> tree<00:03:42.299> would<00:03:42.449> look<00:03:42.599> like

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
image of what a tree would look like

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.800 
image of what a tree would look like
versus<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.829> plain<00:03:44.459> old<00:03:44.669> for<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.389> remember

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
versus just plain old for but remember

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.050 
versus just plain old for but remember
this<00:03:45.959> uses<00:03:46.439> up<00:03:46.560> way<00:03:47.009> more<00:03:47.280> resources<00:03:47.790> and

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
this uses up way more resources and

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.330 
this uses up way more resources and
here's<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.479> Christmas<00:03:48.659> tree<00:03:49.189> with<00:03:50.189> the

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
ornaments on it I think it looks awesome

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.379 
ornaments on it I think it looks awesome
I<00:03:52.409> personally<00:03:53.310> think<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.579> it's<00:03:53.849> it's

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
I personally think that it's it's

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.360 
I personally think that it's it's
impressive<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.139> mean<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.889> a<00:03:55.919> recent

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
impressive I mean this is a recent

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.009 
impressive I mean this is a recent
addition<00:03:56.669> remember<00:03:57.000> when<00:03:57.359> I<00:03:57.389> first<00:03:57.659> looked<00:03:57.930> at

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
addition remember when I first looked at

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.140 
addition remember when I first looked at
the<00:03:58.139> mod<00:03:58.290> all<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.739> was<00:03:58.889> was<00:03:59.189> that<00:03:59.579> tree<00:04:00.000> and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
the mod all there was was that tree and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.999 
the mod all there was was that tree and
now<00:04:00.359> they've<00:04:00.900> got<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.199> Christmas<00:04:01.620> tree<00:04:01.799> here

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:02.009 
now they've got the Christmas tree here

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.520 
now they've got the Christmas tree here
think<00:04:02.459> about<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:03.000> realm<00:04:03.629> although<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.109> think<00:04:04.439> it

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
think about a realm although I think it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.110 
think about a realm although I think it
would<00:04:04.650> probably<00:04:04.680> crash<00:04:05.280> most<00:04:05.669> systems<00:04:06.000> an

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
would probably crash most systems an

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.080 
would probably crash most systems an
entire<00:04:06.689> realm<00:04:07.079> where<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:07.919> was<00:04:08.009> filled<00:04:08.400> with<00:04:08.549> 3d

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
entire realm where it was filled with 3d

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.640 
entire realm where it was filled with 3d
