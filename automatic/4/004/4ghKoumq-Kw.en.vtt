when I came to running around here with
Niki<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> few<00:01:00.870> months<00:01:01.109> ago<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.699> yeah<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.850> could

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.660 
Niki a few months ago so yeah that could
be<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.239> tricky<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:05.010> camera<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> road

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.870 
of Saturday could be celebrating it's
it's<00:06:28.650> going<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.890> be<00:06:28.950> difficult<00:06:29.100> to<00:06:29.490> be<00:06:29.610> honest

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
it's going to be difficult to be honest

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.300 
it's going to be difficult to be honest
after<00:06:30.060> the<00:06:30.390> the<00:06:30.660> penalty<00:06:31.080> I<00:06:31.140> got<00:06:31.320> in<00:06:31.500> in<00:06:31.890> Moscow

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
after the the penalty I got in in Moscow

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.610 
after the the penalty I got in in Moscow
we<00:06:32.490> lost<00:06:32.850> a<00:06:32.940> lot<00:06:33.060> of<00:06:33.090> points<00:06:33.450> so<00:06:33.570> we<00:06:34.410> still

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
we lost a lot of points so we still

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.680 
we lost a lot of points so we still
believe<00:06:34.890> in<00:06:35.010> it<00:06:35.100> so<00:06:35.490> we'll<00:06:35.640> try<00:06:35.850> our<00:06:35.910> best<00:06:36.120> but

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
believe in it so we'll try our best but

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.780 
believe in it so we'll try our best but
