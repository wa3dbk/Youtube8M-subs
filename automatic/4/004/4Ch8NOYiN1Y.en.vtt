this<00:00:00.329> is<00:00:00.420> how<00:00:00.599> to<00:00:00.659> solve<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.319> Rubik's<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:02.040> Rubik's

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
this is how to solve a Rubik's a Rubik's

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.150 
this is how to solve a Rubik's a Rubik's
4<00:00:03.810> by<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.110> 4x4<00:00:04.710> Rubik's<00:00:04.920> Cube<00:00:05.520> pum<00:00:06.560> edges<00:00:07.560> part<00:00:07.919> 2

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
4 by a 4x4 Rubik's Cube pum edges part 2

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.879 
4 by a 4x4 Rubik's Cube pum edges part 2
so<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.900> should<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.469> position<00:00:10.650> where

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
so you should be in a position where

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.190 
so you should be in a position where
yourself<00:00:11.460> almost<00:00:11.790> all<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.210> six<00:00:12.480> centers<00:00:12.900> and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
yourself almost all the six centers and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.910 
yourself almost all the six centers and
ten<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.089> edges<00:00:15.089> are<00:00:15.540> all<00:00:16.260> edges<00:00:16.740> I'll

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
ten of the edges are all edges I'll

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.820 
ten of the edges are all edges I'll
refer<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.279> them<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.580> dangers<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:19.529> first

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
refer to them as dangers now the first

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.700 
refer to them as dangers now the first
10<00:00:20.310> pages<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.750> should<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:21.930> two<00:00:22.050> days

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
10 pages and so you should have two days

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.970 
10 pages and so you should have two days
left<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.340> solved<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.109> which

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
left to be solved it is this one which

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.429 
left to be solved it is this one which
is<00:00:26.010> green<00:00:26.580> yellow<00:00:26.880> white<00:00:27.300> orange<00:00:28.109> sent

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
is green yellow white orange sent

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.160 
is green yellow white orange sent
through<00:00:28.680> green<00:00:29.400> yellow<00:00:29.699> while<00:00:30.150> black<00:00:30.869> orange

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
through green yellow while black orange

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.069 
through green yellow while black orange
bright<00:00:31.679> white<00:00:32.130> flash<00:00:32.489> by<00:00:32.880> five<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
bright white flash by five you have to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.430 
bright white flash by five you have to
get<00:00:34.350> food<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.309> position<00:00:35.610> where<00:00:38.840> in<00:00:39.840> position

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
get food in a position where in position

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.500 
get food in a position where in position
where<00:00:41.070> these<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.520> Matthew<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.239> will

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
where these so Matthew and these will

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
where these so Matthew and these will
match<00:00:42.690> unless<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.219> position<00:00:44.399> where

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
match unless it is in a position where

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.040 
match unless it is in a position where
they<00:00:44.879> store<00:00:45.120> matching<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.570> two<00:00:45.750> matching

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
they store matching these two matching

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
they store matching these two matching
that's<00:00:46.230> good<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> also<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.460> feel<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that's good and also you feel like this

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.610 
that's good and also you feel like this
swimming<00:00:48.510> action<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.140> will<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.379> matching

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
swimming action this will be matching

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.459 
swimming action this will be matching
this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.370> imagine<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.059> will<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.329> lucky<00:00:51.539> so

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
this is imagine this will be lucky so

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.270 
this is imagine this will be lucky so
pretty<00:00:53.070> simple<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> basically<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.860> wouldn't

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
pretty simple so basically this wouldn't

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
pretty simple so basically this wouldn't
work<00:00:56.420> these<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> their<00:00:57.780> madness<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.410> no<00:00:58.500> match

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
work these to their madness is no match

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.279 
work these to their madness is no match
this<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.300> not<00:01:00.420> match<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
this and this do not match this in the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.470 
this and this do not match this in the
spirit<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.399> basic<00:01:02.730> thing<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.149> basic

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
spirit now the basic thing is your basic

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.200 
spirit now the basic thing is your basic
rule<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.080> tackled<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> split<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
rule is to be tackled and split them you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
rule is to be tackled and split them you
know<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> came<00:01:06.510> across<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:07.200> something<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
know I came across or something now you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070 
know I came across or something now you
have<00:01:08.520> those<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.030> solving<00:01:09.390> those<00:01:09.479> two<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.810> what

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
have those two solving those two so what

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
have those two solving those two so what
does<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.409> will<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.619> does<00:01:10.950> removes<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.909> here

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
does have will be does removes this here

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.499 
does have will be does removes this here
who<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> CM<00:01:12.810> movies<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:15.210> ahead<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
who the CM movies here so go ahead and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.050 
who the CM movies here so go ahead and
do<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:17.520> watch<00:01:17.820> me

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
do it so how it is just watch me

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
do it so how it is just watch me
carefully<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.810> since<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.310> since<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
carefully and since you and a since you

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
carefully and since you and a since you
banned<00:01:21.000> me<00:01:21.180> 3x3<00:01:21.750> Rubik's<00:01:22.140> cube<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.590> should

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
banned me 3x3 Rubik's cube in you should

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.719 
banned me 3x3 Rubik's cube in you should
know<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.250> doing

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
know what I'm doing

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
know what I'm doing
so<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> should<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.740> follow<00:01:26.130> me<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.409> do

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
so so you should just follow me and do

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.690 
so so you should just follow me and do
these<00:01:28.710> moves<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.079> you<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.470> learn<00:01:31.740> them<00:01:31.950> just

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
these moves and you just learn them just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.179 
these moves and you just learn them just
you<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.659> right<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:34.920> up

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you know like right so the right up

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.670 
you know like right so the right up
right<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.549> right<00:01:36.000> thing<00:01:36.810> Eddie<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.290> brother

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
right up right thing Eddie one brother

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
right up right thing Eddie one brother
I<00:01:37.799> mean<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.310> right<00:01:38.549> ultimately<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.509> people

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
I mean all right ultimately this people

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
I mean all right ultimately this people
should<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.979> seriously

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
should know that that's a seriously

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
should know that that's a seriously
simple<00:01:42.299> algorithm<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.990> mean<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.590> thing<00:01:43.860> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
simple algorithm I mean that thing I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.460 
simple algorithm I mean that thing I
could<00:01:44.820> teach<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.270> algorithm<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
could teach you an algorithm like that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
could teach you an algorithm like that
right<00:01:46.890> now<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.520> remember<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
right now and you just remember it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.690 
right now and you just remember it
because<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.320> simple<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.490> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
because it's just so simple so it's that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.139 
because it's just so simple so it's that
sort<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.090> living<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.710> move<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.909> move

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
sort of a living so this move you move

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.319 
sort of a living so this move you move
that<00:01:54.360> they're<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.189> goes<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.180> price

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that they're the right goes up the price

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.530 
that they're the right goes up the price
goes<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.619> right<00:01:58.920> goes<00:01:59.159> across<00:01:59.540> over

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
goes up then the right goes across over

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.510 
goes up then the right goes across over
the<00:02:00.659> right<00:02:00.840> comes<00:02:01.079> back<00:02:01.259> home<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.009> comes<00:02:02.280> back

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the right comes back home and comes back

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600 
the right comes back home and comes back
and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.439> centers<00:02:04.799> get<00:02:04.920> messed<00:02:05.159> up<00:02:05.310> again

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and then the centers get messed up again

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.550 
and then the centers get messed up again
and<00:02:05.850> bang<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.540> solve<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.170> solve<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
and bang you solve that and solve that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.850 
and bang you solve that and solve that
so<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:10.349> that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.730 

and<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.210> these<00:02:15.420> two<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.200> these

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and get it so that these two so these

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.560 
and get it so that these two so these
two<00:02:16.950> these<00:02:17.250> two<00:02:17.310> matching<00:02:17.910> these<00:02:18.060> took<00:02:18.300> these

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
two these two matching these took these

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.590 
two these two matching these took these

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
two matching this is to imagine one of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.960 
two matching this is to imagine one of
these<00:02:21.780> matching<00:02:22.410> now<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.730> this

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
these matching now do it do this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.170 
these matching now do it do this
pleaseplease<00:02:24.540> across<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.350> way<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:26.670> goes<00:02:26.970> up

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
pleaseplease across this way it goes up

pleaseplease across this way it goes up
the<00:02:27.360> strings<00:02:27.630> up<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.500> leads<00:02:28.830> across

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the strings up this leads across

the strings up this leads across
underneath<00:02:29.850> combined<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:30.720> thing<00:02:30.990> down<00:02:31.200> and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
underneath combined this thing down and

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.800 
underneath combined this thing down and
we<00:02:32.550> dispose<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.330> solves<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.720> I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
we dispose that and it solves that I

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.210 
we dispose that and it solves that I
mean<00:02:33.990> it's<00:02:34.140> really<00:02:34.350> simple<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.860> mean<00:02:34.890> just

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
mean it's really simple I mean just

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.780 
mean it's really simple I mean just
watch<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.430> once<00:02:35.880> or<00:02:36.090> twice<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:37.040> easy<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
watch that once or twice and easy and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.740 
watch that once or twice and easy and
then<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.240> solve<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.600> 3x3<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:43.970> had<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.180> cross<00:02:45.480> I

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
then just solve it 3x3 I had the cross I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.470 
then just solve it 3x3 I had the cross I
take<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.230> long<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.800> it

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
take so long to do it

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.840 
take so long to do it
and<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:48.989> anyone<00:02:49.350> knows<00:02:49.560> I'm<00:02:49.920> very<00:02:50.520> good

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
and now if anyone knows I'm very good

link little video to the sucker

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.770 
link little video to the sucker
I<00:02:56.880> suck<00:02:57.450> across<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:01.640> from<00:03:02.640> little<00:03:03.060> toys<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
I suck across that from little toys and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:15.890 
I suck across that from little toys and
stuff<00:03:04.130> cause<00:03:07.400> some<00:03:09.230> think<00:03:14.690> yes

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
stuff cause some think yes

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.280 
stuff cause some think yes
now<00:03:16.489> parody<00:03:17.489> we<00:03:18.060> get<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.480> case<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.900> one<00:03:19.110> edge

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
now parody we get to a case of one edge

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.509 
now parody we get to a case of one edge
needs<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.739> flipped<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.220> there's<00:03:20.430> no

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
needs to be flipped but there's no

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.430

algorithm<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:21.150> do<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.750> what<00:03:21.870> do<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.080> do

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
algorithm to do it so what do you do

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.500 
algorithm to do it so what do you do
so<00:03:22.950> watch<00:03:23.130> what's<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.640> last<00:03:23.790> algorithm<00:03:24.390> for

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
so watch what's the last algorithm for

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.270 
so watch what's the last algorithm for
the<00:03:24.630> two<00:03:24.870> parodies<00:03:25.350> one<00:03:25.890> parodies

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the two parodies one parodies

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.979 
the two parodies one parodies
orientational<00:03:27.030> parody<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> other<00:03:27.750> pair

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
orientational parody and the other pair

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.920 
orientational parody and the other pair
is<00:03:28.830> permutation<00:03:29.580> or<00:03:29.670> parody<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.540> we'll<00:03:30.690> get<00:03:30.810> to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
is permutation or parody so we'll get to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.980 
is permutation or parody so we'll get to
them<00:03:31.049> in<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.260> next<00:03:31.440> step
