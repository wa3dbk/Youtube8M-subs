00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
about a hundred megabyte or less of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.910 
about a hundred megabyte or less of
the<00:01:52.520> dedicated<00:01:53.360> memory<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:54.229> I<00:01:54.470> showed<00:01:54.770> you

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
the dedicated memory that I showed you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.260 
the dedicated memory that I showed you
earlier<00:01:55.000> okay<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.930> in<00:01:57.470> my<00:01:58.250> case<00:01:58.549> I've<00:01:58.880> seen<00:01:59.090> it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
earlier okay so in my case I've seen it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.910 
earlier okay so in my case I've seen it
many<00:01:59.420> times<00:01:59.619> configuring<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.740> game<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
many times configuring the game the the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.370 
many times configuring the game the the

video memory that detects in this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.710 
video memory that detects in this
machine<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:07.869> 1980<00:02:08.869> megabyte<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.720> 2048

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
machine is 1980 megabyte of the 2048

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.009 
machine is 1980 megabyte of the 2048
that<00:02:12.349> is<00:02:12.500> normal<00:02:12.890> because<00:02:13.550> Windows<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.480> using

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
that is normal because Windows is using

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.710 
that is normal because Windows is using
a<00:02:15.319> portion<00:02:15.769> of<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> video<00:02:16.190> memory<00:02:16.720> so

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
a portion of the video memory so

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.059 
a portion of the video memory so
completely<00:02:18.410> normal<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:20.450> for<00:02:20.870> example<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.709> says

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.710 

say<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.190> says<00:02:25.390> 250<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.709> have<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.720> three

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
say it says 250 but you have a three

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.920 
say it says 250 but you have a three
