00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.500
 You opened the night All you could afford 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.460
 Masks ripped away Soul held in captivity. 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.210
 Let the blood on your cheek fall down on lipstick. 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.610
 Dash barrier words. 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.050
 Angel words are not necessary. 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.070
 Chorus: And we are not angels, man! 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.370
 No, we are not angels. 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.130
 Dark creatures, and ripped off the strap to us. 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.339
 If we are asked What would we like? 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:09.200
 We would take off We would take off ... 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:24.630
 We are not angels guy! 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:38.060
 No, we are not angels. 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.719
 There in the fire We lost the ranks. 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.979
 There is no such love nor trust. 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.030
 People look for feathers. 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.399
 We are not angels guy! 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.549
 Hundreds of other people's roofs What were you looking for a guy there? 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.850
 You've been sleeping for so long .. 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.889
 Too long for the creature. 

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:10.140
 Maybe it's time down? 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.890
 Where you breathe the body. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.890
 Drop your blank sheet. 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:34.640
 Creatures do not walk in white
