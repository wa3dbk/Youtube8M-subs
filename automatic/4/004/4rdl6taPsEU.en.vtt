things<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.410> Elizabeth<00:02:21.860> when<00:02:22.069> there<00:02:22.190> are<00:02:22.280> some

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
things in Elizabeth when there are some

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.339 
things in Elizabeth when there are some
problems<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:23.150> Elizabeth<00:02:23.690> has<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.049> I<00:02:24.080> think

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
problems that Elizabeth has but I think

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.229 
problems that Elizabeth has but I think
Elizabeth<00:02:24.560> shares<00:02:25.010> these<00:02:25.280> problems<00:02:25.730> with

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
Elizabeth shares these problems with

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.539 
Elizabeth shares these problems with
lots<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.930> other<00:02:27.110> suburbs<00:02:27.470> people<00:02:28.250> are<00:02:28.370> very

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
lots of other suburbs people are very

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.740 
lots of other suburbs people are very
quickly<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.269> label<00:02:30.079> a<00:02:30.260> place<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:32.239> all<00:02:32.450> this

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
quickly to label a place and so all this

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.839 
quickly to label a place and so all this
is<00:02:32.900> bad<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.319> that's<00:02:33.440> bad<00:02:33.799> but<00:02:34.099> if<00:02:34.549> they<00:02:34.790> think

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
is bad and that's bad but if they think

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.970 
is bad and that's bad but if they think
carefully<00:02:35.599> they<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:36.079> say<00:02:36.290> well<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.620> happens

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
carefully they can say well that happens

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.650 
carefully they can say well that happens
and<00:02:37.190> that's<00:02:37.280> suburb<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.000> another<00:02:38.299> person

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
and that's suburb to another person

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.960 
and that's suburb to another person
that's<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:39.049> up<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.319> well<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:39.799> want<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.790> make

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970

their<00:02:41.180> cells<00:02:41.690> feel<00:02:42.049> better<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.829> like<00:02:43.040> saying

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
their cells feel better and like saying

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.860

that they come from a better place

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.690 
that they come from a better place

they might be living in Mawson Lakes so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.199 
they might be living in Mawson Lakes so
that's<00:02:49.040> more<00:02:49.400> better<00:02:49.640> because<00:02:49.880> they've<00:02:50.030> got

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209

here so I wouldn't be our leaving I just
really<00:04:20.600> love<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.870> openness<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.709> way

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979

they support each other through crises

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.820 
they support each other through crises
and<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:27.020> sense<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.500> think<00:04:27.710> they're

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
and in that sense I think they're

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.760 
and in that sense I think they're
extremely<00:04:28.340> supportive<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:29.590> think<00:04:30.590> there's<00:04:30.740> a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
extremely supportive I think there's a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.960 
extremely supportive I think there's a
lot<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.010> room<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.250> room<00:04:31.880> for<00:04:32.180> improvement<00:04:32.660> but

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
lot of room to room for improvement but

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.909 
lot of room to room for improvement but
that<00:04:34.970> improvement<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:35.660> think<00:04:35.900> will<00:04:36.020> come<00:04:36.260> from

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
that improvement I think will come from

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.510 
that improvement I think will come from
you<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.639> young<00:04:37.850> people<00:04:39.220> taking<00:04:40.220> up<00:04:40.370> the
