years ago I would have worried about a
Berkshire<00:01:58.619> without<00:01:58.890> Buffett<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> was

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
Berkshire without Buffett because it was

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.969 
Berkshire without Buffett because it was
primarily<00:02:00.210> his<00:02:00.450> investment<00:02:00.960> vehicle<00:02:01.409> today

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
primarily his investment vehicle today

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.920 
primarily his investment vehicle today
it's<00:02:02.159> primarily<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.820> well-managed<00:02:03.540> business

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it's primarily a well-managed business

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's primarily a well-managed business
organization<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> don't<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.159> any<00:02:05.310> worries

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
organization so I don't have any worries

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.940 
organization so I don't have any worries
with<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.329> he's<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.079> planned<00:02:07.350> playing

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
with with he's really planned playing

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.350

this out very well and the company will

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.809 
this out very well and the company will
be<00:02:09.539> well<00:02:10.080> off<00:02:10.289> without<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.310> or<00:02:11.400> without<00:02:11.520> him

earlier<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.770> year<00:03:10.830> talking<00:03:11.160> about<00:03:11.370> IBM

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
earlier this year talking about IBM

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.240 
earlier this year talking about IBM
struggles<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.440> seems<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.740> be<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.920> setback

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
struggles and it seems to be a setback

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.850 
struggles and it seems to be a setback
rather<00:03:14.670> than<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.910> permanent<00:03:15.420> problem<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
rather than a permanent problem and and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.580 
rather than a permanent problem and and
Berkshire<00:03:17.850> has<00:03:17.970> actually<00:03:18.270> made<00:03:18.390> money<00:03:18.600> off<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
Berkshire has actually made money off of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.410 
Berkshire has actually made money off of
the<00:03:19.650> IBM<00:03:20.010> stock<00:03:20.340> because<00:03:20.730> iBM<00:03:21.150> has<00:03:21.180> been

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the IBM stock because iBM has been

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.690 
the IBM stock because iBM has been
repurchasing<00:03:22.050> its<00:03:22.200> share<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:23.280> investment

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
repurchasing its share so the investment

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.450 
repurchasing its share so the investment
has<00:03:23.790> actually<00:03:24.120> been<00:03:24.690> been<00:03:25.560> positive<00:03:26.070> even<00:03:26.250> if

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
has actually been been positive even if

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.580 
has actually been been positive even if
even<00:03:26.820> if<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.000> company<00:03:27.150> struggling<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
even if the company struggling and the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.290 
even if the company struggling and the
thought<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.460> company<00:03:29.790> has<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.000> you

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
thought is that the company has a you

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.840 
thought is that the company has a you
know<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> deep<00:03:30.720> history<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.500> some<00:03:32.430> very<00:03:32.670> good

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
know a deep history and some very good

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.660 
know a deep history and some very good
product<00:03:33.540> plans<00:03:34.410> with<00:03:34.590> with<00:03:34.800> Watson<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.520> on

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
product plans with with Watson and so on

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.670 
product plans with with Watson and so on
so<00:03:35.880> yeah<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.330> don't<00:03:36.690> think<00:03:36.990> that's<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.380> number

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
so yeah I don't think that's the number

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.620 
so yeah I don't think that's the number
one<00:03:37.830> problem<00:03:38.550> or<00:03:38.850> challenge<00:03:39.000> at<00:03:39.300> Berkshire

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
one problem or challenge at Berkshire

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.050 
one problem or challenge at Berkshire
nowadays
