00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.040 
tray that could just slide right in here
you<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.370> also<00:00:47.430> use<00:00:47.789> tinfoil<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.719> something

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you could also use tinfoil or something

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.880 
you could also use tinfoil or something
like<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.930> goes<00:00:51.930> right<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.320> sits<00:00:52.739> on

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
like that and goes right in here sits on

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.560 
like that and goes right in here sits on
the<00:00:52.980> bottom<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> lifts<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.180> barely<00:00:54.420> off

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the bottom it lifts it just barely off

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.639 
the bottom it lifts it just barely off
the<00:00:54.840> ground<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.800> airflow<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.989> also<00:00:57.989> cut<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the ground for airflow I also cut the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.700 
the ground for airflow I also cut the
two<00:00:59.899> different

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
two different

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.200 
two different
I<00:01:02.800> even<00:01:03.399> know<00:01:03.550> what<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:03.760> would<00:01:03.850> call<00:01:03.910> them

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
I even know what you would call them

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.149 
I even know what you would call them
just<00:01:04.360> basically<00:01:04.659> this<00:01:04.989> grill<00:01:05.290> it<00:01:05.680> wraps<00:01:05.979> all

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
just basically this grill it wraps all

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.609 
just basically this grill it wraps all
the<00:01:06.220> way<00:01:06.340> around<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.510> it<00:01:08.049> goes<00:01:08.229> all<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.470> way

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
the way around and it goes all the way

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.140 
the way around and it goes all the way
through<00:01:09.159> but<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:11.080> I<00:01:11.110> decided<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.130> do<00:01:12.340> is<00:01:12.909> to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
through but what I decided to do is to

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.359 
through but what I decided to do is to
cut<00:01:13.390> those<00:01:13.600> off<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.350> instead<00:01:14.770> put<00:01:15.070> not<00:01:15.340> just

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
cut those off and instead put not just

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.300 
cut those off and instead put not just
here<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.080> could<00:01:17.320> put<00:01:17.530> large<00:01:18.130> steaks<00:01:18.580> or<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
here so I could put large steaks or you

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.590 
here so I could put large steaks or you
know<00:01:21.369> something<00:01:21.670> like<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:21.970> if<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.149> wanted<00:01:22.450> to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.060 
know something like that if I wanted to
or<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:22.899> also<00:01:23.530> put<00:01:24.040> holes<00:01:24.430> down<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:24.940> side<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:26.649> a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
or I also put holes down the side and a

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.460 
or I also put holes down the side and a
pattern<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.119> corresponds<00:01:28.899> I<00:01:28.960> need<00:01:29.110> each

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
pattern that corresponds I need each

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.170 
pattern that corresponds I need each
side<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:29.920> could<00:01:30.070> put<00:01:30.250> tent<00:01:30.490> stakes<00:01:30.790> like<00:01:31.060> I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
side so I could put tent stakes like I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.770

no doubt buying a

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.940 
no doubt buying a
the<00:04:38.760> propane<00:04:39.180> stove<00:04:39.480> is<00:04:39.660> easier<00:04:40.020> but<00:04:40.350> this<00:04:40.770> is

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
the propane stove is easier but this is

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.260 
the propane stove is easier but this is
kind<00:04:41.160> of<00:04:41.190> cool<00:04:41.430> because<00:04:41.640> you<00:04:41.790> can<00:04:41.850> just<00:04:42.060> use

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
kind of cool because you can just use

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
kind of cool because you can just use
what<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:42.540> have
