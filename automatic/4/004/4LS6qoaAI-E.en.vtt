so far I think the biggest impact has
been<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> healthcare<00:00:12.630> work<00:00:12.929> we've<00:00:13.110> done<00:00:13.139> I

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559

was<00:02:00.090> good<00:02:00.329> economics<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:04.229> means

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
was good economics so that means

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.230 
was good economics so that means
