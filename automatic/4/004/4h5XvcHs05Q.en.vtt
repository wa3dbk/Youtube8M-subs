00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.559
 what's up kids here are you 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.450
 watching gta san andreas in play 3 ha 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.890
 come out in the story that I hope already 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.150
 You know, I make a video a bit 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.070
 because there will be people who do not know it but 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.129
 the store has left 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.839
 to download for 15 euros 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.480
 the truth is that it is the best gta there is 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.130
 then for 15 euros it's fine but it's 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.259
 that if you share it with someone and what 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.809
 you buy between two, as it has 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.809
 gone through that you get to 7.50 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.090
 I already have here I am not playing with 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.640
 tricks this stick done now a little 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.200
 for the video to remember this great 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.560
 trick I think it was the best over 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560
 molaba 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.960
 I'm going to climb up here 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.370
 and well seeing the opportunity to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.559
 get the game for 750 the truth is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.489
 that I did not think about it because good 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.440
 I have a thorn in my head 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.060
 with this game in its day I did not get it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.850
 to pass 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.500
 I did not have the play 2 because to the house of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 my father and I played every two ends of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.820
 week and also gave a lot to the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.770
 pro then no end to hook in 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.900
 play 2 and at home so I had it in the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.730
 pc but what happens when playing with 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.820
 the keyboard had a mission almost to the 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.580
 final that forced you to get a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.160
 catch a plane and go through a series of 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.020
 hoops and such and good with the keyboard is that 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.170
 they did not do it to me or I could not pass it to me 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.060
 and good is that after the gta 3 the gta 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.760
 vice city and the vice city stories the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.450
 liberty city stories in the p esp el gta 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.610
 4 that went to play 3 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.830
 I've spent all the gt that big - 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.260
 this is now he is now trying 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.060
 happen I just started it yesterday 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.950
 and well that way I get it increase I do not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.050
 gave tricks or anything or life or 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.720
 weapons or anything I do without tricks 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.340
 and good the truth is that graphically 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.830
 bad is that at the beginning it says colloquial 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.020
 the game of all right now for a 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.130
 Accurate shit but good you want not to 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.439
 then when gta 5 comes out 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.040
 let's change to because that's going to be 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.920
 very pp 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.110
 and well, the bad thing is that now 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.030
 you see the graphics of shit but good 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.410
 then jump and gta 5 and the host 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.870
 fucking drug of the game 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.080
 and nothing because that if I liked this 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.350
 game and pussy you want 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.840
 they remembered so to speak 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.340
 to play it again and you share it 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.650
 with someone and you're already a 7.50 and like 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.880
 you see is exactly the same game that 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.980
 the surname have not changed anything of 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.140
 done at the beginning of the game put play 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 station2 when you are going to save the game 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.659
 they put you do not remove the memory stick 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.700
 or whatever it is they have copied such 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.920
 which people complained because they look the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.920
 character raised a little the game and others 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.800
 certainly the trains could be caught 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.690
 yesterday and 1 we have agreed a train 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.960
 derail totally from so much cane to 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.069
 train that the wagons to lion for a 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.209
 side and 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.209
 in the cabin by another 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.460
 and nothing then if you want your mom soft 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.500
 affective video employ some mission 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.500
 or doing the subnormal money 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.300
 just to pass it to me and I think because 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.620
 I really think it's the best gta concept 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.420
 since it has come out better than 4 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.480
 soon the 4th of the princess was 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.280
 better but this one is called freedom 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.380
 many more things to do 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.450
 yesterday for example I finished it already started 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.200
 You see I changed clothes I put tattoos 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.050
 in the arm and I put on a beard 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.030
 then you can study the cars you can 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.180
 go eat after torso in the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.390
 gym 6 skill there are bicycles there 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.330
 planes and trains much more much more 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.099
 varied than that of gta 4 that with many 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.500
 graphics that were experts in 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.019
 topics to look for so nothing I leave you with 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.860
 this already if you want to lower what you already know 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.860
 what comes
