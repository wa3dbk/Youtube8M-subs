 who seem to be the United States and do not concern here to 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.310
 An example list of topics on which dzhen 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.100
 Psak expressed in one and only in

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.820
 all as a result, the number of topics and 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.520
 of course it affects their quality 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.189
 analysis but sometimes not until analysis 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.780
 facts to sort out we want to 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.149
 Ukraine had access to additional 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.039
 volume hans if needed 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.899
 as you all know natural gas 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.829
 transported by pipeline and 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.149
 Western Europe through Ukraine to Russia 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.009
 indicative of psaki dating 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.719
 future husband he called the press service 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.209
 Democratic Party to find out how 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.670
 drive to the event site sent 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.890
 him the other way then in an interview 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.719
 I admitted I am not well guided 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.610
 for some reason said I think you need 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.659
 turn left as a result he 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.270
 lost even more 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.009
 so at the briefing giving out prepared 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.140
 The helpers text jen psaki is often not 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.140
 understands what he says and even in this 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.910
 recognized and singled out rahoi on with white and 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.829
 we do not recognize the results of the referendum 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.750
 which took place in Donetsk and Lugansk 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.549
 There were messages selected carousel 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.530
 pre-marked ballots and 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.690
 voting children voting for 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.200
 absent forgive my ignorance 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.150
 what is the elective carousel should 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.780
 admit that I just read this text 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.239
 I myself do not know that I will clarify my colleagues 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.459
 what is being said and the children are also mentioned 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.470
 who voted in Nezhin did it 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.870
 circling a couple of strong pores you think 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.700
 what is not above the journalist already accustomed 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.099
 ask again several times 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.959
 psaki what did she mean at times 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.389
 statement contradicts the fundamental 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.010
 the principle of the modern world order 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.349
 for example the western economy would collapse 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.750
 if it existed by the rules as 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.940
 they understand the representative of the State Department are given 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.739
 and fit the Russians say what they want 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.260
 get money for the gas that they 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.400
 already put on Ukraine you agree 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.810
 what is the basis of normal 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.849
 commodity-money relations 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.620
 I understand what they say but if the total 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.419
 agreement which was concluded between 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.970
 countries in the past and what happens 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.970
 it is now obvious that it is no longer easy 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.859
 business for now but still you agree 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.880
 that Russians have the right to demand money 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.319
 for the goods sold 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.450
 I will gladly understand this question 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.359
 when I return to my office and do not 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.010
 clarify and let's get back to the topic later 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.299
 phrases that a journalist hears from 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.519
 representative let a profit arno 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.810
 recently she could not name a single 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.340
 significant achievement american 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.810
 foreign policy when he was 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.909
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.730
 although this topic at the psaki briefing 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:40.280
 touched the world itself and uncomfortable questions and 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.810
 nothing to say bubbles coincidence 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.340
 is it a coincidence that he would fold 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.319
 Ukrainian authorities sent troops 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.329
 eastern Ukraine immediately after the visit to 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.159
 Kiev from to put representatives of the United States 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.230
 the first time it was that John Brennan 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.909
 now from vice president rubyin sketch 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.909
 bodings it so act i it 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.919
 a coincidence i think you just 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.560
 repeat the words foreign minister 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:04.069
 laurels and whether there was again a state color what 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.290
 the next question is new however not only 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.790
 journalists nous gusev often puts 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.959
 your official representative in 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.760
 awkward situation 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.040
 An example of this is a bearded photo 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.349
 men in camouflage are taken from the internet and 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.430
 which Washington called evidence 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.030
 presence in the east of Ukraine 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.959
 Russian troops 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.060
 how sure are you on these 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.630
 photos of people who are related 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.669
 to Russia 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.979
 these photos went around all the world media 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.770
 they were on twitter and they are in 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.169
 open access in the pictures we see that 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.580
 These people are crazy about their appearance clearly 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.750
 have cars in Russia 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.159
 and this you call evidence and shane 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.389
 up to 12 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.430
 but you don't want to say that 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.409
 US government with Russian intelligence 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.370
 and so on now depends on the photos 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:52.130
 who posted these shots online 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.710
 sealed conclusions do yourself 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:59.320
 Subject also picked up humorous show 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.320
 even the Americans themselves gave the State Department us peace 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.160
 attirance 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.380
 what is serious is yours 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.900
 evidence fat man with a beard 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.270
 this is Eastern Europe all the same yes he 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.900
 look like almost every guy in the world is 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.700
 same 2 3 groups taken from oleg summer man 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.120
 which will be servis the first album Bisti 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.090
 boy 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.550
 joking rather joking trying and 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.470
 psaki turns on awkwardly like for example 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.210
 the history of the Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.430
 which in a telephone conversation is capable 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.020
 Ukraine Geoffrey Payette discussing 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.210
 future configuration options 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.430
 Ukrainian government again seemed 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.840
 where would the us obscene 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.700
 spoke to the European Union you all 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.550
 well know victoria and for sure in 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.530
 course that when she was 23 she was 8 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.260
 months lived aboard a Russian ship and 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.890
 may have learned some vocabulary there 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.960
 that is, they started and swear you have 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.000
 due to the fact that we are biased 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.590
 Russia is not, I assume that on board 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.720
 of this fishing vessel she could 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.990
 learn Russian profanity but 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.530
 she swore in English she ok 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.390
 it would be understandable it would be funny if 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.620
 it was not so sad in the State Department clearly 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.750
 personnel shortage is considered by analysts 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.430
 note that specialists in Russia 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.440
 especially not enough young cadres 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.690
 prefer Arabic or Chinese 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.610
 direction and old thinks in categories 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:23.590
 still the cold war result is evident 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.930
 Now the question is what does America do with everything 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.570
 that which is the most stupid option you 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.490
 can take a shower so we must 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.250
 make a tactical decision arm 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:37.930
 cues give them 100 t-72 tanks and stocks 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:40.180
 on so come out the gift of an accident 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.130
 we have already done this pro-Russian fighters 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.460
 they have been taken away and are now having fun on 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.560
 parking store 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.270
 Washington does not have a well-thought 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.250
 policy with Russia considers 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.419
 expert because trite to anyone 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.400
 think about the prospects 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.699
 Decisions are made according to the 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.259
 the situation is changing rapidly 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.569
 Replace the Obama strata do not have time 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:01.580
 calculate the consequences 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:03.650
 State Department budget from 83 years were laid 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.360
 expenses for training advisers in the USSR 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.550
 and after all the states had to take into account 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.960
 interests of moscow around the world then 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.970
 balance of power in global politics 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.710
 changed the year before 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.449
 the state department even completely stopped 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.020
 analyst training funding 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.840
 Russianists 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.820
 now it turns out that hurried like 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.770
 write newspapers programs are not going to 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.320
 only restore well and maybe even 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:29.229
 to expand the tour lazarev inside is not 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.229
 First the United States of the skills
