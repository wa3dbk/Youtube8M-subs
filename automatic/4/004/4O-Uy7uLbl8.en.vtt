00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.440 
powder brush which looks like this this
is<00:02:14.250> kind<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.700> new<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.209> kind<00:02:15.420> of

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
is kind of a new so it's kind of

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.720 
is kind of a new so it's kind of
deformed<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.170> um<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:17.730> use<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.209> with<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:19.260> one

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
deformed but um I use this with this one

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.060 
deformed but um I use this with this one
it's<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.910> Max<00:02:21.870> Factor<00:02:21.959> miracle<00:02:22.530> touch<00:02:22.709> and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
it's the Max Factor miracle touch and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.360 
it's the Max Factor miracle touch and
you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.400> see<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:25.070> opening<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.160> very

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you can see that the opening is very

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190 
you can see that the opening is very
different<00:02:26.550> ok<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.750> what<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:27.989> much

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
different ok so this is what is much

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.370 
different ok so this is what is much
bigger<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:28.920> also<00:02:29.070> much<00:02:30.050> smaller<00:02:31.050> in

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
bigger but it's also much smaller in

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.330 
bigger but it's also much smaller in
size<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:33.500> was<00:02:34.500> planning<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.830> use<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.190> like

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
size so I was planning to use it like

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.509 
size so I was planning to use it like
that<00:02:35.550> just<00:02:36.030> because<00:02:36.420> I've<00:02:37.050> been<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.680> trying

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
that just because I've been one trying

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.280 
that just because I've been one trying
to<00:02:38.640> use<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.940> because<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.390> originally<00:02:39.840> used

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
to use that because I originally used

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.350 
to use that because I originally used
the<00:02:40.500> stippling<00:02:41.130> brush<00:02:41.459> with<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.150> tail

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
the stippling brush with this one tail

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.330 
the stippling brush with this one tail
and<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.320> wanted<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> try<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:43.890> one<00:02:44.010> because

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and I wanted to try this one because

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.860 
and I wanted to try this one because
I've<00:02:44.549> heard<00:02:44.700> oh<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.120> applies<00:02:45.420> liquid

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
I've heard oh it applies liquid

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.539 
I've heard oh it applies liquid
foundation<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.470> nicely<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.100> wanted<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.459> try

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
foundation so nicely so I wanted to try

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.420 
foundation so nicely so I wanted to try
for<00:02:47.730> career<00:02:48.060> foundation<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:49.320> as<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.190> see

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
for career foundation but as you can see

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.850 
for career foundation but as you can see
it<00:02:50.580> doesn't<00:02:50.760> fit<00:02:51.120> inside<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:53.400> way<00:02:53.640> too<00:02:53.700> big

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
it doesn't fit inside it's way too big

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.610 
it doesn't fit inside it's way too big
so<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.400> used<00:02:56.700> my<00:02:56.790> stippling<00:02:57.239> called<00:02:57.620> stippling

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
so I used my stippling called stippling

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.500 
so I used my stippling called stippling
brush<00:02:58.890> into<00:02:59.130> work<00:02:59.340> very<00:02:59.760> nice<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.910> really

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
brush into work very nice so I really

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.259 
brush into work very nice so I really
like<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.870> foundation<00:03:04.579> I'm<00:03:05.579> not<00:03:05.820> wearing<00:03:06.239> it

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
like this foundation I'm not wearing it

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.819 
like this foundation I'm not wearing it
now<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.810> kind<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.049> planning<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:09.829> so

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
now I was kind of planning to but and so

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.759 
now I was kind of planning to but and so
I<00:03:10.860> tried<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.549> elf<00:03:11.989> tinted<00:03:12.989> moisturizer<00:03:13.470> SPF

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:21.430 
I tried the elf tinted moisturizer SPF
thing<00:03:14.700> means<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:16.070> this<00:03:17.070> says<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.790> give<00:03:17.970> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.710 

12-hour<00:03:22.440> luminous<00:03:23.160> matte<00:03:23.400> finish<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.090> pour

some wrinkles look smoother and I like

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.600 
some wrinkles look smoother and I like
this<00:03:27.720> about<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.680> because<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.160> doesn't<00:03:29.430> claim

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
this about this because it doesn't claim

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.810 
this about this because it doesn't claim
to<00:03:29.880> make<00:03:30.090> your<00:03:30.299> pores<00:03:30.630> smaller<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.260> just<00:03:31.820> makes

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
to make your pores smaller it just makes

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.970 
to make your pores smaller it just makes
them<00:03:32.910> look<00:03:33.030> smoother<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:34.320> really<00:03:34.470> does<00:03:34.680> it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
them look smoother and it really does it

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.830 
them look smoother and it really does it
really<00:03:35.190> likes<00:03:35.459> fills<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:36.060> some<00:03:36.299> pores<00:03:36.630> and

really likes fills in some pores and
stuff<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.680> consistency<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.370> very<00:03:38.459> like<00:03:38.790> I

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
stuff and the consistency is very like I

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.449

this foundation know this is the
lightest<00:04:04.630> shade<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.110> it's<00:04:05.230> not<00:04:05.470> like<00:04:05.680> that

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710

dark as you can see on my arm but it
blends<00:04:09.580> in<00:04:09.730> very<00:04:09.790> nicely<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.600> when<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.750> applied

coverage<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.210> don't<00:04:13.420> want<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:13.990> and<00:04:14.230> I

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
coverage and I don't want that and I

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.900 
coverage and I don't want that and I
don't<00:04:14.500> like<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.890> on<00:04:14.950> my<00:04:15.100> face<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:15.550> I<00:04:15.580> like<00:04:15.790> it

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
don't like it on my face so I like it

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.479 
don't like it on my face so I like it
apply<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.210> with<00:04:16.300> a<00:04:16.360> brush<00:04:16.650> but<00:04:17.650> if<00:04:17.770> you<00:04:17.890> can<00:04:18.190> get

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
apply it with a brush but if you can get

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.210 
apply it with a brush but if you can get
your<00:04:18.670> hands<00:04:18.790> on<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.680> even<00:04:20.680> if<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.040> get<00:04:21.160> a

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
your hands on this and even if you get a

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.950 
your hands on this and even if you get a
sent<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.640> you<00:04:21.760> in<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.090> US<00:04:22.330> or<00:04:22.510> something<00:04:22.900> I

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
sent to you in the US or something I

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.380 
sent to you in the US or something I
really<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.590> try<00:04:23.860> this<00:04:23.920> but<00:04:24.880> it<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.150> little

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
really just try this but it is a little

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.150 
really just try this but it is a little
bit<00:04:25.600> smaller<00:04:25.930> than<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.320> regular<00:04:26.770> foundation

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
bit smaller than a regular foundation

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.130 
bit smaller than a regular foundation
because<00:04:27.700> regulation<00:04:28.600> is<00:04:28.720> an<00:04:29.500> ounce<00:04:29.740> or<00:04:31.140> 30

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
because regulation is an ounce or 30

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.820 
because regulation is an ounce or 30
milliliters<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:32.920> this<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.430> 20<00:04:33.730> milliliters

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
milliliters and this is 20 milliliters

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.880 
milliliters and this is 20 milliliters
so<00:04:35.830> it's<00:04:36.040> like<00:04:36.930> point<00:04:37.930> six<00:04:38.260> ounces<00:04:38.680> or

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
so it's like point six ounces or

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.340 
so it's like point six ounces or
something<00:04:39.220> probably<00:04:39.990> sliced<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.050> little<00:04:41.260> bit

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
something probably sliced a little bit

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.080 
something probably sliced a little bit
smaller<00:04:41.620> but<00:04:41.950> do<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.100> use<00:04:42.280> only<00:04:42.490> clean<00:04:42.970> the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
smaller but do you use only clean the

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.000 
smaller but do you use only clean the
kind<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.420> it<00:04:43.540> because<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:43.960> have<00:04:44.260> nearly<00:04:44.710> not

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
kind of it because I have nearly not

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.200 
kind of it because I have nearly not
used<00:04:45.280> anything<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.920> so<00:04:47.920> last<00:04:48.850> long

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
used anything of this and so last long

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.040

while<00:04:49.420> so<00:04:49.930> yeah<00:04:50.340> thanks<00:04:51.340> for<00:04:51.490> watching<00:04:51.790> guys
