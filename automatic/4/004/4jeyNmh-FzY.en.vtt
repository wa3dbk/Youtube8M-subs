00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
the Seekers he has a neck extension in a

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.550 
the Seekers he has a neck extension in a
circus<00:03:43.989> he<00:03:44.530> would<00:03:44.769> be<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:46.660> tall<00:03:46.989> man<00:03:47.230> that

circus he would be the tall man that
gene<00:03:47.799> would<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.250> really<00:03:49.060> tall<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:53.350> let's<00:03:53.500> pop

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
gene would that really tall so let's pop

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.300 

so<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.049> pretty<00:04:04.230> cool<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.590> have<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.829> chase<00:04:05.129> that
