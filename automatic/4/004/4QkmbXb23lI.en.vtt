00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.290 
expect from looking at the packaging so
there's<00:02:06.800> those<00:02:08.679> then<00:02:09.679> we<00:02:09.890> have<00:02:10.300> pink

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.710 
flamingos
you<00:02:14.870> see<00:02:15.130> pink<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:16.310> Mingo<00:02:16.700> was<00:02:16.910> almost<00:02:17.240> it's

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
you see pink so Mingo was almost it's

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.160 
you see pink so Mingo was almost it's
like<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.470> guess<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.070> watermelon<00:02:19.520> cherry<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.510> to

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
like I guess a watermelon cherry but to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.530 
like I guess a watermelon cherry but to
me<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.500> always<00:02:21.680> tasted<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> lemonade<00:02:22.730> but

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
me it always tasted like a lemonade but

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.820 
me it always tasted like a lemonade but
I<00:02:23.600> guess<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.960> would<00:02:24.050> be<00:02:24.080> more<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.470> charcoal

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
I guess that would be more of a charcoal

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.760 
I guess that would be more of a charcoal

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
it it's delicious but I'm kind of shying

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.340

away<00:03:07.130> from<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.580> one<00:03:07.930> apparently<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.080> year

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
away from that one apparently this year

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.500 
away from that one apparently this year
though<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:10.190> addition<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.150> all<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.420> these

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
though in addition to all of these

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.490 
though in addition to all of these
flavors<00:03:12.160> which<00:03:13.160> are<00:03:13.340> old<00:03:14.090> new<00:03:14.540> or<00:03:14.870> retro<00:03:15.320> if

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
flavors which are old new or retro if

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.170 
flavors which are old new or retro if
you<00:03:15.590> want<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:15.830> call<00:03:15.980> them<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.130> they<00:03:16.970> also

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
you want to call them that they also

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.840 
you want to call them that they also
brought<00:03:17.480> back<00:03:17.540> charcoal<00:03:18.170> very<00:03:18.380> thin<00:03:18.710> now<00:03:19.700> that

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
brought back charcoal very thin now that

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.790 
brought back charcoal very thin now that
I<00:03:19.880> know<00:03:20.120> for<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> fact<00:03:20.750> kind<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.290> tasted<00:03:21.620> like<00:03:21.650> a

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
I know for a fact kind of tasted like a

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.330 
I know for a fact kind of tasted like a
lemonade<00:03:22.220> -<00:03:22.700> but<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.540> was<00:03:23.630> also<00:03:23.780> pink<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:25.310> I

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
lemonade - but it was also pink so I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.820 
lemonade - but it was also pink so I
guess<00:03:25.550> that's<00:03:25.820> why<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:27.200> one<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.560> harder

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
guess that's why it's one of the harder

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.650 
guess that's why it's one of the harder
flavors<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.400> find<00:03:28.670> since<00:03:29.090> they<00:03:29.240> have<00:03:29.390> pink

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
flavors to find since they have pink

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.340 
flavors to find since they have pink
flamingos<00:03:30.590> everywhere<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.930> yeah<00:03:33.080> when<00:03:33.320> I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
flamingos everywhere but yeah when I

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.710 
flamingos everywhere but yeah when I
bought<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.250> even<00:03:34.850> bought<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.090> freaking

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
bought this I even bought the freaking

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.020 
bought this I even bought the freaking
or<00:03:36.260> brought<00:03:36.530> home<00:03:36.710> one<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.130> display<00:03:37.460> boxes

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030

or brought home one of the display boxes
I<00:03:38.210> was<00:03:38.660> excited<00:03:39.170> about<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.650> especially

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
I was excited about this especially

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.830 
I was excited about this especially
since<00:03:40.520> you<00:03:41.030> know<00:03:41.060> see<00:03:41.300> you<00:03:41.420> got<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.690> purple

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
dinosaur there and no not Barney

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.949

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
thankfully but yeah

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.000 
thankfully but yeah
I<00:03:49.090> would<00:03:50.090> do<00:03:50.300> thing<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.870> know<00:03:50.959> where<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.470> pour

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
colors but I think you guys can gather

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.080 
colors but I think you guys can gather
pretty<00:03:56.360> much<00:03:56.570> how<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:57.140> goes<00:03:57.709> but<00:03:58.610> I'll<00:03:58.850> tell

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090

there yeah I think that about covers it
and<00:04:13.130> other<00:04:13.400> than<00:04:13.670> my<00:04:14.410> impression<00:04:15.410> of<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
and other than my impression of the
