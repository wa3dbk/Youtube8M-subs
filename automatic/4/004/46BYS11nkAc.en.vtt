00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
based on the Cape Verde core which is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.249 
based on the Cape Verde core which is
built<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.009> 28<00:01:23.640> nanometer<00:01:24.259> manufacturing

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
process and has 1.5 billion transistors
also<00:01:29.610> keep<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.909> mind<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.369> 7700<00:01:32.369> series

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
also keep in mind that the 7700 series

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.190 
also keep in mind that the 7700 series
