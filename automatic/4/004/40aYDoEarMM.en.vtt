00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.899 
the reason why i like to do in the free
section<00:03:38.079> is<00:03:38.709> because<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.099> lot<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.400> people<00:03:39.489> that

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
section is because a lot of people that

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.240 
section is because a lot of people that
create<00:03:40.239> that<00:03:40.269> faux<00:03:40.659> bob<00:03:40.959> feel<00:03:41.290> they<00:03:41.739> have<00:03:41.920> no

create that faux bob feel they have no

create that faux bob feel they have no
movement<00:03:42.879> to<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.690> if<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.079> have<00:03:44.290> layers

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
movement to it so if you have layers

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.949 
movement to it so if you have layers
anyone<00:03:45.190> movement<00:03:45.730> lift<00:03:46.030> or<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.480> third

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
anyone movement lift or the third

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.720 
anyone movement lift or the third
section<00:03:47.290> but<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.739> helps<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.430> give<00:03:48.579> it<00:03:48.700> that

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
section but it helps to give it that

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.699 
section but it helps to give it that
because<00:03:49.359> then<00:03:49.599> when<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.900> release<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.349> hair

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
because then when you release this hair

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.280 
because then when you release this hair
it<00:03:51.190> kind<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.489> flows<00:03:51.760> over<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.209> top<00:03:52.450> nicely<00:03:53.079> and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
it kind of flows over the top nicely and

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.470 
it kind of flows over the top nicely and
gives<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.560> more<00:03:53.709> movement<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:55.150> now<00:03:55.329> i'm<00:03:55.420> just

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
gives it more movement so now i'm just
