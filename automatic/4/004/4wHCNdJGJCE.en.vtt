you<00:00:00.179> know<00:00:00.329> one<00:00:00.690> thing<00:00:00.930> I'll<00:00:01.110> say<00:00:01.140> about<00:00:01.589> these

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
you know one thing I'll say about these

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.050 
you know one thing I'll say about these
voxels<00:00:03.680> which<00:00:04.680> will<00:00:05.009> probably<00:00:05.549> come<00:00:05.819> was<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
voxels which will probably come was a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.089 
voxels which will probably come was a
big<00:00:06.390> surprise<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.870> people<00:00:07.440> because<00:00:07.740> these<00:00:07.890> are

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
big surprise to people because these are

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.600 
big surprise to people because these are
obviously<00:00:08.700> our<00:00:08.790> budget<00:00:09.620> low-end<00:00:10.620> vehicle<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
obviously our budget low-end vehicle is

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.240 
obviously our budget low-end vehicle is
that<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.780> brakes<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.380> these<00:00:13.559> little<00:00:13.740> voxels

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
that the brakes on these little voxels

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.779 
that the brakes on these little voxels
are<00:00:14.340> absolutely<00:00:14.670> fantastic<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:17.220> brakes<00:00:17.520> on

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
are absolutely fantastic the brakes on

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.250 
are absolutely fantastic the brakes on
these<00:00:17.970> cars<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.350> work<00:00:19.710> well

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
these cars really do work well

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.310 
these cars really do work well
I<00:00:20.580> don't<00:00:21.580> quite<00:00:21.790> know<00:00:21.970> how<00:00:22.270> voxels<00:00:22.840> managed<00:00:23.170> to

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
I don't quite know how voxels managed to

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.109 
I don't quite know how voxels managed to
pull<00:00:23.530> that<00:00:23.710> off<00:00:23.920> with<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.430> brakes<00:00:24.670> on<00:00:24.880> this

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
pull that off with the brakes on this

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.750 
pull that off with the brakes on this
for<00:00:25.360> ten<00:00:25.540> times<00:00:25.780> better<00:00:25.990> with<00:00:26.290> your<00:00:26.500> five<00:00:26.760> on

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
for ten times better with your five on

other<00:00:31.900> car<00:00:32.110> I<00:00:32.140> can<00:00:32.439> think<00:00:32.590> of<00:00:32.800> who<00:00:33.130> has<00:00:33.430> brakes

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
other car I can think of who has brakes

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.680 
other car I can think of who has brakes
as<00:00:34.059> good<00:00:34.239> as<00:00:34.330> these<00:00:34.480> ones<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.040> Audi's<00:00:36.690> now

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690

steering components because this

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.580 
steering components because this
particular<00:01:32.890> vehicle<00:01:33.430> has<00:01:33.910> done<00:01:34.410> 85,000<00:01:35.410> miles

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
but the steering is quite responsive

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.370 
but the steering is quite responsive
there<00:01:39.850> is<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.030> bit<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.480> bounce<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.110> car

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
there is a bit of a bounce in the car

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.330 
there is a bit of a bounce in the car
which<00:01:41.680> i<00:01:41.830> think<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.900> too<00:01:43.900> softer<00:01:44.410> shops<00:01:44.650> shops

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
which i think is too softer shops shops

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.950 
which i think is too softer shops shops
I<00:01:45.520> think<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.760> shocks<00:01:46.000> could<00:01:46.180> be<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> bit<00:01:46.600> firmer

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
I think the shocks could be a bit firmer

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.080 
I think the shocks could be a bit firmer
of<00:01:47.380> course<00:01:47.650> this<00:01:47.830> isn't<00:01:47.980> a<00:01:48.100> sports<00:01:48.400> model<00:01:48.850> but

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
of course this isn't a sports model but

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.880 
of course this isn't a sports model but
they<00:01:49.930> are<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.140> bit<00:01:50.290> soft

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
they are a bit soft

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.400 
they are a bit soft

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.560

you<00:01:57.460> need<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.700> be<00:01:57.910> able<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.120> handle<00:01:58.420> the
