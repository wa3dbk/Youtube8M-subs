00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.600
 Hi everybody! Today I tell you everything about how I take care of my skin. 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.020
 I have very difficult skin to take care of, because I suffer from acne, but I also have dry skin in some places. 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.280
 I have seven products that I really can't live without, so let's get started! 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.520
 First I want to talk about what I remove my makeup with, and I do that with a milk cleaner 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.480
 And this one is from Maquillage Pro Paris, and it's called Lait DÃ©maquilant. 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.420
 It smells very nice, and it also removes the powerful makeup such as waterproof mascara. That's why I use this. 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.460
 After I remove my makeup, I clean my face and I do that with the Clarasonic Mia 2 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.620
 This is the pink and also the mini version. 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.300
 It is actually an automatic brush that, when turned on, moves around against your skin. 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:52.800
 It exfoliates all dead skin cells from your face, and removes any remaining makeup that was left on your face. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.720
 So it cleans thoroughly, and I like that about it. 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.000
 But the Mia is not for everyone. I also heard stories about people whose faces just went backwards. 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.420
 I only have positive experiences, and my face only improved. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.980
 I use the Clarasonic in combination with the Clinique Liquid Facial Soap, for combination / oily to oily skin. 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.680
 This is the first step in the Clinique step-by-step plan, which I use. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.340
 If you do not know what the Clinique 3-step plan is, it is a cleanser, toner and cream, made especially for your skin type. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.880
 There are four skin types. I'm number three, I don't know exactly what the others are, but if you have oily skin, number 3 is perfect for you. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.040
 And this works well if you have pimples, or dry spots on your face. 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.680
 I like this because it contains aloe vera leaf juice, which is good for healing pimples or scars. 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.320
 On the other hand, it also contains sodium benzoate, which is irritating to the skin. Some suffer more from this than others. 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.314
 I personally only have positive experiences with this product. 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.360
 After cleaning, I use a toner, and I use the Clinique Clarifying Lotion. This is step three in the step-by-step plan. 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 I'm not going to lie people, it dries out your skin. For some it is worse than others, but some had to accutane themselves through this. 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.240
 So I recommend that you first try the trial version before you buy a whole bottle. 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.120
 But even though it dries out skin, I still like it because it works together with the other products from the step-by-step plan. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.740
 So also the cream, and the cream ensures that all lost moisture and vitamins are brought back to your face. 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:37.520
 So I think it's great how these products work together, to give my skin a beautiful .. skin. If you know what I mean. 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.000
 Another plus to this product is that it contains witch hazel. Witch hazel reduced swelling under the eyes, reduced wrinkles 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.140
 and this is also caring for acne or pimples. 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.920
 The following product is my favorite product, and it is the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.520
 A gel is not as thick as a cream, I like this the most, because when I use a thick cream it feels like I get an even greasier skin. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.300
 It also smells really nice, and that is because it contains cucumber extract. 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.020
 It's not that your whole face starts to smell like cucumber, no worries, but it gives a nice exotic, fruity scent. 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.620
 It also contains a little caffeine. Caffeine is good for reducing swelling under your eyes, and it is also an antioxidant. 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.400
 So drink that coffee! (Or tea!) 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.360
 The following product was given to me by my dermatologist for pimples, and it is called eryacne. 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.780
 I apply this to my pimples every day (my entire face). 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:45.860
 And what it does is it kills the bacteria in your pores. So it does not address your blackheads, but prevents your blackheads from turning into pimples. 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.860
 So this ensures that you do not get pimples. 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.280
 Then I use an eye cream to prevent wrinkles. This is the Neutragenic Smoothing Eye Cream from the Body Shop. 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.360
 This contains babassu oil, which revitalizes your skin. It also tackles small wrinkles around your eyes. 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.280
 It also contains red grape extract, which improves the texture of the skin, and gives it a nice scent. 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:14.500
 On the other hand, it also contains alcohol and other artificial ingredients, but I think it's a good product, and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.040
 It feels good, and it smells nice, top product. 

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:23.394
 And finally I apply a lip balm. This is the Nivea Lipbutter in Vanilla and Macademia. 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.160
 Do you know how Belgian chocolate tastes? This tastes good! 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.900
 So I use this for my lips, this was the last product. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.180
 This is how I care for my skin, I hope it helped you. Maybe there is something in between that you want to try. 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.400
 The Clinique set comes in a try set, which I bought, to see if I liked it, and I thought it was great. 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.860
 And then I see you in the following video. Bye! KISSS MUSHAAAAAAH XXXXX
