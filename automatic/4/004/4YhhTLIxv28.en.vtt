coming off of that 207 GBS - and a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.910 
coming off of that 207 GBS - and a
solace<00:02:16.400> Farrah<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.910> gonna<00:02:17.120> have<00:02:17.360> different

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
solace Farrah is gonna have different

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.070 
solace Farrah is gonna have different
different<00:02:18.920> fire<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.730> sparkle<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.420> begin<00:02:20.810> with

differences<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.920> your<00:02:25.160> fire<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.610> sparkle

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
differences now in your fire and sparkle

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.860 
differences now in your fire and sparkle

but the thing that we want to point out
the<00:02:29.870> brilliant<00:02:30.440> scope<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:31.400> not<00:02:32.860> communicating

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
the brilliant scope is not communicating

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.320 
the brilliant scope is not communicating
meaningfully

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.320 

the<00:02:37.720> superiority<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.340> fire<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.849> sparkle

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
the superiority of the fire and sparkle

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.830 
the superiority of the fire and sparkle
of<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.660> 230<00:02:41.489> okay<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:42.970> here<00:02:43.150> we<00:02:43.270> are<00:02:43.300> looking

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
of this 230 okay but here we are looking

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.699 
of this 230 okay but here we are looking
at<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:45.480> spotlighting<00:02:46.480> okay<00:02:47.319> so<00:02:47.380> even
