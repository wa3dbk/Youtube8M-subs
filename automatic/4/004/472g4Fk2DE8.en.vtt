00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.020
 This year is a year that we are 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.110
 posting much on the national kick in the 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.719
 publisher today she makes two birthday 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.920
 years of home in it was created two 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.750
 years ago 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.720
 officially before already did much 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.310
 market research and it is new that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.960
 year will also be a major investment 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.300
 in the national hospital a lot of people are 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.450
 launching now that it's fantastic with two 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.930
 books neca guards of the dudu hawk and 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.760
 the garibaldi Andrew month already 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.239
 there will be another national book that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.219
 would be 10 love songs from paulo 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.530
 week already out the second book in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.989
 christine nerds or by your eyes 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 the second in November will leave the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.129
 third book of Christine that we 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 we will launch the biennial of cearÃ¡ and 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.570
 The end of the year I think it's still going to leave 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.489
 but the two nationals besides those 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.839
 International being expected 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.280
 There is a time we will give. 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.499
 continuity in the wise 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.909
 in fact the book is international gives a 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.610
 little more work because of the 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.950
 part of the translation of the book in 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.980
 Portuguese is ready, you just need 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.810
 a review and everything then is the time of 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.680
 gestation of the book outside is a bit 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.720
 bigger 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.650
 really for that reason i believe 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.050
 that in the future this comes the footprint of 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.970
 part of the market, and reading ends 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.830
 transforming into something same day of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.260
 take under your arm and put a thousand 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.610
 books inside your device you go 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.620
 Wherever you want with your neighbors. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.480
 carrying a suitcase and has the issue 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.490
 of practicality I think it's Brazil yet 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.930
 have to get used to the idea I think 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.120
 which is such a little thing more than 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.860
 kind of medium to long term we will 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.620
 end up adopting this idea really 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.990
 is working is edited selling 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.880
 the books also in this format and the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.130
 reader will get used to it because 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.140
 voter who has not yet down his foot 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.710
 is the little book there that attacked by taking the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.930
 book does not have a blog that is called a scent 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.850
 because it is really a culture 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.220
 it is with the material at hand it was 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.450
 walking but I think in the very middle future 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.440
 in the long run this will end if 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 inverting 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.899
 each publisher has a way of seeing the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.989
 self-published author 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.799
 some think it burns the movie because 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.110
 he already showed the one that came if it sold 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.720
 if you have not sold everyone you know if the 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.400
 she will try to leave or not the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.379
 suddenly there is a fear with part of the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.970
 editor is looking to work with a 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.700
 a work that has already been launched 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.379
 Mota is another on-demand publisher. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.609
 there is some fear at least of the 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.980
 part of me that gets people thinking 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.859
 Has the book already sold out? 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.349
 possibility to sell you as a person 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.049
 said he will open 600 copies will he 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.329
 will have 600 more people wanting to read 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.120
 this book his audience has run out 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.400
 there it 's something we talk about 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.069
 much about it inside that is from 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.129
 author is to know what he is 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:59.239
 wanting nfsl posted or if he wants 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.069
 have a publisher who embraces his idea 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.829
 and launches the book from the beginning 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.680
 finally changing the book market by making the 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.739
 most attractive book is not selling 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.099
 depends on each publisher I already 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.470
 I'd rather get the raw book and work 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.470
 with the book Create an image Create the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.359
 our create frame cover choose 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.699
 Who are the partners for anyway? 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.290
 work of the book not only germinate 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.599
 get that product ready and suddenly 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.239
 Already sold what had to have 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.069
 sold and I will not add anything in the 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.569
 because it has already been released 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.669
 cried, say so 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.099
 So it depends a lot on the publisher I 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.560
 I prefer to follow the product from the 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.400
 beginning until the book is released and 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.400
 distributed in bookstores
