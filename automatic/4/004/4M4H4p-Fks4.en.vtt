00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.259
 fender you all varnishes and i will show how 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.400
 do this 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:16.190
 Of course I thought up but itâ€™s not very good 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.270
 important how to make ice and snow 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.619
 proceed to view 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.390
 that we need such a detail 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:32.840
 Such a need is still such a detail 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:36.870
 Such kranchik 2 such details still 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:47.370
 we will need this 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:51.059
 such a dredging will still need two 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 such still need such 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:03.470
 square 1 by 4 and we will need these 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:07.500
 two medals like this 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:15.500
 back just can not need such 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:22.009
 squares such details 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:27.650
 need such a platform 8 by 2 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:29.329
 but I'll show you later as the details 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.540
 proceed to build 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:38.750
 first take 2 by 8 platforms and mino 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.750
 so here is this detail 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.420
 for days like this the next one 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420
 part 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:13.600
 cast separately it turns out this 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:20.950
 metallica in place this one 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:23.280
 and there in such a way that these two 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:35.110
 were outside 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:39.330
 then so that when notching 4 so that you can 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:44.459
 was to land a man but the next step 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.459
 next we take two such parts and 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:03:08.800
 we attach this here 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:14.709
 it turns out and the next step is a million 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:19.000
 guitar here about and connect such 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:28.440
 two can be any color and more of course 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.440
 it would have been green and the number was come on 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:04:25.800
 but we get here so then here 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:32.240
 such things and yet still delivered but 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.240
 some plates set and the next step 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.840
 We think this is the engine 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.940
 next step 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:56.280
 such a course would be better if she were 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:05:04.530
 red color we have such a design 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:08.580
 gets us something else we need here 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:13.950
 put these things here that this is 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.810
 the right to fight then add to these 1 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.440
 such a 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.860
 yes such a platform and your 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:27.060
 Spitak is ready then right now I'll show you how 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:33.960
 little man like this 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:37.530
 little man and he even can not just 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:44.130
 playing about a film is simply more convenient 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:47.280
 it is more convenient to do and my sputum 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.220
 do because if you buy something and 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.889
 star wars mail 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.530
 you can say you will not find that of course and 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:00.060
 not so small sets with alcohols 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:05.880
 but they cost about 5 500 rubles 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:08.490
 but of course at least not very similar 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.850
 The main thing in this plus the fact that they are looking for these two 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:16.919
 pieces so for the movie she use 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:19.610
 it will be convenient and 100 platform and 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.610
 a cartoon 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:36.840
 took a frame about made a frame move 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:39.060
 did the frame I want to show you about 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:59.030
 tag which participated from aids 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:59.030
 look cool aids 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.130
 but 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:34.419
