of the best pieces I've ever done and
I've<00:01:27.509> often<00:01:28.350> said<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.710> people<00:01:28.799> when<00:01:29.659> I've<00:01:30.659> been

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
I've often said to people when I've been

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.699

asked<00:01:31.139> that<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.859> I<00:01:32.549> should<00:01:32.789> only<00:01:32.969> sing<00:01:33.560> one<00:01:34.560> or

Harris<00:02:04.380> war<00:02:04.679> and<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.759> are<00:02:05.849> quite<00:02:06.270> new<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
Harris war and they are quite new that

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.450 
Harris war and they are quite new that
we<00:02:07.409> did<00:02:07.560> two<00:02:07.770> years<00:02:07.799> ago

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.890 
we did two years ago
first<00:02:08.700> time<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.120> think<00:02:09.240> that's<00:02:09.540> why<00:02:09.750> they

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
first time so I think that's why they

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.170 
first time so I think that's why they
picked<00:02:10.130> those<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.370> there<00:02:11.670> are<00:02:11.760> never<00:02:11.970> been

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
picked those so there are never been

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.290 
picked those so there are never been
heard<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.190> something<00:02:14.190> bit<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
heard here and something bit at the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.200 
heard here and something bit at the
novelty<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.890> audience<00:02:17.190> now<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.640> Lodi
