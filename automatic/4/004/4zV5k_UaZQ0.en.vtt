you pen testing on Windows Server 2003
Windows<00:00:04.490> Server<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.910> most<00:00:06.240> widely<00:00:06.839> used

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870

vulnerability<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.300> let's<00:00:24.750> start<00:00:25.170> first<00:00:25.619> of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
vulnerability so let's start first of

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.070 
vulnerability so let's start first of
all<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:26.039> need<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> start<00:00:26.430> our<00:00:26.849> MSF<00:00:27.359> console<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
all we need to start our MSF console I

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.209 
all we need to start our MSF console I
already<00:00:28.619> started<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:30.830> now<00:00:31.830> check

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
already started here now check

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.600 
already started here now check
connectivity<00:00:32.640> using<00:00:33.469> BB<00:00:34.469> underscore<00:00:35.190> status

connectivity using BB underscore status

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.139 
connectivity using BB underscore status
and<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:37.440> connected<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> PostgreSQL<00:00:38.820> server

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
and it's connected to PostgreSQL server

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.459 
and it's connected to PostgreSQL server
first<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.590> need<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.920> search<00:00:41.450> exploit

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
first of all we need to search exploit

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:51.020 
first of all we need to search exploit
so<00:00:44.090> search<00:00:45.140> net<00:00:46.280> API<00:00:48.680> we<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
so search net API we can see here is the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.830 
so search net API we can see here is the
many<00:00:51.449> exploits<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.969> there<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.149> two<00:00:54.420> great

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
many exploits and there are two great

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.250 
many exploits and there are two great
exploits<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.520> exploit<00:00:57.180> windows<00:00:57.600> SMB
