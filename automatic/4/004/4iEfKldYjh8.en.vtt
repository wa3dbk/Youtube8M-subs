00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.600
 for my friends as they are today we are going to 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.670
 talk about a little bit of acne 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.340
 acne happens because there is a 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.290
 overproduction of grease on the face 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.110
 then the pores like that 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.570
 they congest and the granite comes out the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.960
 black dot comes out that black white thingy 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.000
 frightful yellow that we do not like and 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.160
 usually this happens with people 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.770
 that have good fatty skin 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.890
 news is that people who have 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.320
 long fat in the skin and will 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.750
 have fewer wrinkles than people who 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.900
 have a dry or more balanced complexion 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.839
 because it is a natural moisturizer the worst 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.100
 of what you can do is dry 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.640
 completely your skin there are girls of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.920
 guys that with this desire that they do not 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.519
 they leave good grains almost almost dry 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.019
 the whole face and this is even worse 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.449
 I have a video that I would like me to 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.239
 they would say that it is a good old man who 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.670
 call care for fatty skin that here 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.440
 I explain how to treat a complexion that 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.940
 tends to be of the bear I would love 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.940
 that they saw it and we are going to be speaking 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.280
 many options in this channel for 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.810
 that you can balance that fatty skin 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.820
 of course if you already 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.820
 your acne is abrasive is something but of 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.470
 truth that draws a lot of attention 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.659
 beads too big too 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.149
 constant is something that is deforming you 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.310
 your face do not hesitate to consult a 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.630
 I want to speak to the professionals 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.119
 people who have oily skin 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.830
 jojoba oil many people I 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.530
 Valencian to make like coconut oil 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.229
 basile I have the oily skin the oil of 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.689
 Jojoba is so similar to natural bait 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.509
 of the skin that does as a trick what 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.840
 touch and tell the skin no longer produce 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.110
 more fat we have enough time 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.209
 produces the opposite effect we stop 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.250
 produce so much fat and those outbreaks of 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.580
 blackheads acne and pimples all 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.920
 those things begin to diminish for 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.590
 the people who have dry skin at 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.890
 otherwise it gives us that fat 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.870
 we need and balance the ph of the skin 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.670
 I'm going to recommend an exfoliant 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.200
 I'm using it right now in my 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.819
 teenager who is entering the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.860
 adolescence and adeca that comes from 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.010
 suddenly with his nose full of little things 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.990
 and it has worked for me of clear marvel 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.720
 that to be able is going to be the same almost 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.850
 I beg of you and please do not I do not want 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.860
 as they say in the blacksmith's house good not 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.570
 I know how he sees that bug but something like that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.050
 to see if you remind me how it goes 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.000
 that said because they are not left next 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.830
 all day with the molcajete and not 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.510
 come 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.820
 but good lately we've been 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.010
 doing and these pimples about things 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.730
 which are the little ones that are all 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:03.040
 in the forehead they are disappearing 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:05.840
 excellent what they will need is more 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.480
 this the ideal important and the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.569
 ingredients that is 100% oil 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.450
 jojoba and we're going to need baking 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.220
 of sodium I already have it my cap and I 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.769
 I said I brought and cooked it here at 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.379
 bathroom because I use all these wonders and 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.510
 the only thing that they are going to do to me to see what 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:27.850
 simple to put a little bit of 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:32.230
 baking soda a few droplets 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.410
 of jojoba oil are going to stir 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.260
 they are going to do an exfoliation in all their 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.050
 face if they have in the nose in the nose 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.790
 if they have in the forehead on the forehead and what 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.400
 they are going to let act at least 10 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.250
 minutes and then they go to bathe the cute 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.260
 of this is that the skin is going to touch and 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.360
 will be jealous because that dryness 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.850
 little guys do not tell me they 're 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.940
 doing putting gels drying the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.400
 skin that they think happens happens more 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.250
 great because then the skin says today 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.500
 they are drying me we are going to produce more 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.320
 fat and they start producing more more more 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.540
 fat plus grains you get more 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.760
 drying treatments and the result 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.760
 it's being negative 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.819
 let's see the following recipe that does not 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.250
 will only help us avoid 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.800
 control acne also with this 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.740
 recipe what we are going to do is eliminate 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.400
 and start lowering the spots 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.770
 caused by him we're going to see her for this 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.120
 recipe we are going to need 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.580
 rice and lemons now the lemons in 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.440
 some countries there is a difference and a 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.889
 lemon yellow and this is lemon 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.250
 sour green preferably be this 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.860
 sour green that is the same as the line in 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.229
 but if you can not find it you can use 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.810
 how important the night is 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:03.000
 previous leave about three 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:06.840
 Spoons of rice soaking in water 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.780
 to soften it and start this recipe 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.060
 let's put in a blender all the 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.550
 rice that is not a lot of water because if it is 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.449
 a lot of water can be very liquid and what 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.110
 we will liquefy 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:24.629
 Now let's put this mixture in a 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.550
 little plate remember not to put too much 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.279
 water because if it is not going to come out as 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.279
 watery has to come out we believe milestone as 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:35.659
 this is already this mixture we are going to squeeze 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.659
 a lemon 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.830
 to stir and our anti mask 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.800
 acne and pimples 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.590
 antich black points is ready to 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.100
 use having my mixture already prepared 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.170
 let's take a little bit and we're going to 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.900
 put for example if I here have my 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.600
 little spot and my acne I'll put it here 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.720
 You can also use it as a mask in 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.540
 the whole face to create a feeling 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.420
 even that is going to level everything 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.030
 the color for the lemon and for the rice in 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.760
 whitening and apart a control of 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.960
 sebum on the skin nothing else this mask 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.020
 that you are going to keep in the 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.020
 fridge 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.960
 I would like you to do it twice 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.819
 the week and of course when we are 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.430
 using the lemon we have to do it in 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.619
 night and in the morning use protector 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.509
 solar also I invite you to see my 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:35.639
 video of sunscreens because 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.860
 It is very important to know what 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.210
