00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.190
 [music] 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.590
 hello in touch Ekimov igor in this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.560
 video tutorial we will learn the optimal 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.699
 location of switches and sockets and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.230
 what 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.750
 euro level location of sockets and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.470
 switches can tell you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.559
 the designer while he offers a scheme 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.450
 the location of sockets and switches with 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.579
 binding to the walls of the floor and ceiling 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.309
 location can also prompt you 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.660
 an electrician who will have you do 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.940
 electrician based on my personal experience 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.149
 but best when the location 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.260
 switches and sockets you define 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.190
 they themselves bombed there live they electrician or 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 to the designer 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.519
 if you do yourself 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.610
 electrician then for you it is more 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.950
 up to date as a consultation 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.860
 an electrician or designer costs money 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.159
 switches are installed on European standard 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.000
 height of 90 centimeters at the same time 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.530
 The guide is the middle of the switch. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 also an amendment to the height of the hall 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.689
 if the floor is not filled, then this is an amendment 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.280
 is 1 2 centimeters if the same floor 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.430
 who will flood better 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.130
 part of the switches and sockets after 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.460
 how will the floor be flooded 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.610
 at the same time height of 90 centimeters is not 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.400
 is a panacea for someone can 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.170
 location will be more convenient 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:03.310
 switch at a height of 80 centimeters 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.729
 someone at a height of 1 meter of this depends on the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.780
 of how tall people live in 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.100
 this apartment is determined by this 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.410
 at what height is the switch better 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.290
 arrange to be comfortable 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.190
 switch off with the lowered hand from the edge 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.280
 the doorway recedes 10 15 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.550
 centimeters and to the edge they are up 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.940
 mean of the outlet with it must be considered 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.930
 that the casing takes from three to five 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.310
 centimeters with a distance of 10 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.060
 centimeters we have a switch looks like 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.600
 pressed against the door 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.930
 if this distance is 15 centimeters 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.540
 then the switch looks more free 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.130
 but at the same time he is selecting a part 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.310
 wall space 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.660
 if the switch turn out close 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:06.520
 the middle of the wall then it centers it 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.980
 relative to the middle of the wall 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.550
 European standard sockets are placed on 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.840
 30 meters high relative to the middle 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:21.590
 sockets also need to be corrected for 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.130
 floor height strictly attached to this 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.310
 not sure if I have a day of projects and 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.890
 20 centimeters from the floor you are 40 centimeters 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.780
 from the floor 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.210
 sockets should be high enough 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.170
 there was no spray under them 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.920
 when the floor is washed and so that the animals do not 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.580
 tagged 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.060
 and they should be low enough here 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.140
 Do not throw eyes also do not do 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.940
 and sockets 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.740
 below 15 centimeters from 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.720
 perpendicular wall as they are when 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.210
 this look pressed against the wall 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.990
