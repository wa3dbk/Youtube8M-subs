00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.490
 Hi, I'm Alejandra Coghlan and you're in my 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.010
 house that is your house we continue with the 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.950
 healthy recipes and good because not with 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.889
 the little fish that is the season right now 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.000
 of fish and then I'll show you what 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.090
 what are we going to do 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.730
 we will make a tilapia fillet 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.040
 I already have this well washed well 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 clean how nice it is a very meat 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.359
 firm 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.600
 and we will accompany it with tomato 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.730
 onion and some bay leaves 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 then first things first thing what 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 first thing we're going to do is put the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.930
 background of the paper either is that to me 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.050
 He does really like a leaf paper 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 of laurel later we are going to put a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.050
 couple of onion slices good 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.260
 I think more three and this is so that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 at the bottom it has very good flavor and then 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.780
 at the top we're going to put your 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.600
 onion you already know that this method I what 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.110
 I use it very much, I love it because 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.450
 it makes super super fast no you're not like 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.920
 that with the complication of the thousand 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.440
 Sauces is not a very simple thing and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.190
 we are going to make him equal 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.710
 laurel leaf up here and then for 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.710
 what not a little olive oil 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.180
 a few drops of lemon 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.740
 a little bit of salt 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.460
 a little pepper 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.010
 and we are already wrapping it like always 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.490
 as a gift some friends have 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.550

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.890
 you put in the oven are absolutely right 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.420
 friends if they are going to do it for the family 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:06.200
 I recommend that you put it in the oven 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.899
 about 20 minutes to about 190 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.989
 degrees if nothing else you will do to 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.110
 You can put it in a skillet 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.940
 you are giving it back then in this in 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.470
 this occasion we will accompany you with 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.040
 some vegetables that are roasted pumpkins 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.840

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.180
