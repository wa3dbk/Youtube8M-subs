00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.920 

again<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.410> monocle<00:02:50.310> wig<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:51.300> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
again this is the monocle wig and I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.509 
again this is the monocle wig and I
think<00:02:52.170> I'm<00:02:52.260> gonna<00:02:52.349> assume<00:02:52.709> more<00:02:52.890> colors<00:02:53.310> in

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
think I'm gonna assume more colors in

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.210 
think I'm gonna assume more colors in
this<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.910> I'm<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.209> I'm<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.720> spray<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:56.190> i

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
this and I'm like I'm I spray it but i

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.979 
this and I'm like I'm I spray it but i
think<00:02:56.550> i<00:02:56.670> would<00:02:56.730> rather<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.480> already<00:02:57.629> in

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
think i would rather have it already in

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.830 
think i would rather have it already in
some<00:02:58.290> colors<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.920> then<00:02:59.069> have<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.849> basic<00:03:00.360> one<00:03:00.569> be
