00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
would have been a lot easier if I just

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.640

hope the Patriots when I want it to be a

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.430 
hope the Patriots when I want it to be a
good<00:06:00.030> game<00:06:00.210> hopefully<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:00.810> lot<00:06:01.139> of<00:06:01.320> these

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
good game hopefully a lot of these

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.620

cleanups<00:06:02.009> payout<00:06:02.400> you<00:06:02.699> know<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.270> not<00:06:03.419> for

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
cleanups payout you know and not for

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.990 
cleanups payout you know and not for
just<00:06:03.810> me<00:06:03.990> because<00:06:04.169> I<00:06:04.440> know<00:06:04.500> there's<00:06:04.919> a<00:06:05.159> ton<00:06:05.970> of

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
just me because I know there's a ton of

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.540 
just me because I know there's a ton of
these<00:06:06.419> and<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:07.380> mean<00:06:07.590> a<00:06:07.740> ton<00:06:08.009> of<00:06:08.070> them<00:06:08.370> that<00:06:08.520> I

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
these and I mean a ton of them that I

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.719 
these and I mean a ton of them that I
don't<00:06:08.880> even<00:06:09.030> have

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
don't even have

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.879 
don't even have
so<00:06:09.819> I<00:06:10.089> think<00:06:10.539> a<00:06:10.809> lot<00:06:10.990> of<00:06:11.020> people<00:06:11.139> have<00:06:11.589> probably

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
so I think a lot of people have probably

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.129 
so I think a lot of people have probably
played<00:06:12.279> it<00:06:12.550> smart<00:06:12.699> and<00:06:13.089> picked<00:06:13.659> up<00:06:13.809> the<00:06:13.839> ones

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
played it smart and picked up the ones

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:15.899 
played it smart and picked up the ones
that<00:06:14.349> will<00:06:14.499> more<00:06:14.680> than<00:06:14.860> likely<00:06:14.919> end<00:06:15.430> up<00:06:15.580> being

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
that will more than likely end up being

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.149 
that will more than likely end up being
paid<00:06:16.180> out<00:06:16.349> working<00:06:17.349> some<00:06:17.529> trades<00:06:17.800> and<00:06:18.009> what

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159
