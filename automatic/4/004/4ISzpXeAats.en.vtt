00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.480
 hello friends in this tutorial 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.120
 we will learn to make this pretty 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.160
 snake made with clean pipes that we 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.170
 used to decorate pencils 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.550
 our children well let's go to 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.699
 start 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.070
 to make it we will need two clean 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.800
 pipes to do what is the body 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.329
 we are going to occupy a little piece of green 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.239
 another green to do what is this 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.000
 part of the tail and a bit of 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.489
 red color to make your tongue like that 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.620
 as two movable eyes that they will carry in 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.700
 this part and well then let's start 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.400
 to do it 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.170
 I chose to do the combination so in 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.910
 place of two clean pipes because they would be 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.460
 four for the combination of 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.400
 good colors let's start first to 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.760
 do what is this part the part of 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.750
 today we are going to start first making a 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.750
 small circle 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.850
 of this size to form what will be 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.850
 his first eye 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:14.119
 then we are going to do the same thing about this 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.119
 side let's make a slight fold like that 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.990
 and well look, we will be well trained 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.970
 the like the two sticks where will they go 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.520
 his eyes 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.510
 now we are just going to turn the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.510
 so that it stays together 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.970
 so we are staying like this 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.900
 now the next thing is let's make a 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.580
 petal 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.210
 much like that 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.120
 about two centimeters to form what 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.730
 It will be your 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.730
 his mouth from this top part 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.000
 and again we are going to cross our 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.800
 clean pipes through the middle of what they are 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.800
 the eyes so that it stays together 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.510
 and well look like this and we are staying 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.510
 now again we are going to make another 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.020
 petal to form the bottom part of 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.020
 its mouth 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.170
 well and we go again 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.260
 to turn around here in the middle of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.260
 eyes 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.120
 and we went through here in the middle 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.390
 we cross through the middle of the mouth to 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.690
 that is united and is well fixed this 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.690
 part 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.730
 and we go to the middle 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.510
 now if we close what is the little mouth 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.730
 of the snake 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.080
 and look, we will have stayed what it is 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.080
 head 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.180
 nothing else now let's grab the one 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.180
 the appointment of clean pipes red 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.710
 we are going to bend the tip and we are going to 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.030
 start making it a circle 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.030
 to form the tongue 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.459
 and well, here we are going to bend a 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.959
 little bit so it's like a little hook and 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.959
 you can grab this part 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.890
 we can put it like that, nothing else or the 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.890
 We can fix with a little bit of silicone 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.750
 to make it easier for you and then 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.750
 best 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.440
 Well look and that's what is left 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.330
 is the top part 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.120
 now with this clean of pipes what 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.670
 let's do is let's take our 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.049
 pencil from where we're going to put our 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:24.389
 snake and let's go let's leave him 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.030
 more or less this part to make it what 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.699
 which it is the tail and let's start 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.120
 roll up so that the body of 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.120
 the viper 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.800
 and we take it out right now to continue 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.740
 forming our bible 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.750
 Well, this part has been left so 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 nothing else what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.740
 roll it here 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.770
 this part we are going to give it back here and 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.770
 this is going to roll 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.480
 and this part that we have left over we cut it 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.760
 now with little glue or silicone or 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.760
 let's put the little eyes 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.010
 and look how pretty it has been almost 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.810
 finished our snake now nothing 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.330
 the detail is missing, to put what 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.300
 it would be like the rattle milestone with another 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.120
 different color here I put another one 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.610
 different green so that it looks more and 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.729
 highlight 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.729
 nothing else is like that and the rest we cut 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.320
 we bend the tip 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.150
 and well look how nice it has been already 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.150
 our snake 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.090
 and now if we put it in our pencil 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.180
 and look 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:26.250
 what a nice movement it has 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.020
 and it is completely removed 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.060
 whether they do it with a combined or 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.010
 in green 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.260
 good friends, it 's good, simple 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.810
 craftsmanship of this occasion I hope them 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.790
 has liked it is impossible to like and we 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.910
 we see in the following tutorial up 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.910
 then
