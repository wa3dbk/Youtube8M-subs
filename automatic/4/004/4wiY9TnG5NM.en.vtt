00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello friends with you in pre and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.189
 Today I will talk about KV-2 in general 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 Of course to do reviews on technology when 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.700
 she is at the closed stage 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.130
 beta testing is doing it 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.220
 ungrateful but since I promised 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.670
 still show next video apt-2 i 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.039
 I thought that just stupidly cutting 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.050
 fragments from fights it will be boring and not 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.900
 interesting and I donâ€™t think that much 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.019
 will change the concept of combat on it with 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.320
 the output of these tanks in the open 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.899
 testing and so apt-2 and has excellent 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
 armament but terrible mobility 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.649
 in fact, this is all due to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.230
 Apt-2 this walking artillery is very vulnerable 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.000
 melee since can shoot 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.090
 only once and then wait 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.690
 half a minute well, of course not somewhere 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.770
 30 40 seconds is a recharge, but if 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.050
 will hit the enemy then it will destroy 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.769
 shooting at long distances is pretty 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.590
 difficult due to the fact that the land has a blow and give 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.820
 armor-piercing projectile have a rather low 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.090
 speed 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.190
 flight initial there about 550 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.130
 meters 2 land mines in my why me and 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.720
 I speak for land mines and more I will 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.420
 tell exactly about the landmine so I 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.450
 account because i think it's 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 there is no main shell on this tank 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.060
 armor-piercing no other shells 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.860
 precisely high-explosive projectile hit 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.740
 high-explosive projectile 99 percent 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.840
 guarantee the destruction of the enemy 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.479
 hit by an armor-piercing projectile is not 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.660
 guarantees you the destruction of the enemy 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.600
 so was my habit at the beginning 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.720
 another tap and shot armor-piercing and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.240
 marveled like that from my breaking through 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.940
 happens but the tanks they destroy 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.020
 then random I charged land mines and so 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.789
 I will say from the place 15 times in a row which I 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.649
 shot bombs hit by the enemy 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.360
 there was not one for me not 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.280
 I will destroy it myself and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.250
 due to using only a mine 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.010
 and this is not surprising in the mass article 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.280
 projectile in my about 40 43 kilograms 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.519
 imagine . in two moles from 50 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.280
 kilogram my bombs 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.569
 high tank no tank in this game 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.019
 can withstand 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.090
 breaking up so many of you dryh 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.310
 pure stuff on your armor of course 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.930
 was once once and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.310
 dozens of destroyed tanks 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.980
 On this 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.620
 on square-2 was once that I did not destroy 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.510
 it is possible I did not hit the enemy 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.280
 shot from a distance to me 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.980
 I wrote that there is a lot Kretov had 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.170
 the enemy but I did not destroy him but not 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.110
 I give confirmation that I just got 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.280
 Exactly by the way this is another plus 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.230
 use on this tank exactly 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.930
 high-explosive shells as if you are not 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.019
 tank itself will be taken to get near you 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.989
 also apply quite a lot of kretov and 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.840
 you can even destroy the enemy 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.599
 easy fuse thread 2 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.030
 but it was good news about this one 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.489
 tank and the awful is that on 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.620
 its level, this tank makes its way 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 almost everyone and makes his way into 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.830
 all projections that in the tower that in the forehead 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.260
 shells and of course I can't but 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.010
 noted that that at close range in 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.810
 you only have one chance one shot 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.930
 if the enemy was able to dissolve you for this 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.930
 a shot and you missed something you can safely 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.180
 leave the fight because in that time 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.489
 while you recharge all literate 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.450
 opponent you destroy it just 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.450
 come out and 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.370
 shoot even once two three i don't 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.810
 I know for the time it happens 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:56.650
 long long reload opponents 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.360
 1 and 4 5 will shoot well, the probability is 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.329
 that you survive and you yourself understand small 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.670
 about precisely for this reason finds it difficult 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.379
 its use in melee 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.019
 but this is all I say for a purely solo game 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:14.170
 another thing when you play together three 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.950
 kv-2 or two kv-2 well, the more so 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.859
 better as they say can keep well 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.289
 defense and in narrow gorges like gut 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.099
 some sort of small 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.340
 aisles 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:30.430
 some kind of cover so on since 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.370
 until one recharges 2 calmly 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.139
 keeps gorge or passage in general if by 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.050
 Others play the game on this tank 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.919
 very much like a game on artillery in 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.810
 direct mode if you could 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.360
 destroy enemy with 1 shot to down 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.199
 perfectly 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.169
 near you and are well guided by 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.629
 map then the game should be on the tank you 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.909
 will seem familiar 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:59.639
 Well on this all subscribe to 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:03.900
 channel write comments in general everything is there 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.219
 as per text and wait for new videos to 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.219
 See you all until 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.729
 already know where the tanks are going main already 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.729
 you go already out of the nod is not particularly over 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.510
 by 2-3 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.650
 to 1 2 squirrel . 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.319
 oh ho
