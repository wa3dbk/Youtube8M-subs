00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.790
 hi girls today i make a video a lot 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.340
 fast and I'll show you some little ones 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.710
 tricks that it's about illusion 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.330
 optic that gives volume to the lashes 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.640
 they seem more like many times 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.180
 in short, they seem to be large without them 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.220
 use false eyelashes effect though 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.900
 Fake eyelashes 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 then guys and in the meantime I'll use this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.640
 Pencil of light grain lasts for 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:37.610
 to give light to the eye to show 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.610
 better this end 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.929
 then 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.030
 but that's what I'll do the classic thing 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.030
 most people do 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.670
 or via cigna 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.070
 and mascara 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.070
 the most typical thing people do 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.460
 especially when they go quickly 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.200
 first thing they do a score time myself 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.580
 to long cherries therefore the effect 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.070
 still anyway about me already with mascara 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.570
 changes a lot 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.540
 but for those who have we decide the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.230
 your very short figline in my opinion 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.620
 these little tricks can help 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.760
 very 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:43.020
 however this ended mascara 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.300
 jakupi eyelash curler the lashes anyway 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.510
 a good result on the eyelashes because 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.790
 bending them seem more ok with this 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.690
 we ended up on this eye instead 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.590
 we do everything ad hoc as we should 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.050
 do 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.990
 you want to have this optical effect of 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:06.900
 very voluminous long and fake eyelashes 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:11.179
 in the meantime I will use the pencil and put it on 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.179
 near the lashes on the eyelid 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.000
 very slow 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 light 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.850
 maybe towards the end a little bigger 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:32.000
 here this area a little bigger the more 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.500
 intense and within the eye a 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.920
 upper part opens in black pencil 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.920
 then casal 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:52.170
 ok you already see a small one 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:56.300
 difference then I take a brush 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.300
 angled and faded 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.849
 slowly the markit 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.480
 from here you can already notice a small one 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.560
 difference 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.560
 now look at the eyelash curler again 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.610
 brush to comb her monkey like this 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.040
 split and look not at the mascara is already 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.590
 something changes use again the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.690
 mascara what is used here 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.710
 any volumizing mascara that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.220
 which you like best 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.130
 I use this to be correct 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:57.830
 I use both for both eyes 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.830
 the same mascara to you here 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.549
 I use it after every layer of mascara 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.549
 pipe cleaner to comb and divide them 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.900
 now I will use these fibers here 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.850
 which are to lengthen the lashes you can 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.829
 also use these here 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.889
 essence that has a lot of space 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.889
 much lower though these are fibers 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.039
 black these are white and these are here 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.669
 I am finer for me and that I 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:35.410
 used both respecting the indication 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.449
 yes, and putting in a mascara 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.729
 I must say that it ruins three mascara 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.949
 however more than anything else because it is made 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.970
 ahead lump there but with the brush 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.220
 you can comb the group so little 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.800
 more effort but still you can get 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.820
 the same result as this one or more 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.380
 or less or you can still if not 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.930
 you have neither of the two ruvetti 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.080
 simply buy them used various 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.740
 mascara that you like best 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.740
 volumizing things like that 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.760
 since these are very fine here 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.360
 brown smile just take a 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.950
 1 large panel or whatever you want 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.950
 clean maybe and take away 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:42.739
 it is a flaw of these fibers and again 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:42.739
 mascara 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:49.949
 now if I would have used I wouldn't have 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:54.419
 used the fibers I would have again 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:58.789
 used the brush for per 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.789
 comb the eyelashes 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.099
 here is the result is this 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:18.030
 look at what you do or more 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:22.650
 part of you in a hurry what I have 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:25.500
 made myself with a million optical tricks 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.450
 and you can do it really really fast 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.330
 even in the morning just take some 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.280
 hand and if you don't use fibers but 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.250
 use simple volumizing mascara 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.110
 things like that here also have an effect 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:42.210
 very enlightening you know it all 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:48.300
 it must also be this I recommend it 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:52.160
 look here very nice if you don't like it 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.160
 that too much volume here and here nothing 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.650
 you can also put just a moment 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.630
 mascara on the inner lashes I want 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.630
 give her only a little in the middle 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:14.610
 I'll put it in the center so there are yes 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:17.160
 ago you see there are because when you are 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.560
 accentuates much higher volume 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.889
 seems like things that aren't there to of 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.100
 down in the personal taste in the sayings to you 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:28.800
 and it's over so let me know if you 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:32.250
 like it is more than anything else 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.880
 let me know if you consider useful hello 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.880
 girls
