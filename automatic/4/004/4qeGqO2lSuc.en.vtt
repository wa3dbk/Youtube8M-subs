00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
is a drop on the map we had a compass

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.810

useful for for reach its target

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.640 
useful for for reach its target
and<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.900> have<00:01:51.020> some<00:01:51.490> abilities<00:01:52.490> parrots<00:01:53.270> and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
and you have some abilities parrots and

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.750 
and you have some abilities parrots and
an<00:01:54.650> over<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.370> look<00:01:55.550> like<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.060> too<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:58.490> fight

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
an over to look like that too to fight

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.100 
an over to look like that too to fight
against<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.990> prefer<00:02:00.770> or<00:02:01.210> two<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.420> kill<00:02:02.630> its

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
against is prefer or two to kill its

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.359 
against is prefer or two to kill its
target<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.990> it's<00:02:05.990> really<00:02:06.260> a<00:02:06.770> different

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
target so it's really a different

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.029 
target so it's really a different
objective<00:02:07.520> but<00:02:08.509> over<00:02:08.750> again<00:02:08.959> because<00:02:09.170> it's

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
objective but over again because it's

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.660 
objective but over again because it's
just<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.660> scoring<00:02:11.660> race<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:13.220> first<00:02:13.459> player

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
just the scoring race the first player

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.810 
just the scoring race the first player
is<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.180> priority<00:02:14.570> as<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.290> best<00:02:15.470> scorer<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.430> not

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
is a priority as the best scorer and not

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.600 
is a priority as the best scorer and not
to<00:02:17.390> play<00:02:17.540> level<00:02:17.660> as<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.990> best<00:02:18.350> count<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:19.190> Kira

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
to play level as the best count of Kira

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.720 
to play level as the best count of Kira
so<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.570> have<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.800> use<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.130> different

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
so you have to to use a different

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.770 
so you have to to use a different
strategy<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:24.080> make<00:02:24.110> quality<00:02:25.100> kills<00:02:25.780> two

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
strategy to make quality kills two

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.470

different<00:02:27.770> bonuses<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:30.850> drop<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
different bonuses and a drop in the
