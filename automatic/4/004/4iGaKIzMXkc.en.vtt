it's<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.229> about<00:01:31.259> recovery<00:01:31.860> who<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.189> recover

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it's all about recovery who can recover

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
it's all about recovery who can recover
the<00:01:32.610> best<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> who<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.750> feel<00:01:33.869> best<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.170> Sunday

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the best and who can feel best on Sunday

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.510 
the best and who can feel best on Sunday
feel<00:01:35.189> like

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
feel like

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.090 
feel like
144<00:01:37.520> 7<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:37.970> 1<00:01:38.090> 50<00:01:38.330> 50<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.930> can<00:01:39.050> feel<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.350> oh<00:01:39.530> if

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
144 7 is 1 50 50 you can feel that oh if

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.340 
144 7 is 1 50 50 you can feel that oh if
I<00:01:40.280> had<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.460> go<00:01:40.550> into<00:01:40.640> five<00:01:41.150> tenths<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.080> a<00:01:42.140> second

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
I had to go into five tenths of a second

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.390 
I had to go into five tenths of a second
faster<00:01:42.410> night<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.890> would<00:01:43.010> have<00:01:43.100> hurt<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.280> lot

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
faster night it would have hurt a lot

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.220 
faster night it would have hurt a lot
more<00:01:43.610> yeah<00:01:43.820> then<00:01:44.510> again<00:01:44.600> I'm<00:01:44.780> not<00:01:44.810> these<00:01:45.050> guys

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
more yeah then again I'm not these guys

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.150 
more yeah then again I'm not these guys
I<00:01:45.260> don't<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:45.620> kind<00:01:45.680> of<00:01:45.830> speed<00:01:46.070> that

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
I don't have this kind of speed that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.800 
I don't have this kind of speed that
they<00:01:46.280> throw<00:01:46.460> down<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:46.910> for<00:01:47.480> me<00:01:47.570> it's<00:01:47.720> about

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
they throw down so for me it's about

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.000 
they throw down so for me it's about
metering<00:01:48.290> out<00:01:48.380> energy<00:01:48.710> throughout<00:01:48.950> the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
metering out energy throughout the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.360 
metering out energy throughout the
rounds<00:01:49.870> 147<00:01:50.870> 145<00:01:51.470> I've<00:01:51.740> done<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:51.980> multiple

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
rounds 147 145 I've done that multiple

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.460 
rounds 147 145 I've done that multiple
times<00:01:52.430> throughout<00:01:52.760> my<00:01:52.940> career<00:01:53.000> and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
times throughout my career and

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.000 
times throughout my career and
historically<00:01:54.470> have<00:01:54.590> always<00:01:54.740> come<00:01:54.830> back<00:01:54.950> to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
historically have always come back to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.050 
historically have always come back to
the<00:01:55.160> 144<00:01:55.700> mid<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.150> 143<00:01:56.690> hi<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.800> my<00:01:58.520> title<00:01:58.850> so

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
the 144 mid to the 143 hi to my title so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.760 
the 144 mid to the 143 hi to my title so
I<00:01:59.360> think<00:02:00.110> that's<00:02:00.320> what<00:02:00.470> it's<00:02:00.560> going<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:00.710> take

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
I think that's what it's going to take

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.120 
I think that's what it's going to take
again<00:02:01.130> on<00:02:01.970> Sunday<00:02:02.420> I<00:02:02.630> hope<00:02:03.620> it's<00:02:03.770> windy<00:02:04.040> as

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
again on Sunday I hope it's windy as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.430 
again on Sunday I hope it's windy as
hell<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.300> could<00:02:05.480> just<00:02:05.570> tuck<00:02:05.720> in<00:02:05.870> for<00:02:06.020> 700

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
hell so I could just tuck in for 700

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.889 
hell so I could just tuck in for 700
meters<00:02:06.620> but<00:02:07.520> guess<00:02:08.149> you<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.480> what<00:02:08.570> shows<00:02:08.690> up

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
meters but guess you see what shows up

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.590 
meters but guess you see what shows up
on<00:02:09.110> terms<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.619> whether<00:02:09.740> he's<00:02:10.340> kind<00:02:10.550> of<00:02:10.610> five<00:02:11.450> in

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
on terms of whether he's kind of five in

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.600 
on terms of whether he's kind of five in
a<00:02:11.630> row<00:02:12.760> figured<00:02:13.760> out<00:02:15.190> probably<00:02:16.190> any<00:02:16.430> type<00:02:16.580> of

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
a row figured out probably any type of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.370 
a row figured out probably any type of
race<00:02:16.820> if<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.300> forget<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.930> way<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.110> win<00:02:18.230> it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
race if you can forget a way to win it

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.710 
race if you can forget a way to win it
right<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.680> always<00:02:19.370> liked<00:02:19.580> question<00:02:20.480> Tiger

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
right I always liked question Tiger

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.420

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
it's fast slow if I'm buried if I'm

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.820 
it's fast slow if I'm buried if I'm
boxster<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.390> i'm<00:02:38.510> free<00:02:39.050> i<00:02:39.140> want<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.530> be<00:02:39.620> able<00:02:39.680> to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
win any different weighting my dividend

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.180 
win any different weighting my dividend
three<00:02:41.810> background<00:02:42.230> gave<00:02:42.380> me<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.530> lot<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.709> day<00:02:42.860> a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
three background gave me a lot of day a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.410 
three background gave me a lot of day a
lot<00:02:43.520> of<00:02:43.550> chance<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.850> practice<00:02:44.150> those<00:02:44.300> skills

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
lot of chance to practice those skills

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.300 
lot of chance to practice those skills
so<00:02:44.810> yeah<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.320> think<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:45.950> one<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.220> reasons

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
so yeah I think it's one of the reasons

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.380 
so yeah I think it's one of the reasons
why<00:02:46.610> I've<00:02:46.700> been<00:02:46.790> able<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.060> pull<00:02:47.209> off<00:02:47.270> these

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
why I've been able to pull off these

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.420 
why I've been able to pull off these

a way to get to the front somehow no

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.760 
a way to get to the front somehow no

not anywhere near the level of Tiger
Woods<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.570> but<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:57.020> aspire<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:58.310> have<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.760> kind
