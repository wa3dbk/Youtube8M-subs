00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
I would I just decided that a 1b was the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
I would I just decided that a 1b was the
safest<00:01:20.909> thing<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.510> now<00:01:22.260> I'm<00:01:22.560> gonna<00:01:22.740> go

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.020 
sides now I have to chop the wig on it
it's<00:01:47.159> pretty<00:01:47.490> comfortable<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:49.549> I'm<00:01:50.549> glad<00:01:50.729> for

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
it's pretty comfortable so I'm glad for

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
it's pretty comfortable so I'm glad for
that<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> was<00:01:51.570> very<00:01:51.780> inexpensive<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that because it was very inexpensive and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
that because it was very inexpensive and
so<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.700> texture<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.299> quite<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.780> mine

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
so the texture is not quite like mine

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
so the texture is not quite like mine
but<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.320> gonna<00:01:55.469> comb<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.429> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
but I'm gonna comb it out and all that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.239 
but I'm gonna comb it out and all that
to<00:01:56.880> make<00:01:56.999> it<00:01:57.060> look<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.539> mine<00:01:57.979> in<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249

threading<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.060> my<00:02:36.180> first<00:02:36.390> time<00:02:36.570> doing<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
threading this is my first time doing it

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.650 
threading this is my first time doing it
so<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.710> may<00:02:37.890> eventually<00:02:38.010> do<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.910> video<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.450> this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
so I may eventually do a video on this

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.810 
so I may eventually do a video on this
once<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.410> technique<00:02:40.800> mastered<00:02:41.730> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
once I get the technique mastered a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.490 
once I get the technique mastered a
little<00:02:42.030> bit<00:02:42.120> better<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.960> I'm<00:02:43.050> doing<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.350> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
little bit better but I'm doing this to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.970 
little bit better but I'm doing this to
protect<00:02:43.620> my<00:02:43.980> ends<00:02:44.400> now<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.450> wig<00:02:45.810> inside<00:02:46.380> is
