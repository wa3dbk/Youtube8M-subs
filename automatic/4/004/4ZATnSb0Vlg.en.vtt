00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
well there you go there's the hubs and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.029 
well there you go there's the hubs and
that's<00:00:26.939> actually<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.570> whole<00:00:27.779> periphery<00:00:28.740> of

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that's actually the whole periphery of

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.950 
that's actually the whole periphery of
the<00:00:29.340> dome<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.689> will<00:00:30.900> um<00:00:32.059> uh<00:00:33.059> it's

the dome with if you will um uh it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
the dome with if you will um uh it's
gonna<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.380> four<00:00:35.160> point<00:00:35.460> four<00:00:35.670> meters<00:00:36.059> in

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
gonna be four point four meters in

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.180 
gonna be four point four meters in
diameter<00:00:37.469> um<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:39.350> can't<00:00:40.350> calculate<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
diameter um I can't calculate that and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.779 
diameter um I can't calculate that and
feet<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.820> I'll<00:00:41.969> put<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.930> thingy<00:00:43.789> that

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
feet but I'll put a little thingy that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150 
feet but I'll put a little thingy that
tells<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.210> 15<00:00:45.809> square<00:00:46.140> meters<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.950> it's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
tells you 15 square meters is what it's

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.650 
tells you 15 square meters is what it's
going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.410> few<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.059> hubs

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
going to be that is a few of the hubs

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to be that is a few of the hubs
that<00:00:52.079> are<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:53.539> connected<00:00:54.829> assembled

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that are actually connected assembled

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.689 
that are actually connected assembled
yeah<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.739> not<00:00:59.010> completely<00:00:59.910> level<00:01:00.510> um

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
yeah then it's not completely level um

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
yeah then it's not completely level um
how<00:01:02.699> exact<00:01:03.120> everything<00:01:03.660> needs<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.710> how

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
how exact everything needs to be and how

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
how exact everything needs to be and how
flexible<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.930> will<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:08.390> for<00:01:09.390> time<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.080> tell

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
flexible it will be is for time to tell
