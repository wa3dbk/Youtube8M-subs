00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
what is up guys Jake from one half here

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.740 
what is up guys Jake from one half here
with<00:00:13.080> our<00:00:13.200> next<00:00:13.500> live<00:00:13.710> attack<00:00:14.160> video<00:00:14.719> we<00:00:15.719> are

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
with our next live attack video we are

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.800 
with our next live attack video we are
against<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> Big<00:00:16.500> Red<00:00:16.670> Academy<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.510> have

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
against the Big Red Academy and I have

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.509 
against the Big Red Academy and I have
selected<00:00:19.380> number<00:00:20.130> four<00:00:20.850> as<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:22.050> target<00:00:22.519> so

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
selected number four as the target so

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.920 
selected number four as the target so
let's<00:00:23.670> check<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.910> out<00:00:24.449> what<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> game

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
let's check it out what the game

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.980 
let's check it out what the game
plan<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.439> then<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.710> will<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.369> attack<00:00:26.990> I'm

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
plan and then we will do the attack I'm

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
plan and then we will do the attack I'm
guessing<00:00:30.080> I'm<00:00:31.080> guessing<00:00:31.140> giant<00:00:31.980> bombs<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
guessing I'm guessing giant bombs in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.520 
guessing I'm guessing giant bombs in
here<00:00:33.149> probably<00:00:36.620> baby<00:00:37.620> loves<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> record

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
here probably baby loves when I record

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.549 
here probably baby loves when I record
there<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:40.980> I'm<00:00:41.809> guessing<00:00:42.809> Tesla's

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
there and there I'm guessing Tesla's

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.670 
there and there I'm guessing Tesla's
probably<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.230> think<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> big

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
probably here I think that's a big

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.450 
probably here I think that's a big
enough<00:00:46.950> spot<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> pretty<00:00:48.090> sure<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:49.460> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
enough spot for it pretty sure it is and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.049 
enough spot for it pretty sure it is and
then<00:00:50.700> maybe<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.170> i<00:00:52.699> will<00:00:53.699> see

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
then maybe like here and here i will see

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.189 
then maybe like here and here i will see
you<00:00:54.270> know<00:00:54.360> somewhere<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.050> some

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you know somewhere in it's some

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.560 
you know somewhere in it's some
combination<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.800> those<00:00:56.059> it's<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
combination of those it's not going to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.319 
combination of those it's not going to
change<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.989> game<00:00:58.230> plan<00:00:58.260> though<00:00:58.969> which<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
change the game plan though which is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.979

giant here more hogs John it here more

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.310 
giant here more hogs John it here more
hogs<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:53.009> probably<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.520> giant<00:01:54.200> I've<00:01:55.200> never

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
hogs and a probably a giant I've never

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.410 
hogs and a probably a giant I've never
got<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.369> said<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.729> want<00:01:56.909> any<00:01:57.000> more<00:01:57.119> Giants

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
got like I said I want any more Giants

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.959 
got like I said I want any more Giants
just<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.600> few<00:01:57.750> hogs<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.229> I'll<00:01:59.159> drop<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.520> heal

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
just a few hogs there I'll drop my heal

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.230 
just a few hogs there I'll drop my heal
spells<00:02:00.439> pretty<00:02:01.439> much<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.729> just

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
spells pretty much like this just

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.600 
spells pretty much like this just
because<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.689> where<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:03.990> high<00:02:04.680> HP<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
because that's where the high HP is and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.550 
because that's where the high HP is and
where<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.759> actually<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.420> second<00:02:07.259> women<00:02:07.469> are

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
where the actually that second women are

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.999 
where the actually that second women are
probably

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
probably

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.820 
probably
it<00:02:08.250> probably<00:02:09.090> more<00:02:09.299> like<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.649> should

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
it probably more like that this should

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.589 
it probably more like that this should
be<00:02:10.950> taken<00:02:11.250> care<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.489> over<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.909> and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
be taken care of over here and then the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.059 
be taken care of over here and then the
third<00:02:12.720> one<00:02:12.840> wherever<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.349> need<00:02:13.409> it<00:02:13.799> so

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
third one wherever I need it so

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.440 
third one wherever I need it so
hopefully<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.909> all<00:02:14.970> goes<00:02:15.030> down<00:02:15.329> pretty

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
hopefully it all goes down pretty

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.149 
hopefully it all goes down pretty
quickly<00:02:15.750> pretty<00:02:16.110> smoothly<00:02:16.439> and<00:02:16.799> we<00:02:16.890> don't<00:02:17.040> run

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
quickly pretty smoothly and we don't run

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.880 
quickly pretty smoothly and we don't run

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
all I was awful a bit on my guess of

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.510 
all I was awful a bit on my guess of
where<00:04:36.580> things<00:04:36.820> were<00:04:37.260> but<00:04:38.260> no<00:04:38.770> double<00:04:39.070> bond<00:04:39.220> so

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
where things were but no double bond so

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.640 
where things were but no double bond so

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
really you know when they when they

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.230 
really you know when they when they
don't<00:04:41.800> have<00:04:41.950> that<00:04:41.980> it<00:04:42.340> makes<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.850> much

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240

that<00:05:24.910> was<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.030> little<00:05:25.120> bit<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:25.450> they<00:05:25.540> get

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
that was a little bit so they get

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.500 
that was a little bit so they get
different<00:05:25.870> spawn<00:05:26.200> times<00:05:27.419> everything<00:05:28.419> is

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
different spawn times everything is

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.120 
different spawn times everything is
going<00:05:28.690> good<00:05:28.900> here<00:05:29.290> let's<00:05:29.650> have<00:05:29.770> a<00:05:29.800> couple

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130
