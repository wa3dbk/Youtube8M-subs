more affordable because the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210 
more affordable because the
infrastructure<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.259> take<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.100> consideration

what we meant by infrastructure but if
you<00:01:45.570> look<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.869> smaller<00:01:46.860> scale<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:48.119> talk

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you look at smaller scale and we talk

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.770 
you look at smaller scale and we talk
about<00:01:48.570> personal<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.680> satellite<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:51.299> has<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> lot

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
about personal so satellite it has a lot

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
about personal so satellite it has a lot
of<00:01:51.810> benefits<00:01:52.380> when<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.860> comes<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.340> first

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
of benefits when it comes to first

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.719 
of benefits when it comes to first
benefit<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> first<00:01:55.590> wireless<00:01:56.189> storage

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
benefit is the first wireless storage

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.600 
benefit is the first wireless storage
solution<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> put<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.439> beside<00:01:59.159> these

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
solution so if you put it beside these

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.380 
solution so if you put it beside these
iPads<00:02:00.600> androids<00:02:01.439> iPhones<00:02:02.399> anything<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.149> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
iPads androids iPhones anything that is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.740 
iPads androids iPhones anything that is
Wi-Fi

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
Wi-Fi

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.110 
Wi-Fi
so<00:02:04.900> this<00:02:05.080> is<00:02:05.170> your<00:02:05.290> solution<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.580> 500

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
so this is your solution it's a 500

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.480 
so this is your solution it's a 500

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
five hours continuous streaming and you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.750 
five hours continuous streaming and you
can<00:02:14.410> steam<00:02:14.680> up<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.980> three<00:02:15.160> devices<00:02:15.430> at<00:02:15.730> the

can steam up to three devices at the
same<00:02:15.820> time<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.900> imagine<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.500> event<00:02:17.860> ipad

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
same time so imagine to the event ipad

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.900 
same time so imagine to the event ipad

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
with 64 megabytes or gigabytes so what

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.370 
with 64 megabytes or gigabytes so what
can<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.150> do<00:02:22.300> well<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.930> are<00:02:22.959> limited<00:02:23.320> on

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
can you do well you are limited on

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.620 
can you do well you are limited on
capacity<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.940> was<00:02:25.180> one<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
capacity and this this was one of the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.510 
capacity and this this was one of the
main<00:02:25.840> points<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.290> people<00:02:26.680> learn<00:02:26.830> just

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
main points that people learn just

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.160 
main points that people learn just
ordered<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.000> saved<00:02:29.610> everyone<00:02:30.610> looked<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:30.940> as

ordered it saved everyone looked at as

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.310 
ordered it saved everyone looked at as
iPads<00:02:32.170> or<00:02:32.290> tablets<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.120> main<00:02:34.300> issue<00:02:35.140> is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
iPads or tablets that the main issue is

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.710 
iPads or tablets that the main issue is
storage<00:02:36.310> does<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.790> capacity<00:02:37.300> that<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.570> can

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
storage does the capacity that you can

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.650 
storage does the capacity that you can
do<00:02:37.900> what<00:02:38.080> can<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:38.440> this<00:02:38.680> 64<00:02:39.220> gigabyte<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.910> think

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
do what can do this 64 gigabyte I think

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.630 
do what can do this 64 gigabyte I think
a<00:02:40.750> lot<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.930> basic<00:02:41.440> things<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.860> do<00:02:41.980> but<00:02:42.190> now

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
a lot of basic things you can do but now

others<00:06:10.699> were<00:06:10.850> using<00:06:11.150> 320<00:06:11.930> gigabyte<00:06:12.290> so<00:06:12.979> 2<00:06:13.430> p.m.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
others were using 320 gigabyte so 2 p.m.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.050 
others were using 320 gigabyte so 2 p.m.
will<00:06:13.970> we<00:06:14.270> went<00:06:15.229> in<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:15.650> new<00:06:15.830> platform<00:06:16.070> for<00:06:16.520> 500

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
will we went in a new platform for 500

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.870 
will we went in a new platform for 500
gigabyte<00:06:17.419> to<00:06:17.720> two<00:06:18.080> years<00:06:18.229> ago<00:06:18.440> now<00:06:19.190> we<00:06:19.639> have

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
gigabyte to two years ago now we have

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.270 
gigabyte to two years ago now we have
the<00:06:20.360> one<00:06:20.540> terabyte<00:06:20.900> per<00:06:20.960> disk<00:06:21.350> so<00:06:21.919> if<00:06:22.040> you<00:06:22.130> just

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
the one terabyte per disk so if you just

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.580 
the one terabyte per disk so if you just
really<00:06:22.910> simple<00:06:23.210> calculation<00:06:23.720> now<00:06:24.139> this<00:06:24.380> can

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
really simple calculation now this can

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.340 
really simple calculation now this can
have<00:06:24.770> a<00:06:25.010> dr<00:06:25.370> can<00:06:25.550> have<00:06:25.699> a<00:06:25.729> five-disc<00:06:26.350> so

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
have a dr can have a five-disc so

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.800 
have a dr can have a five-disc so
possibly<00:06:28.280> do<00:06:28.669> you<00:06:28.760> make<00:06:28.970> turkish<00:06:29.360> it's<00:06:29.479> faster

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
possibly do you make turkish it's faster

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.570 
possibly do you make turkish it's faster
and<00:06:30.260> this<00:06:31.010> is<00:06:31.190> things<00:06:31.910> will<00:06:32.060> go<00:06:32.210> on<00:06:32.330> and<00:06:32.449> I

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
and this is things will go on and I

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.670 
and this is things will go on and I
believe<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:35.210> most<00:06:35.570> challenging<00:06:36.229> part<00:06:36.500> of

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
believe the most challenging part of

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.490 
believe the most challenging part of
storage<00:06:37.220> was<00:06:37.460> very<00:06:37.729> density<00:06:38.270> how<00:06:38.630> can<00:06:38.870> get<00:06:39.080> the

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
storage was very density how can get the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.029 
storage was very density how can get the
best<00:06:39.680> out<00:06:39.949> of<00:06:39.979> this<00:06:40.370> spur<00:06:41.060> inch<00:06:41.320> so<00:06:42.320> I<00:06:42.680> think

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 
best out of this spur inch so I think

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.790 
best out of this spur inch so I think
where<00:06:43.370> we<00:06:43.850> are<00:06:43.910> doing<00:06:44.289> investing<00:06:45.289> a<00:06:45.350> lot<00:06:45.500> on

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
where we are doing investing a lot on

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.620 
where we are doing investing a lot on
R&amp;D<00:06:46.130> when<00:06:46.520> it<00:06:46.639> comes<00:06:46.850> to<00:06:47.060> be<00:06:47.150> the<00:06:47.210> first<00:06:47.510> to

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
R&amp;D when it comes to be the first to

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.050 
R&amp;D when it comes to be the first to
market<00:06:47.780> first<00:06:48.320> of<00:06:48.410> all<00:06:48.699> technology<00:06:49.699> and<00:06:49.910> the

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
market first of all technology and the

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.330 
market first of all technology and the
one<00:06:50.180> TV<00:06:50.449> /<00:06:50.630> disk<00:06:50.870> with<00:06:51.410> answer<00:06:51.919> your<00:06:52.010> question

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
one TV / disk with answer your question

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.450 
one TV / disk with answer your question
five<00:06:52.850> TVs<00:06:53.180> on<00:06:53.419> the<00:06:53.570> under<00:06:53.870> on<00:06:54.080> the<00:06:54.530> way<00:06:54.710> I<00:06:54.949> think

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
five TVs on the under on the way I think

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.580 
five TVs on the under on the way I think
within<00:06:55.760> three<00:06:56.060> months<00:06:56.210> you<00:06:56.419> see<00:06:56.660> and<00:06:56.930> from

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
within three months you see and from

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.409 
within three months you see and from
their<00:06:57.830> own<00:06:57.949> of<00:06:58.190> course<00:06:58.460> the<00:06:58.789> rise<00:06:58.940> are<00:06:59.150> working

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 
their own of course the rise are working

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.020 
their own of course the rise are working
on<00:06:59.539> a<00:06:59.599> new<00:06:59.900> platform<00:07:00.139> to<00:07:00.560> have<00:07:00.680> like<00:07:00.919> five<00:07:01.729> six

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
on a new platform to have like five six

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.730 
on a new platform to have like five six
seven<00:07:02.210> eight<00:07:02.389> and<00:07:02.570> I<00:07:02.630> think<00:07:03.229> would<00:07:03.349> be<00:07:03.500> very

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
seven eight and I think would be very

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.760 
seven eight and I think would be very
soon<00:07:04.430> fraction<00:07:04.849> of<00:07:04.940> one<00:07:05.120> today<00:07:05.300> so<00:07:06.289> we'll<00:07:06.620> be

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
soon fraction of one today so we'll be

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.500 
soon fraction of one today so we'll be
seeing<00:07:06.979> one<00:07:07.250> two<00:07:07.460> three<00:07:07.669> and<00:07:07.760> going<00:07:08.060> on<00:07:08.180> pretty

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
seeing one two three and going on pretty

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.760 
seeing one two three and going on pretty
