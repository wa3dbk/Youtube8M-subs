00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello and welcome you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.819
 I have to be completely new 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.730
 last week a few thoughts 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.030
 that's about a big project 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.030
 no video project but something 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.290
 more comprehensive a channel project and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.480
 Although you can see the whole network 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.670
 on youtube for example tm and such 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.710
 I would like a channel 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.390
 start with several youtube and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.740
 Together as all that is built that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.180
 you'll know right away I have a little one 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.580
 presentation and quotes 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.880
 prepared where that explains everything exactly 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.300
 becomes 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.730
 So I present you dj craft 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.160
 academy before many questions 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.700
 arise here I explain something that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.230
 so is 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.560
 First, I want to say that it is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.820
 everything is once only an idea 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.410
 First I want to look is that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.719
 I've even got that at all 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.969
 time for it and watch it at all people 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.010
 So it's the goal with different ones 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.960
 but youtube should not do any 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.820
 be big youtuber but rather 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 smaller maybe a potential 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.469
 can develop big 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.329
 there will be regular uploads from 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:09.450
 on and off this separate youtube 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.880
 it should give games like minecraft call 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 of duty and so on, but also others 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.259
 projects maybe like news broadcasts 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.279
 or maybe even the loks or 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.619
 tutorials something like that 

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:20.909
 they were of course some so what 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.899
 is the special so there was also 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.969
 already at tcm 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.770
 the special thing is that it is for smaller ones 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.479
 youtuber is i always notice it 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.649
 There are already talents out there but 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.579
 can not be discovered because it is so 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.069
 a mass of youtube gives the easy 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.899
 does not come through with her or with that 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.099
 What they do 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.819
 the special thing is that it's more of a 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:43.529
 school so an academy is city one 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.229
 So network would be for example the 

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:49.469
 Membership for up to three months 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.060
 that is, anyone who starts there has one 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.039
 Membership of three months if the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 is expired he is usually in the 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.570
 Most cases will happen then 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 dismiss as of course comes the question 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.270
 Why should I ever go there? 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.340
 join in after three 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.039
 months will dismiss the goal is it 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.840
 to train you so you are 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.160
 You can make advertising for that 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.179
 make your own channel you live 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.519
 maybe once a week a video 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.349
 high and or maybe several times 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.959
 and you can synonymous in these videos 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.910
 call channel and so of course 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.450
 Experiences ideas and even spectators 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.130
 win 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.709
 Of course you can also contact with 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.959
 other youtube this one i call it 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.340
 social network and therefore maybe 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.660
 also a few other projects with 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.860
 makes other users on your channel 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.530
 So it also has advantages for yours 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.810
 channel and to the audience why should 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.959
 or how you should look at this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.489
 yes well it is a lot of variety many 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.319
 new faces great projects and 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.239
 regular entertainment you have to 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.980
 Imagine that when ten times 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.720
 People always say they're there for three 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.610
 months 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.260
 then these ten months will be this 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.660
 ten people also regularly reject that 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.120
 means at least one two three every day 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.319
 new videos new faces maybe 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.230
 could be your new favorite player 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.569
 get to know great projects who knows what 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.130
 there everything over comments from call 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.970
 of duty or maybe minecraft or 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.980
 something like that and of course 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.859
 said regular entertainment only that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.660
 it is not boring to me 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:15.420
 is there anything you could know yes 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.090
 and that if a good performance 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.739
 if you are very many, for example 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.030
 getting calls just became a lot 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.889
 popular since and still in this 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.600
 community wants to stay after these three 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.250
 months then you could talk about it 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.750
 Negotiate that you even do that 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.299
 then you can go on a regular basis 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.459
 continue this channel without any time limit 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.489
 maybe upload to your community 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.450
 expand or what else so evil 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.489
 there is a sense there will be 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.440
 the normal permanent members 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.579
 Do not give excessive now 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.620
 but they do what they do 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.000
 special and as much as news 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.040
 then, for example, you would need a shipment 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.660
 the regular maybe twice 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.030
 three times four times a week no idea 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.590
 news broadcast out skin on the latest 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.880
 gaming news or something like that 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.380
 that would be members then the 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.780
 permanently while 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.990
 and no time limit but would have the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.980
 point is still that is more one 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.320
 should be school 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.070
 for let's play or other youtubers 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.570
 main thing mainly but let's play 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.410
 of course , everything is still a calm idea 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.060
 I say 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.650
 that's why it really would 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.610
 Are you interested in what you think? 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.800
 as a spectator 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.200
 would you subscribe to such a channel 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.680
 Would you be interested in that? 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.750
 something to look at just because yes new 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.460
 People get to know new let's play off 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.410
 As you said, you find your favorite 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.910
 player maybe and yes now wanted 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.590
 I would be interested 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.810
 such a channel at all interesting 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.190
 find and if that's the case then 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.410
 I would use such a project 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.180
 then I would write to people 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.830
 or people write to me then 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.010
 we can fill in certain form 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.630
 and thus I'd say a 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.280
 build quotes network or 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.380
 will not be a network that 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.880
 somehow paid but it comes to it 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.100
 It's more about gaining experience 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.450
 and also to see what to watch 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.250
 also important in the young 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.550
 years as a display 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.360
 yes and tell me how you find the idea 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.770
 then maybe you could 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.510
 realize if it is less 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.890
 I'm not interested in that 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.020
 I would for example estimate it 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.180
 but are there enough already? 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.160
 they do not like that because of that 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.390
 if you like it and then you will 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.840
 Decided if you have the project in 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.240
 claim or not 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.200
 so much for that and yes says your opinion 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.340
 and I'm curious and if that's all 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.140
 then I will again 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.930
 a few videos definitely raushauen where 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.180
 I always explain everything in detail and 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.940
 so on yes then I'm curious and 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.940
 author of a short and until then ciao
