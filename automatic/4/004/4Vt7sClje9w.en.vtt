00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
only have one more thing to hit so what

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:21.550 
only have one more thing to hit so what
is<00:05:11.970> it<00:05:13.639> it's<00:05:14.639> a<00:05:14.700> problem<00:05:14.880> one<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.090> these<00:05:15.180> blocks

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.650 

might've<00:05:22.560> been<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:22.770> one<00:05:22.889> I<00:05:23.479> might<00:05:24.479> have<00:05:24.570> just

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
might've been that one I might have just

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.170 
might've been that one I might have just
got<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:25.190> yes<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.280> did<00:05:26.460> ok<00:05:26.699> so<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.850> think<00:05:26.940> we<00:05:27.060> can

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
got it yes I did ok so I think we can

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.760 
got it yes I did ok so I think we can
actually<00:05:27.270> get<00:05:27.479> out<00:05:27.600> of<00:05:27.690> here<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:28.530> can<00:05:28.650> see

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
actually get out of here you can see

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.779 
actually get out of here you can see
that<00:05:28.889> this<00:05:28.979> pathway<00:05:29.220> over<00:05:29.550> here<00:05:29.669> actually

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
that this pathway over here actually

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.129 
that this pathway over here actually
opens<00:05:30.180> up<00:05:30.240> i<00:05:30.389> actually<00:05:30.690> were<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.810> first<00:05:31.020> time

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139
