00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
and so that these all need to get cat
from<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.970> point<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
from that point there and the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980 
from that point there and the
arrangement<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:38.040> merely<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.790> whole<00:01:39.479> thing<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
arrangement was merely a whole thing it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
arrangement was merely a whole thing it
looked<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.710> planted<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.610> but

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
looked like it was a planted up one but

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.569 
looked like it was a planted up one but
if<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.110> wanted<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.740> could<00:01:43.860> possibly<00:01:44.310> just

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
if you wanted to you could possibly just

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
if you wanted to you could possibly just
do<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:44.880> planted<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.509> well<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:45.930> all

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
do it with planted up as well but all

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200 
do it with planted up as well but all
they<00:01:46.590> had<00:01:46.770> done<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.220> put<00:01:47.640> beautiful

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
they had done was just put beautiful

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.870 
they had done was just put beautiful
hydrangeas<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> container<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.460> then

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
hydrangeas into the container and then

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.499 
hydrangeas into the container and then
surrounded<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.530> moss<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
surrounded it with the moss or with the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.709 
surrounded it with the moss or with the
what<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> foods<00:01:55.799> how<00:01:56.310> easy<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.450> an

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
what the foods how easy is this an

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.270 
what the foods how easy is this an
arrangement<00:01:58.170> that's<00:01:58.439> permanent<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.100> will

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
arrangement that's permanent that will

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510 
arrangement that's permanent that will
last<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.850> long<00:02:00.390> time<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.159> said<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
last a long time and as I said if you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340 
last a long time and as I said if you
wanted<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.210> could<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.479> repeat<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> same

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
wanted to you could do repeat the same

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.889 
wanted to you could do repeat the same
process<00:02:04.590> by<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.460> using<00:02:05.700> fresh<00:02:06.119> look<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
process by just using fresh look at that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.109 
process by just using fresh look at that
easy<00:02:07.049> easy<00:02:07.380> easy<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.069> designing<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.879> I'll

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
easy easy easy to designing and I'll

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180 
easy easy easy to designing and I'll
just<00:02:09.300> bring<00:02:09.509> those<00:02:09.720> those<00:02:10.319> fins<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:10.860> into

fantastic easy designing if you wanted
to<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.400> could<00:02:15.520> cut<00:02:15.730> those<00:02:15.880> down<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> wee<00:02:16.390> bit
