the<00:00:59.010> oil<00:01:00.380> this<00:01:01.380> can<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.650> done<00:01:01.860> by<00:01:01.920> locating<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
the oil this can be done by locating the

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.150 
the oil this can be done by locating the
dipstick<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:04.019> has<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> yellow<00:01:04.500> handle<00:01:05.040> on

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
most modern cars and pulls out like so

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:16.820 
most modern cars and pulls out like so
it<00:01:08.790> should<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.060> removed<00:01:10.640> right<00:01:15.260> zips<00:01:16.260> in<00:01:16.530> again

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it should be removed right zips in again

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
it should be removed right zips in again
and<00:01:17.100> removed<00:01:17.580> again<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:21.060> oil<00:01:21.210> level<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and removed again the oil level is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.600 
and removed again the oil level is
located<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> bottom<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.160> dipstick

located at the bottom of the dipstick

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.090 
located at the bottom of the dipstick
the<00:01:24.240> oil<00:01:24.420> level<00:01:24.600> should<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.080> between<00:01:25.260> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the oil level should be between the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.960 
the oil level should be between the
maximum<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.670> minimum<00:01:27.210> markings<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:29.700> course

maximum and minimum markings of course

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
maximum and minimum markings of course
it's<00:01:30.210> important<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.050> oil<00:01:31.200> level<00:01:31.440> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it's important that the oil level is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
it's important that the oil level is
accurate<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> should<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.479> level

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
accurate and then it should be on level

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.080
