00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.129 
well okay so the next thing I'm going to
be<00:03:56.370> reviewing<00:03:56.639> is<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> shirt<00:03:57.449> that<00:03:57.659> every<00:03:57.930> see

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
be reviewing is a shirt that every see

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.369 
be reviewing is a shirt that every see
so<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.790> shirt<00:04:00.000> does<00:04:00.269> not<00:04:00.510> look<00:04:00.810> like<00:04:01.169> it

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
so this shirt does not look like it

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.550 
so this shirt does not look like it
looked<00:04:01.620> online<00:04:02.159> so<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.790> don't<00:04:02.970> have<00:04:03.150> high

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
looked online so I don't have high

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.360 
looked online so I don't have high
expectations<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:07.139> quality<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.709> not<00:04:08.129> as

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
expectations but the quality is not as

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.250 
expectations but the quality is not as
great<00:04:08.760> as<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.120> thought<00:04:09.359> it<00:04:09.540> would<00:04:09.629> be<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:09.989> it's<00:04:10.169> a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
great as I thought it would be so it's a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.699 
great as I thought it would be so it's a
peplum<00:04:10.530> shirt<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.859> has<00:04:14.099> gold<00:04:14.430> trimming

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
peplum shirt and it has gold trimming

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.560 
peplum shirt and it has gold trimming
this<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.250> gold<00:04:17.459> trimming<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.329> has

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
this is the gold trimming that it has

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.000 
this is the gold trimming that it has
around<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.739> collar

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
around the collar

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.190 
around the collar
and<00:04:22.100> as<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:22.400> can<00:04:22.580> see<00:04:22.640> that<00:04:23.240> material<00:04:23.450> is<00:04:23.960> very

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
and as you can see that material is very

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.860 
and as you can see that material is very
thin<00:04:24.530> because<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:24.890> can<00:04:25.100> almost<00:04:25.520> like<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:26.660> can

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
thin because you can almost like you can

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.450 
thin because you can almost like you can
see<00:04:27.080> through<00:04:27.410> me<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.890> material<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.430> very

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
see through me so the material is very

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.530 
see through me so the material is very
very<00:04:28.880> thin<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.590> then<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.770> has<00:04:30.980> its

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
very thin and then it has its

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.000 
very thin and then it has its
asymmetrical<00:04:32.540> cut<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.250> back<00:04:34.430> is<00:04:34.670> long<00:04:34.940> and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
asymmetrical cut so the back is long and

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.640 
asymmetrical cut so the back is long and
the<00:04:37.010> front<00:04:37.370> is<00:04:37.580> short<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.420> it<00:04:38.870> also<00:04:39.080> has<00:04:39.470> that

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
the front is short and it also has that

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.000 
the front is short and it also has that
trimming<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.910> bottom<00:04:41.270> as

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.450 

and<00:04:44.780> then<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.930> last<00:04:46.140> item<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.890> received

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
and then the last item that I received

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.360 
and then the last item that I received
is<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:47.670> belt<00:04:48.090> which<00:04:48.990> still<00:04:49.320> has<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.680> plastic<00:04:50.190> on

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
is a belt which still has the plastic on

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.260 
is a belt which still has the plastic on
it<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:51.240> belt<00:04:51.570> was<00:04:51.870> pretty<00:04:53.150> inexpensive<00:04:54.150> as

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
it this belt was pretty inexpensive as

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.210 
it this belt was pretty inexpensive as
well<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:54.660> think<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:54.990> was<00:04:55.200> about<00:04:55.440> three<00:04:55.950> or

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
well I think this was about three or

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.250 
well I think this was about three or
four<00:04:56.610> dollars<00:04:56.930> but<00:04:58.700> my<00:04:59.700> ex<00:04:59.940> fish<00:05:00.260> expectation

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
four dollars but my ex fish expectation

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.800 
four dollars but my ex fish expectation
for<00:05:01.410> this<00:05:01.620> belt<00:05:01.950> you<00:05:02.820> guys<00:05:03.030> have<00:05:03.390> seen<00:05:03.630> the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
for this belt you guys have seen the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.530 
for this belt you guys have seen the
style<00:05:04.080> this<00:05:04.530> belt<00:05:04.920> before<00:05:05.100> it<00:05:05.850> has<00:05:06.270> like<00:05:06.510> a

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
style this belt before it has like a

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.220 
style this belt before it has like a
larger<00:05:07.640> gold<00:05:08.640> plate<00:05:09.210> on<00:05:09.450> it<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:09.900> thought<00:05:10.140> it

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
larger gold plate on it so I thought it

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.170 
larger gold plate on it so I thought it
was<00:05:10.350> gonna<00:05:10.440> be<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.770> larger<00:05:11.130> gold<00:05:11.370> plate<00:05:11.670> but

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
was gonna be the larger gold plate but

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.980 
was gonna be the larger gold plate but
actually<00:05:12.660> got<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.290> wear<00:05:13.560> with<00:05:13.830> my<00:05:13.860> shirt

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
actually got it to wear with my shirt

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.420 
actually got it to wear with my shirt
but<00:05:15.990> as<00:05:16.170> you<00:05:16.350> can<00:05:16.530> see<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.950> gold<00:05:17.160> doesn't

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
but as you can see the gold doesn't

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:25.050 
but as you can see the gold doesn't
match

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.050
