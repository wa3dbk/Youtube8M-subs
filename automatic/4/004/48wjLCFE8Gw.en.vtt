00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Welcome to a new forum broadcast 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.760
 Easy show they dance with zero where they 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.429
 I will teach how to create this hdr effect without 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.610
 need to have plugins this request 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.100
 they have sent it to my mail and I'm going 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 to please them like that is that they do not leave 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.660
 that we started with this new video 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.000
 good tutorial once they have 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.699
 open the photograph they want to make 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.109
 in hdr I'm going to use this one that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 I'm going to leave them in the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.920
 description of the video so they can 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.399
 practice as we always go to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.420
 duplicate it by pressing control j now 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.290
 let's go to the menu picture settings 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.480
 shadows illuminations 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.180
 and we leave them with the values ​​as is 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.630
 comes perhaps to you you get out of this 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.840
 so just give click here 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.190
 this box you label it for you 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.360
 others come out but you do not need 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.700
 you only give ok or if you want to copy it 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.010
 If you get different here, you can pause 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.100
 the video and you can copy the settings that 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.490
 have ok ok now we give right click 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.320
 on your layer we tell you to convert into 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.790
 Inteligent object 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.820
 let's go to the filter menu focus 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.070
 smoothed approach 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.470
 and here in this panel you will come out 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.690
 these parameters if you have a 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.450
 older version such as the 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.760
 cs5 I do not know maybe here you go to the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.220
 basic and advanced option click 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.800
 over advanced and you're going to move 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.259
 the tabs that says then approach 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.910
 shadows illuminations so you can 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.119
 give the values ​​that we are going to put to 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:51.890
 below here in amount of focus 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:55.250
 we're going to put it on 30% with a radius of 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.869
 10 pixels and in reducing noise you leave like this 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.270
 in 10% 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.580
 here in shadows in amount of 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.610
 We are going to put 28 transition 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.220
 percent in tonal width 28 percent 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.800
 with a radius of one pixel 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.310
 who lighting is in quantity of 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:19.180
 transition we leave it at 80% width 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.680
 tonal 0% and radius of 50 pixels we give ok 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.010
 right away we're going to create a layer of 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.130
 setting by clicking on this icon and 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.320
 let's choose black and white mode 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.620
 fusion of your layer here you can see it 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.800
 where it says normal displays the options 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.709
 and it tells you to superimpose and here you can 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.870
 move the parameters as you want like this 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.580
 By default, it will be nice but if 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.390
 you want to increase it for example here in 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.550
 red then you would not put a 50 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:57.670
 here in yellows I leave it green 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:03:02.180
 we are also Danish we leave in 80 blue 70 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.310
 magenta 60 this is already adjustments that you 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.290
 you can go putting in agreement to the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.840
 photograph that you are going to have to go 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.209
 playing with the parameters ok this is from 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.940
 according to your taste I'm going to contract 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.080
 this properties window 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.750
 we can see how is the before 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.030
 and how is the after 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.790
 now that if you want to recover the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.610
 color from somewhere here by clicking 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.430
 about the layer mask of the setting of 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.820
 black and white let's take a brush 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.440
 of black color and we are going to paint by 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.600
 example here on the ground for 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.600
 recover that hue that I had 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.319
 thus 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.570
 and ready so you can make the selection 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.480
 that you want from the area where you want 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.030
 hide the effect now you're going to 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.950
 ask why we made this layer 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.170
 of very intelligent because if simply 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.540
 so that the values ​​that you put in 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.180
 the smoothed approach when double- clicking 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.510
 here about the name of the adjustment of the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.540
 filter if you see here double click and 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.900
 You can modify the amount of values 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.180
 what you did put 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.239
 with this we finished the videotutorial 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.120
 did you see how easy it previously makes two 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.780
 years I passed them a technique called 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.330
 highlight details and saturation hdr 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.400
 you can see by clicking here I'm going to 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.310
 leave so if you're interested to see the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.990
 technique you can perform it I am your
