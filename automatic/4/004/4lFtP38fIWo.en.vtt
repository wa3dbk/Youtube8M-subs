00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hello and welcome to part 4 of Megaman

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.539 
hello and welcome to part 4 of Megaman
10<00:00:03.629> we<00:00:03.929> are<00:00:03.959> now<00:00:04.200> playing<00:00:04.529> as<00:00:04.799> base<00:00:05.160> in

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
10 we are now playing as base in

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.629 
10 we are now playing as base in
commando<00:00:06.450> man<00:00:06.629> stage<00:00:07.130> some<00:00:08.130> things<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.460> didn't

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
commando man stage some things I didn't

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.280 
commando man stage some things I didn't
mention<00:00:08.730> about<00:00:09.059> pace<00:00:09.300> he<00:00:09.660> does<00:00:09.900> handle

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
mention about pace he does handle

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.680 
mention about pace he does handle
exactly<00:00:10.980> like<00:00:11.250> he<00:00:11.519> did<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.910> Megaman<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.450> base

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
exactly like he did in Megaman in base

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.230 
exactly like he did in Megaman in base
therefore<00:00:13.080> he<00:00:13.830> cannot<00:00:14.190> run<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.730> shoot<00:00:14.940> at<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
therefore he cannot run and shoot at the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.750 
therefore he cannot run and shoot at the
same<00:00:15.269> time<00:00:15.859> he<00:00:16.859> has<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.130> stand<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.550> shoot

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
same time he has to stand and shoot

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.849 
same time he has to stand and shoot
unless<00:00:18.150> he's<00:00:18.300> jumping<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.930> case<00:00:19.230> he<00:00:19.680> can

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
unless he's jumping in that case he can

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.609 
unless he's jumping in that case he can
move<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.220> jump<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.730> shoot<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.050> if<00:00:22.439> you

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
move and jump and shoot and so if you

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.890 
move and jump and shoot and so if you
want<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> shoot<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.340> move<00:00:23.600> jumping<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.750> your

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
want to shoot and move jumping is your

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200 
want to shoot and move jumping is your
best<00:00:25.080> course<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> action<00:00:25.640> also<00:00:26.640> base<00:00:26.849> cannot

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
best course of action also base cannot

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.130 
best course of action also base cannot
shoot<00:00:27.420> through<00:00:27.660> walls

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
shoot through walls

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.490 
shoot through walls
so<00:00:28.710> that's<00:00:28.890> Mega<00:00:29.369> Man<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.699> proto<00:00:29.910> man<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.500> but

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
so that's Mega Man and proto man can but

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.340 
so that's Mega Man and proto man can but
if<00:00:31.949> base<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.610> overcome<00:00:33.600> by<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.870> obstacle<00:00:34.170> but

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
if base is overcome by an obstacle but

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.959 
if base is overcome by an obstacle but
like<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> wall<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.460> can't<00:00:35.640> shoot<00:00:35.790> through

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
like a wall then you can't shoot through

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.350 
like a wall then you can't shoot through
it<00:00:37.160> kind<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.399> fair<00:00:38.579> considering<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> could

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it kind of fair considering you could

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.080 
it kind of fair considering you could
shoot<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.660> any<00:00:39.750> direction<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.469> whatever

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
shoot in any direction and whatever

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.220 
shoot in any direction and whatever
anyway<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.270> commando<00:00:42.780> man<00:00:42.960> and

but believe me it'll take ages to kill
you<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.680> stand<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.400> too<00:01:14.520> long<00:01:14.549> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you if you stand in it for too long so

you if you stand in it for too long so
don't<00:01:15.030> worry<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:16.310> in<00:01:17.310> hard<00:01:17.670> mode<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
don't worry about that in hard mode is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
don't worry about that in hard mode is
the<00:01:18.299> only<00:01:18.450> time<00:01:18.780> those<00:01:19.020> mines<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.220> sand

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the only time those mines in the sand

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
the only time those mines in the sand
actually<00:01:20.790> create<00:01:21.299> giant<00:01:21.689> holes<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
actually create giant holes that you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
actually create giant holes that you
could<00:01:22.619> fall<00:01:22.830> into<00:01:23.070> usually<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.150> open

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
could fall into usually they just open

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
could fall into usually they just open
up<00:01:24.689> these<00:01:24.869> small<00:01:25.080> holes<00:01:25.530> where<00:01:25.830> these<00:01:26.009> little

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
up these small holes where these little

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
up these small holes where these little
crab<00:01:26.909> robots<00:01:27.420> shoot<00:01:27.720> their<00:01:27.900> spiked<00:01:28.200> balls<00:01:28.470> at

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
crab robots shoot their spiked balls at

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.260 
crab robots shoot their spiked balls at
you<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:29.909> easy<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you that's what it's like an easy in

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
you that's what it's like an easy in
normal<00:01:30.540> mode<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.869> hard<00:01:31.320> mode<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.680> actually

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
normal mode in hard mode they actually

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.289 
normal mode in hard mode they actually
open<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.400> pit<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.909> got<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.119> watch<00:01:33.240> where

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
open up pit so you got to watch where

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.080 
open up pit so you got to watch where
you're<00:01:33.630> jumping<00:01:34.130> these<00:01:35.130> sand<00:01:35.430> storms<00:01:35.880> will

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
you're jumping these sand storms will

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
you're jumping these sand storms will
push<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> direction<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.770> are

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
push you in the direction that they are

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.660 
push you in the direction that they are
moving<00:01:38.479> for<00:01:39.479> example<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.159> moving<00:01:41.460> left

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
moving for example if it's moving left

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.069 
moving for example if it's moving left
it<00:01:41.880> will<00:01:42.000> push<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.360> left<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:42.960> you're

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it will push you left and if you're

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.740 
it will push you left and if you're
running<00:01:43.320> into<00:01:43.470> spikes<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.220> no<00:01:44.790> good<00:01:45.090> or<00:01:45.509> if

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
running into spikes that's no good or if

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.700 
running into spikes that's no good or if
you're<00:01:45.869> running<00:01:45.960> into<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> bottomless<00:01:46.590> pit

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
you're running into a bottomless pit

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.649 
you're running into a bottomless pit
what<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> want<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.880> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> protect
