00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.690 

unplug<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.349> dog<00:03:40.220> dish<00:03:41.620> as<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.860> can<00:03:43.130> see<00:03:43.430> the

unplug the dog dish as you can see the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.360 
unplug the dog dish as you can see the
water<00:03:44.360> than<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:45.050> frozen<00:03:45.319> solid

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.199 

he's<00:03:49.370> mine<00:03:49.610> here<00:03:49.880> still<00:03:50.300> old<00:03:50.510> thawed

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.600 

I'm<00:03:53.420> going<00:03:53.750> up<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.709> top<00:03:54.950> there<00:03:55.250> too<00:03:55.459> it

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
I'm going up to the top there too it

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.880 
I'm going up to the top there too it
looks<00:03:55.819> like<00:03:56.200> what<00:03:57.200> appears<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.560> be<00:03:57.680> working

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
looks like what appears to be working

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.270 
looks like what appears to be working
yep<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:01.130> swore<00:04:01.550> me

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.100 

so<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.400> hasn't<00:04:06.579> been<00:04:06.760> extremely<00:04:07.269> cold<00:04:07.659> yet

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
so it hasn't been extremely cold yet

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.729 
so it hasn't been extremely cold yet
again<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:10.569> I<00:04:10.689> think<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:11.049> is<00:04:11.230> gonna<00:04:11.379> do<00:04:11.590> the

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
again and I think this is gonna do the

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.130 
again and I think this is gonna do the
job<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.760> could<00:04:12.939> just<00:04:13.150> start<00:04:13.329> fast<00:04:13.629> enough<00:04:13.959> I

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
job you could just start fast enough I

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.580 
job you could just start fast enough I
can<00:04:14.290> only<00:04:14.439> have<00:04:14.709> another<00:04:14.980> bulb<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.549> it<00:04:16.590> so

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
can only have another bulb to it so

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.789 
can only have another bulb to it so
we'll<00:04:17.739> call<00:04:17.949> this<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.160> success

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
we'll call this a success

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:31.190 
we'll call this a success
you<00:04:20.799> think<00:04:21.070> girls<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:22.630> it

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.260 

you
