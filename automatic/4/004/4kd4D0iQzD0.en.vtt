00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
years of abuse you know all together you

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.990 
years of abuse you know all together you
still<00:01:23.060> have<00:01:23.270> your<00:01:23.690> audible<00:01:24.110> star<00:01:24.730> star<00:01:25.730> drag

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000

here adjustment your spool tension knob

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.640 
here adjustment your spool tension knob
but<00:01:32.390> probably<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.900> biggest<00:01:33.050> difference<00:01:33.350> and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
but probably the biggest difference and

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.170 
but probably the biggest difference and
one<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.980> most<00:01:34.190> important<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.730> should<00:01:34.760> say

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
one of the most important I should say

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.300 
one of the most important I should say
the<00:01:35.750> braking<00:01:36.200> system<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:36.860> if<00:01:36.980> you<00:01:37.070> fish

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
the braking system and so if you fish

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.530 
the braking system and so if you fish
the<00:01:37.340> mono<00:01:37.700> or<00:01:37.909> you<00:01:38.000> fish<00:01:38.210> some<00:01:38.390> other

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
the mono or you fish some other

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.510 
the mono or you fish some other
centrifugal<00:01:39.200> braking<00:01:39.560> systems<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.430> know

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
centrifugal braking systems you know

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.010 
centrifugal braking systems you know
that<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.790> often<00:01:41.090> have<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.390> take<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.810> cover

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
that you often have to take the cover

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.870 
that you often have to take the cover
off<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.530> adjust<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.920> pins<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.460> sometimes

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
off and adjust the pins and sometimes

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.940 
off and adjust the pins and sometimes
you<00:01:44.030> lose<00:01:44.180> those<00:01:44.420> little<00:01:44.720> brakes<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.860> they

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
you lose those little brakes and they

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.590 
you lose those little brakes and they
pop<00:01:46.159> off<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.730> all<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:46.970> kind<00:01:47.150> of<00:01:47.210> stuff<00:01:47.300> will

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
pop off and all that kind of stuff will

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.390 
pop off and all that kind of stuff will
lose<00:01:47.840> weight<00:01:48.440> with<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.710> same<00:01:48.890> system<00:01:49.280> but

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
lose weight with the same system but

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.850 
lose weight with the same system but
they<00:01:49.490> made<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:50.050> externally<00:01:51.050> adjustable<00:01:51.650> so

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
they made this externally adjustable so

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.100 
they made this externally adjustable so
you<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.190> sit<00:01:52.550> here<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:52.940> free<00:01:53.720> spool<00:01:53.960> this

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
you can sit here and free spool this

let's<00:02:47.900> see<00:02:48.170> beyond<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.950> braking<00:02:49.730> system<00:02:50.320> you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
let's see beyond that braking system you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.520 
let's see beyond that braking system you
have<00:02:51.440> 14<00:02:51.950> pounds<00:02:52.459> max<00:02:52.790> drag<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.989> if<00:02:54.410> you're

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
have 14 pounds max drag so if you're

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.810 
have 14 pounds max drag so if you're
fighting<00:02:54.739> fish<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.250> have<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.400> lot<00:02:55.520> of<00:02:55.550> drag

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.699 
fighting fish you have a lot of drag
pressure<00:02:56.090> here<00:02:56.360> it's<00:02:56.510> pretty<00:02:56.720> standard<00:02:56.989> at<00:02:57.320> 14

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.250 
pressure here it's pretty standard at 14
pounds<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:59.209> that's<00:02:59.750> what<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.050> should

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
pounds it's that's what you should

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.920 
pounds it's that's what you should
expect<00:03:00.620> from<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.950> company<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:02.450> know<00:03:02.540> from<00:03:02.720> top

expect from a company you know from top

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.020 
expect from a company you know from top
to<00:03:02.959> bottom<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.650> would<00:03:03.830> say<00:03:04.070> has<00:03:04.459> other<00:03:04.640> features

with<00:03:36.560> any<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:36.830> Lou's<00:03:37.100> bearings<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:37.970> think

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
with any of Lou's bearings so I think

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.630 
with any of Lou's bearings so I think
they<00:03:38.360> do<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.540> really<00:03:38.810> great<00:03:38.930> job<00:03:39.049> with<00:03:39.560> with<00:03:40.519> the
