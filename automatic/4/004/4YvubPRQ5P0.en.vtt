00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 if you are one of those who loves to show off 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.990
 inside a car but it does not have much 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.540
 to accelerate pgr c is the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 ideal recipe for anyone who wants to appear 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.040
 The model is the most expensive car in 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.780
 French car maker for sale in Brazil but 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.650
 is a cheaper coupe on the market 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.650
 Brazilian 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.080
 the sports footprint of rcz is much more 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.869
 visual that mechanically that because the car 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.669
 is equipped with 1.6 turbo engine of 165 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.469
 horsepower 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.210
 it is not a weak engine but it is 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.210
 far from thrilled as German 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.410
 can not consider what is a 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.390
 because he has no motor 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.160
 for this but he gives you two good ones 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.590
 reasons you like him 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.750
 the first is the internal finish is well 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.940
 characteristic of p &amp; g the choir of good 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.790
 quality and sewing which are the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.250
 outside the cabin it may 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.200
 until I remember an audi tt but those 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.630
 files that cover the full extent of the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.730
 car and this depression here in the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 back are details that guarantee 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.470
 exclusivity of this model 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.940
 position to drive the rcz is typical of 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.760
 a coupe you're right underneath when 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.460
 you look at other cars and 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.740
 I felt the ceiling high above your head. 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.270
 but it's just a matter of time before you 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.270
 get used to driving the car 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.350
 when the car reaches 85 kilometers per 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 the airfield opens 19 degrees from 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.509
 of 155 kilometers per hour arrives at 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.179
 aperture of 34 degrees but if you 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:31.120
 I'd rather just press this button than he 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:33.400
 automatically opens and closes like any other 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.640
 foot self-respecting rc has room for 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.140
 four people but here back does not think 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.470
 in taking anyone is that space is very 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.470
 small 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.400
 baby at the pump
