underlying plywood in the layout table

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.920 
underlying plywood in the layout table
and<00:02:19.070> they<00:02:20.070> do<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.300> they've<00:02:21.690> got<00:02:21.750> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and they do that so that they've got a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.840 
and they do that so that they've got a
firm<00:02:22.380> base<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.890> running<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.370> trains<00:02:23.640> and

firm base for running the trains and
also<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> way<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.390> keep<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.780> sound<00:02:25.050> from

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
also a way to keep the sound from

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.550 
also a way to keep the sound from
reverberating<00:02:26.430> through<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.760> plywood<00:02:27.090> that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
reverberating through the plywood that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.620 
reverberating through the plywood that
holds<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> tables<00:02:29.010> together<00:02:29.160> on<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.580> top<00:02:29.790> you

board<00:03:29.820> on<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.120> back<00:03:30.269> wall<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.110> control

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
board on the back wall for the control

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.039 
board on the back wall for the control
panel<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.060> see<00:03:33.269> down<00:03:33.570> toward<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
panel but you can see down toward the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.810 
panel but you can see down toward the
door<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:34.440> they've<00:03:34.590> got<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.799> lot<00:03:34.980> more<00:03:35.010> table

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
door here they've got a lot more table

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.940 
door here they've got a lot more table
in<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.989> are<00:03:37.019> beginning<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.620> put<00:03:37.799> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
in and that are beginning to put the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.340 
in and that are beginning to put the
track<00:03:38.610> bed<00:03:38.820> down<00:03:39.030> there<00:03:39.299> here's<00:03:40.019> some<00:03:40.200> details

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
track bed down there here's some details

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.130 
track bed down there here's some details
of<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.330> landscaping<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.570> how<00:03:42.690> they<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:42.900> it

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
of the landscaping and how they do it

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.509 
of the landscaping and how they do it
I'm<00:03:43.260> fascinated<00:03:43.620> by<00:03:44.040> what<00:03:44.250> I'm<00:03:44.370> learning

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
I'm fascinated by what I'm learning

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.920 
I'm fascinated by what I'm learning
about<00:03:44.760> how<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> do<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.299> if<00:03:45.510> I'd<00:03:45.630> known<00:03:45.810> all

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
about how to do this if I'd known all

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.780 
about how to do this if I'd known all
this<00:03:46.110> one<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.320> was<00:03:46.530> doing<00:03:46.799> my<00:03:47.400> model

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
this one I was doing my model

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.100 
this one I was doing my model
railroading<00:03:48.120> years<00:03:48.420> ago<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.750> would<00:03:48.900> have<00:03:48.930> been

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
railroading years ago it would have been

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.979 
railroading years ago it would have been
a<00:03:49.140> lot<00:03:49.320> simpler<00:03:49.709> but<00:03:50.670> they're<00:03:50.880> putting<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
a lot simpler but they're putting the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.440 
a lot simpler but they're putting the
the<00:03:52.580> cardboard<00:03:53.580> strips<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.030> place<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.390> are

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the cardboard strips in place that are

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.990 
the cardboard strips in place that are
going<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.660> be<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:55.019> basis<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:56.610> various

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
going to be the basis of the various

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.490 
going to be the basis of the various
mountains<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.780> things<00:03:57.959> are<00:03:58.139> going<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.350> have

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
mountains and things are going to have

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.990 
mountains and things are going to have
as<00:03:58.620> part<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.040> layout<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.730> going<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.940> be

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
as part of the layout it's going to be

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.550 
as part of the layout it's going to be
really<00:04:00.269> neat

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.080 

here's<00:04:03.560> some<00:04:03.739> detail<00:04:04.099> this<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.519> sculpted

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
here's some detail this is a sculpted

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.869 
here's some detail this is a sculpted
styrofoam<00:04:05.900> cliff<00:04:06.409> face<00:04:06.680> they<00:04:07.400> cover<00:04:07.670> that

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
styrofoam cliff face they cover that

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.140 
styrofoam cliff face they cover that
with<00:04:08.150> some<00:04:08.299> impregnated<00:04:08.989> paper<00:04:09.819> that<00:04:10.819> when<00:04:11.000> it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
with some impregnated paper that when it

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.690 
with some impregnated paper that when it
dries<00:04:11.269> gives<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.379> a<00:04:12.409> rock<00:04:12.709> face<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:13.250> looks

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
dries gives you a rock face that looks

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.850 
dries gives you a rock face that looks
like<00:04:13.790> what<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.360> see<00:04:14.510> on<00:04:14.659> the<00:04:14.750> right<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.200> then

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
like what you see on the right and then

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.129 
like what you see on the right and then
they<00:04:15.950> use<00:04:16.130> books<00:04:16.489> like<00:04:16.729> this<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.329> go<00:04:17.690> ahead<00:04:17.959> and

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
they use books like this to go ahead and

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.900 
they use books like this to go ahead and
select<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.620> colors<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.250> decide<00:04:19.549> how<00:04:19.729> they're

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
select the colors and decide how they're

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.159 
select the colors and decide how they're
going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.120> paint<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.479> so<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.720> make<00:04:20.900> looks

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
going to paint it so it make looks

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.350 
going to paint it so it make looks
realistic<00:04:21.530> now<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:22.639> is<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:22.820> partially

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
realistic now this is a partially

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.030 
realistic now this is a partially
painted<00:04:23.720> rock<00:04:23.900> face<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.440> another<00:04:24.620> part<00:04:24.949> of

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
painted rock face and another part of

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.219 
painted rock face and another part of
the<00:04:25.100> layout<00:04:25.430> they<00:04:26.389> haven't<00:04:26.690> got<00:04:26.840> all<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:27.110> it

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
the layout they haven't got all of it

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.930 
the layout they haven't got all of it
done<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:27.650> see<00:04:27.979> some<00:04:28.190> of<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.340> basic<00:04:28.490> white

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
done so you see some of the basic white

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.170 
done so you see some of the basic white
cliff<00:04:29.840> face<00:04:30.080> there<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.710> then<00:04:31.669> this<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.060> the

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
cliff face there and then this is the

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.879 
cliff face there and then this is the
book<00:04:32.360> they're<00:04:32.540> using<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.139> kind<00:04:33.620> of<00:04:33.680> like<00:04:33.770> the

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
book they're using it's kind of like the

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.560 
book they're using it's kind of like the
Red<00:04:34.070> Rocks<00:04:34.310> of<00:04:34.520> Sedona<00:04:34.850> we<00:04:35.120> have<00:04:35.240> here<00:04:35.479> in

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
Red Rocks of Sedona we have here in

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.180 
Red Rocks of Sedona we have here in
Arizona<00:04:35.990> but<00:04:36.289> they're<00:04:36.530> going<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.710> be<00:04:36.830> using

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
Arizona but they're going to be using

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.710 
Arizona but they're going to be using
that<00:04:37.340> for<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:37.729> part<00:04:38.000> of<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.120> layout<00:04:38.330> and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
that for this part of the layout and

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.659 
that for this part of the layout and
then<00:04:39.500> I'm<00:04:39.590> going<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.800> pan<00:04:40.010> around<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.460> show

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669

tracks that run by it I'm really very

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.460 
tracks that run by it I'm really very
surprised<00:04:47.330> at<00:04:47.539> how<00:04:47.660> aesthetic<00:04:48.139> this<00:04:48.289> is

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
surprised at how aesthetic this is

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.469

looking even now and the kind of

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.000 
looking even now and the kind of
planning<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:50.930> went<00:04:51.050> into<00:04:51.229> making<00:04:51.620> it<00:04:51.860> look

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
planning that went into making it look

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.460 
planning that went into making it look
good<00:04:52.479> they're<00:04:53.479> running<00:04:53.780> trains<00:04:54.050> now<00:04:54.289> they

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
want to get the trains running as soon

in the midst of all the construction and
they<00:05:02.720> do<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:03.050> because<00:05:03.260> one<00:05:03.710> of<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.919> things

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
they do that because one of the things

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.610 
they do that because one of the things
they<00:05:04.340> provide<00:05:04.850> is<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.150> viewing<00:05:05.960> experience<00:05:06.530> for

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
they provide is a viewing experience for

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.610 
they provide is a viewing experience for
people<00:05:07.280> who<00:05:07.490> come<00:05:07.729> through<00:05:07.760> on<00:05:08.240> tours<00:05:08.539> and<00:05:08.810> so

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
people who come through on tours and so

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.050 
people who come through on tours and so
they<00:05:09.770> want<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.010> get<00:05:10.070> trains<00:05:10.400> up<00:05:10.639> and<00:05:10.789> running

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
they want to get trains up and running

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.600 
they want to get trains up and running
as<00:05:11.150> fast<00:05:11.360> as<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.720> can<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.770> we'll<00:05:15.830> see<00:05:16.250> some<00:05:16.460> few

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
as fast as I can and we'll see some few

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.129 
as fast as I can and we'll see some few
blinking<00:05:17.000> lights<00:05:17.210> because<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.810> electricity

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
blinking lights because the electricity

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.170 
blinking lights because the electricity
isn't<00:05:18.620> quite<00:05:18.919> all<00:05:19.220> worked<00:05:19.520> out<00:05:19.700> yet<00:05:20.000> in<00:05:20.120> the

they've got some more work to do but

out the site end up and working out the
kinks<00:05:28.490> so<00:05:28.669> they<00:05:28.820> actually<00:05:29.030> get<00:05:29.389> going<00:05:30.340> we're

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
kinks so they actually get going we're

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.129 
kinks so they actually get going we're
going<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.550> follow<00:05:31.729> this<00:05:31.910> train<00:05:32.180> around<00:05:32.330> we're

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
going to follow this train around we're

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.210 
going to follow this train around we're
going<00:05:33.260> to<00:05:33.320> be<00:05:33.440> seeing<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.740> lot<00:05:33.800> more<00:05:33.889> of<00:05:34.130> this

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
going to be seeing a lot more of this

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.100 
going to be seeing a lot more of this
train<00:05:34.520> here<00:05:35.120> that<00:05:35.300> we<00:05:35.419> would<00:05:35.630> when<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.930> thing

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
train here that we would when the thing

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.390 
train here that we would when the thing
is<00:05:36.229> finished<00:05:36.560> because<00:05:36.740> we<00:05:37.039> can<00:05:37.190> look<00:05:37.370> through

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
is finished because we can look through

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.879 
is finished because we can look through
what's<00:05:37.910> going<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.120> be<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.780> solid<00:05:39.199> landscaping

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
what's going to be the solid landscaping

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.529 
what's going to be the solid landscaping
and<00:05:40.039> follow<00:05:40.849> the<00:05:41.030> train<00:05:41.270> around<00:05:43.389> that<00:05:44.389> will

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
and follow the train around that will

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:45.939 
and follow the train around that will
all<00:05:44.690> be<00:05:44.720> covered<00:05:45.139> by<00:05:45.260> landscaping<00:05:45.830> when

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
all be covered by landscaping when

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.159 
all be covered by landscaping when
they're<00:05:46.099> done<00:05:46.449> and<00:05:47.449> here's<00:05:47.630> another<00:05:47.840> look<00:05:48.020> and

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
they're done and here's another look and

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.629 
they're done and here's another look and
train<00:05:48.500> coming<00:05:49.220> around<00:05:50.949> so<00:05:51.949> they<00:05:52.099> do<00:05:52.160> have<00:05:52.430> some

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
train coming around so they do have some

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:53.860 
train coming around so they do have some
up<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:52.940> running<00:05:53.210> which<00:05:53.330> is<00:05:53.360> one<00:05:53.690> of<00:05:53.720> the

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
up and running which is one of the

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.969 
up and running which is one of the
things<00:05:54.080> they<00:05:54.229> wanted<00:05:54.590> to<00:05:54.710> do<00:05:56.229> that<00:05:57.229> again<00:05:57.830> it's

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
things they wanted to do that again it's

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.439 
things they wanted to do that again it's
been<00:05:58.099> fascinating<00:05:58.310> for<00:05:58.760> me<00:05:58.789> to<00:05:59.000> see<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.300> whole

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
been fascinating for me to see the whole

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:00.760 
been fascinating for me to see the whole
process<00:05:59.720> that<00:06:00.050> they<00:06:00.169> go<00:06:00.199> through<00:06:00.349> and<00:06:00.710> the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
process that they go through and the

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.680 
process that they go through and the
steps<00:06:01.039> they<00:06:01.190> go<00:06:01.220> through<00:06:01.610> and<00:06:01.849> and<00:06:02.270> they<00:06:02.510> don't

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
steps they go through and and they don't

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.930 
steps they go through and and they don't
have<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.900> redo<00:06:03.169> anything<00:06:03.440> they<00:06:03.710> actually<00:06:04.099> do

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
have to redo anything they actually do

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.700 
have to redo anything they actually do
it<00:06:05.060> right<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:05.360> first<00:06:05.510> time<00:06:05.660> so<00:06:06.110> there's<00:06:06.349> very

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
it right the first time so there's very

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.260 
it right the first time so there's very
very<00:06:06.949> little<00:06:07.070> of<00:06:07.220> having<00:06:07.490> to<00:06:07.580> redo<00:06:07.940> anything

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
very little of having to redo anything

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.640 
very little of having to redo anything
they<00:06:09.050> actually<00:06:09.410> canvas

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
they actually canvas

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.830 
they actually canvas
back<00:06:10.740> inward<00:06:11.220> on<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.550> curves<00:06:11.790> by<00:06:12.419> putting<00:06:12.750> a

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
back inward on the curves by putting a

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.680 
back inward on the curves by putting a
thin<00:06:13.080> piece<00:06:13.290> of<00:06:14.150> cardboard<00:06:15.150> underneath<00:06:15.479> the

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
thin piece of cardboard underneath the

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.439 
thin piece of cardboard underneath the
outer<00:06:15.870> rail<00:06:16.229> so<00:06:17.009> they<00:06:17.160> actually<00:06:17.340> are<00:06:17.940> able<00:06:18.419> to

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
outer rail so they actually are able to

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.180 
outer rail so they actually are able to
run<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:18.840> trains<00:06:19.110> at<00:06:19.259> a<00:06:19.320> higher<00:06:19.470> speed<00:06:19.710> and

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
run the trains at a higher speed and

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.439 
run the trains at a higher speed and
have<00:06:20.789> it<00:06:20.940> safe

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
have it safe

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.330 
have it safe
there's<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.169> train<00:06:22.470> entering<00:06:22.770> to<00:06:22.979> what's<00:06:23.160> going

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
there's a train entering to what's going

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.760 
there's a train entering to what's going
to<00:06:23.370> be<00:06:23.490> a<00:06:23.520> tunnel<00:06:24.030> we<00:06:24.930> actually<00:06:25.289> can<00:06:25.410> see<00:06:25.440> it

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
to be a tunnel we actually can see it

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.260 
to be a tunnel we actually can see it
now<00:06:25.919> we<00:06:25.979> will<00:06:26.190> be<00:06:26.490> able<00:06:26.580> to<00:06:26.789> see<00:06:26.970> it<00:06:27.060> in<00:06:27.150> the

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
now we will be able to see it in the

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.879 
now we will be able to see it in the
future<00:06:27.479> when<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:27.870> tunnel<00:06:28.169> is<00:06:28.289> complete<00:06:28.710> the

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
future when the tunnel is complete the

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.010 
future when the tunnel is complete the
landscaping<00:06:29.370> is<00:06:29.580> all<00:06:29.729> there<00:06:29.940> but<00:06:30.660> for<00:06:30.840> now<00:06:30.960> we

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
landscaping is all there but for now we

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.810 
landscaping is all there but for now we
can<00:06:31.289> watch<00:06:31.470> it<00:06:31.650> run<00:06:32.039> through<00:06:32.070> the<00:06:32.310> tunnel<00:06:32.550> and

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
can watch it run through the tunnel and

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:40.480 
can watch it run through the tunnel and
actually<00:06:33.360> come<00:06:33.539> out<00:06:33.630> the<00:06:33.780> other<00:06:33.930> end

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.980 

fascinating<00:06:41.490> process<00:06:41.699> I've<00:06:42.090> I've<00:06:42.570> learned<00:06:42.840> a

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
fascinating process I've I've learned a

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.490 
fascinating process I've I've learned a
lot<00:06:43.020> as<00:06:43.470> I<00:06:43.620> said<00:06:43.889> it's<00:06:44.070> it's<00:06:44.550> been<00:06:44.729> fascinating

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
lot as I said it's it's been fascinating

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.430 
lot as I said it's it's been fascinating
there's<00:06:46.500> some<00:06:46.680> upper<00:06:46.889> level<00:06:47.130> track<00:06:47.340> there<00:06:47.789> and
