00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.959
 hello good morning today we're going to 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:09.970
 present a 6-inch fable nothing 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:14.940
 more or less a mobile 4g 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.940
 known as de novo 1936 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.000
 we see that we have it in Spanish 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.090
 Spain Espanyol 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:43.699
 has a ram of 1GB a rom of 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.629
 8 and a processor core octa 1.7 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:51.070
 gigahertz and Android version 444 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.070
 a taste of kitkat 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.900
 let's see the navigation speed 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.900
 what's wrong with it 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.759
 and we see that it immediately renders the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.759
 websites 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.540
 let's do a little test 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.060
 speed Wi-Fi connection 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.560
 with the typical speed text 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.960
 we started to test 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.799
 and connected by 100 megabit Wi-Fi 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.320
 of download that we have we are 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.320
 taking advantage of a little more than 30 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.420
 we see that we have had a descent 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.420
 pretty impressive 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.980
 and we have an upload speed of 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.980
 approximately 10 megabits 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.790
 without further delay we will deactivate the 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.470
 wifi and we are going to connect them 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.470
 exclusively with the data rate 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.409
 right now he 's looking for the best 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.409
 server and we started the test 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.560
 we see that we are reaching without 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.709
 problems the almost 70 megabits per 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.709
 second 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.250
 and an upload speed of 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.250
 practically 30 megabits per second 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.390
 this is the power of 4g 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.569
 let's take advantage to try to see a 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.569
 video 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.890
 and let's see some of the videos 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.890
 popular for example 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.580
 the one of a vehicle known as an island 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.360
 it is impressive to see a screen of 6 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.360
 inches 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.580
 this completely replaces 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.030
 practically any tablet of 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.030
 market 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.940
 we must not forget that the video 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.360
 we are seeing through the connection 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.360
 of data 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.459
 and we see that it is perfectly fluid 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.459
 we advance a little 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.570
 and then start 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.340
 we have taken a screenshot 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.419
 before we've done so long ago 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.860
 and gets an impressive 43 thousand 239 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.860
 points 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.420
 and without more a greeting from more lenovo
