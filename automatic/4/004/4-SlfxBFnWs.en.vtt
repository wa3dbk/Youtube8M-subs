of expert village today we're taking a

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.230 
of expert village today we're taking a
close<00:00:05.100> look<00:00:05.250> at<00:00:05.730> used<00:00:06.600> acoustic<00:00:07.080> guitars

close look at used acoustic guitars

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.490 
close look at used acoustic guitars
primarily<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.540> determine<00:00:10.050> whether<00:00:10.080> or<00:00:10.349> not

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
primarily to determine whether or not

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.879 
primarily to determine whether or not
it's<00:00:10.830> worth<00:00:10.920> purchasing<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.440> with<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.590> idea

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
it's worth purchasing and with the idea

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.670 
it's worth purchasing and with the idea
of<00:00:13.980> something<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.820> playable<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:16.470> can

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
of something that is playable and we can

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680 
of something that is playable and we can
learn<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.190> we've<00:00:17.850> taken<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.240> look<00:00:18.270> at<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690

bridge<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.490> determine<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> bridge<00:00:20.939> on

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
bridge and determine that the bridge on

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.910 
bridge and determine that the bridge on
the<00:00:21.240> instrument<00:00:21.810> we're<00:00:22.050> looking<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.529> actually

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the instrument we're looking at actually
