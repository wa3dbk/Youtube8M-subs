the shimazaki give it a good little

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.969 
the shimazaki give it a good little
shake<00:01:21.110> here<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:22.640> go<00:01:22.820> back<00:01:23.120> you<00:01:23.710> can<00:01:24.710> see<00:01:24.740> how

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
shake here we go back you can see how

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
shake here we go back you can see how
much<00:01:25.400> shimazaki<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:26.210> stuck<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.659> fly

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 

this<00:01:31.829> really<00:01:32.219> makes<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.670> fly<00:01:32.909> pretty

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this really makes the fly pretty

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.310 
this really makes the fly pretty
bomb-proof<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:35.240> ultra<00:01:36.240> water<00:01:36.479> repellent<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
bomb-proof and ultra water repellent and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
bomb-proof and ultra water repellent and
when<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.250> start<00:01:38.520> off<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.880> way<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.329> find<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
when we start off this way we find that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.620 
when we start off this way we find that
the<00:01:40.590> shake<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> bake<00:01:41.219> method<00:01:41.759> keeps<00:01:42.390> your

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the shake and bake method keeps your

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.020 
the shake and bake method keeps your
flies<00:01:42.869> floating<00:01:43.649> much<00:01:44.369> higher<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.939> much

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
flies floating much higher and much

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.270 
flies floating much higher and much
longer<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.990> base<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.710> quail<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
longer with that base of a quail that

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.810 
longer with that base of a quail that
silicone<00:01:47.909> base

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.150 

so<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.540> hope<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.750> YouTube<00:01:52.410> will<00:01:52.620> find<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
so we hope that YouTube will find that

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.460 
so we hope that YouTube will find that
with<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.610> method<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.720> year<00:01:54.870> flies<00:01:55.140> we'll

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
with this method the year flies we'll

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.710 
with this method the year flies we'll
put<00:01:55.710> higher<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.400> longer<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:57.450> less

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
put higher and longer with less

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.170 
put higher and longer with less
maintenance<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> you'll<00:01:59.580> be<00:01:59.700> able<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.000> fish<00:02:00.150> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
maintenance and you'll be able to fish a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.260 
maintenance and you'll be able to fish a
bit<00:02:00.690> more

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.329 

you
