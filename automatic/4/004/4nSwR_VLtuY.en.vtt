00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.180
 i 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.420
 but it was difficult the process was difficult 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.830
 because many would like to arrive by 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.230
 example the first division where is 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.980
 right now 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.390
 but he was told a few times after 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.360
 that first one they did not tell him and that the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.890
 next year they accepted him in the club 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.140
 there were other occasions that it is no longer 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.720
 that you can not or can not 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:45.280
 not really the only one of the birds that 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:49.840
 they said they did not accept and then what 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.330
 called the tuca in the year of 2008 annul 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.829
 the preseason to start now 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:01:00.210
 debuted it and they went to Cancun but they 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.210
 trained with the team in 2008 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.510
 and this one was very excited and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.860
 returning said the tuca you return to the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.930
 promotion law because you're not 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.470
 contemplated in the plans 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.190
 that did hit him so much hit him 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.490
 who played a very bad championship in the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.700
 promotion was very unmotivated and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.130
 and we tempers and after the other 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.530
 championship started again to grab 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.530
 new forces and continued until 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.710
 passed from 2008 to 2011 that debuted on 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.729
 last year one day before his birthday 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.880
 that debuts because unfortunately it 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.130
 injures the cacho 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.930
 at minute 30 of the first half and the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.840
 enter from the 30th minute of the first 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.700
 time because we thought that what 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.530
 they had called but that was obviously going to 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.789
 be on the bench and I was not going to play or 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.789
 I was going to play 5 minutes 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.300
 We were in Cancun unfortunately 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.290
 we are watching it on a television appointment 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.840
 how tiny because he was in we were 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.990
 in a hotel where they had not hired 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.810
 the service where the party worked 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.870
 We went looking for it and found a 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.310
 in a barecito and there we were and that 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.970
 feel not so 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.930
 It feels very nice to see what goes into 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.670
 play and this feels very father and all 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.050
 the plays since we came in we thought 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.750
 that a goal they had been brave was 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.420
 it really hurts I jumped like crazy and 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.040
 later and it was not him and thought the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.920
 good people this one is going a lot to the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.170
 pumas but then I thought I had 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.230
 got him not some anecdote that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.140
 remember is when you are little there is a 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.459
 anecdote that does not like that I commented it 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.230
 but I'm going to comment because if it's a 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.770
 anecdote of when a job to soccer 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.770
 in the first match 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.690
 we were with the dads living and my 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.069
 son comes over and dad tells me to take him 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.870
 the mask 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.940
 then I remove the chain 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.630
 I give him his kiss because he had scored a goal 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.140
 in his first game 26 years and longer 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.680
 came back 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.860
 and this 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.080
 after that dad told me 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.630
 I will not be able to approach 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.590
 with you to celebrate no goal and I 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.700
 scolded the coach 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.280
 and I really do that if that occasion 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.560
 marked my son the coach is the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.850
 coach marked him because after never 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.670
 this warmth came again 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.070
 and that's one thing that did affect me a lot 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.270
 but the one to follow from there started to 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.730
 follow a discipline with the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.850
 coaches what has been your best 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.100
 gift that he has received from the 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.100
 home on Father's Day or it's not something very 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.040
 special the best gift I've had 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.580
 of my son was when after that 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.700
 he got his first goal we went to dinner 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.450
 some tacos by the way and when he 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.599
 I parked, I parked back 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:20.669
 pulled out the shirt completely soaked 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.669
 of the party says it's for you dad that was 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.850
 the first goal 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.060
 I'm crying to remember I felt a 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:37.690
 great satisfaction a great emotion what 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:51.810
 I hugged and cried the two of us were in 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:51.810
 the beginning the love 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.169

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.370

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.830
