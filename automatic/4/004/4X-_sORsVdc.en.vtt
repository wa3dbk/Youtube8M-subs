 the ag2r team worldwide and especially 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.239
 scrape the perron and then we 'll finish with 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 did you know that with the l 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.760
 expression to the rising dancer is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.760
 left 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.110
 at breakfast we have different types 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.010
 table cereals according to the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 everyone's tastes after it has lasted from 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.500
 complete pack there will be more or less of the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.629
 train tracks for example fled 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.789
 rice cakes and then he'll see the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.500
 second part in quotes God's 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.750
 meal that will be the snack that will be 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.990
 rather made from rice eggs or pasta 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.540
 so as to m hamlet into master ham 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 cheese had a little bit of protein 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.670
 carbs and that's really the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.250
 second part it's really filled this 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 fuel before going to the tables 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.640
 preparing for the ravito 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.530
 tomorrow so here we actually cut what we 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.200
 made yesterday 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.690
 what we call we will do that the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.440
 ravito actually consists of two 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.440
 parties that's all that is argene 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.030
 packaged is what we prepare this 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.759
 so called would do so it's 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.040
 semolina cake the poland where there was 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.640
 made yesterday a porridge with flakes 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.350
 soy milk oat 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.570
 we made a short list in relation to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.340
 all hallways at 6m what they 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.990
 would like to have just all of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.550
 tongue of each person's singing tour 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 or less start a little saltier than 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.140
 sweet so we do not have once all 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.519
 listed we get together what they want 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.410
 to emit we go a little bit adapted too 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.920
 our way to us so that precisely 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.380
 tastes change on feb lumiel bananas 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.150
 have made salty but in principle we have 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.569
 more or less always the same the same 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.880
 ritual 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.030
 they eat mainly carbohydrates 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 in different forms be it 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.709
 starchy foods with rice pasta 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.950
 potatoes or fruits like 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.590
 banana and and others and then there is need 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.959
 also to eat meat the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.810
 red meat especially dairy 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.459
 which are necessary for the production of 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.590
 proteins to remake the cells that 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.350
 are put to great contribution in 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.410
 especially the muscle so we deprive them 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.620
 on the contrary in addition to the menu of the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.810
 Tour de France have thought and organized 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.610
 for runners and each time 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.720
 my interests without ever the same 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.720
 and the guys they want to eat 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.950
 worn the polka dot jersey on the turn of 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.060
 get on this podium 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.130
 you'll see this audience in front of it's 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.660
 really always touching so broken 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.730
 it's home after I had a 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.700
 motivation I had a little more 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.500
 motivation but it's true these same 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.269
 faces and well it's very very happy 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.590
 we do we have we have a shirt 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.700
 distinctive it is always pleasant in 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.709
 the group to have someone who has a 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.470
 jersey so that always attracts the taste 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.730
 to the water so here it was really 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.390
 pleased especially that Roman he has well 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.060
 participated in that I wear the jersey 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.030
 he had managed to bang stone rolland 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.260
 in water of the 2nd cat and thus allowed to 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.530
 wear this jersey so 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.030
 all that's true it's the team knows 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.819
 it's a brand of collective wanted 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.159
 rather a good day even if we have a 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.810
 little bit frustrated because there 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.959
 the morning break that had taken 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.620
 christophe riblon should have and could have 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.960
 go much further 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.090
 again there has been 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.220
 we did not understand why the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.240
 oreca greenedge wanted even if he had 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.550
 the leader's jersey 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.810
 knowing that they were going to lose there 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.120
 took the race on their own then 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.370
 how good he could have let them do 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.220
 sky so that penalized escaped and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.120
 christophe riblon who worked very well 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.770
 since it has redone a little bit 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.270
 number 10 two years ago but there was 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.280
 not the margin at the foot of the collar 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.590
 There was a minute it was 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.350
 not enough to consider going neither 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.910
 passed at the top of the neck of pailhers neither 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.530
 won the stage 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.520
 so the frustration she is there especially 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.320
 compared to christophe who was 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.420
 really loud and then behind we got 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.740
 also we have a second race behind 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.810
 with our three leading runners who are 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.220
 beaten to the end and we saw when 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.040
 even good jeans christophe PÃ©raud de 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.360
 the excellent Roman bardet and also the 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.730
 very good john gadret 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.140
 so here we are not far from the canton 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.570
 did not play with any better 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:55.170
 but overall we are still very 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:58.050
 satisfied well ben it is especially to 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.250
 to stick to a neck so it's up to 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.000
 From the moment stands is on 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.470
 pedals and that goes up as shame 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.080
 standing up does not have the dfs on the stage 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.680
 everyone but the practice 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.900
 the attacked for mosquitoes 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.450
 for info in the world of practice 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.340
 but has climbers do longer 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.620
 as a dancer that most of 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.350
 of course we can do all that 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.970
 more or less as hubert said the 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.890
 climbers do it more 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.410
 we are a little less powerful so 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.410
 by offsetting by putting yourself in 16
