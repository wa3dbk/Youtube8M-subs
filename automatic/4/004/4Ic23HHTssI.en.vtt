hi<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.199> Mohammed<00:00:01.650> Shaquille<00:00:02.010> here<00:00:02.310> and

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hi this is Mohammed Shaquille here and

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.579 
hi this is Mohammed Shaquille here and
you're<00:00:02.760> watching<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.210> tailstock<00:00:03.600> being

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
you're watching a tailstock being

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.650 
you're watching a tailstock being
designed<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.160> part<00:00:05.400> design<00:00:05.580> generator<00:00:06.420> shape

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
designed the part design generator shape

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.360 
designed the part design generator shape
design<00:00:06.990> was<00:00:07.230> finally<00:00:07.620> assembled<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.220> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
design was finally assembled in the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.799 
design was finally assembled in the
assembly<00:00:08.849> design<00:00:08.970> workbench

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
assembly design workbench

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.470 
assembly design workbench
so<00:00:10.530> what<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.040> tailstock<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:11.969> basically<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
so what the tailstock is so basically a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.360 
so what the tailstock is so basically a
part<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> late<00:00:13.320> Martin<00:00:13.559> Ron's<00:00:13.860> bed<00:00:14.130> ways

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
part of the late Martin Ron's bed ways

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.890 
part of the late Martin Ron's bed ways
opposite<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> headstock<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.570> support

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
opposite to the headstock to support

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.290 
opposite to the headstock to support
eating<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> lengthy<00:00:16.920> work<00:00:17.520> pieces<00:00:17.789> or<00:00:18.029> tools

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
eating the lengthy work pieces or tools

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.590 
eating the lengthy work pieces or tools
such<00:00:18.930> as<00:00:19.050> drills<00:00:19.109> reamers<00:00:19.680> etc<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.390> can

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
such as drills reamers etc so this can

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.540 
such as drills reamers etc so this can
be<00:00:21.630> climbed<00:00:21.930> anywhere<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> little<00:00:23.130> bit<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
be climbed anywhere on the little bit so

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000 
be climbed anywhere on the little bit so
basically<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> designing<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
basically for the designing of this I

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.990 
basically for the designing of this I
have<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.740> used<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.250> top-down<00:00:29.789> approach

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
have I have used the top-down approach

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.260 
have I have used the top-down approach
for<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.990> assembly<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.610> exactly<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.180> did

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
for the assembly so what exactly I did

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.319 
for the assembly so what exactly I did
is<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.200> designed<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.860> parts<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:36.090> some

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
is I have designed the parts so some

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.940 
is I have designed the parts so some
other<00:00:36.510> parts<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.110> designed<00:00:37.469> while<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> was

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
other parts I have designed while I was

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.420 
other parts I have designed while I was
doing<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.460> assembly<00:00:39.170> such<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.620> washers

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
doing the assembly such as the washers

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.560 
doing the assembly such as the washers
and<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.870> set<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.219> I'll<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.539> through

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and not set on so I'll be going through

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.840 
and not set on so I'll be going through
each<00:00:45.960> parts<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.710> obviously<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.520> used<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
each parts that obviously I have used to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.250 
each parts that obviously I have used to
you<00:00:50.000> know<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.210> design<00:00:50.930> this<00:00:51.079> particular

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
you know to design this particular

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.549 
you know to design this particular
tailstock<00:00:52.010> here<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.090> basically<00:00:53.440> for<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
tailstock here so basically for the

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.619 
tailstock here so basically for the
users<00:00:54.980> who<00:00:55.219> wants<00:00:55.579> to<00:00:55.699> know<00:00:55.820> exactly<00:00:56.269> how<00:00:56.390> the

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
users who wants to know exactly how the

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.020 
users who wants to know exactly how the
tailstock<00:00:57.230> looks<00:00:57.620> like<00:00:57.860> and<00:00:58.519> it's<00:00:58.670> different

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
tailstock looks like and it's different

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.389 
tailstock looks like and it's different
views<00:00:59.329> I'll<00:00:59.659> be<00:00:59.839> switching<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.010> different

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
views I'll be switching to the different

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.130 
views I'll be switching to the different
views<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.909> front<00:01:02.180> view<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.570> side<00:01:02.780> view<00:01:02.989> on

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
views the front view the side view on

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.740 
views the front view the side view on
the<00:01:03.260> top<00:01:03.469> view<00:01:03.710> of<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.009> tailstock<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.570> that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
the top view of the tailstock so that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.410 
the top view of the tailstock so that
the<00:01:05.960> users<00:01:06.380> can<00:01:06.770> see<00:01:07.460> how<00:01:07.759> the<00:01:07.820> design<00:01:08.000> looks

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
the users can see how the design looks

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.930 
the users can see how the design looks
like<00:01:08.630> from<00:01:08.840> different<00:01:09.200> views<00:01:09.440> with<00:01:09.700> any<00:01:10.700> other

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
like from different views with any other

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.240 
like from different views with any other
manuals<00:01:11.570> or<00:01:11.780> anywhere<00:01:12.200> if<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.380> go<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:12.799> won't

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
manuals or anywhere if you go you won't

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.859 
manuals or anywhere if you go you won't
be<00:01:13.399> able<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.610> find<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:16.430> I'll<00:01:16.700> be<00:01:16.909> switching

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
be able to find and so I'll be switching

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.680 
be able to find and so I'll be switching
it<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.289> right<00:01:18.500> view<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.780> left<00:01:21.020> view

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
it to the right view and the left view

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.060 
it to the right view and the left view
so<00:01:23.690> let<00:01:24.080> me<00:01:24.140> just<00:01:24.319> come<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.710> each<00:01:24.950> part<00:01:25.310> now<00:01:25.580> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.610 

so<00:01:29.760> as<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.360> over<00:01:30.510> here<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:31.320> have

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
so as you can see over here you have

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.160 
so as you can see over here you have
different<00:01:32.460> nuts<00:01:32.730> so<00:01:33.450> let's<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.780> where<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
different nuts so let's see where and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.410 
different nuts so let's see where and
all<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.440> have<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.830> nuts<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.730> a<00:01:36.060> knot

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
all you have the nuts you have a knot

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
all you have the nuts you have a knot
over<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.930> another<00:01:37.350> knot<00:01:37.650> over<00:01:37.830> here<00:01:38.160> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
over here another knot over here and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.580 
over here another knot over here and
another<00:01:38.610> knot<00:01:38.940> over<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:39.870> basically<00:01:40.260> in

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
another knot over here so basically in

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.040 
another knot over here so basically in
the<00:01:40.800> design<00:01:41.550> books<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.570> won't<00:01:42.840> be

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
the design books are they won't be

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.800 
the design books are they won't be
giving<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.300> drawings<00:01:45.300> for<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.600> knots

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
giving you the drawings for the knots

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.540 
giving you the drawings for the knots
they'll<00:01:46.080> be<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.380> saying<00:01:46.650> himself<00:01:46.980> not

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
they'll be just saying himself not

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.960 
they'll be just saying himself not
insisting<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.420> lock<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.500> hex<00:01:49.800> nut<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.100> all

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
insisting that lock not hex nut and all

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.460 
insisting that lock not hex nut and all
these<00:01:51.150> things<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.660> should<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
these things so you should be in a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.040 
these things so you should be in a
position<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:53.160> know<00:01:53.460> how<00:01:53.850> exactly<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.540> design<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
position to know how exactly to design a

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.990 
position to know how exactly to design a
nut<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.980> basically<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.640> how<00:01:56.940> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
nut so basically if you know how to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.760 
nut so basically if you know how to
design<00:01:57.240> an<00:01:57.540> octave<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.960> will<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.290> able<00:01:58.440> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
design an octave you will be able to
