00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
to whether we get that fourth place ball

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
believe it is for that fourth place spot

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.609 
believe it is for that fourth place spot
and<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.970> literally<00:00:30.359> comes<00:00:30.720> down<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.380> game

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and it literally comes down to this game

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.530 
and it literally comes down to this game
we're<00:00:31.800> completely<00:00:32.130> tied<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.910> points<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
we're completely tied on points at the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.209 
we're completely tied on points at the
moment<00:00:33.840> although<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.590> only<00:00:34.829> difference

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
moment although the only difference

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.580 
moment although the only difference
right<00:00:35.430> now<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:36.000> our<00:00:36.719> goal<00:00:37.020> difference<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.530> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
right now is our goal difference and I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.630 
right now is our goal difference and I
believe<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.190> ahead<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.399> goal

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.920 
believe I'm just ahead on goal
difference<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.329> said<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> last

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
difference but like I said in the last

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.810 
difference but like I said in the last
episode<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.739> literally<00:00:41.100> comes<00:00:41.370> down<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> this

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820

episode it literally comes down to this
game<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.239> my<00:00:42.780> game<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.079> against<00:00:43.649> QPR<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
game so my game is against QPR and I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.630 
game so my game is against QPR and I

believe Fulham are against Swansea so it
is<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> nail-biting<00:00:48.870> finish

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is going to be a nail-biting finish

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.770 
is going to be a nail-biting finish
anyways<00:00:50.100> um<00:00:50.399> early<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.969> into<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> game<00:00:51.480> about

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
anyways um early on into the game about

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.479 
anyways um early on into the game about
20<00:00:52.079> minutes<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.129> were<00:00:53.250> some

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
20 minutes in you know there were some

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.830 
20 minutes in you know there were some
chances<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.059> around<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.480> honest<00:00:54.719> with

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
chances going around to be honest with

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.420 
chances going around to be honest with
you<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.140> actually<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.770> stale<00:00:56.010> game<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you is actually a bit of a stale game in

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.069 
you is actually a bit of a stale game in
the<00:00:56.520> sense<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.660> much<00:00:57.840> just

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the sense that it was very much just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.479 
the sense that it was very much just
back<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.500> forth<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:58.949> nothing<00:00:59.340> really

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
back and forth there was nothing really

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.639 
back and forth there was nothing really
happening<00:01:00.090> early<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.260> starts

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
happening early on as you can see starts

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.959 
happening early on as you can see starts
to<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:01.920> an<00:01:02.039> early<00:01:02.100> chance<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
to get an early chance there but I

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
to get an early chance there but I
played<00:01:03.210> him<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> wrong<00:01:03.780> side<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
played him on the wrong side you know I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.840 
played him on the wrong side you know I
played<00:01:04.680> him<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.220> hand<00:01:05.430> side<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
played him on that right hand side and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
played him on that right hand side and
sometimes<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.990> enjoy<00:01:07.290> playing<00:01:07.680> him<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
sometimes I enjoy playing him on that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
sometimes I enjoy playing him on that
left<00:01:08.369> side<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.299> he<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.600> actually

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
left side just so that he can actually

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.929 
left side just so that he can actually
score<00:01:10.229> some<00:01:10.409> near<00:01:10.560> post<00:01:10.770> goals<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.280> um<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.640> was

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
score some near post goals but um I was

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.429 
score some near post goals but um I was
playing<00:01:12.180> him<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.510> right<00:01:12.689> hand<00:01:13.049> side<00:01:13.290> so

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
playing him on that right hand side so

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.690 
playing him on that right hand side so
they<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.740> cut<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> don't<00:01:14.460> know<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
they can cut in but I don't know if I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.340 
they can cut in but I don't know if I
approach<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.240> correctly<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.200> just

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
approach that correctly because it just

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
approach that correctly because it just
wasn't<00:01:16.740> working<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.130> too<00:01:17.310> well<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.490> me<00:01:17.700> but

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
wasn't working out too well for me but

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.510 
wasn't working out too well for me but
halftime<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.740> Swansea<00:01:19.740> were<00:01:19.890> winning<00:01:20.100> three

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
halftime and Swansea were winning three

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
halftime and Swansea were winning three
nil<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.330> literally<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> best<00:01:22.049> news<00:01:22.500> ever

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
nil that is literally the best news ever

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.980 
nil that is literally the best news ever
I<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.119> happy<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> saw<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:24.900> were

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
I was so so happy when I saw they were

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.749 
I was so so happy when I saw they were
winning<00:01:25.170> three<00:01:25.439> now<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> had<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
winning three now and now all I had to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.660 
winning three now and now all I had to
do<00:01:27.049> was<00:01:28.049> make<00:01:28.259> sure<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> didn't<00:01:28.979> lose<00:01:29.130> five<00:01:29.400> mil

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
do was make sure I didn't lose five mil

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
do was make sure I didn't lose five mil
or<00:01:29.820> something<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.540> miles

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
or something like that because miles

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600 
or something like that because miles
already<00:01:31.380> ahead<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.829> goal<00:01:32.040> difference<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.490> were

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
already ahead on goal difference we were

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.609 
already ahead on goal difference we were
tied<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.970> points<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.659> even<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.170> lose<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
tied on points so even if I lose this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.200 
tied on points so even if I lose this
then<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.979> both<00:01:35.189> still<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.520> tied<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.820> points<00:01:35.850> but

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
then we both still be tied on points but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.069 
then we both still be tied on points but
I<00:01:36.240> still<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> better<00:01:36.840> goal<00:01:37.049> difference

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
I still have a better goal difference

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109 
I still have a better goal difference
unless<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:38.040> lost<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.490> something<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.850> five

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
unless I lost like something like five

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.030 
unless I lost like something like five
nil<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:39.390> four<00:01:40.380> nail<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.710> something<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:40.979> that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
nil or four nail or something like that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.429 
nil or four nail or something like that
so<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:42.000> literally<00:01:42.329> down<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.990> wire<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
so it was literally down to the wire and

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.580 
so it was literally down to the wire and
once<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.549> saw<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.030> were<00:01:45.060> losing<00:01:45.479> sorry<00:01:46.439> not

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
once I saw that we were losing sorry not

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.630 
once I saw that we were losing sorry not
that<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.890> were<00:01:47.009> losing<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.579> were

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that we were losing would they were

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.100 
that we were losing would they were
losing<00:01:47.850> three<00:01:48.149> nil<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.659> made<00:01:48.810> me<00:01:48.840> feel

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
losing three nil it kind of made me feel

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.980 
losing three nil it kind of made me feel
so<00:01:49.409> much<00:01:49.680> easier<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:50.970> Remy<00:01:51.509> goes<00:01:51.840> ahead

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
so much easier but then Remy goes ahead

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.690 
so much easier but then Remy goes ahead
of<00:01:52.229> rockets<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.829> into<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> top<00:01:53.369> left-hand

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
of rockets one into the top left-hand

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.429 
of rockets one into the top left-hand
corner<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> set<00:01:55.079> me<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.229> edge

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
corner and that kind of set me on edge

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.810 
corner and that kind of set me on edge
because<00:01:55.680> i<00:01:55.829> also<00:01:56.040> thought<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.520> Fulham

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
because i also thought you know Fulham

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
because i also thought you know Fulham
could<00:01:57.030> come<00:01:57.240> back<00:01:57.390> maybe<00:01:57.899> pull<00:01:58.170> out<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> draw

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
could come back maybe pull out a draw

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.560 
could come back maybe pull out a draw
you<00:01:58.860> know<00:01:58.979> maybe<00:01:59.130> make<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> 3-3<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.180> second

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you know maybe make it 3-3 in the second

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.850 
you know maybe make it 3-3 in the second
half<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:00.990> more<00:02:01.200> than<00:02:01.320> capable<00:02:01.439> if

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
half because that's more than capable if

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.679 
half because that's more than capable if
Swansea<00:02:02.399> were<00:02:02.640> able<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> score<00:02:03.180> three<00:02:03.420> against

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
Swansea were able to score three against

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.330 
Swansea were able to score three against
him<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.899> first<00:02:04.110> half<00:02:04.259> I'm<00:02:04.469> sure<00:02:04.950> Fulham

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
him in the first half I'm sure Fulham

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.830 
him in the first half I'm sure Fulham
could<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> same<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> second

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
could do the same to them in the second

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.930 
could do the same to them in the second
half<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.710> really<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.340> nervous<00:02:08.670> with

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
half so I was really really nervous with

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
half so I was really really nervous with
that<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.239> really<00:02:09.479> late<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.959> into<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> game<00:02:10.440> in

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
that but really late on into the game in

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.080

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.379 
these guys is sort of and wages just
mainly<00:04:10.709> because<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.250> didn't<00:04:11.880> really<00:04:12.060> play<00:04:12.239> with

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
mainly because I didn't really play with

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.520 
mainly because I didn't really play with
them<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:12.690> don't<00:04:12.900> know<00:04:12.989> if<00:04:13.019> they're<00:04:13.230> worth<00:04:13.349> it
