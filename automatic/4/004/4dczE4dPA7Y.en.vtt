00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 We will introduce the Livebird SE (Shining Edition), which was made by modifying the Rapid Morphin series Livebird this time. 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:21.749
 As you can see, there are differences from games and anime, but the result is Zetsubo-like, but forgive me 

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:40.602
 The tires are floating and you can not travel 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:50.639
 My feet are sticking out ... 

00:00:55.017 --> 00:00:59.017
 Do not look from the back (^ ^; 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Let's transform it to robot mode 

00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.541
 Super fast deformation! 

00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:22.172
 First remove the upper mower 

00:01:25.496 --> 00:01:35.496
 Then remove the left and right parts 

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:57.200
 Raise the wings and remove the front part 

00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:03.080
 By the way, all parts removed so far are surplus parts 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Make the left and right legs straight and turn the toes forward 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:47.230
 Open the wings sideways and point the orange wings up 

00:02:52.463 --> 00:03:14.460
 Lower arm 

00:02:52.463 --> 00:03:16.460
 Lower arm 

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:29.650
 Rotate the shoulder parts 

00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:26.470
 Lower the tire on your foot 

00:04:28.088 --> 00:04:58.090
 Take out the tire stored in the upper mower and attach it to the shoulder ... 

00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:08.700
 It is the completion of the library SE robot mode! 

00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:21.110
 The right wing goes down soon (^ ^; 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:35.700
 It's been a long time, so I will hold the weapon and pose next time 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Thank you for your viewing!
