00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 I gave it to the alien. 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.750
 Yes, sir . This time, on the contrary, yes. 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.450
 Forward to my gourmet 5 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.910
 It's the first thing in the state book . 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.490
 End / It is recommended to see 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:28.140
 4 2 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.700
 Is it late to work to accelerate to the upper right child ah ? 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.850
 Okay, so we've to try new drugs once as you turn on the second plate 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.030
 You'll also have time jjyon So I tried a little over 4 steps 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.030
 character 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 Our mother did not find a way to really get a helmet Hou 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.019
 We will from easy operation from the inside so that the mom's example ohsigo 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.239
 It's all right. 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:01:03.149
 This way you can turn it so you have to turn your head back like this. 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:07.570
 For example, Mother would do to someone who just good hold in their hands 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:15.220
 It 's good to go inside. 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:21.070
 The two parties thus saw a lean bow inward so the incoming position 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:25.240
 It's a very real fact that I have been doing so since the domestic market . 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.800
 Then the Officer will have two head support before head on the head 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:34.960
 I am weak in the lower body, I keep the lower body parts, I believe in the upper body. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.600
 When you feel the first time you have the other was fixed in this state and the lower body 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.880
 It can be rather burdensome. 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:47.829
 This is why I do not want to use muscle 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:55.979
 When you feel loved bear right words moon and then back to the shoulders as you 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:55.979
 Even taking the move ah jusimyeonseo operation both will be fine so 4 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:08.729
 My mother is almost completely new, 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.009
 So you may as well doegetneyo body but this time you put up a hand for example, 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:18.030
 The first time you have to 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:22.230
 It can be rather central to knowing that you are comfortable. 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.480
 The wet saliva put forward the better it is as hard Fold 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:32.610
 Because exercise can be more central and easier to write 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.020
 Possible range ah I thought I would call 110 comfortably 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.400
 Yes 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:45.870
 Well, this is a really funny thing. 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.670
 I think if I beat my rhythm for the first time, 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.590
 When 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.280
 Here is a narrow plastic card that will not break, so if you are in the right hemisphere 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.300
 If you practice a lot more, it will be an investigation . 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.710
 Now who embraced you ever wondered exceedingly minute but it's something where you do this 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:09.870
 4 Or how breathing is what happens when the nerves are not specifically use this 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:13.770
 Breathing is very important when you are in motion, for example, 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.240
 So when you come in, it's better to breathe. 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:23.640
 Clear air in the air This is what we call oriental medicine 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:30.330
 Do take the 2000 road when you leave the hand outwards to exhale the breath 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:34.800
 It's good, but the aoso- non-physiological air sacs that are produced in our bodies are like us. 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:40.410
 I mean, I mean, it's like sending out a bun, so your hands go in. 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.650
 When you exhale the breath coming out of work when the drinking brought a breath hands outward 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.330
 This behavior is much more helpful. 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.480
 Well , there's something like that. 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.320
 However , since it is optimal, 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.370
 It is important to balance things and to feel 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.850
 If you are in the middle, do not miss it. 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:08.340
 This is the key to slowing down and then 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.720
 It is a good idea to concentrate your mind as much as possible . 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.880
 I understand. 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:18.720
 This action itself is rather difficult for the first time 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.270
 I'm confused because I do not know where to go this way. 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:27.650
 How do you adjust 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.650
 You 'll see this behavior again through the screen . 

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:48.860
 wie ein oder to 5 

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:48.860
 U 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:09.400
 Here heunhideul missed the time when I Let stand point of paralysis 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.080
 It is late so I can express it like this . 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.450
 Practicing Gym 2 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.250
 Well, you know , as well as tomorrow's gym exercises to prevent this stroke 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:24.610
 It's ready. 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:27.330
 The HR will respond just 30 minutes further broke powder when ah negative meaning 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.330
 Flying
