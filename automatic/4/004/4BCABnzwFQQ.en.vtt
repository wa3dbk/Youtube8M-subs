00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.369 
side our microUSB and our volume rocker
here<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:08.280> top<00:02:08.789> there's<00:02:09.060> nothing<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
here up top there's nothing and on the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.090 
here up top there's nothing and on the
other<00:02:10.500> side<00:02:10.879> without<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.030> camera

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
other side without a camera

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.210 
other side without a camera
interesting<00:02:16.290> looks<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.500> camera<00:02:18.070> but

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
interesting looks like a camera but

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.620 
interesting looks like a camera but
there's<00:02:18.370> also<00:02:18.520> one<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.910> back<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.450> have

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
there's also one in the back so I have

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.330 
there's also one in the back so I have
to<00:02:19.750> check<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.110> out<00:02:20.350> see<00:02:20.590> exactly<00:02:20.950> what<00:02:21.220> that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
to check that out see exactly what that

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.780 
to check that out see exactly what that
is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.160 

so<00:02:24.790> here<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> back<00:02:25.270> we've<00:02:25.450> got<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.630> camera

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
so here in the back we've got a camera

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.000 
so here in the back we've got a camera
and<00:02:27.570> looks<00:02:28.570> like<00:02:28.720> you're<00:02:28.900> using<00:02:28.930> JBL<00:02:29.590> speakers

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
and looks like you're using JBL speakers

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.410 
and looks like you're using JBL speakers
so<00:02:30.160> there's<00:02:30.370> looks<00:02:30.850> like<00:02:31.030> there's<00:02:31.210> another

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
so there's looks like there's another

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.760 
so there's looks like there's another
speaker<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.900> back<00:02:32.020> which<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.260> pretty<00:02:32.410> cool

hopefully battery life is really good
but<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.900> expect<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.470> be<00:04:37.560> because<00:04:38.040> the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
but I expect it to be because the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.350 
but I expect it to be because the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
to put these through their paces and see

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.789 
to put these through their paces and see
exactly<00:04:55.440> how<00:04:55.830> will<00:04:56.100> they<00:04:56.310> stack<00:04:56.580> up
