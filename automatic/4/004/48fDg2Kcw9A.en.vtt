hello and welcome to an easy origami bat

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.930 
hello and welcome to an easy origami bat
video<00:00:03.710> this<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> bat<00:00:05.190> that's<00:00:05.430> very<00:00:05.670> easy<00:00:05.819> to

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
video this is a bat that's very easy to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.639 
video this is a bat that's very easy to
make<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.390> would<00:00:06.509> be<00:00:06.660> fun<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.049> Halloween<00:00:07.470> or

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
make and would be fun and Halloween or

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.549 
make and would be fun and Halloween or
anytime<00:00:08.010> really<00:00:08.960> start<00:00:09.960> with<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.139> square<00:00:10.530> of

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
anytime really start with a square of

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.000 
anytime really start with a square of
origami<00:00:11.040> paper

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
origami paper

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.410 
origami paper
I'd<00:00:13.880> then<00:00:14.120> make<00:00:14.330> a<00:00:15.550> fold<00:00:16.550> along<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:16.970> diagonal

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
I'd then make a fold along the diagonal

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:26.470 
I'd then make a fold along the diagonal
as<00:00:17.510> we're<00:00:17.690> showing<00:00:17.900> here<00:00:25.000> increase<00:00:26.000> that<00:00:26.180> fold

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
as we're showing here increase that fold

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.700 
as we're showing here increase that fold
well<00:00:30.640> next<00:00:31.640> we're<00:00:31.760> going<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.000> fold<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.419> paper

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
well next we're going to fold the paper

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:50.439 
well next we're going to fold the paper
in<00:00:33.710> half<00:00:33.770> like<00:00:34.280> this<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:48.790> then<00:00:49.790> unfold<00:00:50.269> that

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
in half like this and then unfold that

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.540 
in half like this and then unfold that
last<00:00:50.750> fold<00:00:53.530> you'll<00:00:54.530> take<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.830> bottom<00:00:55.220> edge

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
last fold you'll take the bottom edge

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.119 
last fold you'll take the bottom edge
and<00:00:56.120> fold<00:00:56.839> it<00:00:56.960> up<00:00:57.080> to<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.320> top<00:00:58.659> leave<00:00:59.659> about

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
and fold it up to the top leave about

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.810 
and fold it up to the top leave about
one<00:01:01.129> centimeter<00:01:01.400> or<00:01:01.790> so<00:01:03.129> at<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.280> top<00:01:04.489> point

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
one centimeter or so at the top point

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:14.350 
one centimeter or so at the top point
visible

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.680 

are<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.690> fold<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.080> top<00:01:16.470> point

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
are you going to fold down the top point

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.289 
are you going to fold down the top point
just<00:01:18.690> like<00:01:18.840> we're<00:01:18.990> showing<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:20.119> don't<00:01:21.119> fold

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
just like we're showing here don't fold

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:36.740 
just like we're showing here don't fold
it<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.630> way<00:01:21.780> over<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:35.750> next

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it all the way over just like that next

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
it all the way over just like that next
we're<00:01:36.930> going<00:01:37.050> to<00:01:37.110> make<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> mountain<00:01:37.740> fold<00:01:37.950> in

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
we're going to make a mountain fold in

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.609 
we're going to make a mountain fold in
the<00:01:38.399> piece<00:01:40.340> like<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:45.200> then<00:01:46.200> next<00:01:46.380> we're

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the piece like this then next we're

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.210 
the piece like this then next we're
going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> make<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.869> valley<00:01:48.869> fold<00:01:49.020> along<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
going to make a valley fold along the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:01.249 
going to make a valley fold along the
line<00:01:50.399> I'm<00:01:50.610> showing<00:01:50.940> here<00:01:57.289> so<00:01:58.289> from<00:01:58.560> the<00:02:00.259> base

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
line I'm showing here so from the base

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.520 
line I'm showing here so from the base
of<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.590> head<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> bat<00:02:03.470> through<00:02:04.470> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
of the head of the bat through the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:15.780 
of the head of the bat through the
bottom<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> body

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.100 

look<00:02:16.790> at<00:02:16.910> these<00:02:17.030> over<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.540> do<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:17.960> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
look at these over and do that on the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:39.520 
look at these over and do that on the
other<00:02:18.200> side<00:02:20.350> again<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.560> same<00:02:21.770> line

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.530 

all<00:02:40.530> right<00:02:40.740> now<00:02:41.670> what<00:02:41.820> we're<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> do<00:02:42.300> is

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
all right now what we're going to do is

all right now what we're going to do is
fold<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.620> edge<00:02:43.860> here<00:02:44.250> onto<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.180> front<00:02:45.480> edge

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:59.250 

like<00:02:48.870> this

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
we're going to make a valley fold along

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:31.070 
we're going to make a valley fold along
this<00:03:19.620> line<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:30.090> repeat<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:30.960> the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
this line and repeat that on the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.250 
this line and repeat that on the
backside<00:03:38.360> now<00:03:39.360> all<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.690> need<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.840> do<00:03:40.020> is<00:03:40.110> hold
