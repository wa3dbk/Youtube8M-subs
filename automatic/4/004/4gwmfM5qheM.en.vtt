00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.629
 this time they have lent us the 

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:07.100
 newly presented sony xperia media 4 lo 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.470
 that would be the next version of the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.790
 sony and good measure the truth is that 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.860
 It is very similar to its versions 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.690
 previous and what would be in the pot 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.970
 and they were leaving me very good 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.530
 impressions is great this is 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.550
 great this phone and good if you 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.870
 you want to know you already know what you have 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.870
 what do you do here while you 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.369
 good guys we already have in our 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.050
 hands the sun and hesperia m4 and good the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.220
 true that looks pretty good for how 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 be seeing the design as always 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.480
 we have the main part we have 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.400
 at the top what would be the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 front speaker the sound logo on the 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.960
 left part we have the sensors and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 next would be the 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.550
 Your account is a 5-inch screen 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.590
 with resolution hd and it would be and despite having 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.150
 of being accessed and not passing nor height hdn 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.610
 to 2 here the truth that looks frankly 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.829
 well if we go down we find as always 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.600
 the keypad inside the screen and the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.820
 low part we would not find a speaker 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.770
 frontal also like the part of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 above we turn the phone over 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.580
 we found a design very similar to that of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.259
 the pot and good we found in the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.540
 top of the camera that is 3 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.229
 megapixels and just below what is the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 flash led 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.920
 - the logo of nfc we lowered a bit the logo 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.350
 of sony and in the bottom 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.759
 only the logo of xperia if 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.410
 we go around the edges we have to in the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.090
 He blew right we have the lock button 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.640
 and unlocking and just below would be the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.740
 volume up and down buttons on the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.399
 part below we have a specific button 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.909
 the photographs we found what would be 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.130
 the connector the slot for microsd and not 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.110
 we would have nothing else we got to the edge 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.970
 top we have the 3.5 jack and what 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.159
 it would be a microphone and the part below 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.750
 we have another microphone and some speakers 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.360
 the phone as we have said has 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.729
 resolution would be 5 inches and comes 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.810
 with android lollipop let's check it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.810
 here in the settings 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.900
 and 5.0 lollipop 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.330
 the phone the truth that is nothing 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.180
 weighs only 150 grams in 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.210
 how much size would it have 145.5 millimeters 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.120
 high 72 6 millimeters wide and one 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.980
 7.3 mm thickness the machinery 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.070
 that would make this terminal possible would be a 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.140
 msm8960 processor and 9 that would be 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.750
 octa core processor is worth 4 of these 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.710
 cores would work at 1.5 gigahertz and 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.410
 4 others would work at a gigahertz 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.060
 this would be accompanied by 2 gb of ram and 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.870
 also its internal memory would be 8 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.130
 gigabytes 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 this would be expandable that we have seen 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.240
 before by microsd cards good equal 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.950
 that your previous models would be 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.900
 totally resistant to water and dust 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.490
 and would be currently equipped as soon as 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.420
 to connectivity I would not have bluetooth wifi 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.220
 in kind wifi direct 4g etc its battery 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.990
 would be 2400 milliamps 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.230
 and according to what they told us we had 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.730
 tested would last two days with a use 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.960
 half two whole days is what we have been 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.460
 said what will have to check if this 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.380
 it's true or not in terms of colors 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.790
 available there would be three colors in this 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.470
 case we have here the coral that I liked 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.420
 pretty and good we would also have the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.100
 white and black the screen is a 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.630
 hd screen that really quite well 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.310
 and well let's put a video so that 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.510
 you can appreciate in the quality 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.770
 who has the screen and who looks 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.150
 pretty good even though I do not have 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.150
 2 hd resolution 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.939
 i 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.800
 we go to the camera a camera of 5 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.540
 megapixels and the rear camera 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.000
 we found that a camera of 3 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.770
 megapixels with the exmor r sensor that 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.150
 tenacity and you are seeing there I have the 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.200
 fast photos but well it would not be 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.580
 the terminals that you go faster 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.620
 taking and well so we've already 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.790
 known the new sony comedy sony 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.920
 xperia m4 we hope you liked it 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.960
 we swallow the comments crisis that 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.340
 do you think of your terminal and good 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.990
 remember that we are here in modern west 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.310
 let's upload a bunch of videos 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.930
 right now we're going to leave two more 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.760
 videos of two other frames pretty 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.870
 interesting so if three and yes 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.100
