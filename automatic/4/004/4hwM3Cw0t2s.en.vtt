Pistons<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.120> break<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.810> dirt<00:02:28.020> if

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
Pistons are and just break the dirt if

that<00:02:30.810> hard<00:02:31.050> mean<00:02:31.440> it's<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.740> same<00:02:32.010> thing<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:33.240> to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
that hard mean it's the same thing so to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.030 
that hard mean it's the same thing so to
wire<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.290> Pistons<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.640> went<00:02:35.880> back<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.390> I

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
wire the Pistons I just went back here I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.240 
wire the Pistons I just went back here I
used<00:02:38.270> these<00:02:39.270> things<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:40.080> keep<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.980> connection

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
used these things to keep the connection

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.060 
used these things to keep the connection
running<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:43.020> run<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.440> all<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.680> way<00:02:43.830> back<00:02:44.010> here

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
running and run it all the way back here

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.620 
running and run it all the way back here
and<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:44.490> basically<00:02:44.760> what<00:02:45.030> i<00:02:45.060> did<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.420> i<00:02:45.480> just

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
and then basically what i did is i just

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.030 
and then basically what i did is i just
made<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> little<00:02:45.990> room<00:02:46.110> up<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.650> wiring

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
made a little room up here the wiring

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.510 
made a little room up here the wiring
room<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.459> i<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.240> went<00:02:48.480> boom<00:02:48.870> boom<00:02:49.260> boom<00:02:49.560> with

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
room and i just went boom boom boom with

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.590 
room and i just went boom boom boom with
the<00:02:51.620> redstone<00:02:52.620> repeaters<00:02:53.040> boom<00:02:54.000> boom<00:02:54.270> boom

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
the redstone repeaters boom boom boom

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.840 
the redstone repeaters boom boom boom
and<00:02:54.989> that's<00:02:55.590> all<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.100> takes<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> where<00:02:56.640> it's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and that's all it takes to where it's

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.650 
and that's all it takes to where it's
super<00:02:57.750> simple<00:02:58.010> wire<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.220> back<00:02:59.250> down<00:02:59.640> here<00:03:01.340> too

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
super simple wire it back down here too

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.979 
super simple wire it back down here too
and<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:04.230> get<00:03:04.470> your<00:03:04.590> lever<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.520> can<00:03:05.989> turn

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
and I get your lever and you can turn

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.190 
and I get your lever and you can turn
them<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.680> off<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.750> can<00:03:09.840> put<00:03:10.020> on<00:03:10.170> your

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
them on and off so you can put on your

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.960 
them on and off so you can put on your
footing<00:03:10.620> now<00:03:10.830> I'm<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:11.820> it

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
footing now I'm going to just do it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.340 
footing now I'm going to just do it
