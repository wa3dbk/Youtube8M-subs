00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.680
 intrinsic adventure 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.300
 you know morgan handbook although you do not believe it 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 he is a really exceptional boy 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.830
 I remember when I used to drink tea with him 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
 flying over a faucet beyond 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.560
 the lower hills were about 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.560
 fantastic times 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.539
 this is a more seen organ the seen 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.539

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.420
 this is where I start to introduce 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.930
 an argument to rebut the health of 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.830
 one of intelligence and let's go atoms 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.970

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.970
