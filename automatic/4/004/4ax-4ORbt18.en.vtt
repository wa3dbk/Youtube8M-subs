00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the game pace a lot and I one thing that

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.810 
the game pace a lot and I one thing that

can<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:31.949> playing<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.520> uncaged<00:00:33.329> I'm

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
can see here I'm playing on uncaged I'm

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
can see here I'm playing on uncaged I'm
not<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.170> sure<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.410> they<00:00:34.680> even<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
not really sure if they even use the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
not really sure if they even use the
cage<00:00:35.579> map<00:00:35.880> anymore<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:37.170> really

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
cage map anymore I don't really

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.290 
cage map anymore I don't really
understand<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> big<00:00:38.340> differences<00:00:38.969> but

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
understand what the big differences but

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.799 
understand what the big differences but
yeah<00:00:39.809> uncaged<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.820> my<00:00:42.480> bed<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
yeah uncaged is not really I my bed the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.410 
yeah uncaged is not really I my bed the
the<00:00:43.680> cages<00:00:44.129> barely<00:00:44.520> use<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.879> now<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.270> just

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the cages barely use now now it's just

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
the cages barely use now now it's just
uncaged<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:46.980> see<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.399> think

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579

it's<00:00:47.989> was<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.530> when<00:00:49.680> he<00:00:49.739> scoped<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.190> but

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it's was a know when he scoped in but

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.510 
it's was a know when he scoped in but
