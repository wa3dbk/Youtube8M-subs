these flowers don't last very long only

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.229 
these flowers don't last very long only
a<00:02:10.289> couple<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.560> days<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.069> put<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.760> outside<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
a couple of days I put it outside the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.470 
a couple of days I put it outside the
garage<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.989> be<00:02:13.110> quite<00:02:13.319> honest

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
garage to be quite honest

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.640 
garage to be quite honest
there's<00:02:15.480> there's<00:02:15.810> an<00:02:15.930> odor<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:16.530> it's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
there's there's an odor to it but it's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.110 
there's there's an odor to it but it's
not<00:02:16.770> nearly<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.250> strong<00:02:17.400> as<00:02:17.520> some<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
not nearly as strong as some of the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.100 
not nearly as strong as some of the
varieties<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.720> Voodoo<00:02:19.590> lilies<00:02:19.920> or<00:02:20.130> or<00:02:21.110> what

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
varieties of Voodoo lilies or or what

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
else are they called corpse flowers or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.100 
else are they called corpse flowers or
whatever<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.390> looking<00:02:27.750> fantastic

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
whatever it's it's looking fantastic

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.350 
whatever it's it's looking fantastic
it's<00:02:29.040> actually<00:02:29.430> starting<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.760> shrivel<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:30.180> at

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
it's actually starting to shrivel up at

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
it's actually starting to shrivel up at
the<00:02:30.450> base<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:32.460> will<00:02:32.640> end<00:02:33.300> up<00:02:33.480> going<00:02:34.040> what's

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the base so it will end up going what's

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.680 
the base so it will end up going what's
the<00:02:35.160> flower<00:02:35.370> dies<00:02:35.610> then<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.540> new

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the flower dies then that the the new

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.540 
the flower dies then that the the new
growth<00:02:36.900> will<00:02:37.110> start<00:02:37.380> but<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.070> just<00:02:38.340> want<00:02:38.520> to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
growth will start but I just want to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
happens later on when the bulb size gets

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.110 
happens later on when the bulb size gets
much<00:02:50.730> bigger

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
much bigger

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.410 

top<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> spike<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.520> far<00:03:47.820> we're<00:03:48.000> at<00:03:48.060> 22

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
top of the spike so far we're at 22

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.390 
top of the spike so far we're at 22
inches<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:49.200> don't<00:03:49.800> think<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.100> it's<00:03:50.220> going<00:03:50.340> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
inches I don't think that it's going to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.610 
inches I don't think that it's going to
grow<00:03:50.580> too<00:03:50.820> much<00:03:50.850> taller<00:03:51.300> than<00:03:51.420> 22<00:03:51.960> inches<00:03:51.990> but

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
grow too much taller than 22 inches but

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.820 
grow too much taller than 22 inches but
we'll<00:03:52.770> see<00:03:53.390> as<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.690> can<00:03:54.780> see<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.260> flower<00:03:55.590> is

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
we'll see as you can see the flower is

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.980 
we'll see as you can see the flower is
starting<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.280> develop<00:03:56.400> right<00:03:56.820> here<00:03:57.240> there<00:03:57.780> is

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
starting to develop right here there is

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.660 
starting to develop right here there is
no<00:03:58.200> smell<00:03:58.560> at<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.890> point<00:03:59.660> the
