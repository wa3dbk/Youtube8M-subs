pretty heavy has a lot of gain more gain

metal shamans gain set to noon let's put
you<00:00:44.390> up<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:44.510> around<00:00:44.780> 2<00:00:45.110> or<00:00:45.140> 2<00:00:45.650> o'clock

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 

and<00:01:03.809> pretty<00:01:04.559> heavy<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.430> kicking<00:01:05.670> game

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
and pretty heavy it's kicking game

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
and pretty heavy it's kicking game
towards<00:01:06.570> three<00:01:07.020> o'clock<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> notice

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
towards three o'clock if you notice

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.210 
towards three o'clock if you notice
there's<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> bit<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.970> noise<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> signal

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
there's a bit of noise in the signal

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.410 
there's a bit of noise in the signal
just<00:01:11.220> flip<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> noise<00:01:11.759> gate<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.270> that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
just flip the noise gate and all that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.719 
just flip the noise gate and all that
disappears<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.290> when<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.310> using<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.580> noise

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
disappears and when you're using a noise

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.190 
disappears and when you're using a noise
gate<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.149> important<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> adjust<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
gate it's important to adjust the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.510 
gate it's important to adjust the
sensitivity<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.920> release<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.430> your

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
sensitivity and release to your

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.109 
sensitivity and release to your
preferred<00:01:17.820> playing<00:01:18.720> style<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:20.280> typically

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
preferred playing style and I typically

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.249 
preferred playing style and I typically
find<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.509> when<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.720> face<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.049> knobs

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
find that when you face the knobs

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.660 
find that when you face the knobs
towards<00:01:22.619> each<00:01:22.740> other<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.580> good

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
towards each other that's a really good

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.039 
towards each other that's a really good
place<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> start<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.600> definitely

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
place to start because you definitely

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.610 
place to start because you definitely
don't<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.409> notes<00:01:25.560> getting<00:01:25.860> cut<00:01:26.100> off

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.710 

here<00:01:34.620> that<00:01:34.800> it<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.700> chops<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.300> out<00:01:36.450> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
here that it just chops right out so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 
here that it just chops right out so
keep<00:01:37.050> that<00:01:37.140> pretty<00:01:37.350> high<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.830> everything

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
keep that pretty high and everything

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.800 
keep that pretty high and everything
will<00:01:38.610> come<00:01:38.640> through<00:01:38.970> except<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.660> noise

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
will come through except all the noise

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
will come through except all the noise
and<00:01:40.080> with<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> release<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.490> set<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
and with the release I like to set that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.300 
and with the release I like to set that
up<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.720> high<00:01:42.840> we're<00:01:43.590> really<00:01:43.770> low<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.010> guess

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
up really high we're really low I guess

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:59.950 
up really high we're really low I guess
for<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:45.510> tight<00:01:45.720> sound

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.830 

and<00:02:00.080> cut<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.950> mids<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.190> bit<00:02:01.420> boost<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.570> level

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
and cut the mids a bit boost the level

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.870 
and cut the mids a bit boost the level
to<00:02:02.900> compensate<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:04.340> let's<00:02:04.490> hear<00:02:04.610> how<00:02:04.760> this

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
to compensate and let's hear how this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:15.670 
to compensate and let's hear how this
sounds

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.210 

Oh

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.130 

pinched<00:02:21.220> harmonics<00:02:21.370> will<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.269> fly<00:02:22.720> from

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
pinched harmonics will just fly from

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.350 
pinched harmonics will just fly from
this<00:02:23.260> pedal<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.860> rips<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.180> game

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
this pedal it just rips and the game

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.179 
this pedal it just rips and the game
isn't<00:02:25.840> even<00:02:25.870> maxed<00:02:26.290> out<00:02:26.409> yet<00:02:26.650> let's<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.099> ahead

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
isn't even maxed out yet let's go ahead

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.100 
isn't even maxed out yet let's go ahead
and<00:02:27.370> crank<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.760> cut<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.450> mids<00:02:28.659> a<00:02:28.750> little<00:02:28.959> more

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
and crank it cut the mids a little more

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:49.630 
and crank it cut the mids a little more
and<00:02:29.849> see<00:02:30.849> how<00:02:30.879> it<00:02:31.150> sounds

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.550 

pedals<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.700> monster<00:02:51.090> let's<00:02:51.989> push<00:02:52.379> in<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
pedals a monster let's push in the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.890 
pedals a monster let's push in the
brutality<00:02:53.159> this<00:02:53.849> brings<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.360> more<00:02:54.599> low-end

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
brutality this brings in more low-end

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.229 
brutality this brings in more low-end
range<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.709> makes<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.310> sound<00:02:56.580> even

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
range and just makes the sound even

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:11.980 
range and just makes the sound even
bigger<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:57.690> pretty<00:02:58.200> nuts

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.230 

it<00:03:12.990> still<00:03:13.260> sounds<00:03:13.620> pretty<00:03:13.680> tight<00:03:14.100> although<00:03:14.940> I

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
it still sounds pretty tight although I

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.210 
it still sounds pretty tight although I
do<00:03:15.300> like<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.600> attenuate<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.740> bass<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> little

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
do like to attenuate the bass a little

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.830 
do like to attenuate the bass a little
bit<00:03:17.430> with<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.610> bass<00:03:17.760> knob<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.360> keep<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.780> in

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
bit with the bass knob so keep that in

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.080 
bit with the bass knob so keep that in
mind<00:03:19.050> if<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.380> really<00:03:19.620> want<00:03:19.800> some<00:03:20.040> extra<00:03:20.280> extra

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
mind if you really want some extra extra

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.580 
mind if you really want some extra extra
low-end<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.780> think<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.020> brutality<00:03:22.500> is

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
low-end but you think the brutality is

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.640 
low-end but you think the brutality is
too<00:03:23.250> much<00:03:23.520> just<00:03:24.480> cut<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.230> back<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.470> bit

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
too much just cut it back a little bit

00:03:25.650 --> 00:04:13.650 
too much just cut it back a little bit
and<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.550> like<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.820> boost<00:03:27.210> the<00:03:27.360> highs<00:03:27.510> just<00:03:27.870> alone

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.710 

and<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:15.010> thing's<00:04:15.310> pretty<00:04:15.520> heavy<00:04:15.640> let's<00:04:16.390> push

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
and this thing's pretty heavy let's push

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.930 
and this thing's pretty heavy let's push
in<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.959> disintegrates<00:04:17.590> this<00:04:18.010> gives<00:04:18.250> us<00:04:18.520> more

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
in the disintegrates this gives us more

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.880 
in the disintegrates this gives us more
gain<00:04:19.270> and<00:04:19.590> an<00:04:20.590> extended<00:04:21.100> harmonic<00:04:21.880> range<00:04:22.180> so

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
gain and an extended harmonic range so

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.540 
gain and an extended harmonic range so
it<00:04:23.890> just<00:04:24.070> gets<00:04:24.220> more<00:04:24.520> wicked<00:04:26.310> there's<00:04:27.310> still

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
it just gets more wicked there's still

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.480 
it just gets more wicked there's still
plenty<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:28.000> clarity<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:28.570> really<00:04:28.810> like<00:04:28.990> how

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490
