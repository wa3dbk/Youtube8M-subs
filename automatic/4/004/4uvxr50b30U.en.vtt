00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.570
 but now we will make leaves for 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.930
 leaves we will need to take 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.849
 the wire is thicker in me is green 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.880
 color wire on this no role 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.840
 especially what color can you have 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.989
 there is a golden color can take such 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.920
 we are getting a little electric on it 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.440
 yellow beads further we use those 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.149
 the beads that are recruited just now 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.780
 for wire for small loops i 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.769
 I twist the wire while leaving 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.690
 long piece about 10 centimeters 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:03.530
 can be longer can be shorter in general by 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:12.320
 we twist them differently 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:15.470
 counting 9 beads and cut off now I 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.470
 make sharp petals french 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:30.370
 by method but from two rows only 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:30.370
 consist of one row and now 2 more are doing 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.140
 further tail if too long 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:58.040
 we cut off hiding it inside out 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.740
 cork can be twisted with pliers 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:06.050
 you can hands who can twist them 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.170
 Now, about the number is one 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:16.000
 such a petal we have here six axes on 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.340
 one axis we need five petals 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.530
 so we just need to need 30 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.890
 of course you can of course less 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.320
 Well, this one was made exactly the same 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.330
 5 petals on each axis 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.080
 why the number of petals is different 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.870
 yes because if you took meter 20 too 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.550
 you got five and a half 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.630
 centimeter in diameter here is this black 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.760
 the middle means 30 petals will be 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.910
 look like this in my opinion this 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.640
 enough this little they 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.850
 often and not densely located just right 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.340
 if you have a black center less than 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.980
 example they did only half 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.709
 Naturally 30 pieces it will be very 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.430
 many you will not be so thick 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.739
 look that ugly, too, if you 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.019
 made the middle one more up to 30 pieces 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.980
 it is very rare to be so meager 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.730
 sunflowers so you need more than 30 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.739
 petals 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.630
 this is for this diameter well 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:25.820
 coming here I made 6 piles of 5 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.470
 petals so here they look 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.540
 now what am i doing i stack everything 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:37.450
 wrong side wrong side 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.450
 one to another pile do this 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.090
 leveling and twisting but twisting not 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.049
 the base itself but about 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:54.680
 the middle is easy to grab at first 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:57.230
 hands then pliers obtained 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.810
 here is such a bunch of five we need 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.030
 to give 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.270
 just stretch like this a little bit and 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.390
 everything is ready for this next I twist 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.030
 all 6 beams 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.410
 now it is necessary to fasten these bunches 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.690
 to the back here with these axes for 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.269
 This I cut here such delays 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.160
 You can shorter than this length 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.270
 doesn't matter everything hides inside 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:30.200
 so not scary, I take 1 bunch 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:33.000
 we put it face down 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.110
 leaves a little bit like that 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.840
 as if this side is not all equal 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:44.510
 now this one 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:51.590
 the wire I cling to the axis between the rows 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:55.610
 so this one is just twisting the pliers 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.610
 fasten very tight 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:12.950
 now the remaining tails down and 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.950
 then bend up to the center 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.420
 then she still gain a foothold for the central 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.070
 the axis will hold tight at all 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.340
 outside that is the front side here it is 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.030
 That 's what I look like I don't do one row 2 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.210
 a row is just such a row 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:37.010
 so as not to gustin to look 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.010
 I cling all others similarly
