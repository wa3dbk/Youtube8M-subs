00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.380
The Canon G15 is the upgrade to the popular
two-year-old G12.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.410
At first glance, the 12.1 million pixel G15
seems very similar to the G12, but there are

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.530
quite a few notable physical differences.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.250
For starters, the dials on the top of the
camera are now stacked and overlapping, and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.240
both on the right side of the camera.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.010
The dedicated ISO dial found on the G12 is
also now missing.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.960
The lens has had a bit of a refresh, being
the first Canon G-series compact camera to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.550
feature an f/1.8 optic.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.340
This maximum aperture reduces down to a still
respectable f/2.8 at the telephoto end.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.080
It’s a 5x optical zoom, making it the equivalent
of 28-140mm.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.190
You zoom in and out via this small switch
around the shutter release.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.190
It’s pretty smooth and quiet to use, and
you can activate digital zoom when not shooting

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.900
in raw format.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.630
Probably the biggest difference between this
and the G12 is the screen, which is no longer

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.630
articulating.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.210
Instead, there’s a fixed 3-inch 920,000
dot device.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.170
It’s a pretty decent performer in bright
light, avoiding glare and reflections most

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.999
of the time, however it’s a shame that Canon
hasn’t chosen to include the same touchscreen

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.639
which can be found on the smaller Powershot
S110.

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:15.320
Not having an articulating screen, and a sleeker
body than its predecessor, makes this a much

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.740
more pocketable camera.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.990
You’ll also notice that the finger grip
is a little less pronounced than before, but

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.299
it’s still pretty easy to hold – while
the textured covering gives you confidence

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.560
when holding the camera in one hand.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.159
Canon’s G series cameras have always been
aimed pretty squarely at the enthusiast photographer,

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.240
and as such the G15 has a number of direct
access dials and button designed to appeal

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.590
to this kind of user.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.119
At the top of the camera is a dial for quickly
changing between the various modes the camera

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.119
offers.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.020
You’ve got fully automatic, fully manual,
semi-automatic and scene, digital filter and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.109
movie modes here.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.869
There’s also space for two sets of custom
settings – which is useful if you often

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.630
find yourself shooting in any given situation,
such as low light.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.159
Slightly underneath this dial is an exposure
compensation dial, which can be quite easily

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.030
reached with the thumb.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.959
Although there’s no direct ISO dial anymore,
a simple tap of this button on the back of

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.810
the camera gives you access to sensitivity
settings.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.670
A small dial at the top of the finger grip
is used to alter aperture and shutter speed

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.500
– depending on the mode being used – and
is very easy to access, again when shooting

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.709
one-handed.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.400
Changing the autofocus points is done by pressing
this button here and scrolling around with

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.040
this dial, or by pressing one of the four
way directional keys.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.989
It’s fairly easy to do, but a touchcreen
would have made it much quicker.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.180
If you need to capture a lot of fast action,
it’s probably easier to set the focus point

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.209
to the middle and focus and recompose.

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.091
Other direct access buttons include this one
for changing the metering mode, this one for

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.920
changing the focusing mode and this one for
changing the flash mode.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.780
Most of the commonly used settings can be
accessed via this Function menu, which means

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.810
you don’t have to delve into the full menu
every time you need to change something.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.629
Here you’ll find settings such as white
balance, continuous shooting, aspect ratio

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.280
and raw format shooting.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.799
It would have been nice if Canon had found
room for an extra customisable button somewhere

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.650
on the body so you could have immediate access
to an extra, commonly used setting.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.780
Images taken straight from the camera are
bright, vibrant and punchy.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.790
There’s also lots of detail, with the f/1.8
aperture lens allowing for some beautiful

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.340
shallow depth of field effects to be achieved.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.989
