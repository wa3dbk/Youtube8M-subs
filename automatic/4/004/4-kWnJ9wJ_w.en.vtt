00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
into this thing and turn it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.889 
into this thing and turn it
anti-clockwise<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.699> that's<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.270> way<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
little bit I'll just pop out like so and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.200 
little bit I'll just pop out like so and
you're<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> slide<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> batteries<00:01:09.450> out

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
you're going to slide the batteries out

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.410 
you're going to slide the batteries out
take<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.390> new<00:01:12.540> batteries<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:14.150> insert<00:01:15.150> them

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
take your new batteries and insert them

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.460 
take your new batteries and insert them
with<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> plus<00:01:16.320> side<00:01:16.650> which<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> bit

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
with the plus side which is this bit

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.749 
with the plus side which is this bit
down<00:01:19.970> first<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.750> right<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:23.450> like<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
down first so right there like so and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.580 
down first so right there like so and
the<00:01:26.759> minus<00:01:27.119> side<00:01:27.330> facing<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.950> tube

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
the minus side facing out of the tube

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.749 
the minus side facing out of the tube
and<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:32.040> how<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and that's how you do it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.660 
and that's how you do it
the<00:01:33.270> Awkward<00:01:33.689> bit<00:01:33.869> now<00:01:34.220> you're<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> have

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the Awkward bit now you're going to have

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.710 
the Awkward bit now you're going to have
to<00:01:35.909> take<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.439> put<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.799> back<00:01:37.950> rather

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
to take this and put it back rather

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
to take this and put it back rather
fiddly<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.960> push<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.090> make

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
fiddly so you push it like that make

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.819 
fiddly so you push it like that make
sure<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> keep<00:01:45.570> stays<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
sure I keep stays in it's not going to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.359 
sure I keep stays in it's not going to
fall<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.520> you're<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:49.369> keep

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
fall out and you're going to keep

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.670 
fall out and you're going to keep
pushing<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.390> turn<00:01:51.899> at<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.200> same<00:01:52.439> time

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
pushing down and turn at the same time

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760 
pushing down and turn at the same time
now<00:01:52.939> this<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.149> done<00:01:54.329> you're<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> want<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
now this is done you're going to want to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.880 
now this is done you're going to want to
turn<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.219> around<00:01:57.110> horizontally<00:01:58.110> again<00:01:58.380> so

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
turn it around horizontally again so

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.859 
turn it around horizontally again so
it's<00:01:59.340> tight<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> fall

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it's tight and it's not going to fall

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.240 
it's tight and it's not going to fall
out<00:02:01.049> easily<00:02:01.939> that's<00:02:02.939> how<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.329> replace<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
out easily that's how you replace the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.620 
out easily that's how you replace the
batteries<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> wireless<00:02:05.820> keyboard<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
batteries on a wireless keyboard and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.949 
batteries on a wireless keyboard and
this<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.649> exactly<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> same<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.569> Magic

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
this is exactly the same for the Magic

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.330 
this is exactly the same for the Magic
Trackpad<00:02:11.150> thank<00:02:12.150> you
