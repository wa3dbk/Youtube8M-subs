today<00:00:01.170> I'd<00:00:01.500> like<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.800> look<00:00:02.040> at<00:00:02.190> four<00:00:02.429> different

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
today I'd like to look at four different

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.240 
today I'd like to look at four different
vibrato<00:00:03.120> techniques<00:00:03.780> vibrato<00:00:04.589> is<00:00:04.859> when<00:00:05.130> we

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
vibrato techniques vibrato is when we

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.340 
vibrato techniques vibrato is when we
repeatedly<00:00:05.819> Bend<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.299> string<00:00:06.600> slightly<00:00:07.230> out<00:00:07.319> of

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
repeatedly Bend a string slightly out of

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.040 
repeatedly Bend a string slightly out of
tune<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.950> back<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.519> again<00:00:08.760> which<00:00:09.570> gives<00:00:09.809> any

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
tune and back in again which gives any

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.919 
tune and back in again which gives any
note<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> sense<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.830> movement<00:00:11.599> it's<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.719> great

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
note a sense of movement it's a great

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.600 
note a sense of movement it's a great
addition<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.380> any<00:00:13.500> guitar<00:00:13.950> players<00:00:14.190> skills

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
addition to any guitar players skills

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.369 
addition to any guitar players skills
and<00:00:14.910> should<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.179> practiced<00:00:15.690> until<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.230> can

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
and should be practiced until you can

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.380 
and should be practiced until you can
perform<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.949> with<00:00:17.160> ease<00:00:19.789> let's<00:00:20.789> start<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.270> my

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
perform it with ease let's start with my

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.700 
perform it with ease let's start with my
personal<00:00:21.930> favorite<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.590> butterfly<00:00:23.189> vibrato

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
personal favorite the butterfly vibrato

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.109 
personal favorite the butterfly vibrato
this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.859> where<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.160> fret<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> note<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.970> move

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
this is where we fret a note and move

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.350 
this is where we fret a note and move
the<00:00:27.330> string<00:00:27.539> from<00:00:27.750> side<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.019> side<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.710> so

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.670 

this<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.660> done<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:33.960> various<00:00:34.380> speeds

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
this can be done at various speeds

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.319 
this can be done at various speeds
depending<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> piece<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.850> music<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.210> are

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
depending on the piece of music you are

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.029 
depending on the piece of music you are
playing

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.880 

we<00:00:43.579> achieved<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.210> vibrato<00:00:44.600> by<00:00:45.050> rotating<00:00:45.710> our

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
we achieved this vibrato by rotating our

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.660 
we achieved this vibrato by rotating our
forearm<00:00:46.489> from<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.820> elbow<00:00:47.829> if<00:00:48.829> I<00:00:49.039> exaggerate

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
forearm from the elbow if I exaggerate

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.639 
forearm from the elbow if I exaggerate
the<00:00:49.789> movement<00:00:50.149> away<00:00:50.269> from<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.659> guitar<00:00:51.019> you

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
the movement away from the guitar you

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.290 
the movement away from the guitar you
can<00:00:51.829> see<00:00:52.010> that<00:00:52.190> it's<00:00:52.309> like<00:00:52.519> turning<00:00:52.850> a<00:00:53.059> key<00:00:53.269> in

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
can see that it's like turning a key in

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.270 
can see that it's like turning a key in
a<00:00:53.479> door<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.140> gives<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.800> fingers<00:00:55.129> an

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
a door and gives the fingers an

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.080 
a door and gives the fingers an
up-and-down<00:00:55.699> movement

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.150 

let's<00:01:00.090> try<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.360> technique<00:01:01.010> fret<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.130> note

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
let's try this technique fret the note

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.700 
let's try this technique fret the note
of<00:01:02.490> C<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> third<00:01:03.450> string<00:01:03.810> fifth<00:01:04.200> fret<00:01:04.320> with

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of C on the third string fifth fret with

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.290 
of C on the third string fifth fret with
your<00:01:04.860> middle<00:01:05.010> finger<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.910> pluck<00:01:07.910> try<00:01:08.910> to<00:01:08.970> move

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
your middle finger and pluck try to move

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.520 
your middle finger and pluck try to move
the<00:01:09.480> string<00:01:09.690> slowly<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.440> side<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.770> side<00:01:15.530> keep

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the string slowly from side to side keep

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.860 
the string slowly from side to side keep
a<00:01:16.650> nice<00:01:16.830> steady<00:01:17.130> rhythm<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.940> this<00:01:18.120> and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
a nice steady rhythm as you do this and

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.390 
a nice steady rhythm as you do this and
make<00:01:19.080> sure<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.620> are<00:01:19.710> creating<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
make sure that you are creating the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.690 
make sure that you are creating the
movement<00:01:20.790> by<00:01:20.970> rotating<00:01:21.510> your<00:01:21.900> arm<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:23.460> may

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
movement by rotating your arm it may

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
movement by rotating your arm it may
help<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.300> you<00:01:24.450> rest<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.870> first<00:01:25.080> finger<00:01:25.440> of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
help if you rest the first finger of

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.140 
help if you rest the first finger of
your<00:01:25.710> fretting<00:01:26.100> hand<00:01:26.130> against<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.910> side<00:01:27.120> of

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
your fretting hand against the side of

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.390 
your fretting hand against the side of
the<00:01:27.300> guitar<00:01:27.720> neck<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:30.920> now<00:01:31.920> try<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the guitar neck like this now try it a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.510 
the guitar neck like this now try it a
little<00:01:32.430> faster

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.100 

we<00:01:38.520> should<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:38.910> go<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.420> try<00:01:39.660> this<00:01:39.720> on

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
we should then go on to try this on

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.670 
we should then go on to try this on
various<00:01:40.619> notes<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.190> different<00:01:41.220> fingers

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.870 

next<00:01:51.580> we'll<00:01:51.880> look<00:01:52.030> at<00:01:52.150> classical<00:01:52.750> vibrato

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
next we'll look at classical vibrato

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.640 
next we'll look at classical vibrato
this<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:55.060> where<00:01:55.240> we<00:01:55.360> fret<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:55.930> pluck<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.440> note

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
this is where we fret and pluck the note

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.800 
this is where we fret and pluck the note
then<00:01:57.340> move<00:01:57.610> our<00:01:57.820> hand<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.510> down<00:01:58.660> the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
then move our hand up and down the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.630 
then move our hand up and down the
direction<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.590> neck<00:01:59.830> while<00:02:00.280> still

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
direction of the neck while still

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.230 
direction of the neck while still
fretting<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.150> string<00:02:01.450> like<00:02:01.960> so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.779 

this<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> very<00:02:07.380> subtle<00:02:07.740> technique<00:02:08.250> which

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
this is a very subtle technique which

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.430 
this is a very subtle technique which
was<00:02:08.940> originally<00:02:09.209> used<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.989> fretless

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
was originally used on fretless

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.290 
was originally used on fretless
classical<00:02:11.039> instruments<00:02:11.520> such<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> cello

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
classical instruments such as the cello

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.809 
classical instruments such as the cello
and<00:02:12.569> violin<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.950> can<00:02:14.099> still<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.370> used<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and violin but can still be used to

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.190 
and violin but can still be used to
great<00:02:15.030> effect<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.569> guitar

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
great effect on the guitar

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.580 
great effect on the guitar
in<00:02:16.819> fact<00:02:17.819> classically<00:02:18.780> trained<00:02:19.020> guitarists

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
in fact classically trained guitarists

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.839 
in fact classically trained guitarists
tend<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> use<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:24.440> thirdly<00:02:25.459> we<00:02:26.459> have<00:02:26.489> what<00:02:26.819> I

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
tend to use this thirdly we have what I

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.470 
tend to use this thirdly we have what I
like<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.209> call<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.510> Clapton<00:02:28.019> vibrato<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:30.300> is

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
like to call the Clapton vibrato this is

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.630 
like to call the Clapton vibrato this is
similar<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.080> butterfly<00:02:31.500> style<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.099> that

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
similar to the butterfly style in that

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.670 
similar to the butterfly style in that
we<00:02:33.269> move<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.630> string<00:02:33.840> from<00:02:33.989> side<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.500> side

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
we move the string from side to side

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
right angle to the neck once again try

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.660 
right angle to the neck once again try
this<00:02:47.260> at<00:02:47.590> different<00:02:47.740> speeds
