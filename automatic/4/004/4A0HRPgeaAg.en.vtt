00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.629 
right so clarify me if I am wrong so
every<00:03:36.569> time<00:03:36.599> they<00:03:36.989> take<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.290> bite<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.829> pair<00:03:38.310> they

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
every time they take a bite a pair they

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.970 
every time they take a bite a pair they
change<00:03:38.970> genders<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.750> when<00:03:40.560> they<00:03:40.709> change

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
change genders and when they change

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.860 
change genders and when they change
genders<00:03:41.519> they<00:03:41.849> can<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.419> bat<00:03:42.569> channel

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
genders they can see the bat channel

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.539 
genders they can see the bat channel
like<00:03:42.989> from<00:03:43.230> what<00:03:43.349> I<00:03:43.560> assume<00:03:44.010> from<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> way<00:03:44.430> it

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
like from what I assume from the way it

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.789 
like from what I assume from the way it
was<00:03:44.609> explained<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.389> they<00:03:45.989> could<00:03:46.199> see<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.590> back

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
was explained is they could see the back

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.400 
was explained is they could see the back
channel<00:03:47.129> only<00:03:47.730> when<00:03:47.970> they<00:03:48.389> are<00:03:48.419> in<00:03:48.660> female

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.470 
channel only when they are in female
form<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:49.949> instance<00:03:50.220> when<00:03:50.340> komatsu<00:03:51.030> or<00:03:51.359> you

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
form for instance when komatsu or you

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.319

that it's like two sides of the same

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.670 
that it's like two sides of the same
coin<00:04:05.730> for<00:04:06.329> instance<00:04:06.629> when<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:06.959> eat<00:04:07.169> one<00:04:07.440> time
