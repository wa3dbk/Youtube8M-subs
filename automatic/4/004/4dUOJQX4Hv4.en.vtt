00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.329
 However, 2010 is the fifth time the Zell region has been in the lead 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.829
 see-kaprun three days and nights meeting point of the national and 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.409
 international field sports will be an exciting match 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.210
 anti-nuclear groups shot from twelve meters 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.520
 on the first day the center of body and scene is that with 7500 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 Euro endowed the test winners 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.890
 At the start are both from seven nations including the Dutchman Bart 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.720
 Brentjens 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.480
 former Olympic champion of Atlanta the Swiss sprinter Kittel Thomas 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.730
 Litscher and last year's winner of Austrian mountain bike good 23 starts 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.970
 and European champion therefore recommends 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.000
 the 400-meter-long route in the center of Gudrun presents itself 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 again very spectacular this year 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.970
 New this year the increased start 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.730
 this takes up the question of whether to get off to the first surge with momentum 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.650
 deal with 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 came again 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.010
 next to known ones 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.090
 stages 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.140
 spray 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.920
 Ditches and tourists have the athletes this year with a show program 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.920
 the knowingly to fight the Salzburg Schnürlregen 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.460
 nevertheless the participants defy the rain and they offer the numerous 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.450
 Spectators along the route thrilling races of the elite and the sports field 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.640
 how much more difficult the rain makes the course have to sacrifice itself but to 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.930
 Take note like every Austrian Wolfgang Korner in his first 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.679
 Run second 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.679
 inside fall all chances to win the final deserved 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.470
 a bitter defeat had mountain bike legend Bart Brentjens 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.700
 plug in a bad start and a too restrained driving style at the beginning of the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.660
 Runs make the mountain bike Olympic champion all the hopes for a 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.660
 Final defeat destroyed 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.209
 the distances dosage find last year's winner Daniel Federspiel the 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.629
 right in the first run underline his favorite role again 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.839
 Arnd Peiffer the Swiss shooting star Lukas Kaufmann 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.279
 his compatriot Christof Bischof 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.449
 very courageously fighting Austrian Gerald Burgsteiner 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.159
 last year third Marco Schätzing from Germany and u 23 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.359
 Wm bronze medalist Thomas Litscher from Switzerland are all of them 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.359
 can deal with the only goal 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.579
 As in the previous year, the Austrian has plenty to cheer about 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.609
 Canadian compatriot Peter Reichel does not like the gains of the Sport Classic 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.239
 Have behavior 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.609
 the just violently 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.010
 he falls back after an unfortunate blowout 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.010
 and therefore is free for last year's winner Peter Pirkner 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.280
 He wins the Game Information all from Germany and Michael Meier 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:18.959
 fitted 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.620
 The rain does not just affect the course of the race 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.850
 also the civil chamber AIS the persistent strong quake does not rise and shows 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.970
 the finish the extra cost muted colors Rossi final the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.789
 umpires 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:35.900
 We climb back into the final of the elite with the use of camera 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.629
 after the start is the joy of the Austrians are the defending champion 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.159
 Daniel many minutes of play 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.270
 Hooray 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.439
 Hagen 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:50.019
 but was already in round two creating the Swiss Matchday in the Bundesliga 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.529
 the connection 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:55.779
 the Swiss is now the rear wheel of the 23-year-old striker and 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.309
 should be a gripping final 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.479
 the Turks are the one to repeat the game and the Swiss go as 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.479
 leader in the last of Sixt finances 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.039
 v here 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.579
 after four minutes and 55 seconds 4 2 led with just under a second 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.049
 Ahead on Daniel Federspiel as tenth of the book goal of 2 2010 over 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:17.789
 the 2 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.720
 hahahahaha Havana 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.979
 Nevertheless, the pleasure of the Ferraristi is their chairs 12th place 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.939
 Mateschitz scored points for him 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.139
 but much bigger than difficult 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.099
 that is that it will succeed 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.449
 the route is clearly lost 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.059
 it was temporarily exceeded, said Wowereit 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.180
 with the life with it are always 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.180
 and in the finals are normal are already fully redeemed 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.499
 Thomas is a research laboratory 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:48.520
 wet track remained 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.529
 Renault with words Platzeck's will 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:51.819
 Rafi rain 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.979
 Alfred Schrenk was relatively smooth but that of the three rooms further to that 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.080
 no objection 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.419
 Way one must drive controlled but also to brook 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.349
 Markwart of Pentz grandchildren therefore therefore better last year I am too 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.259
 ever driven with third party and today I could 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.580
 was actually still open in the fourth quarter I have had third in 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.580
 the last round 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.389
 And something else is new this year, the two victories will be theirs truly 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.030
 Royal ceremonial 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.870
 the title 55 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.059
 That's right today 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.819
 the acceptance especially ten percent 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.360
 in age has been around for almost 40 years and Erich does not expect it 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.499
 I honestly say 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.569
 the Summit third fourth place 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.309
 if it worked out well 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:41.309
 through a defect of aggravate by Gregory 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.960
 the young but the rest of the world reenacted Keith 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.779
 but the technique is right for him 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:49.860
 got better 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.300
 than in the last few years 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.300
 strong participation this year despite the bad weather 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.550
 insanely great event with the whole to look sensational 

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:59.529
 history 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:00.699
 she gave 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.470
 Above all, it is another Dr 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:17.789
 and there and 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.830
 the difficulty also can not be beat 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.559
 were in April 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.669
 after that, it did not matter to St 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.599
 the Dane was a total processor 1 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.400
 Albert have indicated 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.020
 how the acrobats of the airs inspire chatroom 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.510
 and all over the Kitzsteinhorn snowpark 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.930
 show how the next shipment follows counters to cap
