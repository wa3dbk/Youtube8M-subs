00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:14.609
Barco's strategy is to create value for
its shareholders through a focus on professional

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.759
markets for digital visualization systems
and solutions

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.790
To do that
we have identified

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.520
or we have targeted
the entertainment market

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.050
the defense and aerospace business
applications for big video walls

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.230
advanced visualization and solutions for big
video walls and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.740
last but not least
the healthcare market

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.530
So in those four markets
our strategy is to deliver superior quality

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.570
and performance solutions for professional
use

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.410
We stay away from consumer applications

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.590
We focus on solutions for professionals

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.610
In those four markets we apply a very simple
recipe of value creation through leadership

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.110
in three dimensions: the operational excellence
dimension

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.720
the customer intimacy and the technology dimension
or the performance dimension

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.110
In the customer dimension for 2012
I think we made tremendous progress in terms

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.729
of focusing on key customers and on customer
service

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.010
We created a global service organization that
allows us to provide after-sales service to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.479
our customers

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.340
In customer intimacy
we have taken a three-prong approach

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.340
The first part of our strategy was to globalize
the company and to capture the growth momentum

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.340
of emerging countries
such as in Asia, China in particular, as well

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.630
as, in 2012, more specifically Latin America

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.630
The second part of our growth strategy was
to move into the mid-segment

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.150
Not be just a small percentage niche player
with all the ramifications thereof

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.120
but to go and compete for volume in the mid-segment
of the markets we serve

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.310
And again, we have done that very successfully
because today

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.310
in 2012, I can report that all of Barco's
four businesses have become market leaders

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.390
in their specific fields, including in the
value segment of the markets

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.390
The third dimension of our customer intimacy
strategy was to increase the share of wallet

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.730
with those customers by expanding our capabilities
and to offer customers additional parts of

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.280
the solutions set
not just the projector or just the display

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.890
For example, in digital cinema
we've added the media server and are moving

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.319
that into the projector

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:16.319
We've also added Auro 11.1 sound this
is a good example of how we enhance the value

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.330
of the customer relationship through a system-led
approach

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.000
and integrate its system approach
rather than just a product approach

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.780
These three elements have created exponential
growth for us over the three years 2010

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:43.030
11 and 12 and we believe that we are well-positioned
to continue that growth momentum into the future

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.030
In the technology dimension
Barco has launched a number of technological

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.540
innovations
such as laser technology for digital cinema projectors

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.000
or the uncompressed

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.680
latency-free solutions for the medical industry
with our Nexus platform for the digital operating room

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.480
to mention just two

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.260
And finally, in the operational excellence
dimension

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.260
great progress has been made in 2012 in terms
of bringing our warranty costs down and giving

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:28.349
customers products that are more reliable
because the quality is state of the art

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:35.349
is best in class and because, through volume,
we have learned to produce our products more

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.759
efficiently

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:44.439
This has allowed us to make better margins
or increase profitability without having to

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.150
raise prices with our customers

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.259
So Barco is doing well in these three dimensions
and that's why we are winning market share

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.979
That's why we are becoming leaders in our
field

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:03.949
And I'm happy to say that in 2012
Barco became a global leader in essentially

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.629
all four of its core markets
meeting financial objectives of double-digit

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:16.629
growth
approximately 15% EBITDA and

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.979
finally, more than 20% return on capital employed

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.020
Ambitious targets
not necessarily always met by every division

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.990
every year
but in 2012 we came very close to essentially

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.629
meeting our expectations in pretty much everything
we did

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.110
That's why 2012 was a fantastic year for us

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.509
and that's why I'm happy to thank everybody
who contributed to these results
