the line when you should just continue

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.380 
the line when you should just continue
attacking<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> mean<00:02:05.729> you've<00:02:05.880> got<00:02:06.000> no<00:02:06.119> say

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

on<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> find<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.970> very

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
on that and that I find that very

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.639 
on that and that I find that very
disappointing<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> want<00:02:10.619> to

have more of a influence on the game I
don't<00:02:13.200> think

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
don't think

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.819 
don't think
I<00:02:13.430> went<00:02:13.670> over<00:02:13.879> on<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.030> game<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.390> choosing<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
I went over on the game is choosing the

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.429 
I went over on the game is choosing the
style<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:17.030> know<00:02:17.150> scrum<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.870> scrum<00:02:18.170> play

style of you know scrum the scrum play
the<00:02:18.829> lineout<00:02:19.220> play<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:20.150> where<00:02:20.720> the

that<00:03:17.060> just<00:03:17.299> doesn't<00:03:17.510> happen<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.230> know<00:03:18.319> you

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
that just doesn't happen you know you

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.000 
that just doesn't happen you know you
just<00:03:18.579> there<00:03:19.579> i<00:03:19.609> think<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:19.970> fatigue<00:03:20.919> there's<00:03:21.919> a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
just there i think the fatigue there's a

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.890 
just there i think the fatigue there's a
fatigue<00:03:22.340> feature<00:03:22.940> that's<00:03:23.180> very<00:03:23.480> good<00:03:23.750> you

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
fatigue feature that's very good you

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.449 
fatigue feature that's very good you
know<00:03:23.989> if<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.169> play<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.949> players<00:03:25.160> play<00:03:25.400> too

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
know if you play the players play too

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.390 
know if you play the players play too
much<00:03:25.760> then<00:03:26.060> they<00:03:26.419> going<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.230> be<00:03:27.530> tired<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.190> not

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
much then they going to be tired and not

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.490 
much then they going to be tired and not
be<00:03:28.579> able<00:03:28.699> to<00:03:29.060> play<00:03:29.629> well<00:03:29.900> or<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.169> day<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:30.440> I

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
be able to play well or the day and I

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.949 
be able to play well or the day and I
think<00:03:30.680> that's<00:03:30.829> really<00:03:31.010> good<00:03:31.310> but<00:03:32.000> tactically

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
think that's really good but tactically

you're saying does ring bells and you
know<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.330> do

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
know I do

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.370 
know I do
I<00:04:27.370> do<00:04:27.580> agree<00:04:27.910> with<00:04:28.240> anything<00:04:28.480> you<00:04:28.870> wanna<00:04:29.139> add

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
I do agree with anything you wanna add

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.430 
I do agree with anything you wanna add
anything<00:04:29.410> on<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.190> um<00:04:31.260> not<00:04:32.260> precisely

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
anything on to that um not precisely

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.250 
anything on to that um not precisely
just<00:04:33.070> like<00:04:33.669> with<00:04:33.880> football<00:04:34.389> or<00:04:34.630> something<00:04:34.780> I

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
just like with football or something I

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260 
just like with football or something I
think<00:04:35.740> it's<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.919> good<00:04:36.070> platform<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.669> develop<00:04:36.880> on

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
think it's a good platform to develop on

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.190 
think it's a good platform to develop on
but<00:04:37.419> they<00:04:37.540> need<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.690> have<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.930> lot<00:04:38.169> of

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
but they need to have a lot of

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.690 
but they need to have a lot of
improvement<00:04:38.830> if<00:04:38.950> they<00:04:39.100> are<00:04:39.280> going<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.550> bring

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
improvement if they are going to bring

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.750 
improvement if they are going to bring
out<00:04:39.850> an<00:04:39.970> annual<00:04:40.360> game<00:04:40.960> occur<00:04:41.230> just<00:04:41.650> bring<00:04:42.550> in<00:04:42.700> a

with<00:05:21.040> that<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:22.210> know<00:05:22.240> as<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.020> person<00:05:23.830> who<00:05:23.889> just

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
with that you know as a person who just

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.370 
with that you know as a person who just
won<00:05:24.250> at<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.520> gate<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.910> come<00:05:25.090> out<00:05:25.270> a<00:05:25.600> week<00:05:26.080> ago<00:05:26.200> I

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
won at the gate to come out a week ago I

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.260 
won at the gate to come out a week ago I
would<00:05:26.440> say<00:05:26.740> no<00:05:26.950> just<00:05:27.280> let<00:05:27.430> it<00:05:27.550> come<00:05:27.669> out<00:05:27.790> but<00:05:28.030> I

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
would say no just let it come out but I

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.000 
would say no just let it come out but I
think<00:05:28.720> maybe<00:05:28.840> a<00:05:28.990> month<00:05:29.139> in<00:05:29.380> development<00:05:29.860> and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
think maybe a month in development and

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.890 
think maybe a month in development and
added<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.669> couple<00:05:30.790> more<00:05:31.000> features<00:05:31.450> and<00:05:31.479> added

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
added a couple more features and added

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.680 
added a couple more features and added
the<00:05:32.020> more<00:05:32.229> tactical<00:05:33.039> approach<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:34.090> tactic<00:05:34.539> we

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
the more tactical approach the tactic we

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.200 
the more tactical approach the tactic we
are<00:05:34.810> just<00:05:35.110> very<00:05:35.169> disappointed<00:05:35.910> yep<00:05:36.910> so<00:05:37.180> I

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
are just very disappointed yep so I

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.210 
are just very disappointed yep so I
guess<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:37.690> final<00:05:37.840> question<00:05:38.350> is<00:05:38.530> do<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:39.100> think

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
guess the final question is do you think

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.980 
guess the final question is do you think
people<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.880> haven't<00:05:40.090> already<00:05:40.419> got<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.810> game

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
people that haven't already got the game

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
on my channel about I just think it's a

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.850 
on my channel about I just think it's a
bit<00:06:40.400> too<00:06:40.430> slow<00:06:40.880> and<00:06:40.910> boring<00:06:41.270> for<00:06:41.750> YouTube<00:06:42.530> but

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
bit too slow and boring for YouTube but

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.830 
bit too slow and boring for YouTube but
you<00:06:43.100> know<00:06:43.280> it's<00:06:43.550> good<00:06:43.790> good<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:44.450> pass<00:06:44.600> some

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
you know it's good good to pass some

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.540 
you know it's good good to pass some
time<00:06:44.870> good<00:06:45.380> to<00:06:45.620> create<00:06:46.040> your<00:06:46.070> own<00:06:46.190> team<00:06:46.520> and

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
time good to create your own team and

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.990 
time good to create your own team and
manage<00:06:47.030> it<00:06:47.210> and<00:06:47.450> I<00:06:47.780> think<00:06:48.500> Sinai<00:06:49.040> of<00:06:49.310> a<00:06:49.430> long

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
manage it and I think Sinai of a long

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.610 
manage it and I think Sinai of a long
way<00:06:50.150> to<00:06:50.210> go<00:06:50.450> by<00:06:50.660> I<00:06:50.690> think<00:06:50.960> it's<00:06:51.110> one<00:06:51.290> step<00:06:51.470> in

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
way to go by I think it's one step in

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.310 
way to go by I think it's one step in
the<00:06:51.680> right<00:06:51.830> direction<00:06:52.540> yeah<00:06:53.540> definitely<00:06:53.870> and

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
the right direction yeah definitely and

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.920 
the right direction yeah definitely and
also<00:06:54.680> think<00:06:54.890> people<00:06:55.610> you<00:06:56.210> guys<00:06:56.420> should<00:06:56.600> go<00:06:56.690> buy

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
also think people you guys should go buy

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.930 
also think people you guys should go buy
it<00:06:56.960> if<00:06:57.170> you<00:06:57.260> want<00:06:57.470> to<00:06:57.620> have<00:06:58.310> a<00:06:58.340> go<00:06:58.640> forward

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
it if you want to have a go forward

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.750 
it if you want to have a go forward
because<00:06:59.900> they<00:07:00.290> they<00:07:00.590> obviously<00:07:00.770> they<00:07:01.280> never

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
because they they obviously they never

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.550
