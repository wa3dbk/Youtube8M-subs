00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
of do a visual inspection inside I know

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
of do a visual inspection inside I know
that<00:00:42.900> most<00:00:43.739> drivers<00:00:44.180> don't<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.330> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
that most drivers don't have the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.390 
that most drivers don't have the
capability<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> taking<00:00:46.229> the<00:00:46.470> top<00:00:46.650> lid<00:00:46.920> off<00:00:47.100> and

proper position make sure the oil spool

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.010 
proper position make sure the oil spool
make<00:01:50.140> sure<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> coolant<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.700> full<00:01:52.020> especially

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
make sure the coolant is full especially

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.969

if<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.640> closed<00:01:54.640> loop

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
if you have a closed loop

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.899 
if you have a closed loop
cooling<00:01:56.400> system<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:59.070> basically<00:01:59.400> after<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
cooling system and basically after the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.520 
cooling system and basically after the
unit<00:02:00.270> starts<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.720> want<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.960> make<00:02:01.080> sure<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
unit starts you want to make sure that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.490 
unit starts you want to make sure that
of<00:02:02.310> course<00:02:02.670> all<00:02:03.090> your<00:02:03.390> vents<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:03.810> open<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
of course all your vents are open and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.850 
of course all your vents are open and
not<00:02:04.950> closed<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.780> proper<00:02:07.170> airflow<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
not closed so you get proper airflow in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.970 
not closed so you get proper airflow in
the<00:02:07.890> cab<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:09.630> after<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> unit<00:02:10.590> starts<00:02:12.980> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the cab and after the unit starts you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.040 
the cab and after the unit starts you
can<00:02:14.130> basically

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
can basically

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.420 
can basically
kind<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.440> listen<00:02:16.770> for<00:02:17.150> unusual<00:02:18.150> toys<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:20.190> you

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
kind of listen for unusual toys that you

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.960 
kind of listen for unusual toys that you
can<00:02:20.580> let<00:02:21.860> service<00:02:22.860> facility

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
can let service facility

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.460 
can let service facility
