00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
the character you're like forced to have
a<00:01:52.350> character<00:01:52.830> in<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.979> story<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.400> which<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
a character in the story but which I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.190 
a character in the story but which I
thought<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.360> gonna<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.659> set<00:01:54.840> me<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.049> first

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
thought was gonna have set me at first

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.960 
thought was gonna have set me at first
but<00:01:55.650> it<00:01:55.770> actually<00:01:56.130> pulls<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.640> through<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
but it actually pulls you through the

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.840 
but it actually pulls you through the
story<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.659> much<00:01:57.840> better<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.579> get<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850

understand<00:02:00.450> what's<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.229> because<00:02:01.470> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
understand what's going on because you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.620

the fireworks so they had bullets first

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.860 
the fireworks so they had bullets first
and<00:06:32.520> my<00:06:32.640> writer<00:06:32.850> and<00:06:33.060> my<00:06:33.150> Ron<00:06:33.420> I'm<00:06:33.570> probably

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
and my writer and my Ron I'm probably

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.990 
and my writer and my Ron I'm probably
wrong<00:06:34.170> but<00:06:34.560> the<00:06:35.130> moves<00:06:35.370> and<00:06:35.520> those<00:06:35.700> are<00:06:35.850> really

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
wrong but the moves and those are really

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.060 
wrong but the moves and those are really
nice<00:06:36.240> they're<00:06:36.540> all<00:06:36.690> different<00:06:37.110> it's<00:06:37.590> not<00:06:37.800> the

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
nice they're all different it's not the

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.410 
nice they're all different it's not the
same<00:06:38.340> thing<00:06:38.610> so<00:06:38.760> you're<00:06:38.910> not<00:06:39.000> playing<00:06:39.270> the
