00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.440
 boy I ask 4 j studies that are 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.720
 the development team of the version of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.879
 console in the future version if they are going to 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.680
 be able to implement a type of kraft eo 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.360
 like the pc version the basic punishment 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.650
 that is to say he grew that there is always a 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.530
 pc version in the room then in 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.360
 resources and low the grid of three 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.909
 by three where you put the resources of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.530
 question and you can do things and 4j 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.690
 studies he referred to you're 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.820
 referring to the classical criterion the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.860
 classic cracking option and clear the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.930
 boy will have created a plan there is god 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.940
 who are working on it and it's here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.590
 achilles wheeler without wanting to clear 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.030
 apparently four jacks study is 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.560
 working on implementing the fret 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.390
 traditional in the console version 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.740
 I really like the news because of 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.780
 that you already know that the console version 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.579
 plastic are automatic is to say you 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.810
 you have the resources and once you have 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.329
 some resources for example if you have 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.890
 unrefined wood for the table the 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.320
 inventory and at the time of spending 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.030
 say so you can create 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 automatically refined wood with a 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.479
 only button you do not have to do any 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.070
 movement of jeaustin or anything but 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.799
 Of course what people want is to have the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.210
 minecraft essential plastic is not the 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.950
 essence of mike what to do things 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.929
 on your own and not just playing 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.929
 a simple button but you moving the 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.340
 objects to the fretting table and clear on 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.049
 the creative mind I know for example a beak 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.850
 put two sticks and three wooden or 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.080
 three stone or whatever that is what 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.909
 that people want within the version 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.020
 of console and really also the idea 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.909
 I think it's good 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.950
 that we can alternate been using the 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.090
 classic version the classic classic or the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.340
 fret that is already adapted to the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.349
 console version really I think that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.209
 he grew traditional the one in the version 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:15.250
 of pc is a social punishment is minecraft 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.530
 science for a while is like 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.000
 that gives him life and no longer casts or 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.650
 time to spend what you like to do 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.570
 the mine we are going to spend the site this is 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.530
 project I think I would be pretty cool 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.740
 they implemented it too 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.900
 we do not know us here below really 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.190
 encourage the idea I liked and good to me 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.870
 I really like the news always and 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.670
 when they can alternate well 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.290
 in a traditional way or of interest 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.390
 mess with the sentimental system 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.230
 console version and good if all at 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.670
