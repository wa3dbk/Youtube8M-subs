00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and all this stuff kind of in sales so

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.690 
and all this stuff kind of in sales so
this<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.530> about<00:01:46.590> twenty<00:01:46.950> percent<00:01:47.159> off<00:01:47.430> but

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this is about twenty percent off but

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.850 
this is about twenty percent off but
think<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.270> works<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.689> eight<00:01:48.990> pounds<00:01:49.710> or

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
think it works out to eight pounds or

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
think it works out to eight pounds or
ten<00:01:50.040> pounds<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.460> something<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.390> nice

I've<00:03:35.030> got<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.359> theory<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:36.230> have<00:03:36.470> obviously

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
I've got this theory I have obviously

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.930 
I've got this theory I have obviously
haven't<00:03:37.099> tried<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.340> out<00:03:37.489> because<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:37.760> haven't

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
haven't tried it out because I haven't

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.909 
haven't tried it out because I haven't
changed<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.540> bedding<00:03:38.690> from<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.680> kind<00:03:39.859> of

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
changed the bedding from the kind of

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.890 
changed the bedding from the kind of
chocolate<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.400> truffle<00:03:40.730> colors<00:03:41.060> but<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:41.540> think

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
chocolate and truffle colors but I think

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.050 
chocolate and truffle colors but I think
it<00:03:42.109> will<00:03:42.230> make<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> big<00:03:42.620> difference<00:03:42.919> i'm<00:03:43.669> hoping

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
it will make a big difference i'm hoping

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.599 
it will make a big difference i'm hoping
it<00:03:44.150> will<00:03:44.269> anyway<00:03:44.630> because<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.319> i<00:03:45.799> never<00:03:46.160> film

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
little bit with it but that was in two

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.280

with<00:04:39.190> twenty<00:04:39.490> percent<00:04:39.670> off<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:40.330> BHS<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.320> the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
with twenty percent off so BHS is the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.470 
with twenty percent off so BHS is the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
apart from these little fairy lights and

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.060 
apart from these little fairy lights and
they<00:05:09.700> are<00:05:09.910> kind<00:05:10.180> of<00:05:10.270> white<00:05:10.570> wicker<00:05:11.110> heart<00:05:11.560> and

they are kind of white wicker heart and

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.850 
they are kind of white wicker heart and
with<00:05:13.060> fairy<00:05:13.660> lights<00:05:13.900> in<00:05:14.110> them<00:05:14.260> and<00:05:14.380> they're<00:05:14.500> 10

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
with fairy lights in them and they're 10

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.320 
with fairy lights in them and they're 10
in<00:05:15.010> there<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.370> they<00:05:15.460> were<00:05:15.520> just<00:05:15.550> how<00:05:16.210> much

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
in there and they were just how much

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.660 
in there and they were just how much
alike<00:05:16.630> six<00:05:16.990> pounds<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:17.590> not<00:05:17.830> bad<00:05:18.010> at<00:05:18.190> all<00:05:18.370> I

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
alike six pounds so not bad at all I

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.310 
alike six pounds so not bad at all I
just<00:05:19.150> thought<00:05:19.300> they'd<00:05:19.540> be<00:05:19.690> a<00:05:19.720> really<00:05:20.080> nice

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
just thought they'd be a really nice

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.230 
just thought they'd be a really nice
addition<00:05:20.980> maybe<00:05:21.160> along<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:21.940> back<00:05:22.210> wall

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
addition maybe along the back wall

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.360 
addition maybe along the back wall
because<00:05:22.960> basically<00:05:23.200> in<00:05:23.590> my<00:05:23.710> bedroom<00:05:24.040> I've<00:05:24.220> got

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
because basically in my bedroom I've got

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.880 
because basically in my bedroom I've got
to<00:05:24.580> kind<00:05:24.850> of<00:05:24.960> deeper<00:05:25.960> chocolate<00:05:26.530> colored

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
to kind of deeper chocolate colored

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.150 
to kind of deeper chocolate colored
walls<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:28.240> lighter<00:05:28.750> colors<00:05:29.290> now<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:29.830> was

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
walls and to lighter colors now I was

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.640 
walls and to lighter colors now I was
initially<00:05:30.370> tempted<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.180> paint<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.900> darker

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
initially tempted to paint the darker

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.170 
initially tempted to paint the darker
colors<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:33.130> two<00:05:33.280> lighter<00:05:33.460> colors<00:05:33.880> if<00:05:34.000> that

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
colors the two lighter colors if that

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.150 
colors the two lighter colors if that
makes<00:05:34.360> sense<00:05:34.570> but<00:05:35.230> rather<00:05:35.470> than<00:05:35.710> all<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.980> fat

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
makes sense but rather than all the fat

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.950 
makes sense but rather than all the fat
of<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.760> as<00:05:36.940> I<00:05:37.090> said<00:05:37.150> leaving<00:05:37.690> my<00:05:37.780> mom

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
of that and as I said leaving my mom

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.270 
of that and as I said leaving my mom
with<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.170> bedroom<00:05:38.500> there<00:05:38.680> she<00:05:38.800> didn't<00:05:39.100> quite

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
with the bedroom there she didn't quite

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.550 
with the bedroom there she didn't quite
one<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:40.180> I<00:05:40.360> thought<00:05:40.540> I<00:05:40.720> think<00:05:40.960> these<00:05:41.260> will<00:05:41.410> do

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
one and I thought I think these will do

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.410 
one and I thought I think these will do
the<00:05:41.680> trick<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:42.130> lighten<00:05:42.280> them<00:05:42.430> up<00:05:42.520> so<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:43.030> don't

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
the trick and lighten them up so I don't

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.970 
the trick and lighten them up so I don't
know<00:05:43.510> exactly<00:05:43.990> how<00:05:44.200> I'm<00:05:44.260> gonna<00:05:44.350> do<00:05:44.620> it<00:05:44.650> but<00:05:44.920> I'm

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
know exactly how I'm gonna do it but I'm

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.010 
know exactly how I'm gonna do it but I'm
gonna<00:05:45.130> pop<00:05:45.340> them<00:05:45.550> along<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.210> back<00:05:46.450> I<00:05:46.720> think

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
gonna pop them along the back I think

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.930 
gonna pop them along the back I think
where<00:05:47.290> my<00:05:47.440> bed<00:05:47.680> sits<00:05:48.040> kind<00:05:48.280> of<00:05:48.340> near<00:05:48.850> the

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
where my bed sits kind of near the

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.480 
where my bed sits kind of near the
headboard<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:49.840> she<00:05:50.680> made<00:05:51.070> me<00:05:51.100> give<00:05:51.340> it<00:05:51.430> a

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
headboard and she made me give it a

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.160 
headboard and she made me give it a
little<00:05:51.610> bit<00:05:51.790> of<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:52.000> brightened<00:05:52.540> up<00:05:52.630> feel<00:05:52.900> there

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
little bit of a brightened up feel there

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.680 
little bit of a brightened up feel there
also<00:05:53.770> will<00:05:54.070> be<00:05:54.130> nice<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.700> in<00:05:55.270> fact<00:05:55.480> going<00:05:55.630> to

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
also will be nice and in fact going to

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.230 
also will be nice and in fact going to
filming<00:05:56.140> hopefully<00:05:56.710> so<00:05:57.130> something<00:05:58.030> nice<00:05:58.210> that

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
filming hopefully so something nice that

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.180 
filming hopefully so something nice that
now<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:59.050> rest<00:05:59.170> of<00:05:59.380> stuff<00:05:59.530> I<00:05:59.710> haven't<00:06:00.040> actually

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
bought and these are the kind of things

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.230 
bought and these are the kind of things
that<00:06:02.560> I'm<00:06:02.650> hoping<00:06:02.920> will<00:06:03.160> make<00:06:03.280> a<00:06:03.640> fair<00:06:04.030> bit<00:06:04.180> of

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
that I'm hoping will make a fair bit of

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.510 
that I'm hoping will make a fair bit of
difference<00:06:04.540> to<00:06:04.900> my<00:06:05.020> room<00:06:05.230> already<00:06:05.620> but<00:06:06.340> I'm

haven't<00:06:16.780> ended<00:06:16.960> up<00:06:17.080> doing<00:06:17.410> anything<00:06:17.500> with

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
haven't ended up doing anything with

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.870 
haven't ended up doing anything with
them<00:06:17.980> because<00:06:18.100> I've<00:06:18.250> had<00:06:18.280> different<00:06:18.760> ideas

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
them because I've had different ideas

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.330 
them because I've had different ideas
for<00:06:19.690> them<00:06:19.930> I<00:06:20.110> mean<00:06:20.530> at<00:06:20.770> one<00:06:20.950> point<00:06:21.160> I'm

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
for them I mean at one point I'm

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.310 
for them I mean at one point I'm
painting<00:06:21.580> like<00:06:21.790> James<00:06:22.120> Bond<00:06:22.450> silhouette<00:06:23.080> this

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
painting like James Bond silhouette this

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.840 
painting like James Bond silhouette this
is<00:06:23.440> around<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:23.890> time<00:06:23.950> when<00:06:24.280> casino<00:06:24.640> royale

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
is around the time when casino royale

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.370 
is around the time when casino royale
came<00:06:25.330> out<00:06:25.540> and<00:06:25.690> i<00:06:25.720> thought<00:06:25.900> it'd<00:06:26.020> be<00:06:26.050> really

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
came out and i thought it'd be really

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.110 
came out and i thought it'd be really
cool<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:27.100> then<00:06:27.370> I<00:06:27.400> never<00:06:27.640> followed<00:06:27.970> it

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
cool and then I never followed it

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.060 
cool and then I never followed it
through<00:06:28.150> and<00:06:28.990> then<00:06:29.110> I<00:06:29.380> thought<00:06:29.770> it<00:06:29.919> would<00:06:30.010> be

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
through and then I thought it would be

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.100 
through and then I thought it would be
nice<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.400> have<00:06:30.460> pictures<00:06:30.910> with<00:06:31.060> instagram<00:06:31.660> and

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
nice to have pictures with instagram and

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.080 
nice to have pictures with instagram and
stuff<00:06:32.350> on<00:06:32.530> there<00:06:32.740> and<00:06:33.010> but<00:06:33.820> now

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
stuff on there and but now

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.180 
stuff on there and but now
I<00:06:34.150> really<00:06:34.389> want<00:06:34.540> that<00:06:34.690> either<00:06:34.810> but<00:06:35.680> one<00:06:35.949> thing

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
I really want that either but one thing

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.650 
I really want that either but one thing
that<00:06:36.340> i<00:06:36.370> have<00:06:36.639> seen<00:06:36.910> which<00:06:37.090> is<00:06:37.210> really<00:06:37.419> caught

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
that i have seen which is really caught

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.110

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
light up that sounds like the most tacky

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.629

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
something with them I'm thinking of

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.570

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
sure quite what yet but then maybe kind

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.040 
sure quite what yet but then maybe kind
of<00:06:54.190> like<00:06:54.340> piercing<00:06:54.940> little<00:06:55.300> holes<00:06:55.540> in<00:06:55.900> the

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
of like piercing little holes in the

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.960 
of like piercing little holes in the
canvas<00:06:56.290> and<00:06:56.710> then<00:06:56.770> popping<00:06:57.580> little<00:06:57.760> fairy

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
canvas and then popping little fairy

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.790 
canvas and then popping little fairy
lights<00:06:58.210> through<00:06:58.540> so<00:06:58.960> it<00:06:59.110> lights<00:06:59.320> up<00:06:59.500> and<00:06:59.740> I've

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
lights through so it lights up and I've

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.180 
lights through so it lights up and I've
got<00:06:59.979> to<00:07:00.400> kind<00:07:01.060> of<00:07:01.180> big<00:07:01.810> ish<00:07:01.990> ones<00:07:02.290> to<00:07:02.740> pop<00:07:02.949> on<00:07:03.130> a

wall<00:07:03.430> and<00:07:03.910> which<00:07:04.419> I<00:07:04.540> think<00:07:04.720> might<00:07:04.870> give<00:07:05.260> it<00:07:05.350> the

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
wall and which I think might give it the

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.710 
wall and which I think might give it the
kind<00:07:05.560> of<00:07:05.710> spruce<00:07:05.979> up<00:07:06.130> that<00:07:06.340> I<00:07:06.370> want<00:07:06.669> so<00:07:06.910> I'm

relatively<00:07:08.139> cheap<00:07:08.440> budget<00:07:08.650> myself<00:07:08.950> so<00:07:09.820> I

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
relatively cheap budget myself so I

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.420 
relatively cheap budget myself so I
might<00:07:10.540> give<00:07:10.990> that<00:07:11.139> a<00:07:11.169> try<00:07:11.260> one<00:07:11.650> weekend<00:07:12.100> when

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430
