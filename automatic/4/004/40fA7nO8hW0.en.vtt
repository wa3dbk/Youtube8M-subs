weapon foundries at the moment we know
of<00:00:13.500> hacker<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:14.429> know<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.820> Oh<00:00:15.000> Merlin<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.450> we

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
of hacker we know of Oh Merlin and we

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
of hacker we know of Oh Merlin and we
know<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.260> service<00:00:16.740> regime<00:00:17.190> now<00:00:17.699> we're<00:00:17.850> not

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
know of service regime now we're not

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.189 
know of service regime now we're not
sure<00:00:18.119> if<00:00:18.150> they<00:00:18.330> were<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.720> any<00:00:18.900> more

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.439 
sure if they were going to be any more
but<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> good<00:00:20.460> look<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:21.060> some<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
eerie vibe from them they look like they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
eerie vibe from them they look like they
could<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> modern<00:00:45.780> shooter<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.590> Call

could be in a modern shooter like Call
of<00:00:46.920> Duty<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.120> real<00:00:48.390> cool<00:00:48.660> feel

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
of Duty they have that real cool feel

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.540 
of Duty they have that real cool feel
about<00:00:49.200> them<00:00:49.410> which<00:00:49.739> we've<00:00:49.920> only<00:00:50.070> seen<00:00:50.340> in

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
about them which we've only seen in

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400 
about them which we've only seen in
weapons<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> christov<00:00:51.629> which<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
weapons like the christov which is the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.380 
weapons like the christov which is the
first-ever<00:00:52.920> weapon<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> game<00:00:53.940> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
first-ever weapon you get in the game so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
first-ever weapon you get in the game so
it's<00:00:54.539> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.840> cool<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.350> weapons<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's kind of cool to see weapons that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
it's kind of cool to see weapons that
more<00:00:56.399> modern<00:00:56.760> feel<00:00:56.969> instead<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
more modern feel instead of that kind of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
more modern feel instead of that kind of
futuristic<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.829> there<00:00:59.129> look<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.760> have

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
futuristic out there look that we have

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
futuristic out there look that we have
with<00:01:00.059> most<00:01:00.300> weapons<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> pretty<00:01:01.530> good

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
with most weapons we get a pretty good

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
with most weapons we get a pretty good
shot<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.219> 3d<00:01:02.609> model<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.180> auto<00:01:03.390> rifle

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
shot of a 3d model of an auto rifle

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.920 
shot of a 3d model of an auto rifle
shotgun<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.339> finally<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.090> pulse<00:01:06.479> rifle

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
shotgun and then finally a pulse rifle

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.929 
shotgun and then finally a pulse rifle
now<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> cool<00:01:07.590> thing<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.860> hackers<00:01:08.250> pulse

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
now the cool thing about hackers pulse

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
now the cool thing about hackers pulse
rifles<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.049> shoot<00:01:10.590> for

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
rifles is that they actually shoot for

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.950 
rifles is that they actually shoot for
birth<00:01:11.250> however<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.820> has<00:01:12.119> been<00:01:12.330> damaged<00:01:12.750> down

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
birth however that has been damaged down

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.230 
birth however that has been damaged down
so<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.290> matches<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.740> 3<00:01:14.130> burst<00:01:14.400> pulse<00:01:14.700> rifle<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
so it matches a 3 burst pulse rifle and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
so it matches a 3 burst pulse rifle and
the<00:01:15.270> fire<00:01:15.960> rate<00:01:16.200> between<00:01:16.409> each<00:01:16.890> burst<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the fire rate between each burst is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
the fire rate between each burst is
actually<00:01:17.939> slightly<00:01:18.180> faster<00:01:18.600> now<00:01:19.080> you'll<00:01:19.229> see

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
actually slightly faster now you'll see

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200 
actually slightly faster now you'll see
this<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:20.009> weapon<00:01:20.369> foundries<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
this with these weapon foundries that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
this with these weapon foundries that
each<00:01:21.390> weapon<00:01:21.659> foundry<00:01:22.200> sort<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.500> has<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> mark

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
each weapon foundry sort of has a mark

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.620 
each weapon foundry sort of has a mark
to<00:01:23.070> its<00:01:23.280> weapons<00:01:23.670> moving<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> next

can I do like that look to it and then

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.020 
can I do like that look to it and then

these weapons look like nothing we have
in<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.159> game<00:02:18.340> at<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.489> moment<00:02:18.790> except<00:02:19.209> for

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
in the game at the moment except for

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.910 
in the game at the moment except for
hard<00:02:19.599> light<00:02:19.780> obviously<00:02:20.230> because<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:20.799> made

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
hard light obviously because it's made

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.649 
hard light obviously because it's made
by<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.099> same<00:02:21.220> manufacturer<00:02:21.939> but<00:02:22.299> it's<00:02:22.480> cool

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
by the same manufacturer but it's cool

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.660 
by the same manufacturer but it's cool
to<00:02:22.780> see<00:02:22.930> these<00:02:23.079> weapons<00:02:23.470> are<00:02:23.620> distinct<00:02:24.280> with<00:02:24.519> a

look from these weapons now you guys are

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.770 
look from these weapons now you guys are
probably<00:02:51.129> most<00:02:51.489> familiar<00:02:51.670> with<00:02:52.060> service<00:02:52.540> but

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
probably most familiar with service but

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.479 
probably most familiar with service but
seeing<00:02:52.989> as<00:02:53.049> we<00:02:53.170> have<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.470> source<00:02:53.799> regime<00:02:54.310> in

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
seeing as we have the source regime in

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.190 
seeing as we have the source regime in
the<00:02:54.819> game<00:02:55.000> at<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.150> moment<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.540> exotic<00:02:55.930> auto

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
the game at the moment the exotic auto

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.470 
the game at the moment the exotic auto
rifle<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.859> we<00:02:57.220> get<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> good<00:02:57.609> look<00:02:57.760> at<00:02:57.909> the<00:02:58.120> 3d

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
rifle and we get a good look at the 3d

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.809 
rifle and we get a good look at the 3d
models<00:02:58.810> for<00:02:59.049> an<00:02:59.170> auto<00:02:59.379> rifle<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.040> scout<00:03:00.639> rifle

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
models for an auto rifle a scout rifle

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.539 
models for an auto rifle a scout rifle
and<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.900> rocket<00:03:02.230> launcher<00:03:02.769> now<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.459> thing

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
and a rocket launcher now the thing

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.580 
and a rocket launcher now the thing
about<00:03:03.819> service<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.750> they<00:03:04.900> are<00:03:04.930> easily

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
about service is that they are easily

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.979 
about service is that they are easily
flexible<00:03:06.189> from<00:03:06.579> close<00:03:06.849> quarters<00:03:07.299> to<00:03:07.599> range

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
flexible from close quarters to range

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.500 
flexible from close quarters to range
quick<00:03:08.590> too<00:03:08.829> powerful<00:03:09.310> fast<00:03:09.849> handling<00:03:10.180> 2<00:03:10.480> hard

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
quick too powerful fast handling 2 hard

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.050 
quick too powerful fast handling 2 hard
hitting<00:03:11.170> all<00:03:11.439> with<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.889> swap<00:03:12.159> of<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.459> few<00:03:12.790> nodes

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
hitting all with the swap of a few nodes

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.059 
hitting all with the swap of a few nodes
so<00:03:13.840> these<00:03:13.959> weapons<00:03:14.319> are<00:03:14.409> going<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.650> be<00:03:14.739> really

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
so these weapons are going to be really
