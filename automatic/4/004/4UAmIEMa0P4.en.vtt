like<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.680> Cantor<00:01:08.549> shea<00:01:08.760> butter<00:01:09.030> gives<00:01:09.710> my

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
like the Cantor shea butter gives my

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
like the Cantor shea butter gives my
hair<00:01:11.119> more<00:01:13.369> definition<00:01:14.369> with<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> curl

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
hair more definition with the curl

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.550 
hair more definition with the curl
because<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> last<00:01:15.630> couple<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> times<00:01:16.110> i<00:01:16.350> did

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
because the last couple of times i did

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.219 
because the last couple of times i did
it<00:01:16.770> i<00:01:16.979> use<00:01:17.490> different<00:01:17.909> products<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.869> see

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it i use different products like I see

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.679 
it i use different products like I see
in<00:01:20.780> one<00:01:21.780> time<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.140> didn't<00:01:22.350> use<00:01:22.500> anything<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.689> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
in one time I didn't use anything and I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.080 
in one time I didn't use anything and I
didn't<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.110> any<00:01:25.409> definition<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.640> Cantu

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
didn't have any definition but the Cantu

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
didn't have any definition but the Cantu
seems<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.600> give<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.290> curl<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
seems to give me more curl and I like it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.450 
seems to give me more curl and I like it
so<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:31.020> guess<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:31.740> trying<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> figure<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.280> how

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
so I guess I'm trying to figure out how

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.210 
so I guess I'm trying to figure out how
to<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.180> length<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.890> my

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
to get more of a length on it because my

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.749 
to get more of a length on it because my
hair<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:36.390> nice<00:01:37.320> length<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.009> pretty<00:01:38.280> long<00:01:38.520> as

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
hair is a nice length is pretty long as

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.020 
hair is a nice length is pretty long as
a<00:01:38.909> medium<00:01:39.329> length<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.409> when<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.000> take<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
a medium length but when I take the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.210 
a medium length but when I take the
twist<00:01:42.360> out<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> looks<00:01:42.840> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> short<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.189> I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
twist out it looks kind of short so I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.800 
twist out it looks kind of short so I
was<00:01:44.310> trying<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.450> do

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
was trying to think of what I could do

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.499 
was trying to think of what I could do
so<00:01:46.140> it'll<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.560> bigger<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:49.130> longer<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.329> is

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
so it'll be bigger and longer so this is

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.679 
so it'll be bigger and longer so this is
how<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.720> looks<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.509> hope<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
how it looks I like it and I hope you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.050 
how it looks I like it and I hope you
guys<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:55.049> doing<00:01:55.079> well<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.740> i'll<00:01:56.549> call<00:01:56.759> more
