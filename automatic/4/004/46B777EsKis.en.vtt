clear to him that you can't judge a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.799 
clear to him that you can't judge a
breaker<00:00:51.149> by<00:00:51.600> how<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.350> looks<00:00:53.149> that<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
breaker by how it looks that you have to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.209 
breaker by how it looks that you have to
push<00:00:55.710> each<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.879> hard<00:00:57.270> off<00:00:58.070> before<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
push each one very hard off before you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.579 
push each one very hard off before you
reset<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.469> okay<00:01:02.870> I've<00:01:03.870> got<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> reset

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
reset it to on okay I've got to reset

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.109 
reset it to on okay I've got to reset
all<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> breakers<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.930> there's<00:01:06.930> no<00:01:07.140> change

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
all the breakers and there's no change

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.429 
all the breakers and there's no change
now<00:01:09.119> maybe<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> those<00:01:09.750> outlets<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
now maybe one of those outlets with the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
now maybe one of those outlets with the
little<00:01:10.710> push<00:01:10.950> button<00:01:11.130> thingy<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.939> gone

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
little push button thingy on it's gone

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.109 
little push button thingy on it's gone
bad<00:01:13.250> GFI<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:15.049> doubt<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.460> they<00:01:17.460> only<00:01:17.759> killed

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
bad GFI I doubt it they only killed

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.920 
bad GFI I doubt it they only killed
power<00:01:19.970> listed<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.150> outlets<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.630> you've<00:01:21.780> got

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
power listed for outlets and you've got

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.710 
power listed for outlets and you've got
the<00:01:22.110> lights<00:01:22.290> out<00:01:22.560> too<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:24.240> what's<00:01:24.479> wrong

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the lights out too then what's wrong

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.289 
the lights out too then what's wrong
well<00:01:25.650> I'd<00:01:25.799> say<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> poor<00:01:27.000> connection

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
well I'd say you have a poor connection

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.960 
well I'd say you have a poor connection
somewhere<00:01:28.110> along<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.500> circuit<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.670> how<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
somewhere along that circuit so how do I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.749 
somewhere along that circuit so how do I
find<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.680> now<00:01:31.680> let's<00:01:31.890> try<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> jiggle

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
find that now let's try the jiggle

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.440 
find that now let's try the jiggle
method<00:01:33.560> pentacle<00:01:34.560> method<00:01:35.009> what's<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.119> well

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
method pentacle method what's that well

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.899 
method pentacle method what's that well
the<00:01:36.540> idea<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.500> try<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.829> disturb<00:01:38.369> poor

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the idea is to try to disturb poor

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.030 
the idea is to try to disturb poor
connection<00:01:39.600> back<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.290> working<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
connection back into working for a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
connection back into working for a
moment<00:01:46.310> then<00:01:47.310> unplug<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.299> sort<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.659> work<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
moment then unplug it sort of work the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.550 
moment then unplug it sort of work the
instant<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.890> plug<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.399> into<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:50.970> outlet

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
instant you plug it into a good outlet

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.069 
instant you plug it into a good outlet
only<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> want<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.640> plug<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.720> where

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
only I want you to plug it in to where

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560 
only I want you to plug it in to where
your<00:01:55.259> bad<00:01:55.439> outlets<00:01:56.040> okay<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570

I waited while Henry got a lamp and
plugged<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.340> told<00:02:02.340> him<00:02:02.820> an<00:02:02.969> old-style

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
plugged it in I told him an old-style

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.050 
plugged it in I told him an old-style
bulb<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> lamp<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:05.250> better<00:02:05.700> than<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
bulb in the lamp is better than a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.800 
bulb in the lamp is better than a
fluorescent<00:02:07.399> okay<00:02:08.399> I'm<00:02:08.580> all<00:02:08.759> set<00:02:08.899> now<00:02:09.899> what

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
fluorescent okay I'm all set now what

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.780 
fluorescent okay I'm all set now what
but<00:02:11.260> first<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.709> need<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.190> way<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.459> keep<00:02:12.730> track

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
but first you need a way to keep track

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.380 
but first you need a way to keep track
of<00:02:13.620> whether<00:02:14.620> your<00:02:15.010> lamp<00:02:15.250> ever<00:02:15.550> flickers<00:02:16.150> on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
of whether your lamp ever flickers on

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.510 
of whether your lamp ever flickers on
them<00:02:16.540> for<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:17.140> split<00:02:17.500> second<00:02:17.980> or<00:02:18.099> more

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
them for a split second or more

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.809 
them for a split second or more
is<00:02:19.330> there<00:02:19.630> any<00:02:19.780> way<00:02:19.930> home<00:02:20.410> with<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.520> can

but they don't know about this little

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.479 
but they don't know about this little

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
to get an extension cord plugged in

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.250 
to get an extension cord plugged in
instead<00:02:38.349> of<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.620> lamp<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.599> lamp<00:02:40.810> plugged

back connection is at the outlet that
you<00:03:27.100> were<00:03:27.250> just<00:03:27.549> jiggling<00:03:27.850> okay<00:03:28.750> cool<00:03:29.170> I'll

don't worry there's more you can do
think<00:04:02.580> about<00:04:02.879> other<00:04:03.330> outlets<00:04:03.840> in<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.110> area

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
think about other outlets in the area

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.839 
think about other outlets in the area
especially<00:04:04.860> ones<00:04:06.950> breaker<00:04:07.950> panel<00:04:08.549> than<00:04:08.700> these

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
especially ones breaker panel than these

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.930 
especially ones breaker panel than these
dead<00:04:09.090> ones<00:04:09.500> go<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.709> do<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.010> jiggle<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.640> them

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
dead ones go and do the jiggle in them

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.809 
dead ones go and do the jiggle in them
now<00:04:12.209> are<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.049> saying<00:04:13.349> that<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.739> bad<00:04:14.069> connection

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
now are you saying that a bad connection

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.870 
now are you saying that a bad connection
can<00:04:15.269> be<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.569> an<00:04:15.690> outlet<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.229> works<00:04:19.340> if<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.579> wire

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
can be in an outlet that works if a wire

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.600 
can be in an outlet that works if a wire
that's<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.510> feed<00:04:21.810> on<00:04:22.139> from<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.979> working<00:04:23.460> outlet

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
that's to feed on from a working outlet

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.650 
that's to feed on from a working outlet
is<00:04:24.330> poorly<00:04:24.720> connected<00:04:25.320> there<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:26.910> will<00:04:27.240> affect

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
is poorly connected there it will affect

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.750 
is poorly connected there it will affect
only<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.289> things<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:29.039> it's<00:04:29.220> supposed<00:04:29.580> to

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
only the things that it's supposed to

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:48.330 
only the things that it's supposed to
feed<00:04:30.650> okay

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.090

yeah Larry you're special
jiggle<00:04:53.000> method<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.449> not<00:04:53.690> working<00:04:54.139> well<00:04:54.770> it

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
jiggle method is not working well it

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.400 
jiggle method is not working well it
doesn't<00:04:55.460> always<00:04:55.729> work<00:04:56.270> but<00:04:56.750> we're<00:04:57.110> not<00:04:57.229> quite

doesn't always work but we're not quite
done<00:04:58.030> there's<00:04:59.030> more<00:04:59.620> wiggling<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.919> can

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
done there's more wiggling that you can

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.820 
done there's more wiggling that you can
do<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:02.150> switch<00:05:02.419> boxes<00:05:02.900> are<00:05:03.080> even<00:05:03.319> the<00:05:03.470> light

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
do the switch boxes are even the light

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.860 
do the switch boxes are even the light
boxes<00:05:05.199> in<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.380> same<00:05:06.650> general<00:05:07.280> area<00:05:07.580> of<00:05:08.270> the

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
dead items and toward the panel take the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.670 
dead items and toward the panel take the
covers<00:05:14.090> off<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.479> switches<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.229> try<00:05:15.620> to

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
covers off of switches and try to

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.480 
covers off of switches and try to
disturb<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.370> wires<00:05:16.669> behind<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.960> switches<00:05:18.530> by

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
disturb the wires behind the switches by

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.290 
disturb the wires behind the switches by
poking<00:05:19.970> at<00:05:20.120> them<00:05:21.580> with<00:05:22.580> something<00:05:22.849> non

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
poking at them with something non

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.770

believe this I was poking behind a

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:54.300 
believe this I was poking behind a
switch<00:05:47.150> for<00:05:47.449> the<00:05:47.569> hallway<00:05:48.080> light<00:05:48.259> which<00:05:48.650> works
