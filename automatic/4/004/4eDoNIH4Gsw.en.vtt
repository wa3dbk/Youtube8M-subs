00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
got these packs from eBay and each one

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.819 
got these packs from eBay and each one
has<00:00:36.630> three<00:00:36.660> cards<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.290> know<00:00:37.380> three<00:00:37.559> cards

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
has three cards you know three cards

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
has three cards you know three cards
that<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.010> used<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.210> don't<00:00:39.329> know<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> just

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that they used and I don't know I just

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.030 
that they used and I don't know I just
figured<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.020> would<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.469> cool<00:00:40.770> random

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
figured it would be a cool random

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
figured it would be a cool random
opening<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.370> never<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.670> these<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.059> course<00:00:42.270> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
opening we never got these of course so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.479 
opening we never got these of course so
yep<00:00:43.230> let's<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.950> ahead<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.190> open<00:00:44.430> this

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
yep let's go on ahead and open this

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.950 
yep let's go on ahead and open this
these<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:45.090> older<00:00:45.360> packs<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:45.870> have

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
these are older packs they don't have

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
these are older packs they don't have
like<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> tear<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> top<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.550> we're<00:00:47.670> gonna

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
like the tear at the top so we're gonna

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.410 
like the tear at the top so we're gonna
be<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.180> careful<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.780> scissors<00:00:50.239> which<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
be very careful with scissors which is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.189 
be very careful with scissors which is
really<00:00:51.809> fun

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
really fun

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.410 
really fun
also<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> guess<00:00:52.829> before<00:00:53.070> destroy<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> artwork

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
also I guess before destroy the artwork

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.760 
also I guess before destroy the artwork
completely<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.230> there's<00:00:55.410> summon<00:00:55.620> skull

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
completely you see there's summon skull

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.189 
completely you see there's summon skull
in<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> background<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.579> pretty<00:00:56.730> cool

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
in the background so that's pretty cool

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.660 
in the background so that's pretty cool
probably<00:00:58.199> shouldn't<00:00:58.530> open<00:00:58.770> these<00:00:59.070> honestly

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
probably shouldn't open these honestly

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910 
probably shouldn't open these honestly
but<00:00:59.969> yeah<00:01:00.420> that's<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.960> very<00:01:01.230> fun<00:01:01.379> opening<00:01:01.800> if

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
but yeah that's not very fun opening if

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
but yeah that's not very fun opening if
we<00:01:02.010> don't<00:01:02.160> open<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.870> wouldn't<00:01:04.080> make

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
we don't open them it wouldn't make

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
we don't open them it wouldn't make
sense<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.580> first<00:01:05.760> off

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
sense know what it all right first off

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.990 
sense know what it all right first off
we<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.060> summoned<00:01:06.510> skull<00:01:07.490> mystic<00:01:08.490> reflect

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and then maku the magical mist I think

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
and then maku the magical mist I think
is<00:01:15.000> how<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.180> pronounce<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:15.840> yeah<00:01:15.930> all

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
is how you pronounce it but yeah all

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.710 
is how you pronounce it but yeah all
three<00:01:16.380> ultra<00:01:16.799> rares<00:01:17.210> looks<00:01:18.210> cool

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
three ultra rares looks cool

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
three ultra rares looks cool
of<00:01:19.650> course<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.250> guess<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.090> way

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
of course I guess I got this like way

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.789 
of course I guess I got this like way
before<00:01:21.540> us<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.049> summoned<00:01:22.320> skull<00:01:22.439> art<00:01:22.619> because

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
before us the summoned skull art because

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.620 
before us the summoned skull art because
that's<00:01:22.950> when<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.430> course<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> Yugi

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
that's when we get of course in the Yugi

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990 
that's when we get of course in the Yugi
dueled<00:01:24.930> aspec<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.490> didn't<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.729> they<00:01:26.850> got

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
dueled aspec so I didn't know they got

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.319 
dueled aspec so I didn't know they got
it<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.299> guess<00:01:27.840> cuz<00:01:28.320> these<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:28.619> older<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.210> they

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
it I guess cuz these are older so they

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.520 
it I guess cuz these are older so they
must<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.750> artwork<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> long<00:01:31.350> time

must had that artwork for a long time

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.300 
must had that artwork for a long time
