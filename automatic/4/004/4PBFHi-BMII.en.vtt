this frame as clean and simple as

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.820 
this frame as clean and simple as
possible<00:01:53.150> so<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.690> get<00:01:53.960> full<00:01:54.140> internal<00:01:54.530> cable

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
is the RS cadence sensor built into

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.830 
is the RS cadence sensor built into
there<00:02:06.050> it's<00:02:06.770> an<00:02:06.950> plus<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:07.760> it<00:02:08.030> will<00:02:08.209> talk<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.570> a

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
there it's an plus so it will talk to a

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.840 
there it's an plus so it will talk to a
Garmin<00:02:09.440> or<00:02:09.590> any<00:02:09.709> other<00:02:09.890> m+<00:02:10.220> head<00:02:10.429> unit<00:02:10.760> and
