00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.240
 hi this is raddho here is a place to put 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.050
 up to date for gold and for money on it 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.880
 weekly beh 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.029
 good unfortunately unfortunately 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.890
 it was predictable i was saying i was titrating 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.109
 last week that there was the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.449
 formation of a disturbing figure 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.939
 and it's actually this bevel 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.739
 of blue enlargement in which one puts 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.210
 well train for which we are good 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.859
 could expect an exit by the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.509
 down statistically and unfortunately 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.340
 that's what happened I already have you 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.309
 explained repeatedly that if we 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.239
 daily technical analysis 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.920
 work more very very well in 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.600
 weekly is still some 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.789
 very useful thing to predict and 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.429
 anticipate and there unfortunately at the 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.309
 sitting at the week was anticipated by 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.660
 technical analysis in addition to ends in 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.429
 below a moving average of 20 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.379
 weeks which is bearish in other words 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.920
 it returns to downward trend 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.170
 frankly not very good up there 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.690
 luckily we are in a zone of 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.030
 important support these gray puzzles that 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 I already pointed out who was the theater 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.900
 of the technical rebound of the month of June 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.390
 when the lowest were made and there 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.030
 we will revisit this 7.7 tons it's 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.490
 not good then the technical indicators 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.140
 are mixed if the mas and always 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.690
 above his signal he remains 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.190
 negative moment tom is negative too 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 but on levels anyway 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.370
 low what worries me is 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.320
 stochastic so why because 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.140
 watch 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.300
 I already showed you this tutorial is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.420
 news when you have the 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.890
 stochastic that crosses I report I 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.450
 remind you of the evolved stochastic 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.040
 between 0 and 100 and he when he in 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.200
 below 20 it is said that it is in zone 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.190
 oversold when it's above 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.230
 90 kg area of ​​purchase and the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.180
 stochastic oscillates well and when 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.030
 cross his signal that sends out 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.550
 messages in this case when 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.990
 cross upward its signal it wants 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.110
 say you have to buy or at least 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.940
 that we must not sell and when 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.590
 cross down his signal like 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.960
 here it means that you have to speculate 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.800
 the decline or at least it is not 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.440
 the moment is not the moment 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.910
 buy 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.320
 right away where you see signal 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.510
 of purchase or so of 2 it takes more 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.940
 sell short is here we have a 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.220
 other sell signal or signal on 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.380
 which one should not buy what and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.840
 here are some examples a look at the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.790
 stochastic cross down here and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.680
 then there is a stochastic decline 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.930
 crossed on the rise it is reported on the gold 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.650
 and then behind there is a rise and these 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.660
 downward crossings and gold has 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.100
 lowered so if I talk about it you'll have it 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.230
 understood that's because looking at what 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.940
 is happening on zoome years sees well that the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.070
 stochastic just crossed his signal 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.390
 downward so I read you a care that 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.250
 means that we have to speculate 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.600
 down or that means for the most 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.620
 cautious that they no longer buy but in 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.320
 anyway it's not good point 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.730
 so thankfully and I say to myself could 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.630
 third time thankfully we 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.850
 are on a support area 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.100
 important that will allow us to 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.650
 to offer a minimum of resistance 1 to 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.780
 bearish but hey it's true that this 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.950
 is not good now if we look 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.890
 gold is good things are not not 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.440
 also look at money slippers 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.820
 severe enough also a look of it's 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.220
 always the story of the super take 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.590
 remember I had reported in time 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.140
 real that the supertrend was an obstacle 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.820
 major to go through and unfortunately to 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.100
 after three weeks of failure we are 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.420
 gone down definitely it was 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.850
 last week we confirm this 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.230
 week with one to a candle underneath 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.610
 from the 20-week moving average and the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.739
 cros the famous crossing of 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.000
 stochastic here signals a clown a 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.760
 also found just now so 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.920
 that's without the effects of the trend 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.300
 bullish short-term rebounded into 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.430
 downtrend it really needs 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.380
 hope that the support area plays its 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.900
 role because the dynamics is 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.269
 clearly negative I hope to have you 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.100
 convinced of the interest of the analysis 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.090
 technique for tracking gold and silver 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.910
 I will not fail to tell you when 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.349
 the uptrend will be back good 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.700
 evening watch weekly help 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.700
 next for the update
