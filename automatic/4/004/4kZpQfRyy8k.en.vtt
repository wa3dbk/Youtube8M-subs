00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.300 
we'll start getting it back together and
put<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:03.830> on<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:03.980> engine

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.320 

all<00:05:07.310> right<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.580> speed<00:05:07.820> up<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.030> drying<00:05:08.150> process

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
all right to speed up the drying process

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.900 
all right to speed up the drying process
I<00:05:08.780> decided<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.290> get<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.560> air<00:05:10.370> compressor<00:05:10.880> out

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
I decided to get the air compressor out

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.330 
I decided to get the air compressor out
and<00:05:12.670> what<00:05:13.670> we<00:05:13.730> can<00:05:13.820> do<00:05:13.910> is<00:05:14.710> not<00:05:15.710> get<00:05:15.890> too<00:05:16.070> close

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
and what we can do is not get too close

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.040 
and what we can do is not get too close
if<00:05:16.730> we<00:05:16.820> can<00:05:17.000> help<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.830> be<00:05:18.830> careful<00:05:19.900> that's<00:05:20.900> the

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
if we can help it be careful that's the

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.590 
if we can help it be careful that's the
damage<00:05:21.230> anything<00:05:21.670> but<00:05:22.670> just<00:05:22.820> use<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.210> air<00:05:23.360> to

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
damage anything but just use the air to

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.470 
damage anything but just use the air to
blow<00:05:24.410> out<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.590> wet<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.880> clear<00:05:26.150> some<00:05:26.390> more

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
blow out the wet and clear some more

00:05:26.480 --> 00:06:23.290 
blow out the wet and clear some more
holes

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.890 

yeah<00:06:23.870> I<00:06:24.140> think<00:06:24.290> that'll<00:06:24.680> do<00:06:24.800> it
