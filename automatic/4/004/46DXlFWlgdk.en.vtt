arm so and the reason we got this now is
again<00:01:54.030> I've<00:01:54.180> mentioned<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> few<00:01:54.659> times<00:01:54.869> while

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
again I've mentioned a few times while

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.920 
again I've mentioned a few times while
we<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> cow<00:01:55.770> out<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> car<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.780> will

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
we have the cow out of the car this will

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
we have the cow out of the car this will
be<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> whole<00:01:58.170> lot<00:01:58.350> easier<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.649> mount<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
be a whole lot easier to mount this and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.050 
be a whole lot easier to mount this and
those<00:02:00.210> transmission<00:02:01.110> arms<00:02:01.439> go<00:02:01.909> between<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
those transmission arms go between the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.300 
those transmission arms go between the
upper<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.450> lower<00:02:03.509> cowl<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.290> it'll<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.130> real

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
upper and lower cowl and it'll be real

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
upper and lower cowl and it'll be real
easy<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> mount<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.509> bolt<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
easy to mount that and bolt it in and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.869 
easy to mount that and bolt it in and
install<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.670> correctly

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
install it and get it in there correctly

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.609 
install it and get it in there correctly
while<00:02:09.500> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
while you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.410 
while you
as<00:02:10.799> we're<00:02:11.039> assembling<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.730> cowl<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.120> gluing

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
as we're assembling the cowl and gluing

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.059 
as we're assembling the cowl and gluing
it<00:02:12.510> together<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:13.140> I've<00:02:13.860> got<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.040> I

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
it together so I've got that in and so I

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.530 
it together so I've got that in and so I
just<00:02:17.250> would<00:02:17.519> show<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.299> thought<00:02:18.480> I'd

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
just would show you so I thought I'd

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.559 
just would show you so I thought I'd
show<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> guns<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.349> use<00:02:20.360> I've<00:02:21.360> got

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
show you the guns that I use I've got

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.080 
show you the guns that I use I've got
this<00:02:22.319> little<00:02:22.530> guy<00:02:22.739> right<00:02:22.769> here<00:02:23.280> I've<00:02:23.519> shown<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
this little guy right here I've shown it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.820 
this little guy right here I've shown it
a<00:02:24.120> couple<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.420> times<00:02:24.599> it's<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> detail<00:02:25.260> gun<00:02:25.470> and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
a couple of times it's a detail gun and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.640 
a couple of times it's a detail gun and
it's<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.730> cheapy<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.230> think<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.530> came

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
it's just a cheapy and I think it came

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.559 
it's just a cheapy and I think it came
from<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:29.310> know<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.549> of<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.730> cheap<00:02:29.940> TCP

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
from you know one of the cheap TCP

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.949 
from you know one of the cheap TCP
Global<00:02:31.019> guns<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.329> works<00:02:33.329> really<00:02:33.569> well<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
Global guns and works really well the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.259 
Global guns and works really well the
only<00:02:34.079> thing<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.319> don't<00:02:34.379> like<00:02:34.500> about<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.269> the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
only thing I don't like about it is the

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.559 
only thing I don't like about it is the
the<00:02:36.629> pattern<00:02:37.620> adjustment<00:02:37.829> knob<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.239> in<00:02:39.510> a

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
the pattern adjustment knob here is in a

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.199 
the pattern adjustment knob here is in a
place<00:02:39.840> where<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:41.129> know<00:02:41.310> when<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.879> have<00:02:42.060> this

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
place where you know when you have this

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.089 
place where you know when you have this
in<00:02:42.390> your<00:02:42.420> hand<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.959> you're<00:02:43.049> spraying<00:02:43.379> if<00:02:43.920> you

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
in your hand and you're spraying if you

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.190 
in your hand and you're spraying if you
just<00:02:44.280> barely<00:02:44.549> bump<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.390> know<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.569> can<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
just barely bump it you know you can you

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.610 
just barely bump it you know you can you
can<00:02:47.269> bump<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.420> knob<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.720> adjust<00:02:49.560> your

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
can bump that knob and adjust your

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.280 
can bump that knob and adjust your
pattern<00:02:50.430> without<00:02:50.609> meaning<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.720> don't

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
pattern without meaning to so I don't

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.530 
pattern without meaning to so I don't
know<00:02:52.379> I<00:02:52.410> need<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.819> before<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> spray<00:02:54.510> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
know I need to you know before I spray I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.000 
know I need to you know before I spray I
need<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.870> get<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.079> set<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.799> throw<00:02:55.980> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
need to get it set and then just throw a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.380 
need to get it set and then just throw a
piece<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.340> tape<00:02:56.489> over<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.819> or<00:02:56.970> something<00:02:57.299> just

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
piece of tape over it or something just

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.690 
piece of tape over it or something just
to<00:02:57.510> keep<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.870> from<00:02:58.049> getting<00:02:58.409> bumped<00:02:58.859> while<00:02:59.609> I'm

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
to keep it from getting bumped while I'm

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.449 
to keep it from getting bumped while I'm
using<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.409> finish<00:03:01.409> line<00:03:01.590> three<00:03:01.859> gun<00:03:02.069> this<00:03:02.340> is

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
using it finish line three gun this is

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.670 
using it finish line three gun this is
the<00:03:02.579> first<00:03:02.790> decent<00:03:03.420> gun<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> bought<00:03:04.170> I've<00:03:04.500> had

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
the first decent gun I bought I've had

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.180 
the first decent gun I bought I've had
it<00:03:04.859> maybe<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.730> year<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> half<00:03:06.239> or<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:07.560> I

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
it maybe a year and a half or so and I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.099 
it maybe a year and a half or so and I
primarily<00:03:08.489> use<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.209> primer<00:03:09.480> although<00:03:10.079> I

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
primarily use it for primer although I

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.110 
primarily use it for primer although I
have<00:03:10.379> a<00:03:10.409> 1.3<00:03:11.190> 1.4<00:03:12.090> 1.8<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.310> 2.2<00:03:14.310> tip<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:15.000> it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
have a 1.3 1.4 1.8 and 2.2 tip for it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.150 
have a 1.3 1.4 1.8 and 2.2 tip for it
and<00:03:15.569> I<00:03:15.630> ended<00:03:16.109> up<00:03:16.139> getting<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> 2.2<00:03:16.859> tip

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
and I ended up getting the 2.2 tip

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.210 
and I ended up getting the 2.2 tip
because<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.579> sprayed<00:03:18.150> some<00:03:18.180> slicks<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:19.220> early

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
because I sprayed some slicks in early

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.599 
because I sprayed some slicks in early
on<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:21.980> there's<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.130> deville<00:03:23.579> bus<00:03:25.609> digital

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
on and there's a deville bus digital

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.319 
on and there's a deville bus digital
regulator<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.419> it<00:03:28.290> actually<00:03:29.280> came<00:03:29.489> with<00:03:29.549> this

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
regulator and it actually came with this

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.490 
regulator and it actually came with this
gun<00:03:30.540> which<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.049> Technic<00:03:31.769> oper<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:33.500> I've

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
gun which is the Technic oper and I've

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.900 
gun which is the Technic oper and I've
used<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:34.919> a<00:03:34.980> couple<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.280> times<00:03:35.459> as<00:03:35.639> Darren

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
used this a couple of times as Darren

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.640 
used this a couple of times as Darren
mentioned<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.329> used<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.989> spray<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.349> engine

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
mentioned I used it to spray the engine

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.409 
mentioned I used it to spray the engine
bay<00:03:37.769> with<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.280> we<00:03:38.430> sprayed<00:03:38.730> some<00:03:38.910> test<00:03:39.090> panels

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
bay with and we sprayed some test panels

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.159 
bay with and we sprayed some test panels
with<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.609> you<00:03:41.609> know<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.359> so<00:03:42.389> I<00:03:42.810> still

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
with it and you know and and so I still

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.900 
with it and you know and and so I still
got<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.500> original<00:03:43.620> box<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.310> packaging<00:03:44.790> and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
got the original box and packaging and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.189 
got the original box and packaging and
everything<00:03:45.209> for<00:03:45.449> it<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:45.660> I've<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.810> kind<00:03:46.109> of

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
everything for it and I've just kind of

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.220 
everything for it and I've just kind of
been<00:03:46.280> keeping<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.489> way<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.019> think<00:03:49.199> I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
been keeping it that way and I think I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.860 
been keeping it that way and I think I
paid<00:03:49.440> 329<00:03:50.400> or<00:03:50.639> 339<00:03:51.329> for<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.989> gun<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:53.870> came

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
paid 329 or 339 for the gun and came

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.869 
paid 329 or 339 for the gun and came
with<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.079> regulator<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.069> came<00:03:56.190> with<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.400> 1.3

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
with a regulator and it came with a 1.3

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.979 
with a regulator and it came with a 1.3
and<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.299> 1.4<00:03:57.870> tip<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.129> I<00:03:59.489> plan<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.840> spray<00:04:00.840> the

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
and a 1.4 tip and I plan to spray the

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.569 
and a 1.4 tip and I plan to spray the
base<00:04:01.109> with<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.349> 1.3<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.160> I'm<00:04:02.220> gonna<00:04:02.310> do<00:04:02.489> the

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
base with the 1.3 and I'm gonna do the

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.699 
base with the 1.3 and I'm gonna do the
high<00:04:02.730> solids<00:04:03.030> clear<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.780> probably<00:04:04.530> do<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
high solids clear and probably do the

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.129 
high solids clear and probably do the
1.4<00:04:05.329> tipped<00:04:06.329> with<00:04:06.449> the<00:04:06.540> clear<00:04:06.720> but<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.900> need<00:04:07.079> to

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
1.4 tipped with the clear but I need to

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.650 
1.4 tipped with the clear but I need to
play<00:04:07.290> around<00:04:07.440> with<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.769> some<00:04:07.980> more<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:09.480> did

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
play around with that some more it did

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
play around with that some more it did
not<00:04:09.810> come<00:04:10.049> with<00:04:10.169> a<00:04:10.230> cup

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
not come with a cup

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.470 
not come with a cup
I<00:04:10.709> don't<00:04:11.310> really<00:04:11.400> spray<00:04:11.699> that<00:04:11.849> much<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.329> know

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
I don't really spray that much you know

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.539

we get this one car we're working on and
who<00:04:14.970> knows<00:04:15.150> we<00:04:15.329> may<00:04:15.449> do<00:04:15.599> another<00:04:15.629> one<00:04:15.989> after

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
who knows we may do another one after

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.960 
who knows we may do another one after
that<00:04:16.260> but<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:17.220> know<00:04:17.280> it's<00:04:17.400> not<00:04:17.519> like<00:04:17.579> we're<00:04:17.940> a

that but you know it's not like we're a

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.229 
that but you know it's not like we're a
production<00:04:18.719> shop<00:04:18.930> or<00:04:19.109> anything<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.909> this<00:04:20.909> cup

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
production shop or anything so this cup

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.000 
production shop or anything so this cup
that<00:04:21.780> came<00:04:22.169> with<00:04:22.409> the<00:04:22.530> finish<00:04:22.770> line

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
that came with the finish line

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.930 
that came with the finish line
three<00:04:23.250> gun<00:04:23.460> works<00:04:24.240> on<00:04:24.450> this<00:04:24.570> gun<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.170> that<00:04:25.940> $339

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
three gun works on this gun so that $339

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.140 
three gun works on this gun so that $339
price<00:04:27.240> did<00:04:27.540> not<00:04:27.690> include<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.140> cup<00:04:28.350> so<00:04:29.150> and

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
price did not include the cup so and

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.730 
price did not include the cup so and
it's<00:04:30.330> not<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.480> problem<00:04:30.750> for<00:04:30.870> me<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.110> switch<00:04:31.590> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
it's not a problem for me to switch the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.560 
it's not a problem for me to switch the
cups<00:04:31.920> out<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.700> forth<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:35.210> yeah<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.450> know<00:04:36.480> I

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
cups out and so forth so yeah you know I

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.240 
cups out and so forth so yeah you know I
know<00:04:36.810> there's<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.530> couple<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.860> guys<00:04:37.950> online

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
know there's a couple of guys online

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.510 
know there's a couple of guys online
that<00:04:38.670> actually<00:04:39.000> have<00:04:39.180> compared<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.990> Tecna<00:04:40.520> -

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
that actually have compared the Tecna -

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.020 
that actually have compared the Tecna -
the<00:04:41.700> sekolah<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:44.280> know<00:04:44.370> say<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:44.910> they

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
the sekolah and you know say that they

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.000 
the sekolah and you know say that they
both<00:04:45.210> atomized<00:04:45.840> extremely<00:04:46.440> well<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.860> will

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
both atomized extremely well and I will

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.890 
both atomized extremely well and I will
tell<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.270> didn't<00:04:48.510> think<00:04:48.630> there'd<00:04:48.840> be

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
tell you that I didn't think there'd be

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.050 
tell you that I didn't think there'd be
much<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.590> difference<00:04:49.950> but<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.490> know

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
much of the difference but you know

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.190 
much of the difference but you know
because<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.360> finish<00:04:51.600> line<00:04:51.780> gun<00:04:51.990> is<00:04:52.080> actually

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
because this finish line gun is actually

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.170 
because this finish line gun is actually
a<00:04:52.380> pretty<00:04:52.590> nice<00:04:52.740> gun<00:04:53.010> that<00:04:53.280> does<00:04:53.460> does<00:04:53.910> very

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
a pretty nice gun that does does very

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.380 
a pretty nice gun that does does very
well<00:04:54.390> but<00:04:55.320> when<00:04:55.770> you<00:04:55.920> fire<00:04:56.250> this<00:04:56.490> thing<00:04:56.550> up<00:04:56.880> and

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
well but when you fire this thing up and

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.930 
well but when you fire this thing up and
just<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.350> level<00:04:58.560> of<00:04:58.740> atomization<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.700> the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
just the level of atomization and the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.940 
just the level of atomization and the
material<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.630> comes<00:05:00.810> out<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.230> and<00:05:01.500> the

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
material that comes out of it and the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.370 
material that comes out of it and the
wildness<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.420> fan<00:05:03.630> there's

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
wildness of the of the fan there's

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.320 
wildness of the of the fan there's
there's<00:05:04.740> no<00:05:04.890> comparison<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.730> it's<00:05:05.970> it's

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
there's no comparison to it it's it's

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.820 
there's no comparison to it it's it's
you<00:05:07.230> know<00:05:07.260> it's<00:05:07.740> not<00:05:07.890> even<00:05:08.160> close<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:10.490> anyway

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
you know it's not even close so anyway

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.290 
you know it's not even close so anyway
so<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:13.860> was<00:05:13.950> going<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.190> say<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.760> there's

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
so I was going to say that the there's

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.990 
so I was going to say that the there's
some<00:05:15.420> guys<00:05:15.570> online<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:16.020> couple<00:05:16.440> guys<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.590> have

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
some guys online a couple guys that have

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.270 
some guys online a couple guys that have
both<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.240> Tecna<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:19.020> copper<00:05:19.410> I'm<00:05:20.010> sorry

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
both the Tecna and the copper I'm sorry

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.640 
both the Tecna and the copper I'm sorry
the<00:05:20.370> Tecna<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:21.090> Sagawa<00:05:21.420> and<00:05:21.810> say<00:05:22.470> that

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
the Tecna and the Sagawa and say that

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.430 
the Tecna and the Sagawa and say that
they're<00:05:22.770> very<00:05:23.010> similar<00:05:23.370> but<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.480> think<00:05:25.380> a

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
they're very similar but I think a

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.630 
they're very similar but I think a
couple<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.740> different<00:05:25.980> people<00:05:26.190> have<00:05:26.310> said<00:05:26.490> the

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
couple of different people have said the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.300 
couple of different people have said the
Sagawa<00:05:26.970> just<00:05:27.420> seems<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.410> atomize<00:05:28.830> just<00:05:29.190> a

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
Sagawa just seems to atomize just a

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.600 
Sagawa just seems to atomize just a
little<00:05:29.730> bit<00:05:29.880> better<00:05:30.980> so<00:05:31.980> but<00:05:32.370> they're<00:05:32.490> very

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
little bit better so but they're very

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.640 
little bit better so but they're very
very<00:05:32.880> comparable<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.230> think<00:05:34.440> they're

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
very comparable and I think they're

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.010 
very comparable and I think they're
somewhat<00:05:35.640> similar<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.000> price<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:38.750> anyway<00:05:39.750> just

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
somewhat similar in price so anyway just

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.210 
somewhat similar in price so anyway just
thought<00:05:40.320> I'd<00:05:40.530> show<00:05:40.650> you<00:05:40.680> guys<00:05:40.800> that<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:43.220> I'll
