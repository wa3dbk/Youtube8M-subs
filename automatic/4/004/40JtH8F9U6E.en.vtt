00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello she is ready for another 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.660
 impact technique then my name and 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.770
 danie beaulieu welcome to my house 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.040
 the occasion of the 20th anniversary 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.410
 of academy impact and I would like you 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.470
 propose things an intervention 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.330
 simple enough that you can do in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 your kitchen or what you can do 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.850
 anywhere in fact you are for 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.369
 bring a rich reflection on the part of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.890
 your students your customers your kids your 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.719
 colleague your spouse 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.260
 the idea is that you take different 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 leaked bomb about water I could 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.480
 take oil 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 I could take like I brought back from 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.510
 rigor here it is the cream with fargo the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.640
 firm take what you have I 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.550
 could have coffee I could 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 take pictures of the incident wine 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.280
 premiership about anyway a sacred 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.059
 thibault wants to throw soap pretty much 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.460
 anything the reflection is to 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.740
 the effect that there are some things that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.680
 enhance an experience 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.170
 inner internal and there are others 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.299
 who come at night him nothing to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.490
 who can mix well do not 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.700
 sign the march not for example from 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.080
 the water with tomorrow I know you the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.100
 result but for skeptics 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.610
 no I put some oil mix 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.450
 for that not mix a 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.470
 what could that represent 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:40.920
 according to you I think it represents 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:44.610
 There are things in our life 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.380
 who does that for that does not mix 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.409
 with us for example if you are 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.360
 really no wii in music but that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.850
 you have received as one you need 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.829
 destroy in music but I regret 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.690
 you can try your life 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.510
 at meylan 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.880
 as it's going to be high this is too much 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.130
 for samassa this meal mix could 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.390
 you think of something in your 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.190
 life you tried mixing the water 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.170
 then you tried and their 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.220
 antecedents bodein but its totality 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.030
 no it does not do with me according to one of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.030
 it's the people 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.770
 these people can be people 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.130
 so it can be not only 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.020
 fields of interest but also 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.140
 people heart moguls and 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.180
 to mix all that does not mix ben 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.600
 why not find something 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.680
 thing that could come check your 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.100
 experience to mix add earlier 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.960
 it benefits and then it can be 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.590
 also a reflection made in an environment 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.900
 working 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.810
 1 of the times it is to pose as 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.260
 question what in the mission 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.040
 of our work does not do 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.000
 currently 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.680
 and what could improve the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.780
 in a couple too it can be 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.120
 something without allying no it has 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.910
 done during our couple so it's a 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.290
 start of thinking that comes as you 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.480
 see it add a humorous note 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.540
 that there be play down because my 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.160
 daddy of you do not talk about me we talk 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.230
 metaphors and the idea is that when 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.100
 we are engaged in metaphors 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.420
 visual thing 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.140
 it allows us to activity a part 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.200
 of our brain 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.959
 the visual that it is easy that has a 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.750
 information that our logic does have 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.230
 not so integrating something 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.090
 two multi sensory one will have access to 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.390
 information that otherwise would not have 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.820
 no access so I invite you to play 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.950
 with that came out different things you 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.769
 will be surprised to see what is 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.830
 emerges and as an answer that normally 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.090
 and mother I answer no 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.910
 start right now on our challenges 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.120
 to use it 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.540
 August 7 he has a key soon 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.540
 ban
