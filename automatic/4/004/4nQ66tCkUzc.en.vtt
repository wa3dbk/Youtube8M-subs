00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
all right so you're looking at our

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.719 
all right so you're looking at our
compost<00:01:22.579> pile<00:01:22.819> here<00:01:23.149> pretty<00:01:23.869> full<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.729> that's

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
compost pile here pretty full and that's

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.929 
compost pile here pretty full and that's
because<00:01:26.090> we<00:01:26.329> just<00:01:26.859> butchered<00:01:27.859> a<00:01:28.069> volunteer

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
because we just butchered a volunteer

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.669 
because we just butchered a volunteer
brittle<00:01:29.359> bush<00:01:29.539> in<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:29.750> front<00:01:30.200> yard<00:01:30.439> which<00:01:30.649> is

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
brittle bush in the front yard which is

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.149 
brittle bush in the front yard which is
awesome<00:01:31.429> it<00:01:31.579> was<00:01:31.700> huge<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.270> about<00:01:32.950> gosh<00:01:33.950> the

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
awesome it was huge is about gosh the

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.639 
awesome it was huge is about gosh the
outside<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:34.819> know<00:01:34.850> no<00:01:35.229> measuring<00:01:36.229> from<00:01:36.439> left

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
outside you know no measuring from left

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.050 
outside you know no measuring from left
to<00:01:36.740> right<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.700> was<00:01:38.000> at<00:01:38.299> least<00:01:38.630> five<00:01:38.990> feet<00:01:39.049> wide

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
to right it was at least five feet wide

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.839 
to right it was at least five feet wide
very<00:01:41.060> huge<00:01:41.599> and<00:01:41.810> now<00:01:42.259> I'm<00:01:42.649> seeing<00:01:43.159> all<00:01:43.549> these

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
very huge and now I'm seeing all these

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.719 
very huge and now I'm seeing all these
caterpillars<00:01:44.179> and<00:01:44.959> I<00:01:45.679> think<00:01:46.069> that<00:01:46.399> they<00:01:46.670> were

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
caterpillars and I think that they were

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.319 
caterpillars and I think that they were
inside<00:01:47.359> the<00:01:47.420> brittle<00:01:47.959> bush<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.030> check<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.179> out

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
inside the brittle bush and check it out

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.319 
inside the brittle bush and check it out
some<00:01:50.719> are<00:01:50.899> small<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:51.649> some<00:01:52.509> are<00:01:53.509> large<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:55.329> so

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
some are small and some are large and so

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:05.520 
some are small and some are large and so
make<00:01:56.750> their<00:01:57.200> own<00:01:57.879> cocoons<00:01:59.860> like<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:04.250> guy

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
make their own cocoons like this guy

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:14.090 
make their own cocoons like this guy
where<00:02:06.530> is<00:02:06.739> he

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.470 

so<00:02:15.100> here's<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.640> here<00:02:17.130> there's<00:02:18.130> one<00:02:19.080> there
