00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.950
 welcome to my channel as you see today I did 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.470
 a very good chicken barbeque and apart 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.500
 very easy to do right away 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.880
 I will show my way of elaborating these 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.520
 are the ingredients that we are going to occupy 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.109
 to occupy I'm going to start with the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:35.120
 species we occupy two bay leaves 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:37.309
 three whole black peppers two 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.579
 fat peppers a pinch of oregano 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.949
 a pinch of cumin one clove one 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.140
 spoonful of chicken bouillon one 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.890
 teaspoon white vinegar salt 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.460
 taste and two broad chilies and four 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.250
 empty chiles a clove of garlic a piece 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.399
 of onion the tomato or tomato three 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.470
 quarters cup and obviously our 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.530
 chicken me here I have half chicken and I have 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.560
 different pieces so we're going to 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.370
 start is to season our chicken with 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.380
 him with the chicken consommÃ© to give him a 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.790
 little flavor we're going to put it in a 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.500
 pot and all the other ingredients the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.930
 let's liquefy 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.440
 you have to hydrate and remove the seed and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.290
 rabito to rehydrate the chiles and longer 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.820
 after that to liquefy all all 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.980
 the ingredients and also add a 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.680
 little bit of salt because the salt is always 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.020
 taste and just after liquefying 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.030
 all the ingredients we are going to strain 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.510
 and we are going to add them to our chicken 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:50.619
 and let's let's let him loose his 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.830
 let it boil and we will lower it 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.979
 to the fire well low for approximately 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.740
 one hour or until our chicken is 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.290
