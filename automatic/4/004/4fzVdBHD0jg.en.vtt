00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
guess because I just have to wait for an

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.500 
guess because I just have to wait for an
hour<00:02:58.620> then<00:02:58.890> I'll<00:02:58.980> be<00:02:59.040> out<00:02:59.159> on<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.400> road<00:02:59.579> and

just<00:03:11.159> got<00:03:11.280> home<00:03:11.489> from<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.689> test<00:03:12.900> centre<00:03:13.260> it's

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
just got home from the test centre it's

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.490 
just got home from the test centre it's
quarter<00:03:15.180> past<00:03:15.209> four<00:03:15.599> it's<00:03:15.870> been<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.019> very<00:03:16.230> long

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
quarter past four it's been a very long

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.649 
quarter past four it's been a very long
day<00:03:16.560> very<00:03:17.099> cold<00:03:17.370> day<00:03:17.579> I'm<00:03:18.090> hurting<00:03:18.510> all<00:03:18.629> over

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
day very cold day I'm hurting all over

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.780 
day very cold day I'm hurting all over
and<00:03:19.170> even<00:03:19.409> drop<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.709> bike<00:03:19.889> which<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.639> not

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.089 
and even drop the bike which is not
accurate<00:03:20.909> but<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.810> passed<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.680> test

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
accurate but I passed the test
