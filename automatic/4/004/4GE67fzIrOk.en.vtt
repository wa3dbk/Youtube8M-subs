00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.830
 The great thing is that whether you are beginner or advanced 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.929
 cook 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.969
 the purpose of all this is to do what I say. This is not democracy. 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.609
 You bought this cookbook because you want to surprise yourself. 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.390
 the most amazing cooking. But not just food. Through this whole concept. 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.779
 A table with lots of stunning things on it. 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.199
 Your roommates, guests, friends or mother-in-law will just stare. 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.930
 "Wow! You only made it in 30 minutes? 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.190
 Are you sure?!" 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.630
 This cookbook is for people who are busy 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.440
 they love life, love people and above all, love food. 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.560
 We wrote this book in a completely different way than usual. 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.329
 I'm going to pick you up 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.410
 that you will not believe what you have done in such a short time. 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.700
 I don't want to be your best friend in this book. I do not want 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.150
 give suggestions that you could do something. I don't want to be decent. 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 I want to radically change the way you cook. Mostly from Monday to Thursday. 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 Because I can imagine you're busy - like me, you want to go 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.740
 eat - in the wall like I want 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.200
 and you will feel better with a woman, husband, friend, girlfriend, mother-in-law or parents ... 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.600
 As for recipes, they cover all your needs. 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.730
 There's meat, fish, vegetarian dishes, pasta, salads, but also international dishes 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.860
 there are European dishes and English dishes ... 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.189
 I wrote it a bit like, "Do what I say." 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.590
 But if you don't like this salad, 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.710
 of course you can exchange it for what you love. 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.300
 You can exchange salad for salad, vegetables for vegetables or 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.440
 herbs for herbs. Just by what you love, but don't totally out of my intentions. 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.610
 Do not exchange salad for something fried because I will not guarantee you 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.720
 that you do it fast and tasty. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.209
 I'm trying to give you all the tips I've ever learned 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.399
 at work or at home. 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.469
 You will begin to learn things from this book 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.019
 that you use every day with every meal. I promise you that. 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.819
 I promise you. 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.950
 All these things get together and become part of the wonderful, 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.720
 tasty and exciting food 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.660
 that will absolutely get you by preparing it 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.279
 in 30 minutes. 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.319
 And that's amazing. 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.449
 Good luck and enjoy it.
