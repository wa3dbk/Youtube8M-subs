00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.690
 so 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.440
 the truth 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.730
 hello how about friends how are they so 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.130
 welcome on this occasion to a new 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.200
 video and good first of all I want 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.840
 leave something pretty clear there is something 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.790
 I wanted to recharge it and remind you 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.900
 more than anything and that is that in the description 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.610
 of each video 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.950
 I'm leaving social networks 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.410
 marchiniia in which to answer 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.079
 easier your doubts your questions since 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.850
 then here in what has been 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.040
 youtube does not leave me with certain people 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.200
 I do not know why I do not explain it but 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.940
 good is my facebook page my 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.920
 twitter and facebook where can you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.980
 add and talk at the best a day that 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.040
 they have vacated or alcor and all this roll 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.960
 no more cool cool and this matter and 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.390
 well now yes let's move aside all 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.720
 these things, magician, you do not do it anymore 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.090
 bastard and good this what happens is of 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.470
 I love being a Libyan 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.740
 better you already heard him out there to talk 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.110
 or mention in some other channel 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.540
 and one of the 15m cash social networks 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.790
 and hours that the mk guy is doing a 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.159
 league of hyères like and the truth is that 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.850
 it's going to be pretty pretty 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.140
 mind 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.610
 be with mother there are enough things 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.000
 things that have not been seen in any other 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.920
 side and I like it is not about innovating 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.070
 with these things 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.090
 to enter the community to unite the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.189
 stop for them to have a good atmosphere 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.530
 and that is a league for you 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.350
 writing to your competitive team fits 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.250
 clarify that today because there is no longer 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.400
 the space for rebutting 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.380
 will put more links but I would like 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.620
 that are pending because this makes 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.160
 a league that is continuous will not be in 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.650
 this time and already the cock is not going to 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.710
 be very continuous and it will possibly be done 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.050
 another with better things and so it will not 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.570
 it's a pretty good enough project 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.759
 cool as I repeat it and which I 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.040
 I would like it here briefly as 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.780
 I am giving you the information what 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.490
 will listen and also in the same way that 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.820
 in the description I will stop a child 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.160
 all the details about this league is not 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.230
 a league for which useful sad goal 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.510
 competitive which has its name 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.790
 representative not to that I come with this 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.670
 I would like that they will also take a 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.180
 little bit of clarity this in listening 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.459
 pretty good in that for example I am 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.980
 my karma another nor repression such an end 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.500
 mk not then then later there will be 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.680
 others in my every space such dynamic 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.480
 quite 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.620
 it's something that is taking quite 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.209
 account in this because it is cool that 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.439
 represent that tutv that should play not 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.810
 which itself is just another Wayne 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:00.150
 very rare gamer tax and all these things 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.790
 over here you hear me talk enough 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.670
 forced because I'm bad enough of the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.250
 throat because it's difficult for me 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.650
 talk and how is this matter magician 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.739
 good is very similar or very similar to what 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.069
 that is being a football league a 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.249
 league of 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.249
 like the world cup that just happened does 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:24.280
 a few weeks ago a few days ago it 's very 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:26.530
 similar and that is what I want to comment 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.989
 indicate very clearly already know that in many 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.120
 tournaments is direct lighting and is 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.010
 pretty good but this time it's not going 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.319
 to be in direct action but you're going to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.129
 have the opportunity to accumulate points 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.669
 even if you lose or win games 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.769
 and you will be able to accumulate points for this 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.719
 Do not say goodbye to the first round if 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.760
 of acteal and more in the first and having 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.430
 win and know that sometimes you nerves 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.109
 Betray sometimes you play badly and then 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.019
 subsequently in the next 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.879
 Special refraction goat not then 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.739
 it's pretty good, pretty cool 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.319
 I repeat something that I quite like 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.389
 something that I have not seen anywhere else 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.030
 what they have done and good is going to put 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:10.970
 pretty good they're going to be broadcast 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.240
 all flash males 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.860
 the encounters totally live for 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.170
 that those can enjoy out there are going to 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.760
 to be narrating what has been a 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.820
 career art workshop 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.880
 and well that's what starts this Saturday 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.010
 August 22 are pending we are going to 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.930
 leave here in yesterday's pages 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.660
 also so that they go from the sula and 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.150
 will be created from all this information 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.010
 and then share it with your friends and 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.540
 later it is right now since nothing 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.960
 they reached place for them that sees their 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.090
 team so stay tuned so that in 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.460
 the next one does not happen to them and this is 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.380
 very very chingón and it gets there quite 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.180
 intense because they will be competing 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.100
 what is the thermal tee 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.800
 both men and women by 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.740
 separate so if you are going to want 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.890
 break the alchemical mother so they're going 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.470
 to be able to see and all this roll I do not give 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.090
 in which then we, or nobody, the god and 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.950
 they still give everyone they lose but good 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.160
 Many people are interested in seeing how 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.560
 play there 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.750
 they will be able to taste this and 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.540
 totally alive and not on that then it's going to 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.180
 have many more days of their years 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.070

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.870
