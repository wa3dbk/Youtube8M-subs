luxurious homes things like that so it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.109 
luxurious homes things like that so it

seems that we will be able to purchase

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.880 
seems that we will be able to purchase
these<00:01:45.119> really<00:01:45.659> luxurious<00:01:45.930> homes<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.860> are

these really luxurious homes that are

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.050 
these really luxurious homes that are
probably<00:01:47.250> going<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.520> worth<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.880> few

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
probably going to be worth a few

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.990 
probably going to be worth a few
millions<00:01:48.560> considering<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> fact<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> most

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
millions considering the fact that most

that website once after I kept clicking

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.839 
that website once after I kept clicking
it<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> see<00:02:10.649> if<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.890> would<00:02:11.009> shuffle<00:02:11.280> out<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
it to see if it would shuffle out and

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.490 
it to see if it would shuffle out and
show<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.780> again<00:02:12.900> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
things like that I even drove out and I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.980 
things like that I even drove out and I
went<00:02:25.170> around<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.590> area<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.460> where<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.640> thought

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
went around the area to where I thought

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.660 
went around the area to where I thought
some<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.020> these<00:02:28.170> houses<00:02:28.380> would<00:02:28.740> be<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.640> I

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
some of these houses would be that I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.180

figured were really luxurious and they

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.580 
figured were really luxurious and they
had<00:02:32.370> some<00:02:32.730> some<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.870> houses<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.260> had

they had the saunas and i found this

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.930 
they had the saunas and i found this
area<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.990> has<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:41.310> nice<00:02:41.520> view

area here that has a really nice view
where<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.270> can<00:02:42.360> see<00:02:42.690> everything<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.410> it's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
where you can see everything and it's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.520 
where you can see everything and it's
really<00:02:44.730> great<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.330> see<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.380> can

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
really great to see that you can

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.770 
really great to see that you can
actually<00:02:46.709> own<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.760> i'm<00:02:47.970> pretty<00:02:48.480> sure

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
actually own this and i'm pretty sure

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720 
actually own this and i'm pretty sure
that<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.050> reason<00:02:49.440> why<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.860> unavailable<00:02:50.280> is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that the reason why it's unavailable is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.940 
that the reason why it's unavailable is
because<00:02:51.120> these<00:02:51.330> houses<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.110> you're<00:02:52.830> going

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
because these houses that you're going

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.190 
because these houses that you're going
to<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.100> able<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.400> buy<00:02:53.580> don't<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.450> much<00:02:54.690> detail

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
to be able to buy don't have much detail

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.870 
to be able to buy don't have much detail
in<00:02:55.410> them<00:02:55.590> yet<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.070> it's<00:02:56.250> like<00:02:56.400> when<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.640> glitch

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
in them yet so it's like when you glitch

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.180 
in them yet so it's like when you glitch
into<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> building<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> OECS<00:02:58.350> boxes<00:02:58.920> i'm

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
into a building and the OECS boxes i'm

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.710 
into a building and the OECS boxes i'm
pretty<00:02:59.670> sure<00:02:59.850> that's<00:03:00.030> what<00:03:00.150> would<00:03:00.270> happen<00:03:00.420> if

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
pretty sure that's what would happen if

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690 
pretty sure that's what would happen if
you<00:03:00.840> were<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.020> glitch<00:03:01.260> inside<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.130> if

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
you were to glitch inside of it so if

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.210 
you were to glitch inside of it so if
you<00:03:02.880> guys<00:03:03.030> could<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.950> let<00:03:04.950> me<00:03:05.010> know<00:03:05.100> what
