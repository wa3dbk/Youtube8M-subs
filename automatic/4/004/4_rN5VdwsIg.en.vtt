00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
surface to stop it scratching and then

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.170 
surface to stop it scratching and then
the<00:00:16.560> first<00:00:16.800> thing<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.250> there's<00:00:17.430> four<00:00:17.699> screws

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the first thing is there's four screws

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.480 
the first thing is there's four screws
I'm<00:00:18.480> indicating<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:19.470> I've<00:00:19.859> got<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.130> undo

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
I'm indicating here I've got to undo

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
I'm indicating here I've got to undo
these<00:00:20.730> four<00:00:21.119> screws<00:00:21.570> with<00:00:21.840> your<00:00:21.869> talks<00:00:22.260> head

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
these four screws with your talks head

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:40.680 
these four screws with your talks head
so<00:00:23.490> let<00:00:23.699> me<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.060> put<00:00:24.359> those<00:00:24.539> out

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.450 

that's<00:00:41.620> right

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610 

and<00:00:47.880> this<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.270> release<00:00:48.630> the<00:00:48.900> electrical

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and this will release the electrical

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.600 
and this will release the electrical
mechanism<00:00:50.310> okay<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.470> is<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:53.400> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
mechanism okay so that is the that's the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.780 
mechanism okay so that is the that's the
mechanism<00:00:53.850> taken<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.560> with<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.950> put<00:00:56.640> out

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
mechanism taken out so with that put out

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.510 
mechanism taken out so with that put out
the<00:00:56.970> way<00:00:57.150> we<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.200> then<00:00:58.410> write<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the way we can then write so the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.460 
the way we can then write so the
surround<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.270> trim<00:01:00.540> is<00:01:00.690> held<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.110> with<00:01:01.290> these

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
surround the trim is held on with these

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.440 
surround the trim is held on with these
spring<00:01:01.920> clips<00:01:02.280> yes<00:01:02.520> quite<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.970> lot<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.330> them

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
spring clips yes quite a lot of them

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.800 
spring clips yes quite a lot of them
there<00:01:04.020> along<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.460> along<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
there along here and along here now the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.219 
there along here and along here now the
best<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> start<00:01:08.130> lever<00:01:08.430> in

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
best way to do is to start lever in

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.290 
best way to do is to start lever in
gently<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.500> side<00:01:10.800> here<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
can just turn on that and question work

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
can just turn on that and question work
this<00:01:17.970> top<00:01:18.330> hair<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.590> release<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> top

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
this top hair down to release the top

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.060 
this top hair down to release the top
screws<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.750> start<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.440> these<00:01:22.649> bottom
