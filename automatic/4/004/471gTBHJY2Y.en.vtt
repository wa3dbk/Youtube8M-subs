00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
was really really laggy a lot of the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.219 
was really really laggy a lot of the
players<00:01:08.880> were<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.390> tell<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.080> like

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
players were like tell it was like

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
players were like tell it was like
couple<00:01:10.560> dudes<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.950> teleporting<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.580> stuff

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
couple dudes like teleporting and stuff

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.690 
couple dudes like teleporting and stuff
like<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.619> aku<00:01:13.979> 12<00:01:14.340> rip<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.670> my

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
like that but the aku 12 rip in my

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.160 
like that but the aku 12 rip in my
opinion<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.509> most<00:01:15.630> inconsistent

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
opinion is one of the most inconsistent

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
opinion is one of the most inconsistent
guns<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> call<00:01:16.890> duty<00:01:17.070> advanced<00:01:17.549> warfare<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
guns and call duty advanced warfare and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.999 
guns and call duty advanced warfare and
sometimes<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.810> works<00:01:18.990> sometimes<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.950> doesn't

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
and<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.030> hit<00:01:21.150> detection<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.810> guys<00:01:21.930> know

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and the hit detection as you guys know

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.600 
and the hit detection as you guys know
in<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.259> game<00:01:22.439> isn't<00:01:22.650> optimal<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.400> kind<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
in this game isn't optimal it's kind of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.060 
in this game isn't optimal it's kind of
like<00:01:23.700> black<00:01:23.909> ops<00:01:24.150> 2<00:01:24.530> where<00:01:25.530> players<00:01:25.799> are

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
like black ops 2 where players are

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.310 
like black ops 2 where players are
moving<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.580> you're<00:01:27.330> shooting<00:01:27.570> them<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.200> it's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
moving if you're shooting them but it's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.230 
moving if you're shooting them but it's
not<00:01:28.560> registering<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> detection<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
not registering like the detection is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.289 
not registering like the detection is
fairly<00:01:30.680> abysmal<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.850> players<00:01:33.090> are

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
fairly abysmal but if the players are

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.120 
fairly abysmal but if the players are
running<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> straight<00:01:33.810> line<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.500> they're

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
running in a straight line or they're

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190 
running in a straight line or they're
standing<00:01:35.400> still<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.000> gun<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.210> absolutely<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
standing still this gun is absolutely a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.780 
standing still this gun is absolutely a
beast<00:01:37.530> right<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.400> live<00:01:38.579> was

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
beast right there like the live was

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
beast right there like the live was
pretty<00:01:39.150> ridiculous<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:40.079> they're<00:01:40.380> running

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
pretty ridiculous but if they're running

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
pretty ridiculous but if they're running
in<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> straight<00:01:40.860> line<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.579> gun<00:01:41.759> absolutely

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
in a straight line this gun absolutely

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.109 
in a straight line this gun absolutely
rips<00:01:43.170> people<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.220> now<00:01:44.369> let's<00:01:44.399> say<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:44.970> they're

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
rips people but now let's say if they're

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
rips people but now let's say if they're
moving<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.600> flying<00:01:45.810> around<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.619> it's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
moving and flying around it's just it's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.990 
moving and flying around it's just it's
really<00:01:46.950> inconsistent<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:47.880> I've

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
really inconsistent and what I've

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.420 
really inconsistent and what I've
noticed<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.360> takes<00:01:48.509> me<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.979> kill<00:01:50.159> like

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
noticed it takes me about to kill like

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.649 
noticed it takes me about to kill like
if<00:01:50.640> they're<00:01:50.820> running<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> straight<00:01:51.240> line<00:01:51.390> I

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
if they're running in a straight line I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.240 
if they're running in a straight line I
can<00:01:51.810> kill<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:52.020> five<00:01:52.350> people<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:52.979> clip

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
can kill about five people in one clip

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.240 
can kill about five people in one clip
if<00:01:53.430> they're<00:01:54.000> kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.270> moving<00:01:54.479> side<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> side

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
if they're kind of moving side to side

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.999 
if they're kind of moving side to side
it<00:01:56.250> takes<00:01:56.490> me<00:01:56.670> about<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.409> full<00:01:58.409> clip<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> kill

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
it takes me about a full clip to kill

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.830 
it takes me about a full clip to kill
two<00:01:59.369> people<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:00.479> know<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.750> my

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
two people and I don't know if it's my

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.109 
two people and I don't know if it's my
aim<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.200> what<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.520> doesn't<00:02:02.700> seem<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
aim or what but it just doesn't seem to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.539 
aim or what but it just doesn't seem to
have<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.920> stopping<00:02:04.920> power<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.520> I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
have that like stopping power and I

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.399 
have that like stopping power and I
think<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.850> due<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.899> connection<00:02:07.170> as

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
think it's due to like the connection as

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.749 
think it's due to like the connection as
you<00:02:07.530> guys<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:07.740> those<00:02:08.009> guys<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.550> weren't

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you guys see those guys that weren't

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.010 
you guys see those guys that weren't
