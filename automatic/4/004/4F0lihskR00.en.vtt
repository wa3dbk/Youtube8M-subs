00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.940

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.790
 designs chosen in the contest innovate 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.920
 but this time to be roasted danny what 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.920
 difference has with the grill this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.060
 now we are going to tell you that because 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.619
 did you see that if we say to make a roast 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.300
 it is an art to serve it is also an art and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.000
 Facundo is here with us is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.220
 an excellent design happened the facundo 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.220
 thanks for watching how are you tell me how 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.820
 was born this brazier let's say good the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.070
 brazier was born when a friend who 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.760
 llama take the bergarés an acquaintance 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.870
 Argentine chef with his good partner 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.329
 we meet and I raise the concern 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.489
 and the need to want to develop a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.770
 brazier to serve the food to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.960
 temperature on the table but let it be 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.250
 different from what until then 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.870
 there was in the market there 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:14.090
 well I went home I'm talking about 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:17.090
 year 99 for home I started to draw and 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.150
 good came the idea of ​​working in base 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.070
 to the plow disk the square disc is what 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.460
 who knows everyone who is used 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.200
 to cook and good and on the basis of evoke 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.640
 the shape of the plow disk arises a 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.650
 brazier round and good with things that do not 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.510
 they have other braziers improving it in 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.820
 design and function keeps us the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.590
 hot food fats are down and 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.350
 that makes one serve the roast and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.420
 keeps the temperature of the food there 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.250
 just as you put some fathom in the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.810
 Container of embers supported the disk of 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.080
 distribute the food and bring it to the table 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.670
 also a more cheerful and creative way 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.220
 not cute how was the one you participated in 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.899

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.200
 via the industrial design contest 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.259

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.479
 I scored I was encouraged I was encouraged and I scored and I 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.560

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.069
 We were well selected for 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.720

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.610
 it was done in 2008 was the fourth 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.130
 edition of innovar show because here 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.480
 we have the shape of the golden disk and this 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.069
 it's made of wood that I'm not going to lift 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.730
 because it burns guys but the legs 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.110
 they are also made of wood so that one clear 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.700
 the design breaks a bit with the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.650
 Stereotype of traditional braziers 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.709
 what is there so far and good what 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.980
 I did was put good handles 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.260
 wood for comfort of the person who 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.060
 it uses wooden legs that prevent 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.980
 get the temperature to the table that's 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.530
 something important that good until the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.540
 no one had it either and well 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.250
 and a good capacity to be able to serve 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.650
 the food in a restaurant in a 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.200
 catering and also for domestic use not 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.519

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.480
 I started by marketing them 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.230

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.760
 catering 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:19.659

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.420
