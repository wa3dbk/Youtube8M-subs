is<00:00:17.440> my<00:00:17.590> snow<00:00:18.430> removal<00:00:18.820> tool<00:00:19.150> that<00:00:19.779> I<00:00:19.810> built

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
is my snow removal tool that I built

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.640 
is my snow removal tool that I built
here<00:00:20.590> a<00:00:20.619> couple<00:00:21.010> weeks<00:00:21.280> ago<00:00:21.430> and<00:00:22.290> to<00:00:23.290> date<00:00:23.470> I've

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
here a couple weeks ago and to date I've

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.900 
here a couple weeks ago and to date I've
used<00:00:23.890> this<00:00:24.040> on<00:00:24.310> seven<00:00:25.090> different<00:00:25.630> grooves<00:00:26.200> and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
used this on seven different grooves and

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.500 
used this on seven different grooves and
it's<00:00:27.910> it<00:00:28.660> just<00:00:28.690> worked<00:00:29.110> extremely<00:00:29.500> well<00:00:30.510> but

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
it's it just worked extremely well but

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.139 
it's it just worked extremely well but
on<00:00:31.660> one<00:00:31.960> roof<00:00:32.469> that<00:00:32.800> I<00:00:32.829> was<00:00:33.190> working<00:00:33.670> on

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
on one roof that I was working on

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.420 
on one roof that I was working on
there<00:00:34.539> were<00:00:35.340> structure<00:00:36.340> around<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.450> eave

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
there were structure around the the eave

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.780 
there were structure around the the eave
we're<00:00:39.430> trying<00:00:40.329> to<00:00:40.450> use<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:41.070> pellet<00:00:42.070> bag<00:00:42.280> slide

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
we're trying to use the pellet bag slide

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.139 
we're trying to use the pellet bag slide
system<00:00:43.600> just<00:00:44.260> didn't<00:00:44.560> work<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.970> kept

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
system just didn't work and it kept

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.770 
system just didn't work and it kept
getting<00:00:46.270> hung<00:00:46.989> up<00:00:47.170> on<00:00:47.579> an<00:00:48.579> arbor<00:00:49.180> type<00:00:49.480> struc

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
getting hung up on an arbor type struc

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.650 
getting hung up on an arbor type struc
so<00:00:49.989> what<00:00:50.140> I<00:00:50.170> wound<00:00:50.470> up<00:00:50.680> doing<00:00:50.970> was<00:00:51.970> I<00:00:52.210> made<00:00:52.420> a

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
so what I wound up doing was I made a

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.940 
so what I wound up doing was I made a
one-way<00:00:54.750> flapper<00:00:55.750> or<00:00:55.989> whatever<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:56.620> want<00:00:56.829> to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
one-way flapper or whatever you want to

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.930 
one-way flapper or whatever you want to
call<00:00:57.160> it<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:58.239> as<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:59.230> push<00:01:00.190> this<00:01:00.430> into<00:01:00.700> the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
call it so as you push this into the

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.469 
call it so as you push this into the
snow<00:01:01.300> or<00:01:02.079> I<00:01:02.860> can<00:01:03.309> reverse<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.119> pull<00:01:04.449> it

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
snow or I can reverse it and pull it

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.429 
snow or I can reverse it and pull it
into<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.960> snow

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
into the snow

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.280 
into the snow
it<00:01:05.530> just<00:01:05.829> goes<00:01:05.979> one<00:01:06.340> way<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.420> as<00:01:07.600> in<00:01:08.079> this<00:01:08.229> case

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
it just goes one way so as in this case

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.760 
it just goes one way so as in this case
here<00:01:08.770> it's<00:01:08.890> set<00:01:09.069> up<00:01:09.100> for<00:01:09.249> the<00:01:09.549> push<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.560> push<00:01:11.560> it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
here it's set up for the push I push it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.529 
here it's set up for the push I push it
into<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.130> snow<00:01:12.189> like<00:01:12.639> the<00:01:12.969> cutting<00:01:13.209> bar

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
into the snow like the cutting bar

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.919 
into the snow like the cutting bar
golden<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.319> it<00:01:14.439> pushes<00:01:15.039> up<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.609> lets<00:01:16.539> up<00:01:16.719> at

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
golden and it pushes up and lets up at

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.440 
golden and it pushes up and lets up at
the<00:01:17.380> snow<00:01:17.649> pass<00:01:17.979> through<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.789> this<00:01:19.389> will

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
the snow pass through and this will

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.169 
the snow pass through and this will
right<00:01:19.780> on<00:01:19.959> the<00:01:20.109> top<00:01:20.319> of<00:01:20.469> the<00:01:20.590> snow<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:22.090> you

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
right on the top of the snow so you

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.519 
right on the top of the snow so you
start<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.659> pull<00:01:22.929> on<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.819> pole<00:01:24.819> and<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.899> bites

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:26.529 
start the pull on the pole and it bites

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:29.760 
start the pull on the pole and it bites
into<00:01:26.889> the<00:01:27.009> snow<00:01:27.279> comes<00:01:28.149> down<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:28.869> hits<00:01:29.170> can't

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
into the snow comes down and hits can't

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.370 
into the snow comes down and hits can't
go<00:01:29.889> any<00:01:30.039> further<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.880> just<00:01:31.090> pull<00:01:31.600> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
go any further and you just pull the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.169 
go any further and you just pull the
block<00:01:32.679> off<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:33.340> roof<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:35.609> like<00:01:36.609> I<00:01:36.729> say<00:01:36.909> I've

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
block off the roof and like I say I've

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.359 
block off the roof and like I say I've
used<00:01:37.420> this<00:01:37.569> on<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.840> couple<00:01:38.319> places<00:01:38.679> and<00:01:39.249> it

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
used this on a couple places and it

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.940 
used this on a couple places and it
works<00:01:39.609> really<00:01:39.880> well<00:01:41.969> so<00:01:42.969> hopefully<00:01:43.380> I'll<00:01:44.380> show

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
works really well so hopefully I'll show

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
works really well so hopefully I'll show
you<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.130> clip<00:01:45.459> here<00:01:45.880> at<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.689> end<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.959> my<00:01:47.109> little

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you a clip here at the end of my little

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.589 
you a clip here at the end of my little
DIY<00:01:49.060> year<00:01:50.219> if<00:01:51.219> you<00:01:51.399> watch<00:01:51.639> closely<00:01:51.969> on<00:01:52.479> the

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
DIY year if you watch closely on the

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.010 
DIY year if you watch closely on the
roof<00:01:52.779> I'm<00:01:53.020> cleaning<00:01:53.700> using<00:01:54.700> this<00:01:54.959> attachment

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
roof I'm cleaning using this attachment

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.209 
roof I'm cleaning using this attachment
you'll<00:01:57.710> see<00:01:58.390> these<00:01:59.390> bars<00:01:59.750> are<00:02:00.109> not<00:02:00.219> installed

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
you'll see these bars are not installed

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.139 
you'll see these bars are not installed
at<00:02:01.549> that<00:02:01.789> point<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.530> what<00:02:03.530> happened<00:02:04.009> was<00:02:04.250> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
at that point and what happened was the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.209 
at that point and what happened was the
snow<00:02:05.450> was<00:02:05.719> dense<00:02:05.960> enough<00:02:06.140> where<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.710> wanted<00:02:07.159> to

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
snow was dense enough where it wanted to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:13.869 
snow was dense enough where it wanted to
to<00:02:07.909> send<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:11.920> galvanized<00:02:12.920> fencing<00:02:13.370> right

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
to send this galvanized fencing right

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.770 
to send this galvanized fencing right
here<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:15.459> so<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.489> added<00:02:16.790> these<00:02:17.030> bars<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
here and so I added these bars and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.500 
here and so I added these bars and
that's<00:02:18.140> solve<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.709> problem<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.430> again<00:02:20.239> if<00:02:20.390> I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
that's solve that problem and again if I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.690 
that's solve that problem and again if I
want<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.840> go<00:02:20.930> back<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> slide<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.400> take

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
want to go back to the slide I just take

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.750 
want to go back to the slide I just take
that<00:02:22.730> pin<00:02:23.769> pull<00:02:24.769> up<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.129> out<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.140> axle

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
that pin pull up and out is that axle

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.970 
that pin pull up and out is that axle
and<00:02:28.760> itself<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.380> go<00:02:30.470> back<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
and itself and I can go back to the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.920 
and itself and I can go back to the
slide<00:02:31.250> or<00:02:31.579> reverse<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.420> other<00:02:32.599> side

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
slide or reverse it to the other side

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.589 
slide or reverse it to the other side
and<00:02:33.790> have<00:02:34.790> at<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.209> again<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.730> that's<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.239> like<00:02:38.480> I

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
and have at it again so that's it like I
