00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
there's some sort of message to it that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
there's some sort of message to it that
is<00:00:53.550> incredibly<00:00:54.410> universal<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> sort<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
is incredibly universal and sort of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.430 
is incredibly universal and sort of
cathartic<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.640> gnarly<00:00:56.969> yeah<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.870> lasted

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
cathartic some gnarly yeah it's lasted

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.279 
cathartic some gnarly yeah it's lasted
so<00:00:58.800> long<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.059> mean<00:01:00.660> what<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:00.960> what

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
so long like I mean what do you what

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.869 
so long like I mean what do you what
else<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.670> people

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
else do you think it is that like people

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
else do you think it is that like people
are<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.750> excited<00:01:04.170> about<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.830> keeps

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
are so excited about that it just keeps

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.500 
are so excited about that it just keeps
going<00:01:05.339> well<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:06.000> there's<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.270> sort<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
going well I think there's a sort of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
going well I think there's a sort of
message<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.260> redemption<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.549> idea<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
message of redemption of the idea of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.750 
message of redemption of the idea of
actually<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.510> forgiveness<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:11.460> plays

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
actually a forgiveness that that plays

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.130 
actually a forgiveness that that plays
that<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> theme<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.630> plays<00:01:12.869> throughout

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that this theme that plays throughout

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
that this theme that plays throughout
the<00:01:13.290> entire<00:01:13.590> piece<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.100> also<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the entire piece I also think that it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
the entire piece I also think that it
speaks<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> every<00:01:16.110> generation<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.740> whether

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
speaks to every generation so whether

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.190 
speaks to every generation so whether
you<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.340> eight-year-old<00:01:17.759> boy<00:01:17.820> or<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you are an eight-year-old boy or a you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
you are an eight-year-old boy or a you
know<00:01:19.350> sort<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.710> 30<00:01:20.130> year<00:01:20.340> old<00:01:20.460> woman<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:21.090> there

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
know sort of 30 year old woman or there

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510 
know sort of 30 year old woman or there
there's<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.869> character<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.680> everyone<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
there's a character for everyone in it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.969 
there's a character for everyone in it
and<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.570> relate<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.840> also<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> think

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and that one can relate to also I think

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.590
