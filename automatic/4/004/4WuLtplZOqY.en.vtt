 Phrasesschwein because in them the little one 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.499
 Chase 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.760
 not read 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.829
 According to an Australian study, too long television is life-threatening 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.239
 who hangs daily for more than four hours in front of the telly has a clear 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.759
 increased risk of death 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.369
 because of too little exercise 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.920
 so policemen by sometimes like that 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.540
 had 13 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.290
 By the way, a big thank you to Sat 1 and RTL 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.179
 that's one of those hard to make even ten minutes at a time to buy 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.809
 So I hope that stays that way 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.149
 Unfortunately, he has just been sawed off the Sat 1 CEO 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.800
 and he damned our lives damn well as he did 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.120
 in one from every case out with you on the street does not have the same 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 Be Hollywood about our audience Andreas their concern of the whole 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.940
 Potholes in l -e which only a few people know how to use them virtuoso 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.360
 like the artists Claudia Steger and Dawid Luciano the potholes no matter if 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.990
 because the Angelis and York or Montreal always a practical side 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.550
 can win 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.300
 they are still there 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.120
 maybe raining for something like that, there are so-called umbrellas coming soon 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.650
 by the way, also without umbrella 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.220
 At any rate, he thinks he can solve it at Brenner sometime 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.970
 not on the screen should keep material flows of the air dry hopefully 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.730
 the hot air not only a concept I have his life too his good 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.290
 You can even go water skiing in the countryside, like here in South 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.440
 Carolina assuming of course the excavator driver just has time and if 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.150
 you ask nicely no, maybe even ski jumping 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.980
 By the way, do not keep too long in the eyes of other people 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.630
 motionless hanging in front of the telly 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.130
 especially not to be 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.990
 and the paper on the buy side one at the latest after four hours an end 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.930
 before reconsidering Heidi 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.729
 and by no means allow the opening song to dance 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.030

 only digital here in Wolfsburg that is low in calories but the movie Â«Tal 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.390
 rich and very entertaining apart from theirs but also the sheet 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.390
 already worth a virtual contribution for a single post 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.250
 but not too long trips on the Internet 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.069
 now seems to be movement and stuff 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.799
 You can also control that well 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.699
 with the firefox extension project which chronicles the browser whole 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.819

 Mooring an interesting video published by explaining 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.140
 what to look for in order to achieve the most impressive result 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.489
 Bowie then missed

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:08.430
 the first king 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.559
 I calculate movement at work 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:11.899
