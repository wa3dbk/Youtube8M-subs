LS powered about vehicle it's it's fully
electronic<00:00:37.840> you<00:00:38.840> basically<00:00:39.530> you<00:00:39.739> just<00:00:39.769> use

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
electronic you basically you just use

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.799 
electronic you basically you just use
the<00:00:40.460> shifter<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:40.910> pull<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.180> out<00:00:41.239> of<00:00:41.390> park<00:00:41.600> and

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
the shifter to pull it out of park and

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.119 
the shifter to pull it out of park and
then<00:00:41.930> we<00:00:42.110> have<00:00:42.230> a<00:00:42.260> paddle<00:00:42.680> shifter<00:00:43.010> that

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
then we have a paddle shifter that

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.680 
then we have a paddle shifter that
allows<00:00:43.309> you<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:43.610> go<00:00:43.730> through<00:00:43.760> all<00:00:44.000> six<00:00:44.420> gears

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
allows you to go through all six gears

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.000 
allows you to go through all six gears
six<00:00:45.650> gear<00:00:45.890> is<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.100> real<00:00:46.400> low<00:00:46.940> overdrive<00:00:47.540> gear<00:00:48.290> so

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
six gear is a real low overdrive gear so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.950 
six gear is a real low overdrive gear so
it<00:00:49.100> really<00:00:49.280> drops<00:00:49.489> rpms<00:00:50.150> down<00:00:50.360> for<00:00:50.600> cruising

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
it really drops rpms down for cruising

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.210 
it really drops rpms down for cruising
and<00:00:51.080> it's<00:00:51.229> kind<00:00:51.409> of<00:00:51.470> cool<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:51.830> ship<00:00:52.010> through

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
and it's kind of cool to ship through

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.490 
and it's kind of cool to ship through
six<00:00:52.489> gears<00:00:52.729> and<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.180> handle<00:00:53.479> up<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.750> 850

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
six gears and it a handle up to 850

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.530 
six gears and it a handle up to 850
horsepower<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.820> this<00:00:56.059> is<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.360> same

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
horsepower so this is the same

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.210 
horsepower so this is the same
transmission<00:00:57.379> that<00:00:57.470> you<00:00:57.559> find<00:00:57.799> in<00:00:57.949> a<00:00:58.010> late

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
transmission that you find in a late

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.100 
transmission that you find in a late
model<00:00:58.460> Chevy<00:00:58.729> but<00:00:59.479> you<00:00:59.600> guys<00:00:59.720> have<00:00:59.960> actually

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
model Chevy but you guys have actually

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.020 
model Chevy but you guys have actually
changed<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.799> internals<00:01:01.430> to<00:01:01.519> make<00:01:01.699> it<00:01:01.820> into<00:01:02.000> a

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
changed the internals to make it into a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.270 
changed the internals to make it into a
