a squared off corn and bean field here
when<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> say<00:00:15.870> squared<00:00:16.199> off<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.619> square

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
when I say squared off it's a square

you're hooking up your tree stand you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.410 
you're hooking up your tree stand you
hook<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.650> for<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> prevailing<00:00:23.939> wind<00:00:24.180> which

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the wind changes let's say if the switch

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.030 
the wind changes let's say if the switch
is<00:00:30.330> completely<00:00:31.050> around<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.800> an<00:00:31.859> east

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
is completely around and I get an east

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.490 
is completely around and I get an east
wind<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.180> alert<00:00:33.510> any<00:00:33.719> deer<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.380> my
