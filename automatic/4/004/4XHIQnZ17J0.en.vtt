00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
football program so I understand that

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.630 
football program so I understand that
and<00:07:12.720> that's<00:07:12.750> a<00:07:13.260> huge<00:07:13.500> responsibility<00:07:14.070> that<00:07:14.610> I

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640 
and that's a huge responsibility that I

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.260 
and that's a huge responsibility that I
have<00:07:15.000> to<00:07:15.720> make<00:07:15.900> sure<00:07:16.140> that<00:07:16.640> we<00:07:17.640> do<00:07:17.850> things<00:07:18.120> the

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
have to make sure that we do things the

have to make sure that we do things the
right<00:07:18.300> way<00:07:18.510> because<00:07:19.140> if<00:07:19.620> we<00:07:20.160> don't<00:07:20.400> then<00:07:20.760> it

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.030 
right way because if we don't then it

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.730 
right way because if we don't then it
reflects<00:07:21.480> negatively<00:07:21.780> on<00:07:22.200> the<00:07:22.530> whole

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740
