I'm<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.849> make<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> little<00:00:09.179> video<00:00:09.450> here

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
I'm going to make a little video here

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.339 
I'm going to make a little video here
showing<00:00:10.880> my<00:00:11.880> new<00:00:12.090> patrol<00:00:12.509> box<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:13.080> are<00:00:13.170> made

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
showing my new patrol box that are made

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.640 
showing my new patrol box that are made
for<00:00:13.590> camping<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:15.080> we<00:00:16.080> go<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> scouts

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
for camping out we go with the scouts

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.330 
for camping out we go with the scouts
often<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:18.060> adults<00:00:19.070> need<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.130> little

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
often and the adults need a little

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.720 
often and the adults need a little
patrol<00:00:20.640> box<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.420> cook<00:00:21.539> our<00:00:21.720> meals<00:00:22.730> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
patrol box so we can cook our meals and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.189 
patrol box so we can cook our meals and
so<00:00:23.939> I'll<00:00:24.000> put<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.269> one<00:00:24.330> together<00:00:26.930> it's<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
so I'll put this one together it's a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.310 
so I'll put this one together it's a
made<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.740> wall<00:00:28.890> nut<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:31.579> for<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:33.320> good

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
made out of wall nut and for a good

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.360 
made out of wall nut and for a good
strength<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.040> dove<00:00:35.579> tailed<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.149> edge<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:37.370> so

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
strength I dove tailed the edge here so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.240 
strength I dove tailed the edge here so
I<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> lot<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.850> stiffness<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> box<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
I get a lot of stiffness in the box I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.880 
I get a lot of stiffness in the box I
have<00:00:41.250> these<00:00:41.489> wooden<00:00:41.760> handles<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.890> for

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
have these wooden handles on it for

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.020 
have these wooden handles on it for
toting<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.309> around<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:47.219> legs<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.719> loose

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
toting it around the legs are for loose

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.189 
toting it around the legs are for loose
1<00:00:51.030> by<00:00:51.180> 4<00:00:51.480> oak<00:00:51.780> legs<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.500> slide<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:52.920> into

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
1 by 4 oak legs that slide up into

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
1 by 4 oak legs that slide up into
sockets<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.760> then<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> gave<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.059> some

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
sockets and then I gave it some

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.200 
sockets and then I gave it some
triangulation<00:00:58.340> with<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.520> piece<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.969> oak

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
triangulation with this piece of oak

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.609 
triangulation with this piece of oak
here<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> half

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
here and you can see that I put a half

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
here and you can see that I put a half
lap<00:01:04.890> joint<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:06.060> added<00:01:06.360> stiffness<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
lap joint there for added stiffness and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.710 
lap joint there for added stiffness and
the<00:01:08.070> leg<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> held<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.880> place<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the leg is held in place just with a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.070 
the leg is held in place just with a
little<00:01:11.990> quarter-inch<00:01:13.159> bolt<00:01:14.450> that<00:01:15.450> slides

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
little quarter-inch bolt that slides

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.270 
little quarter-inch bolt that slides
into<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:18.000> threaded<00:01:18.420> insert<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
into that threaded insert and that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
into that threaded insert and that
really<00:01:20.549> stiffens<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> joint<00:01:21.630> really

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
really stiffens up this joint really

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.270 
really stiffens up this joint really
well<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.500> don't<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> tight

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
well you don't have to have it tight

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.280 
well you don't have to have it tight
either<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> loosely<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
either just kind of loosely on like that

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.999 
either just kind of loosely on like that
it's<00:01:28.290> two-sided

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
it's two-sided

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.960 
it's two-sided
I<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.479> side<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.110> where<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.640> mostly

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
I have one side here where that's mostly

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.840 
I have one side here where that's mostly
storage<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.040> back<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.549> which
