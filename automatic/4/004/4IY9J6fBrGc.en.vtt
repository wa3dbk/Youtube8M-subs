get the drive the one terabyte portion
is<00:03:00.480> locked<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.680> you'll<00:03:01.860> need<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.070> what<00:03:02.370> you

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490

support<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.190> yet<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.790> know<00:03:11.850> Apple<00:03:12.890> so

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
support just yet but you know Apple so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.500 
support just yet but you know Apple so
anyways<00:03:14.160> once<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.820> have<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.030> installed

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
anyways once you have that installed

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.540 
anyways once you have that installed
you'll<00:03:15.990> be<00:03:16.140> able<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.410> actually<00:03:16.560> unlock<00:03:17.310> the

you'll be able to actually unlock the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.300 
you'll be able to actually unlock the
one<00:03:17.730> terabyte<00:03:18.060> portion<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:19.170> what<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> WD

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
one terabyte portion so what is the WD

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.880 
one terabyte portion so what is the WD
black<00:03:20.670> squared<00:03:21.060> really<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.750> actually<00:03:22.110> for

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
black squared really it is actually for

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.990 
black squared really it is actually for
all<00:03:23.010> those<00:03:23.130> people<00:03:23.190> who<00:03:23.490> are<00:03:23.700> looking<00:03:23.820> for

all those people who are looking for

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.410 
all those people who are looking for
both<00:03:24.420> speed<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.370> storage<00:03:26.370> not<00:03:26.940> only<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.330> it

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
both speed and storage not only is it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.620 
both speed and storage not only is it
not<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.620> hybrid<00:03:29.340> drive<00:03:29.580> where<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.209> just<00:03:30.360> using

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
not a hybrid drive where it's just using

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.199 
not a hybrid drive where it's just using
SSDs<00:03:31.050> caching<00:03:31.590> it's<00:03:32.160> actually<00:03:32.550> two<00:03:32.850> physical

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
a I think seven point five mil so it's

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.160 
a I think seven point five mil so it's
going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.209> be<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.330> bit<00:03:45.510> thicker<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:45.990> if<00:03:46.110> you

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
going to be a bit thicker but if you

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.780 
going to be a bit thicker but if you
