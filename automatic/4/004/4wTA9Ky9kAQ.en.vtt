00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 Hi girls, so today I want to offer you 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.789
 a kind of recipe 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.130
 in short, we start with dozens but in the case 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.320
 since the summer is not unlikely of the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 Popsicles made with fruit party 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.599
 so right with the piece of fruit 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.810
 fresh and as a liquid not to stand by 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.870
 add sugar what I will put of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.040
 juice juice one hundred percent therefore without 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.280
 added sugars 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.860
 but you can add other juices or 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 other things that I will show you now 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.809
 in short, the current would be in the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.760
 stencils from which you can use this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 various forms on the market are varied 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 forms but I wanted to take more case 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.199
 the classic that I am so realizes them 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
 only two because the others 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 obviously I've already done it because it takes 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.030
 time that they freeze to make it of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.430
 see the facts already and you will need the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 then cut fresh fruit for 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.460
 go and put it in the mold of 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.920
 ice lolly and me without advertising 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.200
 I took 100 juices for it 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.009
 hundred juice so I wanted to take 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 lance wanted to take the pineapple 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.650
 you can do I don't even know I didn't have 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.869
 time you can also blend the watermelon 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.750
 and makes as a basis then as on col 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.009
 watermelon the mango as a source you can 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.149
 choose what you want 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.979
 obviously in pieces that there must be 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.299
 of the stencil you can also choose 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.670
 yogurt as a base 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.289
 if instead you yogurt you will not see the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.229
 fruit but still the pieces will be there 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.170
 in short, when you can eat it 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.630
 let's go straight to make the stencil 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.509
 then let's go just to reach the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.369
 our fruit the mind just by chance 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.259
 obviously these seasonal photos 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.970
 so there will be strawberries there will be there 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.019
 will be the blackberries 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.700
 this is the bicocca people we go to 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:18.110
 put it just by chance you can do it 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.420
 also here kg pomegranate with the grains of 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.830
 which we are a bit special with 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.190
 grains of what is called of these 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.230
 raspberries are what you want 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:38.549
 obviously we must also remember that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.970
 we will also have to add the juice to it 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:49.920
 so now I'm going to put the orange 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:52.079
 we play it a little bit and you can 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.579
 do it also with the lemon just the 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.109
 lemon 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.200
 you have to sugar they are a lot 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.760
 sour to me not to add sugars 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:10.170
 I did not want to opt for lemon empires 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:11.930
 and we are going to close it with the mold there 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:19.260
 we assure that we close it well 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:22.370
 let's go and do the other one right away 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.370
 another piece of fruit 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.300
 with admits to the strawberry this is beautiful 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.330
 because dad will see you later 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.910
 notes and small pieces of fruit and it is 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.930
 very nice to see how like 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:48.050
 popsicle and let's go get another one 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:53.560
 piece of fruit we go to put 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.560
 the other juice that is from anas 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.950
 here it is 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.080
 this then a very fast recipe e 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.080
 let's close it 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.660
 and these are our molds 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:23.010
 obviously they go into the freezer and must 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.460
 rest at least those 545 hours though 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.890
 let's say he will eat them the day 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.930
 after which in fact is to show up 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.390
 how the others came and here it is 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.790
 boy the glaciers and the facts 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.920
 obviously rest in the freezer and come 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.620
 just like you see with the prices of 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.920
 fruit and are cute to see and 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.240
 there is to say very natural if you take 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.130
 then the fruit and blend it even more 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.330
 that's the beauty of what I am 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.100
 healthy and are also canines to see and yes 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.870
 he spends very little doing them warmly 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.900

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.700
