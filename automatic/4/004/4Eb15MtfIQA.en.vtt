00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.030
 good let our third to the right that 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.950
 our room today is preparation as 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.810
 use the preparations 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.970
 I'll give you a notion of how to use a 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.699
 application in music operations is ok 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:29.500
 let's go then our third good sometimes 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.359
 You want to know how to make a 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.420
 how to apply a preparation 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.480
 a song and this sometimes leaves you 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.519
 very beaten and sometimes for example 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.979
 work a rope that basic 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.979
 Let's work, by the way. 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.379
 Do you want to do some preparation? That's it. 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.880
 be more in the stumbles you want to do 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.450
 a prayer you will use this one from here 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:12.090
 used to be too old 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.030
 I got 7 with the primary chord and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 applied seventh minor and had always 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:29.640
 this preparation to play the third 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:36.149
 the greater the greater the preparation 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.490
 Then I stopped for your second major and 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.189
 then the third 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.960
 and what happened was that the following would 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.979
 always if this is how you work always 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.700
 like this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.700
 An example 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.340
 all these items are preparations 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.920
 you can use composite ropes to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.400
 prepare to be forming the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:19.930
 preparations for example go to sol 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:22.650
 houses the ninth machete and the sun here 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.980
 apply was even lower 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.370
 and then I'll talk to the sun and the ninth 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.370
 fact 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.440
 O 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.099
 ah 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.110
 ah 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.859
 ae 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.010
 once more 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.690
 ah 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.900
 Let's work on other chords. 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.900
 repairs to 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.310
 ah ok 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.500
 now sending to 1 to 1 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.519
 observe me 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.420
 and so on you will master 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.240
 if you have nothing you do not have mastery anymore 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.340
 if you trained ketamine you need is 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.060
 see the rule that I used the first 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.660
 wake up 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.240
 I know that wake up is weak ninth all is well 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.240
 here is ninth look here 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:25.650
 it is only with nine lagunov blind knot in the family 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:27.210
 only O and or will do will be done 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:37.830
 Natural 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:39.330
 now let's apply the week you need 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.950
 master these rules 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.470
 the smaller larger agreements you already 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.900
 know then it is easy for you to master and 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.480
 apply these preparations 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.520
 So good class, practice enough that you 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.520
 Will you get a hug and see you in the next?
