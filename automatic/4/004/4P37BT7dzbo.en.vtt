so<00:00:57.870> ability<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.309> fast

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so ability to get up get out get fast

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
so ability to get up get out get fast
and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.090> slow<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.390> beyond<00:01:00.809> station<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.320> a

and then slow down beyond station for a
long<00:01:01.469> time<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> come<00:01:02.039> home<00:01:02.190> we've<00:01:03.149> flown

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
long time and come home we've flown

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.710 
long time and come home we've flown
about<00:01:03.750> 68<00:01:04.470> fights<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.070> about<00:01:05.280> 125<00:01:06.180> hours<00:01:06.570> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
about 68 fights and about 125 hours so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.350 
about 68 fights and about 125 hours so
they're<00:01:06.869> about<00:01:07.400> rough<00:01:08.400> been<00:01:08.880> things<00:01:09.180> been

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
they're about rough been things been

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.940 
they're about rough been things been
going<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.750> fast<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.110> got<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:10.409> back<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.799> count

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
going so fast I got to go back and count

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.609 
going so fast I got to go back and count
all<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.460> numbers<00:01:11.670> again<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.229> airplanes

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
all my numbers again but the airplanes

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.510 
all my numbers again but the airplanes
got<00:01:13.860> honeywell<00:01:14.600> tfe731<00:01:15.830> engines<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> very

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
got honeywell tfe731 engines in it very

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.429 
got honeywell tfe731 engines in it very

proven engines on the citation seven and
a<00:01:19.470> Lear<00:01:19.680> 45<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> development<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
and testing it's a brilliant airplane to
fly<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.200> my<00:01:49.409> first<00:01:49.649> thoughts<00:01:50.009> were

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
fly it so my first thoughts were

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
fly it so my first thoughts were
powerful<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.000> nimble<00:01:51.450> after<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.229> first

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
powerful and nimble after the first

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
powerful and nimble after the first
flight<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.950> had<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> back<00:01:54.000> in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
flight that I had with it back in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.859 
flight that I had with it back in
December<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.729> graceful<00:01:57.240> airplane<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
December so it's a graceful airplane to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.139 
December so it's a graceful airplane to
fly<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.770> plenty<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.219> power<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.670> get<00:02:00.000> up

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
fly it's got plenty of power to get up

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
fly it's got plenty of power to get up
to<00:02:00.299> altitude<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.290> designed<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
to altitude then is designed to go up to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.510 
to altitude then is designed to go up to
45,000<00:02:03.090> feet<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:04.040> designed<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.159> pull<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
45,000 feet and designed to pull up to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.479 
45,000 feet and designed to pull up to
six<00:02:05.850> G's<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.360> well<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.229> rolls<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:08.250> four

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
six G's as well and it rolls about four

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.449 
six G's as well and it rolls about four
seconds<00:02:08.940> through<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.649> 360-degree<00:02:10.649> roll<00:02:10.860> so

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
seconds through a 360-degree roll so

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.520 
seconds through a 360-degree roll so
when<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> weapons<00:02:12.510> might<00:02:12.720> come<00:02:12.989> not<00:02:13.230> soon

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
when the weapons might come not soon

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.130 
when the weapons might come not soon
enough<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.040> me<00:02:14.069> but<00:02:14.490> as<00:02:14.640> soon<00:02:14.880> as<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.780> can

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
enough for me but as soon as we we can

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.570 
enough for me but as soon as we we can
start<00:02:16.350> building<00:02:16.470> those<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.980> certifying<00:02:17.430> we

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
start building those and certifying we

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.850 
start building those and certifying we
certainly<00:02:17.940> well<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.260> we've<00:02:19.410> heard<00:02:19.500> about<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
certainly well so we've heard about the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.860 
certainly well so we've heard about the
aircraft<00:02:20.220> how<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> got<00:02:20.910> here<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.569> what<00:02:21.750> it's
