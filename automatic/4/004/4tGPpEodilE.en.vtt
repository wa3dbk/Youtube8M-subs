contains mobile quarterbacks so they

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.990 
contains mobile quarterbacks so they

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
it does a really nice job of actually

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.860 
it does a really nice job of actually
giving<00:02:31.980> us<00:02:32.040> better<00:02:32.280> blitz<00:02:32.670> angles<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.690> get<00:02:33.810> to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
giving us better blitz angles to get to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.750

in this year's game so you want to make

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.470 
in this year's game so you want to make

that<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.830> know<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:19.980> mean<00:03:20.250> it's<00:03:20.760> pretty<00:03:20.970> simple

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
that you know I mean it's pretty simple

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.390 
that you know I mean it's pretty simple
its<00:03:21.600> place<00:03:21.810> pretty<00:03:22.200> self-explanatory<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:23.340> I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
its place pretty self-explanatory but I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.850 
its place pretty self-explanatory but I
think<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:24.750> actually<00:03:25.110> very<00:03:25.140> effective

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
think that it's actually very effective

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.199 
think that it's actually very effective
in<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.100> year's<00:03:26.310> game<00:03:26.519> here<00:03:26.850> you'll<00:03:27.000> see<00:03:27.120> I'm

they're gonna bounce off I'm gonna have

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.470 
they're gonna bounce off I'm gonna have
to<00:03:31.320> force<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.739> throw<00:03:31.980> into<00:03:32.790> coverage<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.330> that's

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
to force a throw into coverage so that's

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.610 
to force a throw into coverage so that's
what<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.690> wanted<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> talk<00:03:34.110> about<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.380> contain

user<00:04:20.190> control<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:20.760> what<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.180> recommend

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
user control so what I like to recommend

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.219 
user control so what I like to recommend
is<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.979> different<00:04:23.400> player<00:04:24.020> then<00:04:25.020> most

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
is is a different player then most

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.390 
is is a different player then most
people<00:04:25.470> use<00:04:25.710> most<00:04:26.550> people<00:04:26.760> use<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.030> safe

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
people use most people use the safe

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.129 
people use most people use the safe
I<00:04:27.430> like<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.820> recommend<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.690> use<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
I like to recommend you to use it the

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.240 
I like to recommend you to use it the
middle<00:04:29.320> linebacker<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.830> reason<00:04:30.100> is<00:04:30.220> that

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
middle linebacker and the reason is that

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.020 
middle linebacker and the reason is that
is<00:04:30.639> because<00:04:31.270> you<00:04:31.509> can<00:04:32.460> go<00:04:33.460> through<00:04:33.759> here<00:04:33.820> and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
is because you can go through here and

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.999 
is because you can go through here and
you<00:04:34.090> see<00:04:34.270> these<00:04:34.419> hash<00:04:34.660> marks<00:04:35.169> I<00:04:35.350> like<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.800> play

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
you see these hash marks I like to play

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.980 
you see these hash marks I like to play
within<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.340> hash<00:04:36.580> mark<00:04:36.880> so<00:04:37.030> anything<00:04:37.539> in<00:04:37.780> this

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
within the hash mark so anything in this

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.680 
within the hash mark so anything in this
little<00:04:38.259> box<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:39.130> I'm<00:04:39.310> in<00:04:39.520> right<00:04:39.669> here<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.000> my

want to show you is zone blitzing zone
blitzing<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:19.180> year's<00:05:19.389> game<00:05:19.599> is<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.840> little

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
blitzing this year's game is a little

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.210 
blitzing this year's game is a little
bit<00:05:20.110> more<00:05:20.199> effective<00:05:20.590> than<00:05:20.710> man<00:05:20.889> blitzing

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
bit more effective than man blitzing

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.620 
bit more effective than man blitzing
because<00:05:21.460> its<00:05:21.580> own<00:05:21.669> coverage<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.180> my<00:05:22.270> opinion

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
because its own coverage in my opinion

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.180 
because its own coverage in my opinion
it's<00:05:23.020> just<00:05:23.169> a<00:05:23.260> little<00:05:23.500> bit<00:05:23.620> better<00:05:23.800> than<00:05:24.010> man

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
it's just a little bit better than man

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.279 
it's just a little bit better than man
coverage<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:24.669> year<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:26.080> blitz

I want to show you is the loop crash -
and<00:05:28.120> I'll<00:05:28.180> just<00:05:28.210> show<00:05:28.509> you<00:05:28.539> I<00:05:28.630> mean<00:05:28.720> it's<00:05:28.900> a
