all<00:03:16.860> silver<00:03:17.160> team<00:03:17.340> which<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.580> think<00:03:17.790> it's

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
all silver team which I think it's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
all silver team which I think it's
almost<00:03:18.450> possible<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:19.860> probably<00:03:20.040> will<00:03:20.220> be

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
almost possible but it probably will be

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.710 
almost possible but it probably will be
in<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.489> year<00:03:20.700> but<00:03:20.880> here's<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.180> closer<00:03:21.390> look<00:03:21.570> at

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
in this year but here's a closer look at

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.160 
in this year but here's a closer look at
all<00:03:21.900> them<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.709> cards<00:03:23.070> again<00:03:23.720> tickets<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.930> I

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
all them for cards again tickets and I

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.560 
all them for cards again tickets and I
do<00:03:26.100> feel<00:03:26.459> sorry<00:03:26.670> for<00:03:26.940> him<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.090> think<00:03:27.150> he<00:03:27.390> should

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
do feel sorry for him I think he should

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.420 
do feel sorry for him I think he should
still<00:03:27.720> be<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.900> god<00:03:28.110> calm<00:03:28.440> but<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:28.860> he's<00:03:28.980> left<00:03:29.190> mid

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
still be a god calm but if he's left mid

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.640 
still be a god calm but if he's left mid
it<00:03:30.060> starts<00:03:30.540> all<00:03:30.690> probably<00:03:30.989> mean<00:03:31.230> he's<00:03:31.440> going

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
it starts all probably mean he's going

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860 
it starts all probably mean he's going
to<00:03:31.709> end<00:03:31.830> up<00:03:31.950> as<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.250> left<00:03:32.970> midcard<00:03:33.390> even<00:03:33.810> though

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
to end up as a left midcard even though

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.150 
to end up as a left midcard even though
he<00:03:33.959> starts<00:03:34.290> have<00:03:34.380> already<00:03:34.530> changed<00:03:34.860> if<00:03:35.100> I
