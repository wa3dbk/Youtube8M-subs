would organize the buttons and line them

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.770 
would organize the buttons and line them
up<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.649> think<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.850> being<00:00:36.120> around<00:00:36.270> all

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

up and I think just being around all
these<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.700> creative<00:00:38.700> inspiring<00:00:39.120> people

I<00:00:42.420> guess<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> inspired<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:44.129> create<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
I guess the inspired to create kind of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.880 
I guess the inspired to create kind of
something<00:00:45.570> from<00:00:45.690> nothing<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.350> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> do

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
actually beauty of all kinds beauty of

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.460 
actually beauty of all kinds beauty of
like<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> mundane<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:01.199> banal<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.850> everyday

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
like the mundane the banal for everyday

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.490 
like the mundane the banal for everyday
but<00:01:04.470> I'm<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:04.739> interested<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:07.110> science

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
but I'm also interested in the science

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.250 
but I'm also interested in the science
of<00:01:07.650> beauty<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.130> why<00:01:08.310> certain<00:01:08.909> things<00:01:09.260> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
of beauty and why certain things you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.630 
of beauty and why certain things you
know<00:01:10.380> appear<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.010> beautiful<00:01:11.400> why<00:01:11.490> they

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
know appear to be beautiful why they

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.590 
know appear to be beautiful why they
catch<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.090> eye

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so my paintings are actually kind of a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300 
so my paintings are actually kind of a
contrast<00:01:15.420> between<00:01:15.920> hyperrealism

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
contrast between hyperrealism

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.300 
contrast between hyperrealism
and<00:01:17.750> abstract<00:01:18.750> expressionism<00:01:18.890> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> get<00:01:20.189> up

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
and abstract expressionism if you get up

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
and abstract expressionism if you get up
close<00:01:20.610> you'll<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.630> paintings

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
close you'll see that the paintings

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
close you'll see that the paintings
actually<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:23.159> kind<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.520> abstract<00:01:24.270> or

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
actually really kind of abstract or

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.870 
actually really kind of abstract or
painterly<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.740> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.979> textured<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.759> as

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
painterly and kind of textured but as

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.760 
painterly and kind of textured but as
you're<00:01:27.000> back<00:01:27.150> off<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.720> becomes<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.560> more

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you're back off it becomes kind of more

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.730 
you're back off it becomes kind of more
photorealistic<00:01:29.509> because<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.350> math

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
photorealistic because I have a math

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
photorealistic because I have a math
degree<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.310> an<00:01:32.430> architecture<00:01:33.150> degree<00:01:33.299> I'm

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
degree in an architecture degree I'm

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.649 
degree in an architecture degree I'm
like<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:34.460> highly<00:01:35.460> detailed<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.420> way<00:01:36.600> you

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
like really highly detailed that way you

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
like really highly detailed that way you
know<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.549> kind

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
know and so I it's kind of this is kind

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
know and so I it's kind of this is kind
of<00:01:38.820> what<00:01:39.000> comes<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:41.040> I've

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
of what comes out and so I think I've

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
of what comes out and so I think I've
always<00:01:41.549> been<00:01:41.759> doing<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.540> way<00:01:42.649> painting

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
always been doing it this way painting

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
always been doing it this way painting
and<00:01:43.979> drawing<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:46.399> think<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.090> part<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and drawing and I think it's a part of a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
and drawing and I think it's a part of a
person's<00:01:48.840> personality<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:50.159> comes<00:01:50.369> out

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
person's personality what what comes out

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
person's personality what what comes out
you<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.149> mean<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:52.110> live<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.680> certain

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you know what I mean you live a certain

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.399 
you know what I mean you live a certain
way<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.810> art<00:01:54.960> comes<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
way and so your your art comes out a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.870 
way and so your your art comes out a
certain<00:01:55.740> way<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.119> comes<00:01:57.329> out

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.420 

well<00:02:04.880> when<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.150> see<00:02:05.510> something<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.440> captures

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
well when I see something that captures

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.090 
well when I see something that captures
my<00:02:07.580> eye<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:08.179> take<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.840> 200<00:02:09.380> thousands<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:09.950> it

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
my eye I take like 200 thousands of it

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.559 
my eye I take like 200 thousands of it
and<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:12.370> transfer<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> computer<00:02:14.030> and

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
and then I transfer to the computer and

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.840 
and then I transfer to the computer and
I<00:02:15.230> play<00:02:15.380> with<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.620> in<00:02:15.709> Photoshop<00:02:16.280> or<00:02:16.610> something
