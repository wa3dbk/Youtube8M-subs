 if the meat is cooked, the face has to do with it 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.970
 muscle tracks but look how beautiful of 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.060
 which at this point we go to 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.549
 place on a bassolino but we have to 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.270
 leave for a moment ice pagan 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.830

 warm parades I recommend we put 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:40.980
 so we made a wreath of potatoes 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.500
 we will also position our language 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.190

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.430
 to embellish to finish we say that stage yes 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.190
