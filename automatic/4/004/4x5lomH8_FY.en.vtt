00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.710
 world cup so today I 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.660
 Come and have a little tutorial 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.130
 asked it was to transfer a 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.139
 image on a t-shirt 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.360
 so I already asked you 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.310
 so I'm here I finally got 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.369
 the papers so I can finally you the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.100
 So why do you need the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 transfer paper so I bought some 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.960
 transfer paper of the brand phoenix 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.220
 so that's what it looks like so the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.619
 cover is this one is so here 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.079
 it's for pure white t-shirts their 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.660
 faith and for publishing think it's like 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.420
 so that 's different papers so 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.879
 with different doses so the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.239
 paper like that for whites this will be 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.410
 what this dollars so in fact when you 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.620
 will have the image there you put yourself 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 directly the image on the shirt 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.750
 meal is like that and for the black 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 it was like that with style 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.270
 grid behind so me 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.770
 personally I find that a lot 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.629
 more convenient because to cut out 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.489
 it was much simpler so no 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.520
 same principle as for lightning so 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.979
 so when you print an image via 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.659
 transfer paper the rest of the pattern 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.400
 will be all white if you have so by 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.570
 example you with a logo so what I 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.860
 advise you it's just to cut 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.890
 unless you have a white by 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.810
 example it's not really useful then 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.030
 how much will it cost to cost a little 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.159
 close to 10 euros for 10 sheets so 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.110
 5 for clear t-shirts and 5 for 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.820
 the small French fields so that's 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.259
 rather affordable I bought this on ebay 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 but after I think you can in 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.100
 find maybe in the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.750
 in the small leisure shops I 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.950
 think it might be possible is possible 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.720
 if it's possible I'll leave you a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.460
 little comment telling us where we 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.869
 to find otherwise that's what I tell you 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.060
 I found that for a little bit of 10 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.880
 euros on the idh so is I then I 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.200
 printed on that on the actions of which I 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.820
 I'm sorry I do not have a black tee shirt 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.179
 available to make it small 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.630
 reasons 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.950
 so that's for me because I'm a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.990
 fana of wonder woman is the super pattern 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.429
 bad for my darling so then you have 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.400
 you make fun of me but why two 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.030
 because I was stupid so you have to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.390
 reverse the s like this to be able to 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.880
 see 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.799
 normal at the time of the little cat so 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.000
 so here it is on the transfer paper 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.910
 I have a pony but I advise you 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.959
 strongly to sell the printed 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.850
 directly on our paper this 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.360
 transfer to do it on a sheet 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.940
 normal so I did poorly on the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.260
 normal red line to see 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.670
 which side are printable so once 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.010
 that I saw that I was able to print 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.190
 correctly my papers otherwise I was able to 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.540
 to do in the second time besides 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.549
 so here's once that these prints I 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.200
 however, advise you to leave 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.780
 including five minutes the story that 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.079
 attack hurts adhere well to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.790
 paper and after that well you 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.320
 get your two t-shirts so I have 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.730
 two white tee shirt that I you 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.500
 advise to iron a little bit for 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.650
 easter and more at the time of transfer 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.510
 so they're working from 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.890
 while elsewhere 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.130
 to start I cut them out and 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.130
 pattern 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.850
 so that's what it is once that 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.260
 it's all cut out so yeah I 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.510
 really from the little queen who has Belgian 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.740
 do not know if you've been careful 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.410
 that they had on them because 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.660
 frankly I do not care so I'm going 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.280
 tell you right away for the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.830
 transfer so once your father 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.410
 is hot for you can iron 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.790
 so you see it's a little motive you want 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.050
 it's pretty much never used 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.670
 a lot of patience but if it's a 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.870
 format a4 for example leave you a 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.310
 about 4 4 minutes 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.050
 so here I just spent the game 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.670
 we will hear a minute united 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.740
 admire I confess I did more 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.290
 we are never too sure so now 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.770
 we will let cool a little bit 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.720
 pattern for at least a minute and 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.940
 after that we'll just have to take off 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.530
 who is little fire y this little 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.130
 film to reveal the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.130
 grounds therefore had to take off 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.169
 wow 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.410
 so that's so pretty I love so 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.030
 after you really do what you 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.449
 want but me it was really a 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.449
 little kiff so there is my boyfriend to have 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.860
 so here I love it too too stylish in 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.590
 more for cheap and I was very happy 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.750
 and English so that's it then 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.610
 some little tips now so 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.419
 before washing you let pass 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.979
 about 24 hours is 1 1 surely 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.810
 for the transfer of the image to pass 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.930
 going really properly had it 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.909
 not above 40 degrees so be it 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.789
 a little bit changed I recognize it but 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:16.569
 good to have it custom tshirts 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:20.979
 has no price as we say so washed 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:23.710
 the 40 Â° allende is obviously 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.210
 we know how to do upside down without 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.349
 the other I had stuff like that 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.970
 something that could discolor me 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.830
 because bad and covers more type than 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.380
 you will be well drake 2 not really that 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.120

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.509
 but there I had another another 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.830
 request it's a good ride so I can not wait 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.330
 to make it happen you will just have to 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.130
 wait a little bit because 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.409
