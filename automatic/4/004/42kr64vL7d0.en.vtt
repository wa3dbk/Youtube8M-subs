00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.409
 we heat olive oil in a pan 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.970
 and we add the mushrooms we cook to 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.030

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.890
 we put the dough inside a 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.030
 mold for quiche about 25 centimeters 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.030

 on this we put a good handful of 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.379
 chickpeas so that the dough does not rise 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.480
 during baking we bake for 15 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.060

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.260
 bowl where we beat the eggs 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.850
 we take back to the oven and bake 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.190
 for 40 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.810

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.940
