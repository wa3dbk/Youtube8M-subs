well<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.110> can't<00:00:01.410> imagine<00:00:01.500> there's<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.040> chance<00:00:02.310> in

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
well I can't imagine there's a chance in

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.220 
well I can't imagine there's a chance in
the<00:00:02.610> world<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.120> baby<00:00:03.389> would<00:00:03.600> crank<00:00:03.959> has

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
the world that this baby would crank has

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.990 
the world that this baby would crank has
been<00:00:04.470> sitting<00:00:04.799> here<00:00:04.830> for<00:00:05.130> six<00:00:05.339> or<00:00:05.490> seven<00:00:05.850> weeks

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
been sitting here for six or seven weeks

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.310 
been sitting here for six or seven weeks
for<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.390> tarp<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.400> hasn't<00:00:08.400> been<00:00:08.550> started

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
for the tarp on it hasn't been started

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.799 
for the tarp on it hasn't been started
at<00:00:10.320> all<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.309> battery<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.759> more<00:00:12.690> than

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
at all and the battery is more than

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.760 
at all and the battery is more than
likely<00:00:13.250> completely<00:00:14.250> dead<00:00:15.410> but<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> need<00:00:16.680> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
likely completely dead but I need to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.470 
likely completely dead but I need to
crank<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> move<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.699> because<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.270> have

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
crank it and move it because we have

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.630 
crank it and move it because we have
snow<00:00:18.810> coming<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.980> spot<00:00:20.400> we're
