00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.120
 on Tuesdays 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.320
 is being the most boring day of the 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.030

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.270

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.850
 I'm going to take your best friend monster 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.910

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 Who is your best friend is going to take 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 me to the concert of Justin Bieber 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.330
 of course 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.690
 how much more 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 life because I felt sorry I'm your best 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.649
 our life 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.649
 draculaura 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.460
 and is that someone will be offended if I get 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.460
 my helmets at the concert 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:31.689

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:35.299
 I raise to see what you're doing thanks 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.740
 because this is not the best friend of 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.170
 franky 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.810
 and he said he likes to invite 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.479
 have lunch with him and his zombies do not be 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.670
 shy we will go together frank and you 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.649
 I will accompany although you do not know who is going to 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.870
 Go to the concert with strides as you have to 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.780
 clarify this 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.700
 Y 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.530

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.540

 I take all my best monster 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.650
 friends are decades 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.180
 then because he put in the blog of 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.220
 aspect that could only lead to one 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.560

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 post the news in a hurry is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.910

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.590
 details it will be better to do as the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.590
 ghosts and disappear days 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.420
