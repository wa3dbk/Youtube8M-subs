will<00:02:44.709> probably<00:02:45.100> be<00:02:45.250> electric<00:02:45.700> but<00:02:46.360> there's

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
will probably be electric but there's

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.920 
will probably be electric but there's
still<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.230> lot<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.440> fun<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.890> preserving

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
still a lot of fun in preserving

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.180 
still a lot of fun in preserving
historical<00:02:49.930> technology<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.739> keeping<00:02:51.130> it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
historical technology and keeping it

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.150 
historical technology and keeping it
exactly<00:02:51.670> as<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.000> was<00:02:52.180> I'm<00:02:52.570> not<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:52.989> for

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
exactly as it was I'm not one for

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.800 
exactly as it was I'm not one for
modifying<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.820> any<00:02:55.000> way<00:02:55.120> if<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:55.690> avoid

modifying it in any way if you can avoid

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.650 
modifying it in any way if you can avoid
it<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.860> these<00:02:57.040> cars<00:02:57.400> work<00:02:57.700> exactly<00:02:58.150> as<00:02:58.329> they

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
it so these cars work exactly as they

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.560 
it so these cars work exactly as they
