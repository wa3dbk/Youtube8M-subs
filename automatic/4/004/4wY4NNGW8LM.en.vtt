was the big step for puzzle games now
bad<00:00:16.619> rats<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> next<00:00:17.970> big<00:00:18.270> step<00:00:18.380> this

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
bad rats this is the next big step this

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.439 
bad rats this is the next big step this
is<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> negative<00:00:20.850> thinking<00:00:21.180> man's

smarter guys up they appreciate this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.580 
smarter guys up they appreciate this
kind<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.039> intellectualism<00:00:27.289> display<00:00:28.289> here

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
kind of intellectualism display here

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.209 
kind of intellectualism display here
like<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.210> right<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:30.869> thinking<00:00:31.349> why

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
like you know right now I'm thinking why

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.490 
like you know right now I'm thinking why
is<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.610> bulldozer<00:00:33.210> guy<00:00:33.630> driving<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
is this bulldozer guy driving on the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.650 
is this bulldozer guy driving on the
side<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> wall<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.790> how<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.030> father<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
side of the wall like how the father is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780 
side of the wall like how the father is
that<00:00:36.840> possible<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.070> immediately<00:00:38.610> I'm

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
that possible so just immediately I'm

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.490 
that possible so just immediately I'm
gonna<00:00:38.940> start<00:00:39.239> breaking<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.840> these<00:00:40.050> advanced

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
gonna start breaking out these advanced

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
gonna start breaking out these advanced
techniques<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> called<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> rat

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
techniques this is called the rat

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.410 
techniques this is called the rat
stacking<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.190> basic<00:00:44.610> ideas<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.270> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
stacking so the basic ideas here you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
stacking so the basic ideas here you
make<00:00:45.690> two<00:00:45.989> big<00:00:46.200> piles<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.860> rats<00:00:47.210> pretty<00:00:48.210> much

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
make two big piles of rats pretty much

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.690 
make two big piles of rats pretty much
just<00:00:48.660> put<00:00:48.899> all<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> rats<00:00:49.500> into<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.250> big<00:00:50.460> piles

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
just put all the rats into two big piles

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.069 
just put all the rats into two big piles
and<00:00:50.910> then<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.149> go<00:00:51.329> ahead<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:51.930> gonna

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and then you go ahead and then I'm gonna

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.560 
and then you go ahead and then I'm gonna
finish<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.980> them<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> little

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
finish this off of them put a little

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
finish this off of them put a little
trampoline<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.780> top<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> fat<00:00:55.469> rat

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
trampoline on top of the fat rat

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.220 
trampoline on top of the fat rat
now<00:00:56.340> theoretically<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> baseball<00:00:57.660> rat<00:00:57.899> he

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
now theoretically the baseball rat he

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.290 
now theoretically the baseball rat he
should<00:00:58.500> hit<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.070> ball<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.640> then<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.149> should

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
should hit that ball and then it should

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.939 
should hit that ball and then it should
go<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> cannon<00:01:01.109> guy<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.800> just

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
go to the cannon guy and then they just

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.889 
go to the cannon guy and then they just
passed<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> line<00:01:03.059> until<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.660> gets<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
passed it down the line until it gets to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.620 
passed it down the line until it gets to
the<00:01:04.019> bulldozer<00:01:04.500> guy<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.400> he<00:01:05.640> drives<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.390> over

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the bulldozer guy then he drives it over

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.840 
the bulldozer guy then he drives it over
here<00:01:06.960> into<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.439> bomb<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.460> bomb

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
here into the bomb and then that bomb

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
here into the bomb and then that bomb
will<00:01:09.150> blow<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> chain<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.140> free<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> cat

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
will blow up the chain and free the cat

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
will blow up the chain and free the cat
so<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> objective<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> game<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.750> help

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so the objective of the game is to help

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.760 
so the objective of the game is to help
the<00:01:13.110> cat<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.799> let's<00:01:14.010> try<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> sound<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> oh

hey<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.400> worked<00:03:48.880> yep<00:03:49.390> so<00:03:50.020> it's<00:03:50.050> obvious

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
hey and it worked yep so it's obvious

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.199 
hey and it worked yep so it's obvious
you<00:03:50.709> know<00:03:50.800> once<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.130> see<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.490> it's<00:03:51.640> out<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:52.060> I'm

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
you know once you see it it's out so I'm

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.330 
you know once you see it it's out so I'm
seeing<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.990> cat<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.620> already<00:03:54.069> dead

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
seeing that the cat is already dead

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.160 
seeing that the cat is already dead
before<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.880> level<00:03:55.180> even<00:03:55.300> started<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.080> the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
before the level even started in the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.530 
before the level even started in the
microwave<00:03:56.680> over<00:03:57.040> there<00:03:57.270> so<00:03:58.270> I'm<00:03:58.360> gonna

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
microwave over there so I'm gonna

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.380 
microwave over there so I'm gonna
attempt<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.170> solve<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.830> anyway<00:04:00.220> maybe<00:04:01.209> it's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
attempt to solve it anyway maybe it's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.430 
attempt to solve it anyway maybe it's
just<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.630> little<00:04:01.660> glitch

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
just a little glitch

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.640 
just a little glitch

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
oh I beat it it's obvious when she's

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.870 
oh I beat it it's obvious when she's
once<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.010> see<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.370> happen<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.360> oh<00:04:07.660> is<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.680> it
