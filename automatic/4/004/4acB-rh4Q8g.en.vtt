00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.240
 hi hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.910
 welcome to my channel one more time and 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.950
 thanks for watching one more of my videos and 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.080
 I'm back with a beautiful hairstyle 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.540
 which I hope you like in this 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.660
 I am going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.210
 braid that is for long hair / more 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.950
 long have the prettiest hair goes 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.500
 to see and well we started 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.530
 from this side of his head here to the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.600
 height of your ear I will take a 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 hair section 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.199
 that is not too big or too small like that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.230
 Now I'm going to take a hair section 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.480
 on the other side since I have here my two 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.300
 sections of hair one on each side 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.530
 I'm going to take a small section of 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.390
 hair of the one who gave me 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.250
 well there it is already I have my three 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.469
 sections since I have my three 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.309
 hair sections I will start to 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.799
 braid a basic braid but this 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.430
 braid is going to be woven down like 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.649
 I had taught them in my video from before 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.640
 then this one happened below the 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.350
 this medium and passed it down to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.990
 in the middle too 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.120
 then I go back and I repeat this is for 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.230
 down 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.690
 This passes down the middle 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.110
 and this goes down to the middle 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.230
 as well 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.030
 well once I've done this I'm going to 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.150
 start feeding my braid with 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.920
 small sections of hair that are 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.920
 very very tiny 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.690
 now I pass this down and food of 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.690
 this other side 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.549
 now I come back and come back from this side and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.549
 fed my braid 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.600
 pay attention to go straight for 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.750
 here because if not the braid can be 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.300
 move to and fro is not going to 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.150
 see very right what we want is that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.490
 stay in the center of the head good 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.880
 I continue to feed my braid with small 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.880
 sections 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.060
 good look and so we are leaving the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.060
 braid 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.159
 Then I will continue adding hair 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.159
 from the sides 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.530
 well then look, I still have the 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.959
 hair down here 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.900
 I'm not going to add more, I'm just going to 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.020
 keep tracing what I have here until 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.020
 the end 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.740
 here I'm just going to hold with a 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.260
 rubber 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.590
 now that they have finished the braid can 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.870
 return and accommodate the segments of 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.490
 hair as they want it if they want it 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.920
 looser can loosen them 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.920
 so that the braid looks prettier 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 I'm going to pinch these in the middle too 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.140
 I've already taught them before in other videos 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.530
 how to do this 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.520
 and this is just to make it look more 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.520
 pretty the braid 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.489
 you can leave it the other way 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.180
 if you like, it also looks very pretty 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.180
 but this time I am 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.180
 pinching 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.510
 and well, the braid is left 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.690
 It is a very simple and very easy braid 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.690
 to do 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.760
