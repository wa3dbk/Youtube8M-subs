 understand that we're going to get to a point 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.259

 they were going to make you more point of view 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.990
 the approach taken because it 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.360
 approved with a subscribe assembly 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.950
 part of the agreements of the proposals 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.299
 that we have and equally we 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 subscribe to any of the proposals 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.560
 listen to the proposal that I am 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.119
 making the understood one that moves us 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.360
 The only interest that moves us is 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.000
 present a formula that before the state 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.710
 Venezuelan represents the totality of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 the workers today joyfully 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.159
 We tell the traitors to work 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.099
 university to the country that with good sense 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.080
 they have placed their trust in everyone 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.150
 we for this discussion today are 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.030
 started this discussion on the 23rd and the 24th 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.489
 I continued to pretend to close there that 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.340
 chapter and in that sense we go with good 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.590
 standing to win the best contract 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.030
 collective of the university sector to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.010
 dignify the condition of 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.260
 workers and that never happens again 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.910
 what he calls the overlapping of 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.400
 tabulators for the idea that we're going to 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.220
 confirm to conform through the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.590
 thesis the two minimum wages one a 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.910
 salary tabulator that every time you 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.720
 dies minimum wage is moving 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.910
 automatic 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.560
 and we do not have to resort again to 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.670
 that the state helped because we were 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.950
 below minimum wages 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.690
 national economic proposals 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.820
 salaries that have to do with the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.290
 wage indexation were approved by 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.300
 the colleagues present them there 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.160
 they agreed the approach of 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.510
 make the proposal and also in the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.460
 hc theme on the subject of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.690
 retired workers in that sense 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.700
 we see with good sense this 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.950
 Very fruitful meeting very very 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.930

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.640
 very pleasant we think we are marching 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.530

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.360
 thanks to colleagues the unions 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.100

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.930
 national union work in the one 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.310

 workers on the job 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.650
 fight to conquer the best 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.700
 collective bargaining for the sector 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.700
