driven on the mines

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.600 
driven on the mines
and<00:01:54.119> I'm<00:01:55.119> sure<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:55.509> one<00:01:55.659> has<00:01:55.840> as<00:01:56.080> well<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.549> I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
and I'm sure this one has as well but I

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.889 
and I'm sure this one has as well but I
figured<00:01:57.909> out<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.030> would<00:01:58.299> bring<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.539> all<00:01:58.689> along

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
figured out I would bring you all along

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.120 
figured out I would bring you all along
with<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.170> progress<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.799> it

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
with the progress of it

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.719 
with the progress of it
I<00:02:00.159> plan<00:02:00.939> on<00:02:01.020> lifting<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.549> doing<00:02:03.549> what<00:02:03.640> they

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
I plan on lifting it I doing what they

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.429 
I plan on lifting it I doing what they
call<00:02:03.850> spring<00:02:04.210> over<00:02:04.479> axle<00:02:04.960> kit

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
call spring over axle kit

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.910 
call spring over axle kit
as<00:02:06.399> for<00:02:06.609> spring<00:02:06.939> over<00:02:07.210> axle<00:02:07.659> lifts<00:02:07.869> on<00:02:08.079> it<00:02:08.289> and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
as for spring over axle lifts on it and

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.520 
as for spring over axle lifts on it and
I'm<00:02:09.130> definitely<00:02:09.579> gonna<00:02:10.269> paint<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.170> I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
I'm definitely gonna paint it so I

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.949 
I'm definitely gonna paint it so I
figured<00:02:12.430> I'd<00:02:12.519> bring<00:02:12.670> everybody<00:02:12.970> along<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.720> I

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
figured I'd bring everybody along so I

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.870 
figured I'd bring everybody along so I
guess<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.769> don't<00:02:15.100> nothing<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.519> in<00:02:15.609> part

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
guess it's I don't nothing to do in part

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.240 
guess it's I don't nothing to do in part
one<00:02:16.090> or<00:02:16.120> what<00:02:16.570> but<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.650> guess<00:02:17.799> will<00:02:18.220> be

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
one or what but this I guess will be

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.599 
one or what but this I guess will be
part<00:02:18.640> one<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.329> what<00:02:19.540> I'm<00:02:19.630> doing<00:02:19.840> now<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.609> I'm

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
part one so what I'm doing now is I'm

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.420 
part one so what I'm doing now is I'm
try<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.850> bypass<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.720> EGR<00:02:23.049> valve<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.370> know

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
try to bypass the EGR valve and I know

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.880 
try to bypass the EGR valve and I know
some<00:02:24.790> people<00:02:25.060> say<00:02:25.209> that's<00:02:25.450> bad<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.620> it'll

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
some people say that's bad and it'll

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.890 
some people say that's bad and it'll
melt<00:02:27.100> your<00:02:27.220> valve<00:02:27.430> down<00:02:27.670> stuff<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.450> but

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
melt your valve down stuff like that but

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.259 
melt your valve down stuff like that but
I<00:02:29.140> don't<00:02:29.650> really<00:02:29.769> see<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> problem<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.820> doing

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
I don't really see a problem with doing

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.870 
I don't really see a problem with doing
it<00:02:31.359> on<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.660> one<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.340> wouldn't<00:02:33.340> do<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.579> newer

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
it on this one I wouldn't do it on newer

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.940 
it on this one I wouldn't do it on newer
one<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.840> older<00:02:35.200> he'll<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.799> have

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
I don't know pictures of when i built a

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.130 
I don't know pictures of when i built a
jeep<00:04:16.130> cherokee<00:04:16.160> from<00:04:16.880> start<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.330> finish<00:04:17.360> so<00:04:17.690> i

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
jeep cherokee from start to finish so i

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.560 
jeep cherokee from start to finish so i
do<00:04:18.440> quite<00:04:18.770> a<00:04:18.799> bit<00:04:18.890> of<00:04:19.040> these<00:04:19.130> projects<00:04:19.820> i<00:04:20.000> just

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
do quite a bit of these projects i just

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.050 
do quite a bit of these projects i just
playing<00:04:20.810> around<00:04:21.280> but<00:04:22.280> i<00:04:22.340> usually<00:04:22.760> don't

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
playing around but i usually don't

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.380 
playing around but i usually don't
videotape<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.660> so<00:04:23.870> i<00:04:23.900> actually<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:24.470> should<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:26.150> I

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
videotape it so i actually I should so I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.540 
videotape it so i actually I should so I
guess<00:04:26.660> this<00:04:26.810> is<00:04:27.020> part<00:04:27.410> one<00:04:29.200> demolition

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
guess this is part one demolition

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.530 
guess this is part one demolition

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.560 
done now it just sprayed the whole
inside<00:05:12.740> with<00:05:12.980> degreaser<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:14.180> reason<00:05:14.420> why<00:05:14.540> I

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
inside with degreaser the reason why I

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.400 
inside with degreaser the reason why I
didn't<00:05:14.840> take<00:05:14.930> that<00:05:14.990> seat<00:05:15.470> out<00:05:17.290> let's<00:05:18.290> see

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
didn't take that seat out let's see

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.290 
didn't take that seat out let's see
doesn't<00:05:18.740> bolt<00:05:18.920> in<00:05:19.190> it's<00:05:19.460> welded<00:05:19.760> in<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.240> I

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
doesn't bolt in it's welded in and I

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.940 
doesn't bolt in it's welded in and I
think<00:05:20.510> it's<00:05:20.690> factory<00:05:21.170> weld<00:05:21.380> again<00:05:21.680> I'll<00:05:21.830> have

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
think it's factory weld again I'll have

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.130 
think it's factory weld again I'll have
to<00:05:22.010> look<00:05:22.250> some<00:05:22.460> more<00:05:22.700> to<00:05:22.850> see<00:05:22.880> if<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.180> can't<00:05:23.450> get

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
to look some more to see if I can't get

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.690 
to look some more to see if I can't get
it<00:05:24.230> out<00:05:24.380> but<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:24.590> plan<00:05:24.830> on<00:05:24.860> changing<00:05:24.980> the<00:05:25.430> seats
