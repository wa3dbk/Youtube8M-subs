00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.780 
through it right here I did not but
before<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.770> guys<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.490> want<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> have

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
before you guys do this you want to have

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.999 
before you guys do this you want to have
resilience<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.500> rock<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
resilience on so go on this rock and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.560 
resilience on so go on this rock and
then<00:01:29.159> pull<00:01:29.369> backwards<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.180> you'll<00:01:30.360> fall

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
then pull backwards and then you'll fall

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.420 
then pull backwards and then you'll fall
under<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> map<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.860> said<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.100> didn't

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
under the map but like I said I didn't

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
under the map but like I said I didn't
have<00:01:32.549> resilience<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.140> i<00:01:34.170> did<00:01:34.320> not

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
have resilience on so that way i did not

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
have resilience on so that way i did not
survive<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.600> then<00:01:36.600> i'm<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> show

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
survive and then i'm just going to show

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
survive and then i'm just going to show
