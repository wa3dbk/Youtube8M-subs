you're the type of person who plans on

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.090 
you're the type of person who plans on
buying<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:25.030> unit<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.830> investing<00:03:26.830> your

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
buying a unit and investing your

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.030 
buying a unit and investing your
hard-earned<00:03:27.460> coins<00:03:27.940> into<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:29.830> want

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
hard-earned coins into it and you want

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.340 
hard-earned coins into it and you want
to<00:03:30.130> wear<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.490> every<00:03:30.880> day<00:03:30.910> non-stop<00:03:31.330> for<00:03:32.020> months

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
to wear it every day non-stop for months

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.230 
to wear it every day non-stop for months
and<00:03:32.500> months<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.890> months<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.520> will<00:03:33.880> probably

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
and months and months I will probably

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.230 
and months and months I will probably
say<00:03:34.540> think<00:03:35.020> twice<00:03:35.620> before<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.340> order<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.730> curly

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
say think twice before you order a curly

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.630 
say think twice before you order a curly
unique<00:03:37.660> because<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.990> found<00:03:38.320> that<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:39.250> curly

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
unique because I found that the curly

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.430 
unique because I found that the curly
units<00:03:39.970> shed<00:03:40.330> more<00:03:40.660> than<00:03:40.720> their<00:03:41.080> straight

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
units shed more than their straight

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.190 
units shed more than their straight
units<00:03:41.860> my<00:03:42.490> straight<00:03:42.850> unit<00:03:43.120> didn't<00:03:43.600> shed<00:03:43.900> that

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
units my straight unit didn't shed that

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.540 
units my straight unit didn't shed that
much<00:03:44.470> at<00:03:45.040> all<00:03:45.420> until<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.630> got<00:03:46.780> oh<00:03:47.020> you<00:03:47.710> know<00:03:47.830> so
