anyone<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.010> start<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> compare<00:00:59.699> their<00:00:59.910> actual

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
anyone we start to compare their actual

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
anyone we start to compare their actual
workings<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> two<00:01:01.260> weapons<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.739> we

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
workings of the two weapons that we

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.950 
workings of the two weapons that we
start<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.340> differences<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> most

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
start see differences and the most

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
start see differences and the most
obvious<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.250> fact<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.880> brass

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
obvious one is the fact that the brass

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060 
obvious one is the fact that the brass
knuckles<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.229> considerably

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
knuckles are actually considerably

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.070 
knuckles are actually considerably
faster<00:01:08.430> than<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> warmonger<00:01:09.450> fists<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
faster than the warmonger fists and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.560 
faster than the warmonger fists and
that's<00:01:10.710> both<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> left<00:01:11.580> click<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's both on the left click and the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
that's both on the left click and the
right<00:01:12.780> click

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.039 

now<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> jeweled<00:01:17.759> eagle<00:01:18.030> green<00:01:18.270> however<00:01:18.659> has

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
now the jeweled eagle green however has

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.530 
now the jeweled eagle green however has
a<00:01:19.079> faster<00:01:19.860> reload<00:01:20.220> than<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> pink<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
a faster reload than the pink and of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.830 
a faster reload than the pink and of
course<00:01:21.570> obviously<00:01:21.960> plus<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.649> ammo<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.840> can

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
course obviously plus for ammo which can

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.410 
course obviously plus for ammo which can
it<00:01:24.990> doesn't<00:01:25.320> make<00:01:25.439> sense<00:01:25.829> but<00:01:26.159> whatever

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.120 

now<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.290> honest<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:34.740> there's<00:01:35.009> nothing

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
now to be honest I think there's nothing

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.359 
now to be honest I think there's nothing
wrong<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.850> nothing<00:01:36.470> particularly<00:01:37.470> new<00:01:37.710> about

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
wrong or nothing particularly new about

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.510 
wrong or nothing particularly new about
the<00:01:38.729> jeweled<00:01:39.240> Eagle<00:01:39.780> green<00:01:40.140> vein<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.009> think

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the jeweled Eagle green vein I think

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
the jeweled Eagle green vein I think
they're<00:01:41.640> still<00:01:42.330> good<00:01:42.840> pistols<00:01:43.439> they're<00:01:43.740> still

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
they're still good pistols they're still

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740 
they're still good pistols they're still
really<00:01:44.189> good<00:01:44.460> fun<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> fact

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
really good fun to use I like the fact

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.330 
really good fun to use I like the fact
they've<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.259> shine<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:47.070> nice

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
they've out the shine to it that's nice

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.930 
they've out the shine to it that's nice
for<00:01:47.640> fast<00:01:48.420> mo<00:01:48.720> makes<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.110> even<00:01:49.229> more<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.940> be

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
for fast mo makes it even more not be

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.440 
for fast mo makes it even more not be
more<00:01:51.180> less<00:01:51.330> even<00:01:51.659> better<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.770> whole<00:01:53.520> faster

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
more less even better the whole faster

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.210 
more less even better the whole faster
reload<00:01:54.810> improves<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> can

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
reload improves them on that so you can

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.969 
reload improves them on that so you can
literally<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:56.759> shooting<00:01:57.539> now<00:01:57.689> people<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.380> mere

seconds<00:01:59.759> on<00:02:00.149> end<00:02:02.420> however<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.810> comes<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
seconds on end however when it comes to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.090 
seconds on end however when it comes to
the<00:02:04.530> warmonger<00:02:05.280> fists<00:02:05.789> I<00:02:06.710> absolutely<00:02:07.710> hated

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
know where I meant to be hitting the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.160 
know where I meant to be hitting the
warmonger<00:02:26.730> fists<00:02:27.090> feel<00:02:27.269> like<00:02:27.540> you're<00:02:27.780> lugging

around<00:02:28.260> these<00:02:28.680> slow<00:02:29.370> bulky<00:02:30.180> oversized<00:02:30.840> things

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
around these slow bulky oversized things

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.400 
around these slow bulky oversized things
and<00:02:31.610> because<00:02:32.610> they're<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.120> big<00:02:33.450> you're<00:02:34.200> often

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
and because they're so big you're often

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.740 
and because they're so big you're often
wondering<00:02:35.400> where<00:02:35.640> exactly<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.299> meant<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.600> be

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
wondering where exactly you meant to be

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.360 
wondering where exactly you meant to be
hitting<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.170> person<00:02:37.680> because<00:02:37.920> they've<00:02:38.070> got

hitting the person because they've got

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.699 
hitting the person because they've got
the<00:02:38.519> same<00:02:38.760> sort<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.239> splashes<00:02:39.959> with<00:02:40.290> brass
