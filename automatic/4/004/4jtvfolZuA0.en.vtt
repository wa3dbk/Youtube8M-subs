know that that's not a content for

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.250 
know that that's not a content for
maybe<00:00:59.430> give<00:00:59.700> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.820> wider<00:01:00.300> berth<00:01:00.630> and<00:01:00.870> let

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
maybe give a little wider berth and let

the<00:01:03.930> victory<00:01:04.260> exactly<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.070> Jacques

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
the victory exactly I think Jacques

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.820

go<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.460> clear<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.940> his<00:01:09.000> way<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.570> he

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
go and clear out of his way because he

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.590 
go and clear out of his way because he
looks<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.740> he's<00:01:10.940> for<00:01:11.940> somebody<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.300> collect

situation<00:05:37.680> too<00:05:38.219> hard<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:38.729> used<00:05:38.969> the<00:05:39.120> tires

he's<00:05:40.349> slow<00:05:40.710> around<00:05:40.949> the<00:05:41.129> corners<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:41.610> think

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
he's slow around the corners I think

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.550

another car and that was the only a
close<00:07:34.070> call<00:07:34.310> ahead<00:07:34.460> was<00:07:35.390> it<00:07:35.510> a<00:07:35.570> case<00:07:35.720> of

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:35.780 
close call ahead was it a case of

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.650 
close call ahead was it a case of
slowing<00:07:36.350> down<00:07:36.530> for<00:07:36.590> the<00:07:36.950> rain<00:07:37.220> and<00:07:37.460> perhaps

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:37.660 
slowing down for the rain and perhaps

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.450 
slowing down for the rain and perhaps
conserving<00:07:38.660> the<00:07:38.780> fuel<00:07:39.050> just<00:07:39.260> a<00:07:39.350> bit<00:07:39.530> well<00:07:40.310> the

conserving the fuel just a bit well the

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.980 
conserving the fuel just a bit well the
plan<00:07:40.640> was<00:07:40.820> to<00:07:40.880> say<00:07:41.060> if<00:07:41.120> you<00:07:41.270> will<00:07:41.390> race<00:07:41.780> I
