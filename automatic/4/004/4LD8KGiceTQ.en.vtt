00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello today we will realize 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.010
 my chocolate mousse recipe 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 it combines the three flavors of 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.759
 chocolate we will use so chocolate 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.590
 milk and dark chocolate for the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.330
 mousse and white chocolate to give 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.640
 a bit of crunch at the end of the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 recipe is also for decoration 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.130
 for this recipe we need 125 g of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.160
 milk chocolate 125 g dark chocolate 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.260
 6th whole 40 g caster sugar 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 pinch of salt is also a wafer of 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.860
 white chocolate to finish our 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.110
 decoration for this recipe we 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.420
 are going to use the Kenwood robot with the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.770
 liver balloon and the flexible drummer then 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.660
 so to start the recipe we go 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 use the water bath to make for 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.670
 him the two chocolate chocolates at 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.930
 milk and dark chocolate 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.180
 it always melts the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 chocolate evenly without doing it 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.000
 burn without having to add water or 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.879
 butter here is the chocolate he is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.440
 well melted we will leave it out of fire on 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.460
 leave a little rest 5 to 10 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.329
 minutes story that took over the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.949
 try to cool 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.360
 because if you put it directly 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.729
 opening your eyes that will start to them 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.590
 leathers and it will not be very nice 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.990
 during this time we will climb into the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.710
 robot the whites in snow so for 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.360
 beating egg whites 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.939
 we need the balloon choice 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 reuse and therefore a fee to separate 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.299
 the yellows of the whites 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 we will first use the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.500
 fresh whites we will mix them with a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 little bit of salt that will actually allow 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.880
 of just liquefied our whites for 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.470
 they go up faster we go 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.600
 simply use speed 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.490
 intermediate between 3 and 4 or so 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.310
 rises gradually from 1 to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 maximum gradually so there the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.950
 whites are going up as soon as we 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.719
 sees a little less 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.820
 South we will add to the As 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.970
 it will allow you to ally 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.500
 here they are, it's been two and three minutes 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.160
 whites are turning on 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.810
 speed 3 4 or speeding up we will 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.120
 stop and above all we will finish in 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.320
 giving some impulses for the 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.320
 stabilize one did owe one's saddle 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.479
 so here are the whites are well mounted 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.679
 we will add the egg yolks and 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.000
 to avoid of course to make them 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.010
 fall back we'll give a little 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.420
 impulse on the payroll or putting on 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.050
 the maximum speed for 10 seconds 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.420
 maximum 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.310
 it will prevent them from falling and that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.580
 will always have a foam 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.580
 creamy 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.760
 this is thanks to the Kenwood robot we have a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.170
 fly very very creamy it's 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.090
 always very sparkling as you can 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.770
 to see it always has something very 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.950
 unctuous and then we will change 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.100
 of accessories for the flexible drummer 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.570
 for just mixing my chocolate that 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.100
 had time to cool a little bit 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.870
 after 5 to 10 minutes may well 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.940
 mix with the rest of the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.810
 preparation to avoid doing so 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.820
 fall back after paying the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.100
 chocolate at good temperature 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.900
 we will mix the two ingredients and 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.280
 especially to be careful 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.150
 avoid making them fall back by being on 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.150
 the minimum speed 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.800
 here we have left a little spin 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.599
 minute that comes out that all the ingredients 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.989
 blends well after foam at 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.209
 chocolate 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.010
 we will be able to see that she is very 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.630
 creamy then me the advice that I 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.700
 can you give it is to transfer it 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.989
 or when leaving it in the bowl he has 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.819
 especially left two three hours at 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.130
 fridge or two hours is ideal 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.870
 and then you can use it and 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.610
 especially enjoy them here are some 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.230
 hours have passed the moss has had the time 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.590
 to cool down and be a little bit more 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.330
 closed 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.440
 so we could put it in my pocket 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
 will actually fulfill the 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.370
 verrines more easily without putting 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.819
 everywhere and then finish with the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.880
 decoration 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.560
 we will fill the verrines with a 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.769
 little rose to 100 so the sum is 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.769
 optional 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.409
 here we are going to end the life rinne with 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.370
 the third chocolate white chocolate 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.230
 white chocolate milk chocolate and 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.700
 dark chocolate these are three flavors that 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.200
 are going well this mix and you will not have 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.310
 more bitterness and I guarantee it 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.580
 everyone will appreciate the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.580
 dessert
