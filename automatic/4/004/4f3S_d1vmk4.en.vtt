tactility review in full HD I just feel

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.070 
tactility review in full HD I just feel
like<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:12.000> knife<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.420> particular<00:00:12.929> could

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
like this knife in particular could

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200 
like this knife in particular could
benefit<00:00:13.469> from<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:14.070> little<00:00:14.490> bit<00:00:14.580> higher<00:00:14.730> quality

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
benefit from a little bit higher quality

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.900 
benefit from a little bit higher quality
video<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.839> also<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.100> audio<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.520> better<00:00:17.789> I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
video and also the audio is better I

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.710 
video and also the audio is better I
sound<00:00:18.270> kind<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.170> goofy<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.770> my<00:00:20.130> old<00:00:20.970> videos<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
sound kind of goofy in my old videos and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.000 
sound kind of goofy in my old videos and
I<00:00:21.750> think<00:00:21.960> that's<00:00:22.170> partially<00:00:22.439> due<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I think that's partially due to the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.750 
I think that's partially due to the
pretty<00:00:24.439> crappy<00:00:25.439> microphone<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.430> there<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
pretty crappy microphone on there and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.490 
pretty crappy microphone on there and
I'm<00:00:26.849> having<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.300> yell<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> camera<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.380> it's

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
I'm having a yell in the camera and it's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.519 
I'm having a yell in the camera and it's
just<00:00:29.240> not<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> best<00:00:30.660> video<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:31.260> there<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
just not the best video out there I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.000 
just not the best video out there I
think<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:33.059> quick<00:00:33.530> quickly<00:00:34.530> reshoot

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
think so one two quick quickly reshoot

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
think so one two quick quickly reshoot
this<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.450> cus<00:00:39.750> detect

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this and so this is the I'm cus detect

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.560 
this and so this is the I'm cus detect
ility<00:00:40.500> let's<00:00:41.460> talk<00:00:41.700> about<00:00:41.850> why<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.149> would<00:00:42.390> buy

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
ility let's talk about why you would buy

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.220 
ility let's talk about why you would buy
this<00:00:42.629> knife<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> would<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
this knife what you would use it for and

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.420 
this knife what you would use it for and
really<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.379> would<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.039> there's<00:00:47.309> only

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
really I would think that there's only

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.860 
really I would think that there's only
one<00:00:48.230> major<00:00:49.230> reason<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.520> she<00:00:51.480> would<00:00:51.510> use<00:00:51.719> this

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
one major reason that she would use this

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.180 
one major reason that she would use this
knife<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.649> would<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:53.899> defensive

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
knife for and that would be defensive

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.790 
knife for and that would be defensive
like<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> weapon<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.949> that<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.129> due<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.670> the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
like a weapon and that is due to the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.439 
like a weapon and that is due to the
blade<00:01:01.800> shape<00:01:02.070> there's<00:01:02.640> very<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.149> belly

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
blade shape there's very little belly

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
role of a collectible as I've done here

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
role of a collectible as I've done here
but<00:01:43.470> primarily<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.340> you're<00:01:44.490> looking<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> use

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
but primarily if you're looking to use

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.960 
but primarily if you're looking to use
this<00:01:45.270> knife<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:46.369> mean<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> tell

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
this knife I mean I'm not going to tell

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
this knife I mean I'm not going to tell
you<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.270> carry<00:01:48.509> every<00:01:48.780> day<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.619> would

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
you what to carry every day but I would

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.469 
you what to carry every day but I would
think<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.189> practically<00:01:50.850> speaking<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.420> is

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
think that practically speaking this is

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
think that practically speaking this is
not<00:01:51.869> an<00:01:52.619> EDC<00:01:53.250> knife<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:55.189> now<00:01:56.189> let's<00:01:56.340> take<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
not an EDC knife so now let's take a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.690 
not an EDC knife so now let's take a
closer<00:01:56.790> look<00:01:56.909> at<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.149> blade<00:01:58.219> it's<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.399> very

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
closer look at that blade it's a very

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.649 
closer look at that blade it's a very
nice<00:01:59.990> drop-point<00:02:00.990> design<00:02:02.299> it's<00:02:03.299> got<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
nice drop-point design it's got that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.959 
nice drop-point design it's got that
long<00:02:03.899> lean<00:02:04.380> swedge<00:02:04.860> running<00:02:05.369> across<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> top

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
long lean swedge running across the top

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.199 
long lean swedge running across the top
there<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:07.290> got<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> hollow<00:02:07.680> grind<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
there it's got a hollow grind this is a

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.850 
there it's got a hollow grind this is a
laminated<00:02:12.209> steel<00:02:13.020> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
laminated steel you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.540 
laminated steel you
Damascus<00:02:15.410> on<00:02:16.410> either<00:02:16.620> side<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:18.920> ABG<00:02:19.920> 10<00:02:20.190> core

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
Damascus on either side and ABG 10 core

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.970 
Damascus on either side and ABG 10 core
in<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.970> middle<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.600> cutting<00:02:21.840> edge<00:02:22.230> is

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
in the middle so the cutting edge is

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.520 
in the middle so the cutting edge is
actually<00:02:23.220> BG<00:02:23.730> 10<00:02:24.000> which<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:25.050> sure<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> lot<00:02:25.470> of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
actually BG 10 which I'm sure a lot of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.370 
actually BG 10 which I'm sure a lot of
you<00:02:25.740> are<00:02:25.830> familiar<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.550> nice<00:02:26.730> deal

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
you are familiar with it's a nice deal

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.670 
you are familiar with it's a nice deal
so<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.590> handle<00:02:32.420> as<00:02:33.420> I've<00:02:33.600> said<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> quince

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
so the handle as I've said is a quince

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.440 
so the handle as I've said is a quince
with<00:02:34.860> burl

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
with burl

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
with burl
like<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.540> decorative<00:02:36.870> hardwood<00:02:37.790> over<00:02:39.470> full

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
like a decorative hardwood over full

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.720 
like a decorative hardwood over full
stainless<00:02:40.800> steel<00:02:41.160> liners<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:43.520> despite<00:02:44.520> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
stainless steel liners and despite that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.900 
stainless steel liners and despite that
this<00:02:44.910> knife<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.330> still<00:02:45.600> very<00:02:45.900> light<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.260> hand

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
this knife is still very light in hand

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.710 
this knife is still very light in hand
all<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.780> weights<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> blade<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:50.720> don't

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
all the weights in the blade I don't

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.060 
all the weights in the blade I don't
think<00:02:51.959> they<00:02:52.110> would<00:02:52.290> necessarily<00:02:52.440> need<00:02:52.980> to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
think they would necessarily need to

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.500 
think they would necessarily need to
mill<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.459> out<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:55.340> wouldn't<00:02:56.340> mind<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.270> guess

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
mill this out I wouldn't mind it I guess

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.170 
mill this out I wouldn't mind it I guess
but<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.980> actually<00:02:59.370> keeps<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.760> easier<00:03:00.060> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
but this actually keeps it easier to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.910 
but this actually keeps it easier to
clean<00:03:00.330> not<00:03:00.840> milling<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.380> which<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.709> kind

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
clean not milling it out which is kind

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.000 
clean not milling it out which is kind
of<00:03:01.950> nice<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:04.110> weight<00:03:04.320> I'll<00:03:04.560> post<00:03:04.830> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
of nice and and the weight I'll post the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.820 
of nice and and the weight I'll post the
weight<00:03:05.160> in<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:06.170> information<00:03:07.170> section<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.680> want

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
weight in the information section I want

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.930 
weight in the information section I want
to<00:03:07.860> say<00:03:08.010> around<00:03:08.100> three<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:08.580> half<00:03:08.730> ounces

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
to say around three and a half ounces

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.810 
to say around three and a half ounces
and<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.540> such<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> big<00:03:09.930> knife<00:03:10.490> weight<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.670> not

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
and for such a big knife weight is not

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.920 
and for such a big knife weight is not
an<00:03:11.970> issue<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.270> this<00:03:12.540> one<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:14.720> anyhow<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.780> can

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
an issue on this one so anyhow you can

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.710 
an issue on this one so anyhow you can
get<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:17.220> tactility<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.000> any<00:03:18.330> number<00:03:18.540> of

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
get the tactility and any number of

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.320 
get the tactility and any number of
handle<00:03:19.080> materials<00:03:19.580> they<00:03:20.580> offer<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:21.030> lot<00:03:21.300> of

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
handle materials they offer a lot of

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.009 
handle materials they offer a lot of
different<00:03:21.750> types<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.680> wood<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:24.720> can<00:03:24.870> also

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
different types of wood and you can also

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.080 
different types of wood and you can also
get<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.530> micarta<00:03:26.130> or<00:03:27.560> even<00:03:28.560> Corian<00:03:29.100> which

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
get this in micarta or even Corian which

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.270 
get this in micarta or even Corian which
is<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> common<00:03:31.170> countertop<00:03:31.709> material<00:03:32.190> in

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
is a common countertop material in

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.090 
is a common countertop material in
America<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.810> Japan<00:03:34.200> apparently<00:03:34.709> it's<00:03:34.860> a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
America but in Japan apparently it's a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.070 
America but in Japan apparently it's a
can<00:03:35.970> also<00:03:36.120> serve<00:03:36.480> as<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.690> handle<00:03:36.959> material

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
can also serve as a handle material

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.949 
can also serve as a handle material
which<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.760> probably<00:03:39.150> pretty<00:03:39.269> nice<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.720> haven't

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
which is probably pretty nice I haven't

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.550 
which is probably pretty nice I haven't
handled<00:03:40.200> one<00:03:40.350> though<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:42.200> let's<00:03:43.200> talk<00:03:43.380> about

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
handled one though so let's talk about

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.990 
handled one though so let's talk about
this<00:03:43.800> clip<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.790> pocket<00:03:45.060> clip<00:03:46.670> as<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.850> can

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
this clip this pocket clip as you can

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.979 
this clip this pocket clip as you can
see<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:48.840> nice<00:03:49.080> it's<00:03:49.950> pretty<00:03:50.250> big<00:03:50.489> but<00:03:50.989> it

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
see it's nice it's pretty big but it

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.520 
see it's nice it's pretty big but it
rides<00:03:52.320> deep<00:03:52.800> in<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.070> pocket<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:55.410> is

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
rides deep in the pocket and it is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.220 
rides deep in the pocket and it is
swappable<00:03:57.050> ambidextrous<00:03:58.050> tip<00:03:58.860> up<00:03:59.040> carrying

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
swappable ambidextrous tip up carrying

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.720 
swappable ambidextrous tip up carrying
so<00:04:01.230> it's<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.410> very<00:04:01.620> nice<00:04:01.769> clip<00:04:03.080> deployment<00:04:04.730> is

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
so it's a very nice clip deployment is

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.020 
so it's a very nice clip deployment is
nice<00:04:06.000> on<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.360> knife<00:04:07.190> very<00:04:08.190> nice<00:04:08.400> very<00:04:08.700> smooth

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
nice on this knife very nice very smooth

knife with either hand and that titanium
has<00:04:20.640> also<00:04:20.820> been<00:04:21.060> used<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.780> pivots<00:04:22.140> grille

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
has also been used on the pivots grille

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
lockup and I said on my old video that

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.470 
lockup and I said on my old video that
this<00:04:56.280> knife<00:04:56.490> was<00:04:56.670> kind<00:04:56.940> of<00:04:57.000> like<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.150> panther

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
this knife was kind of like a panther

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.940 
this knife was kind of like a panther
and<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:59.840> you<00:05:00.840> wouldn't<00:05:01.200> know<00:05:01.320> it<00:05:01.530> until<00:05:01.560> it

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
and that you wouldn't know it until it

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.070 
and that you wouldn't know it until it
was<00:05:02.100> too<00:05:02.310> late<00:05:02.340> you<00:05:03.030> know<00:05:03.180> just<00:05:03.420> a<00:05:03.510> very<00:05:03.540> quiet
