00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.250

 peter shovel 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.540
 the infinite heart to our naval vehicle 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.039
 moratti 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.170
 this sum 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.410
 what you can do this if you expect it 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.300
 I bought last but she was good 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.300

 a couple 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.090
 but 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.640
 very consistent 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.700
 clear no idea 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.700
 all 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.630
 oratory are stingy 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.630
 but in the stands 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.909
 Paul

 the obstacle 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 com 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.470
 eisner 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.800
 so 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 stop 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.829
 I bought 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.829
 never 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.890
 no 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.220
 just kept it all okay though 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.220

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.020
 what was I wearing? 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.229
 I think the world is finished 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.229
 I won I am 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.379
 the purpose 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.379
 there is no place 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.150
 included ahead of this step 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.599
