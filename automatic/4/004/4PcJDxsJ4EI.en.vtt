ferns or hostas growing Lily the valley

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.910 
ferns or hostas growing Lily the valley
will<00:00:41.850> grow<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.200> nothing<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
will grow if you got nothing in that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400 
will grow if you got nothing in that
area<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.610> never<00:00:44.820> water<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:46.200> it's

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.549 
just too deepest shade or it's full of
moss<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.379> Lily

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
moss then you're not going to get Lily

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
moss then you're not going to get Lily
the<00:00:49.829> valley<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.190> grow<00:00:50.370> either<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.480> they'll

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the valley to grow either but they'll

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.000 
the valley to grow either but they'll
grow<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> container<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> ground

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
grow in the container or the ground

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.939 
grow in the container or the ground
really<00:00:53.520> easily<00:00:53.820> there's<00:00:54.629> such<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.230> tough<00:00:55.530> plant

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
really easily there's such a tough plant

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.029 
really easily there's such a tough plant
but<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.789> never<00:00:57.239> let<00:00:57.570> them<00:00:57.719> dry<00:00:58.020> out<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:59.010> can

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
but you never let them dry out you can

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.130 
but you never let them dry out you can
plant<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.550> any<00:00:59.760> time<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> year<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.899> just

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
plant them any time of the year but just

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the dirt around it so that it's not just

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.480 
the dirt around it so that it's not just
into<00:01:21.509> hard<00:01:21.810> dirt<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> want<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> make<00:01:23.460> sure

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
into hard dirt and you want to make sure

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.850 
into hard dirt and you want to make sure
it's<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.030> broken<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.590> want<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it's kind of broken up and I want to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
it's kind of broken up and I want to
plant<00:01:26.070> them<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:26.280> three<00:01:26.430> inches<00:01:26.909> deep<00:01:27.119> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
plant them about three inches deep so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.929 
plant them about three inches deep so
I'm<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> dig<00:01:28.409> down<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> little<00:01:28.829> ways<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I'm going to dig down a little ways it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
I'm going to dig down a little ways it
doesn't<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.600> real<00:01:30.810> deep<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.259> then

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
doesn't have to be real deep and then

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
doesn't have to be real deep and then
I'm<00:01:32.310> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.930> exact

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
I'm kind of just don't have to be exact

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.609 
I'm kind of just don't have to be exact
I'm<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.340> placing<00:01:35.820> them<00:01:35.880> underneath

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
I'm just kind of placing them underneath

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.690 
I'm just kind of placing them underneath
and<00:01:37.619> there's<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:37.979> an<00:01:38.340> up-or-down

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and there's not really an up-or-down

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
and there's not really an up-or-down
because<00:01:39.299> I've<00:01:39.450> noticed<00:01:39.600> they'll<00:01:39.900> work<00:01:40.079> their

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
because I've noticed they'll work their

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
because I've noticed they'll work their
way<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.439> from<00:01:40.829> any<00:01:40.979> direction<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:42.030> once<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
way up from any direction but once I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.160 
way up from any direction but once I
have<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.869> good<00:01:43.500> wad<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:44.009> root<00:01:44.310> -<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:45.060> found<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.020> by

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
have a good wad of root - i found one by

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
have a good wad of root - i found one by
itself<00:01:46.530> takes<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.950> lot<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> years<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.820> really

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
itself takes a lot of years to really

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.590 
itself takes a lot of years to really
get<00:01:48.240> going

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
get going

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.899 
get going
but<00:01:49.140> three<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.530> five<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> they'll<00:01:50.759> do

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
but three or five or more and they'll do

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730 
but three or five or more and they'll do
really<00:01:51.149> well<00:01:51.360> quicker<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:52.560> I'm<00:01:52.619> just

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
really well quicker so then I'm just

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.310 
really well quicker so then I'm just
going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.070> put<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:54.090> back<00:01:54.270> underneath<00:01:54.630> I'm

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
going to put them back underneath I'm

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560 
going to put them back underneath I'm
not<00:01:55.500> taking<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> measuring<00:01:56.490> stick<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.030> don't

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
not taking a measuring stick I don't

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.359 
not taking a measuring stick I don't
know<00:01:57.689> exactly<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.619> three<00:01:58.860> inches<00:01:59.009> deep

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
know exactly that it's three inches deep

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.459 
know exactly that it's three inches deep
I'm<00:02:00.299> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.719> setting<00:02:00.990> them<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.110> there

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
I'm kind of just setting them in there

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.990 
I'm kind of just setting them in there
another<00:02:01.890> trick<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.670> step

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
another trick is I kind of just step

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.910 
another trick is I kind of just step
them<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.299> there<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.689> because<00:02:03.990> I've<00:02:04.469> noticed

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
them in there just because I've noticed

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.469 
them in there just because I've noticed
sometimes<00:02:05.100> I'll<00:02:05.399> pull<00:02:05.579> them<00:02:05.700> back<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.060> easier

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
sometimes I'll pull them back up easier

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.229 
sometimes I'll pull them back up easier
if<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:06.930> step<00:02:07.799> them<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> ground

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
if I don't step them down and the ground

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.780 
if I don't step them down and the ground
is<00:02:09.420> pretty<00:02:09.569> sweat<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:11.700> need

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
is pretty sweat so I really don't need

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
is pretty sweat so I really don't need
water<00:02:12.120> right<00:02:12.390> now<00:02:12.540> I've<00:02:12.690> watered<00:02:12.930> really<00:02:13.290> well

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
water right now I've watered really well

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.920 
water right now I've watered really well
yesterday<00:02:14.010> all<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:15.030> water<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.690> next

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630 
yesterday all this water on the next
time<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.140> water<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.560> area<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.250> they'll<00:02:17.489> get

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
time I water this area and they'll get

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.940 
time I water this area and they'll get
right<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:18.030> schedule<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.410> don't<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:19.709> I'll

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
right on schedule and I don't think I'll

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.300 
right on schedule and I don't think I'll
see<00:02:20.270> anything<00:02:21.270> from<00:02:21.510> them<00:02:21.780> until<00:02:22.290> April<00:02:23.160> of
