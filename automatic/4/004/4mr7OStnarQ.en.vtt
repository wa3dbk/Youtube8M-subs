00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 good guys order a new video 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.200
 of five laps 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.780
 they were here a race is super cool 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.340
 which is basically about 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.199
 fly with the bike 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.609
 and what is worth more not so much the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 Raw up or up up 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.699
 up is worth a kid a boy several 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.230
 guys went down you have to get to where 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.230
 argument that I minimum for 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.040
 that reaches the smallest I love 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.560
 that this race because they are in plan 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.460
 fly but it's kind of strange but it's 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.050
 A) Yes 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.570
 so let's go there to see if what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.010
 we get to the top of the mat 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.780
 I think it's going to be a bit complicated 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.000
 but hey, I think they're going to bother and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.940
 luchi I love it's amazing we go there 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.950
 it's static they also go and if not yes no 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.540
 I see badly I think that nobody follows me to see 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.780
 what looks back I could not look for 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.610
 back active what the hell I can not look 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.290
 what's going on uncle had miral 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.290
 minimapa ok they're not all there at 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.130
 background so perfect by guys let's go 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.110
 okay though I think I'm losing 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.720
 speed I do not know to see moments to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.290
 try it says a little bit if this is 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.640
 in a bit complicated in a bit much 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.540
 that getting to be hibernating is very 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.190
 complicated uncle 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.290
 upstairs upstairs I do not think the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.350
 visit does not go up down god me 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.760
 cahuín everything not impossible and impossible 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.130
 speed bike is already giving birth to see if 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.590
 we can leave the catch up not 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.510
 let's go for the point is above 11 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.100
 they go so it's going to be impossible for me 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.290
 good to try again I think since 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.300
 the principle that face the bike well and 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.500
 once we face the bike well and 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.670
 throw me back completely because 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.780
 the more speed you think that 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.159
 this speed does not help to be born a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.280
 heap 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.850
 there are micro facing well for 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.860
 I think if I faced here 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.690
 perfect is worth beyond guys let's make 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.690
 practices subscribed by 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.940
 perfect let's go over there let's go let's go 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.530
 let's go let's go 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.489
 there we are we are perfect now 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.489
 we are fine 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.140
 ok and now up up 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.950
 top up 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.950
 up 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.040
 let's go up 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:36.270
 oh, I do not think so, yes 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.280
 there we go up direct direct 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.890
 relative but good if we go up 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.480
 well because once we have we can 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.310
 modify the location grams but good 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.840
 the case is to catch height thing that is a 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.340
 so complicated but good 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.569
 we were really doing height 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.709
 God 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:00.219
 but I think it's much more complicated what 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.350
 that looks like guys or try to catch a 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.670
 poquillo speed here 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.970
 and now up or up to 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.970
 up up 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.310
 I think so 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.910
 it's very complicated uncle I think I have 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.569
 to take a leap if I do not know 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.230
 OK 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.879
 and perfect let's go there let's take out myself 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.879
 I owe schedules worth and perfect 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.590
 and so the speed 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.019
 there we are uncle perfect mode I think 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.069
 yes yes now it was created as perfect 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:47.159
 I think we're going perfect 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.109
 if we go up, it's good if we keep 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.099
 this location is going very well 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.389
 because we are a little bit more for the 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.420
 left but I do not want to touch the command 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.420
 because if the wheel is not modified 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.250
 handle it 100% but well let's 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.920
 try it at least the first list 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.319
 of banks was incredible but now what 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.689
 continue with three to finish bar 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.760
 he saw 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:17.900
 let's see a little bit a mountain 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.730
 come on let's go fast guys I love me 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.640
 love vale let's go up let's go for 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.130
 up and very arrowd lives the goal of 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.350
 there as I like to bend a bit of 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.790
 little by little 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.460
 while doing it little by little there 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.070
 we're 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.980
 OK 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.800
 it's worth a little more 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.170
 a little more come come come ai ai 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.700
 perfect perfect perfect perfect 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.180
 a little more kid a boy a 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.550
 kid 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.100
 ok, it's worth 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.100
 but after thinking there eye 

00:04:55.589 --> 00:05:00.719
 madryn and achával my mother maui q lay 

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:10.089
 it deserves 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:14.289
 holy god from here from this moment 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:17.979
 this is from chilia to the fucking more 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.949
 Ivan and we arrived by bike flying and 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.449
 fashions over my mother and me the 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.009
 last turn that I go back audio 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:28.319
 and look at the last turn that guys 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.319
 vision at the last ethical moment 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.759
 well I think everything will get very long 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:32.759
 of champions 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.129
 goodbye
