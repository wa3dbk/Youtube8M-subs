00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.340 
shortbread perhaps or something any kind
of<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> biscuit<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.600> they're<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.780> um

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of a biscuit like that they're like um

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.279 
of a biscuit like that they're like um
sweet<00:02:08.009> sort<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.819> biscuits<00:02:09.149> mine<00:02:09.869> laid<00:02:10.140> in

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
sweet sort of biscuits mine laid in

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.780 
sweet sort of biscuits mine laid in
there<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.619> these<00:02:10.800> pans<00:02:11.099> are<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> little

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
there now these pans are just a little

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
there now these pans are just a little
bit<00:02:11.879> bigger<00:02:12.090> than<00:02:12.629> what<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.840> called<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
bit bigger than what it called for the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.860 
bit bigger than what it called for the
recipe

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
recipe

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.600 
recipe
and<00:02:14.080> also<00:02:14.349> different<00:02:14.530> types<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.190> biscuits

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and also different types of biscuits

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.949 
and also different types of biscuits
come<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:15.849> different<00:02:15.940> shapes<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.360> sizes<00:02:16.629> so<00:02:16.840> I

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
come in different shapes and sizes so I

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.449 
come in different shapes and sizes so I
found<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.500> needed<00:02:17.530> actually<00:02:18.069> tasks<00:02:18.310> like

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
found that I needed actually tasks like

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.880 
found that I needed actually tasks like
a<00:02:18.580> second<00:02:19.000> package<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:20.019> finish<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> job<00:02:20.590> here

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
a second package to finish the job here

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.229 
a second package to finish the job here
so<00:02:21.069> depending<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.519> size<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.700> your<00:02:21.879> pan<00:02:22.120> is

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
so depending on the size of your pan is

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.240 
so depending on the size of your pan is
the<00:02:22.269> type<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.569> biscuits<00:02:23.019> you<00:02:23.140> use<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:24.069> may

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the type of biscuits you use you may

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.460 
the type of biscuits you use you may
need<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.489> little<00:02:24.730> bit<00:02:24.819> more<00:02:25.000> as<00:02:25.120> well<00:02:25.470> and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
need a little bit more as well and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.229 
need a little bit more as well and
another<00:02:26.739> thing<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.700> might<00:02:27.910> find<00:02:28.090> as

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
another thing is that you might find as

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.610 
another thing is that you might find as
an<00:02:28.330> adequate<00:02:28.569> substitute<00:02:28.780> say<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.440> States

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
an adequate substitute say in the States

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.589 
an adequate substitute say in the States
is<00:02:29.769> something<00:02:29.920> like<00:02:30.129> graham<00:02:30.370> crackers<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
is something like graham crackers so the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.119 
is something like graham crackers so the
next<00:02:31.780> step<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.260> I'm<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.769> whip<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
next step is I'm going to whip the

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.890 
next step is I'm going to whip the
thickened<00:02:33.459> cream<00:02:33.549> which<00:02:34.390> I've<00:02:34.540> got<00:02:34.660> six

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
thickened cream which I've got six

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.960 
thickened cream which I've got six
hundred<00:02:35.230> mils<00:02:35.440> here<00:02:35.860> now<00:02:36.489> that<00:02:36.819> would<00:02:36.940> be

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
hundred mils here now that would be

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.030 
hundred mils here now that would be
about<00:02:37.690> or<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.110> little<00:02:38.319> bit<00:02:38.410> more<00:02:38.530> than<00:02:38.709> 20

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
about or just a little bit more than 20

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.860 
about or just a little bit more than 20
ounces<00:02:39.459> in<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.910> states<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.480> would<00:02:40.690> use<00:02:40.840> a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
ounces in the states and you would use a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.069 
ounces in the states and you would use a
whip<00:02:41.230> whipping<00:02:41.739> cream<00:02:42.010> there<00:02:45.900> we're<00:02:46.900> just

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
whip whipping cream there we're just

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.690 
whip whipping cream there we're just
gonna<00:02:47.170> whip<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.620> until<00:02:48.130> firm<00:02:48.459> peaks<00:02:48.489> form

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.220 

this<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.849> about<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> texture<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.660> want<00:02:55.810> so

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
this is about the texture you want so

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.780 
this is about the texture you want so
that<00:02:56.260> you've<00:02:56.530> got<00:02:56.560> see<00:02:57.010> how<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.220> clings<00:02:57.519> to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
that you've got see how it clings to

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.119 
that you've got see how it clings to
there<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.239> when<00:02:58.629> I<00:02:58.660> pull<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:58.989> out<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.799> forms

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
there and when I pull it out it forms

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.330 
there and when I pull it out it forms
Peaks<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.670> stay<00:03:00.940> in<00:03:01.060> their<00:03:01.180> shape<00:03:02.340> that's

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
Peaks that stay in their shape that's

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.009 
Peaks that stay in their shape that's
what<00:03:03.549> we're<00:03:03.670> after<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.480> now<00:03:04.629> that<00:03:04.720> we've<00:03:04.870> got

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
what we're after so now that we've got

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.140 
what we're after so now that we've got
that<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.769> next<00:03:06.099> step<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:07.000> add<00:03:07.120> our

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
that the next step is to add our

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.990 
that the next step is to add our
condensed<00:03:07.569> milk<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.110> beat<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.530> again<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.910> I've

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
condensed milk and beat it again so I've

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.250 
condensed milk and beat it again so I've
got<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.299> sweetened<00:03:13.599> condensed<00:03:13.870> milk<00:03:13.959> in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
got the sweetened condensed milk in

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.509 
got the sweetened condensed milk in
there<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.590> we're<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:14.739> gonna<00:03:15.040> whip<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.310> again

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
there and we're just gonna whip it again

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.370 
there and we're just gonna whip it again
till<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.819> gets<00:03:15.940> nice<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.120> firm

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.080 

see<00:03:21.950> that's<00:03:22.130> pretty<00:03:22.280> firm<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.700> holds<00:03:22.970> its

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
see that's pretty firm it holds its

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.010 
see that's pretty firm it holds its
shape<00:03:23.150> if<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.630> push<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.960> up<00:03:24.050> like<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:26.020> almost

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
shape if I push it up like that almost

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.530 
shape if I push it up like that almost
feels<00:03:27.500> like<00:03:27.590> soft-serve<00:03:28.220> ice<00:03:28.430> cream<00:03:28.540> let's

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
feels like soft-serve ice cream let's

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.360 
feels like soft-serve ice cream let's
set<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.870> aside<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.710> this<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.070> violet

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
set that aside so this is the violet

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.980 
set that aside so this is the violet
crumble<00:03:31.520> bar<00:03:31.850> for<00:03:32.090> those<00:03:32.210> who<00:03:32.330> haven't<00:03:32.810> gotten

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
crumble bar for those who haven't gotten

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.830 
crumble bar for those who haven't gotten
the<00:03:33.770> refer<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.220> as<00:03:34.310> honeycomb<00:03:34.610> here<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.750> as

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
the refer to it as honeycomb here and as

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.240 
the refer to it as honeycomb here and as
you<00:03:35.960> can<00:03:36.110> see<00:03:36.290> it's<00:03:36.440> similar<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.860> what<00:03:36.980> we<00:03:37.070> call

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
you can see it's similar to what we call

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.400 
you can see it's similar to what we call
an<00:03:37.370> angel<00:03:37.700> food<00:03:37.880> in<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.450> States<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.080> I'm<00:03:39.230> just

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
an angel food in the States so I'm just

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.860 
an angel food in the States so I'm just
using<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.920> small<00:03:40.070> food<00:03:41.000> processor<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.540> do<00:03:41.720> this

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
using a small food processor to do this

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.570 
using a small food processor to do this
but<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:42.260> you'd<00:03:42.410> rather<00:03:42.500> put<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> bag<00:03:43.550> and

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
but if you'd rather put it in a bag and

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.950 
but if you'd rather put it in a bag and
crush<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:43.970> with<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.180> rolling<00:03:44.360> pin<00:03:44.510> or<00:03:44.660> something

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
crush it with a rolling pin or something

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.730 
crush it with a rolling pin or something
else<00:03:45.250> whatever<00:03:46.250> works<00:03:46.610> you<00:03:47.420> don't<00:03:47.600> want<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.810> to

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
else whatever works you don't want it to

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.670 
else whatever works you don't want it to
fine<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.460> see<00:03:49.790> I've<00:03:49.940> got<00:03:49.970> some<00:03:50.680> you're

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
fine and you see I've got some you're

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.070 
fine and you see I've got some you're
just<00:03:51.830> slightly<00:03:52.010> bigger<00:03:52.310> chunks<00:03:52.640> but<00:03:53.080> that's

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
just slightly bigger chunks but that's

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:03.850 
just slightly bigger chunks but that's
about<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.350> texture<00:03:54.680> we're<00:03:54.860> after<00:04:02.740> one<00:04:03.740> or<00:04:03.770> two

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
about the texture we're after one or two

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.260 
about the texture we're after one or two
bigger<00:04:04.130> chunks<00:04:04.520> that<00:04:04.580> aren't<00:04:04.820> enough<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.120> run

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
bigger chunks that aren't enough to run

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.900 
bigger chunks that aren't enough to run
that<00:04:05.420> again<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:06.440> honeycomb<00:04:07.130> or<00:04:07.460> angel<00:04:07.760> food

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
that again this honeycomb or angel food

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.210 
that again this honeycomb or angel food
texture<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.360> really<00:04:08.620> pretty<00:04:09.620> easy<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.070> break

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
texture is really pretty easy to break

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.380 
texture is really pretty easy to break
apart<00:04:10.370> so<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:10.850> should<00:04:11.000> be<00:04:11.090> able<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.240> just

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
apart so you should be able to just

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.790 
apart so you should be able to just
break<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.690> into<00:04:11.810> smaller<00:04:12.110> chunks<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:12.470> sort<00:04:12.770> of

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
break it into smaller chunks so sort of

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.580 
break it into smaller chunks so sort of
squish<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.190> with<00:04:13.310> your<00:04:13.430> fingers<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.260> crushed

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
squish it with your fingers so I crushed

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.200 
squish it with your fingers so I crushed
three<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.220> bars<00:04:16.430> we're<00:04:16.670> gonna<00:04:16.790> save<00:04:17.030> this

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.210 
three of the bars we're gonna save this

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.030 
three of the bars we're gonna save this
one<00:04:17.420> for<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.750> end<00:04:17.840> we're<00:04:18.710> gonna<00:04:18.830> just

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
one for the end we're gonna just

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.650 
one for the end we're gonna just
sprinkle<00:04:19.489> those<00:04:19.580> in<00:04:19.790> there<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.180> fold<00:04:20.480> them

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
sprinkle those in there and fold them

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.810 
sprinkle those in there and fold them
through<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:22.040> cream<00:04:22.250> mixture<00:04:27.430> as<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.520> can<00:04:28.670> see

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
through the cream mixture as you can see

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.400 
through the cream mixture as you can see
I've<00:04:28.910> got<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.120> nice<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.300> evenly<00:04:29.900> mixed<00:04:30.260> in

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
I've got it nice and evenly mixed in

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.700 
I've got it nice and evenly mixed in
there

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
there

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.320 
there
the<00:04:30.980> next<00:04:31.280> step<00:04:31.430> is<00:04:31.550> gonna<00:04:31.640> be<00:04:31.760> to<00:04:31.880> divide<00:04:32.180> this

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
the next step is gonna be to divide this

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.950 
the next step is gonna be to divide this
evenly<00:04:32.810> among<00:04:33.140> your<00:04:33.260> two<00:04:33.410> pans

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.450 

yes<00:04:38.960> I've<00:04:39.110> evenly<00:04:39.500> divided<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.980> among<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.310> two

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
yes I've evenly divided it among the two

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.050 
yes I've evenly divided it among the two
pans<00:04:40.700> I'm<00:04:40.880> just<00:04:41.060> gonna<00:04:41.180> spread<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:41.570> out<00:04:41.750> now

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
pans I'm just gonna spread it out now

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.740 
pans I'm just gonna spread it out now
carefully<00:04:44.060> not<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.390> disturb<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.870> biscuits

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
carefully not to disturb the biscuits

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.000 
carefully not to disturb the biscuits
okay<00:04:47.750> so<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:47.990> can<00:04:48.110> see<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.350> but<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.590> evenly

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
okay so you can see it but that evenly

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.900 
okay so you can see it but that evenly
spread<00:04:49.310> out<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.610> both<00:04:49.820> pans<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:51.320> last<00:04:51.590> step<00:04:51.950> is

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
spread out in both pans the last step is

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.760 
spread out in both pans the last step is
to<00:04:52.970> crush<00:04:53.330> that<00:04:53.570> final<00:04:54.140> chocolate<00:04:54.590> bar<00:04:54.740> and

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
to crush that final chocolate bar and

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.560 
to crush that final chocolate bar and
we're<00:04:55.100> gonna<00:04:55.220> sprinkle<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.760> on<00:04:55.850> top<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.450> the

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
we're gonna sprinkle it on top so the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.280 
we're gonna sprinkle it on top so the
last<00:04:56.780> bar<00:04:57.140> has<00:04:57.320> been<00:04:57.500> crushed<00:04:57.710> here<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.870> if

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
last bar has been crushed here and if

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.760 
last bar has been crushed here and if
you<00:05:00.410> have<00:05:00.500> too<00:05:00.650> many<00:05:00.770> bigger<00:05:01.580> pieces<00:05:01.820> but<00:05:02.770> all

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
you have too many bigger pieces but all

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.210 
you have too many bigger pieces but all
right<00:05:04.180> we're<00:05:05.180> just<00:05:05.210> gonna<00:05:05.510> lightly<00:05:06.220> sprinkle

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
right we're just gonna lightly sprinkle

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.810 
right we're just gonna lightly sprinkle
that<00:05:07.460> over<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.730> top<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:10.280> get<00:05:10.400> any<00:05:10.580> bigger

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
that over the top you get any bigger

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.310 
that over the top you get any bigger
pieces<00:05:11.030> just<00:05:11.240> give<00:05:11.450> them<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:11.570> crush<00:05:11.810> up<00:05:11.960> to

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
pieces just give them a crush up to

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.970 
pieces just give them a crush up to
Margot<00:05:12.680> Rushdie's<00:05:14.230> so<00:05:15.230> that's<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:15.860> can

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
Margot Rushdie's so that's it you can

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.190 
Margot Rushdie's so that's it you can
see<00:05:16.100> it's<00:05:16.220> all<00:05:16.310> evenly<00:05:16.520> divided<00:05:16.870> all<00:05:17.870> we<00:05:18.080> have

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
see it's all evenly divided all we have

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.770 
see it's all evenly divided all we have
to<00:05:18.290> do<00:05:18.410> now<00:05:18.560> is<00:05:19.280> cover<00:05:19.580> them<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:20.180> put<00:05:20.540> them<00:05:20.630> in

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
to do now is cover them and put them in

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.270 
to do now is cover them and put them in
the<00:05:20.840> freezer<00:05:21.140> overnight<00:05:21.170> until<00:05:21.950> they're<00:05:22.070> set

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
the freezer overnight until they're set

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.950 
the freezer overnight until they're set
so<00:05:22.610> I've<00:05:22.730> put<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.880> piece<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.120> plastic<00:05:23.750> cling

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
so I've put a piece of plastic cling

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.720 
so I've put a piece of plastic cling
wrap<00:05:24.080> around<00:05:24.410> both<00:05:24.590> directions<00:05:24.980> just<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:25.490> sort

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
wrap around both directions just to sort

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.030 
wrap around both directions just to sort
of<00:05:25.790> help<00:05:25.940> keep<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:26.330> firmly<00:05:26.930> on<00:05:27.170> there<00:05:27.380> and<00:05:27.650> I'm

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
of help keep it firmly on there and I'm

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.440 
of help keep it firmly on there and I'm
gonna<00:05:28.160> need<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.460> stack<00:05:28.670> these<00:05:28.880> in<00:05:29.090> the<00:05:29.210> freezer

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
gonna need to stack these in the freezer

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.880 
gonna need to stack these in the freezer
so<00:05:29.660> I<00:05:29.690> don't<00:05:29.870> want<00:05:30.020> one<00:05:30.200> crushing<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.740> other

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
so I don't want one crushing the other

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.430 
so I don't want one crushing the other
you<00:05:31.640> can<00:05:31.820> use<00:05:31.970> pretty<00:05:32.510> much<00:05:32.690> anything<00:05:32.990> that

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
you can use pretty much anything that

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.770 
you can use pretty much anything that
you<00:05:33.800> can<00:05:33.950> just

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
you can just

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.040 
you can just
across<00:05:35.780> that<00:05:35.960> top<00:05:36.200> one<00:05:37.660> so<00:05:38.660> that<00:05:38.780> when<00:05:38.870> you

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
across that top one so that when you

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.629 
across that top one so that when you
stack<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.680> second<00:05:40.010> one<00:05:40.100> in<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.250> freezer<00:05:40.370> with

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
stack the second one in the freezer with

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.170 
stack the second one in the freezer with
it<00:05:40.760> it<00:05:41.389> doesn't<00:05:41.570> sink<00:05:41.840> in<00:05:41.960> so<00:05:42.020> pop<00:05:42.320> those<00:05:42.560> in

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
it it doesn't sink in so pop those in

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.070 
it it doesn't sink in so pop those in
and<00:05:44.180> leave<00:05:44.720> them<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:45.020> set<00:05:45.200> overnight<00:05:47.080> mason

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
and leave them to set overnight mason

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.879 
and leave them to set overnight mason
we're<00:05:48.169> gonna<00:05:48.260> pull<00:05:48.530> these<00:05:48.620> out<00:05:48.740> of<00:05:48.830> the

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
we're gonna pull these out of the
