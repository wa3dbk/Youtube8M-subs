00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.940 

I'm<00:00:06.089> looking<00:00:06.450> at<00:00:06.509> mr.<00:00:06.690> Ridley's<00:00:07.049> RMT<00:00:07.529> region

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
I'm looking at mr. Ridley's RMT region

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.100 
I'm looking at mr. Ridley's RMT region
and<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.460> video<00:00:09.059> number<00:00:09.120> two<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.050> is

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
and this is video number two and this is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.049 
and this is video number two and this is
types<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.130> metal<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.580> I'm<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.849> look<00:00:11.910> at

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
types of metal so I'm going to look at

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.759 
types of metal so I'm going to look at
types<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.570> metal<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.019> need<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> know<00:00:13.410> for<00:00:13.620> your

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
types of metal you need to know for your

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.060 
types of metal you need to know for your
exam<00:00:15.020> there<00:00:16.020> are<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.320> different<00:00:16.680> types<00:00:16.890> of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
exam there are two different types of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.540 
exam there are two different types of
metal<00:00:17.400> can<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.000> name<00:00:18.150> them<00:00:18.420> are<00:00:19.550> ferrous

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
metal can we name them are ferrous

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
metal can we name them are ferrous
metals<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:22.100> these<00:00:23.100> contain<00:00:23.580> iron<00:00:23.850> -<00:00:24.359> any

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
metals and these contain iron - any

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.410 
metals and these contain iron - any
metals<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.080> derived<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:25.800> contain<00:00:26.130> iron<00:00:26.420> are

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
metals that derived or contain iron are

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.359 
metals that derived or contain iron are
ferrous<00:00:27.869> metals<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:28.830> almost<00:00:28.980> all

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
ferrous metals and they are almost all

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.450 
ferrous metals and they are almost all
magnetic<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.090> most<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.720> them<00:00:30.869> rust

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
magnetic and most of them rust

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.920 
magnetic and most of them rust
non-ferrous<00:00:32.460> metals<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.420> these<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.690> metals

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
non-ferrous metals are these are metals

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.930 
non-ferrous metals are these are metals
that<00:00:34.020> don't<00:00:34.290> contain<00:00:34.680> iron<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.550> tend<00:00:35.850> not

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that don't contain iron so they tend not

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.119 
that don't contain iron so they tend not
to<00:00:36.120> rust<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.020> two<00:00:37.230> main<00:00:37.260> types<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
to rust that's the two main types of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
to rust that's the two main types of
metal<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.420> metal<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:40.520> okay<00:00:41.520> contains<00:00:42.270> iron

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
metal if a metal is okay contains iron

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.990 
metal if a metal is okay contains iron
then<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.500> ferrous<00:00:43.890> metal<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.430> other<00:00:44.640> metal

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
then it is ferrous metal all other metal

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
then it is ferrous metal all other metal
-<00:00:45.149> non-ferrous<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.200> remember<00:00:46.379> these

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
- non-ferrous if you can remember these

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860 
- non-ferrous if you can remember these
six<00:00:46.950> metals<00:00:47.399> you'll<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.059> doing<00:00:48.300> well<00:00:48.480> steel

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
six metals you'll be doing well steel

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
six metals you'll be doing well steel
stainless<00:00:49.350> steel<00:00:49.410> cast<00:00:49.920> iron<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> non

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
stainless steel cast iron and the non

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910 
stainless steel cast iron and the non
ferrous<00:00:51.360> aluminium<00:00:52.110> copper<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.710> brass

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
ferrous aluminium copper and brass

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.729 
ferrous aluminium copper and brass
that's<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.629> metals<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.410> need<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that's really all in metals you need to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.479 
that's really all in metals you need to
know<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.420> first<00:00:57.690> metal<00:00:58.079> then<00:00:58.260> mild<00:00:58.859> steel

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
know the first metal then mild steel

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.150 
know the first metal then mild steel
what<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.359> say<00:01:00.510> about<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.899> metal<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
what can we say about this metal it is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.030 
what can we say about this metal it is
the<00:01:02.309> most<00:01:02.579> common<00:01:03.090> metal<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.470> take<00:01:04.769> Knox

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the most common metal it can take Knox

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
the most common metal it can take Knox
without<00:01:05.460> damage<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.060> tough<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
without damage it's tough so it's a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.770 
without damage it's tough so it's a
strong<00:01:07.290> durable<00:01:07.920> metal<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.090> cheap<00:01:09.510> if

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
strong durable metal but it's cheap if

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.289 
strong durable metal but it's cheap if
you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.560> remember<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.070> metal<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> answer<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you can remember one metal to answer a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.260 
you can remember one metal to answer a
question<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.130> mild<00:01:14.130> steel<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> good<00:01:15.119> one

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
question with mild steel is a good one

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.020 
question with mild steel is a good one
it's<00:01:16.020> easily<00:01:16.409> pressed<00:01:16.979> into<00:01:17.189> shapes<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.909> most

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's easily pressed into shapes and most

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.590 
it's easily pressed into shapes and most
cars<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:19.259> made<00:01:19.560> from<00:01:20.070> mild<00:01:20.700> steel<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
cars are made from mild steel and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.060 
cars are made from mild steel and
pressed<00:01:21.930> into<00:01:22.110> shape<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.850> magnetic<00:01:25.070> it's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
pressed into shape it is magnetic it's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.249 
pressed into shape it is magnetic it's
quite<00:01:26.460> tough<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.360> doesn't<00:01:27.689> wear<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
quite tough that so it doesn't wear and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.859 
quite tough that so it doesn't wear and
it's<00:01:29.189> quite<00:01:29.579> easily<00:01:30.030> recycled<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:30.720> you've

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it's quite easily recycled but you've

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.600 
it's quite easily recycled but you've
got<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.259> remember<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.650> uses<00:01:32.009> energy<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
got to remember it uses energy to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.999 
got to remember it uses energy to
recycle<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.869> although<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.680> recycled

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
recycle so although it can be recycled

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.270 
recycle so although it can be recycled
it<00:01:35.369> does<00:01:35.549> use<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> lot<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.150> energy<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.280> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it does use a lot of energy and of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.719 
it does use a lot of energy and of
course<00:01:38.460> because<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.970> contains<00:01:39.360> iron<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.840> rusts

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
course because it contains iron it rusts

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.490 
course because it contains iron it rusts

and<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.479> doesn't<00:02:06.899> rust<00:02:07.170> that's<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> most

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and it doesn't rust that's the most

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.440 
and it doesn't rust that's the most
important<00:02:08.280> thing<00:02:08.310> about<00:02:08.489> stainless<00:02:08.879> steel<00:02:09.239> by

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
important thing about stainless steel by

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.690 
important thing about stainless steel by
making<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> into<00:02:10.170> an<00:02:10.259> alloy<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.770> doesn't<00:02:11.459> rust

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
making it into an alloy it doesn't rust

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.720 
making it into an alloy it doesn't rust
so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
so

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.600 
so
you<00:02:12.790> knives<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.659> forks<00:02:13.900> sinks<00:02:14.830> these<00:02:15.220> kind<00:02:15.550> of

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
you knives and forks sinks these kind of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.280 
you knives and forks sinks these kind of
things<00:02:16.049> are<00:02:17.049> made<00:02:17.620> from<00:02:17.860> stainless<00:02:18.190> steel<00:02:19.290> it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
things are made from stainless steel it

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.289 
things are made from stainless steel it
can<00:02:20.349> be<00:02:20.709> recycled<00:02:21.069> but<00:02:21.519> again<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.879> uses<00:02:22.030> lots

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
can be recycled but again it uses lots

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.170 
can be recycled but again it uses lots
of<00:02:22.450> energy<00:02:22.629> because<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:23.860> hard<00:02:24.159> it<00:02:24.760> needs

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
of energy because it's hard it needs

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.690

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
about this high carbon steel is a very

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.509 
about this high carbon steel is a very
tough<00:02:39.730> steel<00:02:40.720> used<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> make<00:02:41.440> tools<00:02:41.799> drills

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.809 
tough steel used to make tools drills
files<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.900> got<00:02:44.079> adding<00:02:44.440> carbon<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.430> steel

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
files so got adding carbon to the steel

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.479 
files so got adding carbon to the steel
it<00:02:46.120> makes<00:02:46.629> it<00:02:46.810> tougher<00:02:47.079> it<00:02:47.709> generally<00:02:48.310> needs

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
it makes it tougher it generally needs

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.220 
it makes it tougher it generally needs
to<00:02:48.579> be<00:02:48.670> heat<00:02:48.940> treated<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:50.079> be

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
to be heat treated and it can be

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.460 
to be heat treated and it can be
recycled<00:02:50.829> it<00:02:51.069> rusts<00:02:51.970> if<00:02:52.090> not<00:02:52.269> protected<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.440> I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
recycled it rusts if not protected so I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.199 
recycled it rusts if not protected so I
say<00:02:53.709> drills<00:02:54.099> tools<00:02:54.670> screws<00:02:55.420> hot<00:02:56.140> carbon<00:02:56.829> steel

metal<00:03:02.079> what<00:03:02.410> can<00:03:02.530> we<00:03:02.590> say<00:03:02.739> about<00:03:02.799> aluminium

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
metal what can we say about aluminium

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.140 
metal what can we say about aluminium

recycled<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:16.090> does<00:04:16.419> tarnish<00:04:17.079> but<00:04:17.289> it<00:04:17.380> doesn't

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
recycled it does tarnish but it doesn't

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.009

rust<00:04:17.919> now<00:04:18.910> we're<00:04:19.359> looking<00:04:19.449> at<00:04:19.599> this<00:04:19.780> metal

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
rust now we're looking at this metal

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.950 
rust now we're looking at this metal
this<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.859> zinc<00:04:21.250> what's<00:04:22.120> important<00:04:22.510> about<00:04:22.539> zinc

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
this is zinc what's important about zinc

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.529 
this is zinc what's important about zinc
is<00:04:23.200> not<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.590> metal<00:04:23.950> but<00:04:24.400> what<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:24.909> used<00:04:25.240> for

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
is not the metal but what it's used for

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.190 
is not the metal but what it's used for
it

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
it

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.770 
it
used<00:04:26.320> for<00:04:26.490> galvanizing<00:04:27.600> galvanizing<00:04:28.600> is<00:04:28.750> a

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
used for galvanizing galvanizing is a

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.010 
used for galvanizing galvanizing is a
protective<00:04:29.440> coating<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.460> mild<00:04:31.240> steel<00:04:31.630> look<00:04:31.930> at

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
protective coating so mild steel look at

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.360 
protective coating so mild steel look at
those<00:04:32.140> railings<00:04:32.410> they're<00:04:32.770> they're<00:04:33.010> dipped

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
those railings they're they're dipped

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.480 
those railings they're they're dipped
into<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.760> hot<00:04:34.390> bath<00:04:34.660> of<00:04:34.990> zinc<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.770> they<00:04:36.370> are

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
into a hot bath of zinc and they are

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.460 
into a hot bath of zinc and they are
galvanized<00:04:37.180> that<00:04:37.480> is<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.600> protective<00:04:38.170> coating

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
galvanized that is a protective coating

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.190 
galvanized that is a protective coating
used<00:04:39.280> on<00:04:39.460> mild<00:04:39.700> steel<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.510> protect<00:04:40.660> against

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
used on mild steel to protect against

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.220 
used on mild steel to protect against
rust<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:42.100> again<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.550> non-ferrous<00:04:43.120> metal<00:04:43.600> very

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
rust so again a non-ferrous metal very

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.450 
rust so again a non-ferrous metal very
resistant<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:44.890> corrosion

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
resistant to corrosion

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.270 
resistant to corrosion
so<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.270> galvanized<00:04:46.810> been<00:04:47.140> dipped<00:04:47.740> it's<00:04:48.010> mild

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
so the galvanized been dipped it's mild

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.060 
so the galvanized been dipped it's mild
steel<00:04:48.640> dip<00:04:49.300> ting<00:04:49.540> in<00:04:49.780> zinc<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.710> becomes

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
steel dip ting in zinc and that becomes

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.100 
steel dip ting in zinc and that becomes
galvanized<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:52.390> it's<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.630> very<00:04:52.870> good

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
galvanized so it's a very good

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.100 
galvanized so it's a very good
protective<00:04:53.560> coating<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:55.270> on<00:04:55.390> its<00:04:55.570> own<00:04:55.750> it's

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
protective coating but on its own it's

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.920 
protective coating but on its own it's
quite<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.380> brittle<00:04:56.740> metal<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:57.400> again<00:04:58.270> can<00:04:58.780> be

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
quite a brittle metal and again can be

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.870 
quite a brittle metal and again can be
recycled<00:05:01.020> last<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.230> all<00:05:02.320> brass<00:05:02.670> what<00:05:03.670> can<00:05:03.790> we

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
recycled last of all brass what can we

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.000 
recycled last of all brass what can we
tell<00:05:04.030> about<00:05:04.090> brass<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.840> non-ferrous<00:05:05.470> metal

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
tell about brass a non-ferrous metal

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.960 
tell about brass a non-ferrous metal
good<00:05:06.370> resistance<00:05:06.850> corrosion<00:05:08.640> easily<00:05:09.640> cast

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
good resistance corrosion easily cast

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.390 
good resistance corrosion easily cast
it's<00:05:10.420> a<00:05:10.540> good<00:05:10.750> conductor<00:05:11.230> of<00:05:11.290> electricity<00:05:11.410> can

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
it's a good conductor of electricity can

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
it's a good conductor of electricity can
be<00:05:12.580> polished<00:05:13.000> it's<00:05:13.630> relatively<00:05:14.260> expensive

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
be polished it's relatively expensive

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.540 
be polished it's relatively expensive
but<00:05:16.420> and<00:05:16.630> there's<00:05:17.440> different<00:05:17.770> grades<00:05:18.310> of

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
but and there's different grades of

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.310 
but and there's different grades of
brass<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:19.360> different<00:05:19.720> things<00:05:19.960> but<00:05:20.200> an
