I have to have something done I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
I have to have something done I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
discovered that I had two choices one

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.310 
discovered that I had two choices one
was<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.590> an<00:01:01.980> invasive<00:01:02.399> back<00:01:03.059> surgery<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
was to have an invasive back surgery to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.060 
was to have an invasive back surgery to
repair<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.430> disk<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> other<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
repair the disk the other was to have a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.609 
repair the disk the other was to have a
non-intrusive<00:01:08.820> procedure<00:01:09.630> called<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
non-intrusive procedure called a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.820 
non-intrusive procedure called a
percutaneous<00:01:10.860> hydra<00:01:11.729> discectomy<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.830> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
percutaneous hydra discectomy and I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.999 
percutaneous hydra discectomy and I
chose<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:15.140> there<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.350> was<00:01:16.740> no

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
chose that because there really was no

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.969 
chose that because there really was no
downside<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.540> was<00:01:18.900> less<00:01:19.259> invasive

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
downside to it it was less invasive

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.460 
downside to it it was less invasive
there<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.369> no<00:01:20.520> cutting<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.439> was

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
there was no cutting then there was

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.830 
there was no cutting then there was
preservation<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> my<00:01:23.580> disk<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.390> muscles

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
preservation of my disk and my muscles

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
preservation of my disk and my muscles
and<00:01:25.049> tissue<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.280> explained<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> me

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and tissue and when they explained to me

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.819 
and tissue and when they explained to me
that<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.479> would<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.869> waterjet<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that there would be a waterjet that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.920 
that there would be a waterjet that
would<00:01:28.979> break<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> disc<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.420> pull

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
would break up the disc and then pull

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.980 
would break up the disc and then pull
the<00:01:31.290> disc<00:01:31.500> material<00:01:31.650> out<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:33.270> seems<00:01:33.570> so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the disc material out it just seems so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.140 
the disc material out it just seems so
calm<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.280> soothing<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.400> non-painful<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
calm and soothing and non-painful the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
calm and soothing and non-painful the
first<00:01:39.420> 30<00:01:39.720> days<00:01:39.869> after<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> procedure<00:01:40.979> even

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
first 30 days after the procedure even

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.050 
first 30 days after the procedure even
though<00:01:42.360> my<00:01:42.540> pain<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.770> significantly<00:01:44.549> reduced

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
though my pain was significantly reduced

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.510 
though my pain was significantly reduced
it<00:01:45.329> still<00:01:46.020> was<00:01:46.700> significant<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.979> was<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
it still was significant and I was a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.910 
it still was significant and I was a
little<00:01:51.119> disheartened<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.200> thought

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
little disheartened because I thought

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830 
little disheartened because I thought
maybe<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.520> procedure<00:01:53.880> didn't<00:01:54.270> work<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
maybe the procedure didn't work the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.649 
maybe the procedure didn't work the
difference<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.649> second<00:01:56.219> month<00:01:56.460> was<00:01:57.240> huge

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
difference in my second month was huge

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.289 
difference in my second month was huge
compared<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> my<00:01:58.530> first<00:01:58.799> month<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.909> that

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
compared to my first month so that

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.230 
compared to my first month so that
really<00:02:00.810> lifted<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.770> spirits<00:02:02.399> prior<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.149> the

really lifted my spirits prior to the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.990 
really lifted my spirits prior to the
procedure<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.229> could<00:02:04.469> travel<00:02:04.799> anywhere

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
procedure I really could travel anywhere
