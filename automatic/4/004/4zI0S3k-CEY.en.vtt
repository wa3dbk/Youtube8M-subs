00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.919
 we have seen how to create a surface 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.100
 topographic within revit 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:11.830
 using a cad or drawing us 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.510
 by hand directly inside the 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.610
 project 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.700
 in the previous video instead in this 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.890
 video we are going to see another 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.080
 possibility to create these curves of 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.450
 then level this our surface 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.250
 topographic that is precisely that of 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.070
 tracing the curves directly 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.370
 level from an image we must 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.749
 always position ourselves in a plant or in 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.460
 a planimetry then in a view 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.579
 from above 2d 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.659
 at this point we can then insert 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.069
 so let's go to the panel 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:49.329
 insert this time we do not insert cad 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:51.249
 but we insert an image and you can 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.870
 take the image that you have 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.499
 it concerns the one related to yours 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.589
 project 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:00.190
 we can insert it inside then 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.749
 of our design 2d and to see it there 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.379
 we must in this case we must 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:08.310
 move to wireframe because staying up 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.289
 our hidden line after surface 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.930
 existing hides the image we are 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.859
 importing ok let's scale a little 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 so this is precisely an image that 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.990
 it shows us some contour lines 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.990
 obviously we can also draw it here 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.240
 on one side and not necessarily to insert it into 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.640
 that point so you can see it 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.820
 directly also in line mode 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.289
 perfect hidden and at this point 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.570
 so to draw a new one in this 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.159
 topographic surface case starting 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.619
 however I don't have to from these contour lines 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.359
 do nothing but return to it then 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:55.590
 volumes and floor plan and select 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:58.179
 then again topographic surface 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.979
 again we are not creating for 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.200
 import but we are creating for 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.130
 enter us point entry then 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.750
 click on insert point is this 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.690
 point we have to read ours here 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.340
 let's say imported planimetry and see 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.070
 that here are some contour lines and 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.130
 there are also quotas on the 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.930
 contour lines that show us precisely 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.340
 then pick up altimeters then what 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.880
 we have to do for example here 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.420
 we have a first level curve that 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.720
 stands at 121 meters point 4 so what 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.810
 we simply put ourselves here and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.550
 we write 121 meters 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.340
 point 4 and then we begin to trace 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.680
 this level curve with ours 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.989
 then with our entry of 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.360
 points then we begin and of course 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.250
 even here you are more detailed then 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.840
 the more you go to zoom 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.870
 within this level curve 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.870
 more obviously the level curve will be
