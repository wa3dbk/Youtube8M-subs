doesn't<00:02:53.060> work<00:02:53.210> like<00:02:53.870> we<00:02:54.230> were<00:02:54.350> using<00:02:54.530> one<00:02:54.770> of

our outdoor mics inside and because

our outdoor mics inside and because

somehow background noise was really

somehow background noise was really

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
prevalent and what was happening is that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.520 
prevalent and what was happening is that
if<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.730> was<00:03:01.910> off<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> little<00:03:02.300> bit<00:03:02.510> then<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.170> was<00:03:03.320> off

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
if I was off a little bit then I was off

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.280 
if I was off a little bit then I was off
but<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> mic<00:03:04.850> something<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.600> one<00:03:05.810> you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
but on a mic something like this one you

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.290 
but on a mic something like this one you
can<00:03:06.440> get<00:03:06.530> both<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.340> I'll<00:03:07.460> bring<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.030> down<00:03:08.150> into

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300

that's<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.870> wind<00:03:42.260> sock<00:03:42.440> of<00:03:42.620> sorts<00:03:42.920> but<00:03:43.460> now<00:03:43.550> this

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
that's a wind sock of sorts but now this

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.090 
that's a wind sock of sorts but now this
little<00:03:43.880> white<00:03:44.150> tape<00:03:44.480> here<00:03:44.780> so<00:03:45.200> when<00:03:45.770> I'm<00:03:45.950> in

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
little white tape here so when I'm in

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.040 
little white tape here so when I'm in
the<00:03:46.190> frame<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:47.000> all<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.210> a<00:03:47.270> sudden<00:03:47.300> this

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
the frame and all of a sudden this

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.470 
the frame and all of a sudden this
starts<00:03:48.410> creeping<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:48.950> there<00:03:49.100> normally<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
starts creeping in there normally the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.080 
starts creeping in there normally the
operator<00:03:51.050> can<00:03:51.440> see<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:52.100> white<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:52.790> fast

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
operator can see the white so fast

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.540 
operator can see the white so fast
whereas<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:53.810> just<00:03:54.110> pure<00:03:54.380> black<00:03:54.740> the

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
whereas it is just pure black the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.370 
whereas it is just pure black the
viewfinder<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.330> black<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.720> white<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:57.080> he

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
viewfinder is in black and white so he

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.110 
viewfinder is in black and white so he
won't<00:03:57.560> see<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.890> until<00:03:58.250> it's<00:03:58.580> too<00:03:58.700> late<00:03:58.730> and

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
won't see it until it's too late and

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.180 
won't see it until it's too late and
sometimes<00:03:59.990> in<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.260> frame<00:04:00.530> we<00:04:00.740> have<00:04:00.770> a<00:04:00.890> safety

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
sometimes in the frame we have a safety

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.130 
sometimes in the frame we have a safety
so<00:04:01.730> if<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:01.910> start<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.240> creep<00:04:02.480> into<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.840> safety

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
so if I start to creep into the safety

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.290 
so if I start to creep into the safety
he<00:04:03.620> sees<00:04:03.890> it<00:04:04.130> they<00:04:04.490> might<00:04:04.610> dear<00:04:04.820> give<00:04:05.180> me<00:04:05.210> a

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
he sees it they might dear give me a

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.750 
he sees it they might dear give me a
finger<00:04:05.600> like<00:04:05.870> up<00:04:06.050> up<00:04:06.170> up<00:04:06.290> up<00:04:06.440> oh<00:04:06.710> there<00:04:07.490> it<00:04:07.580> is

or<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.210> DP<00:05:27.840> could<00:05:28.080> help<00:05:28.289> and<00:05:28.650> say<00:05:28.860> well<00:05:29.039> maybe<00:05:29.190> I

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
or a DP could help and say well maybe I

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.560

can<00:05:29.639> position<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.120> light<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.330> little

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
can position the light a little

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.390 
can position the light a little
differently<00:05:31.020> or<00:05:31.200> we<00:05:31.289> can<00:05:31.440> set<00:05:31.620> a<00:05:31.650> flag<00:05:31.919> for<00:05:32.190> you

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
differently or we can set a flag for you

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.180 
differently or we can set a flag for you
so<00:05:32.880> it's<00:05:33.210> sort<00:05:33.360> of<00:05:33.450> like<00:05:33.600> and<00:05:34.080> as<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.740> get<00:05:34.950> more

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
so it's sort of like and as you get more

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.400 
so it's sort of like and as you get more
time<00:05:35.460> spent<00:05:35.610> on<00:05:35.910> set<00:05:36.180> you<00:05:36.210> learn<00:05:36.570> what's

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
time spent on set you learn what's

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.100 
time spent on set you learn what's
needed<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.979> where<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.430> troubles<00:05:38.789> are<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.270> a

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:29.079 
the foundation I got in school still

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:31.409 
the foundation I got in school still
helps<00:06:29.469> in<00:06:29.589> so<00:06:29.799> many<00:06:29.919> areas<00:06:30.159> now<00:06:30.549> because<00:06:31.269> I

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
helps in so many areas now because I

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:32.789 
helps in so many areas now because I
learned<00:06:31.629> a<00:06:31.749> little<00:06:31.839> bit<00:06:31.989> about<00:06:32.109> producing<00:06:32.529> a

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:32.799 
learned a little bit about producing a

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:34.319 
learned a little bit about producing a
little<00:06:33.039> bit<00:06:33.129> about<00:06:33.369> production<00:06:33.699> managing<00:06:34.149> a

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:34.329

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
camera and and everything so that when I

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.369 
camera and and everything so that when I
showed<00:06:36.909> up<00:06:37.029> on<00:06:37.119> set<00:06:37.419> even<00:06:38.049> though<00:06:38.139> it<00:06:38.229> wasn't

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:38.379 
showed up on set even though it wasn't

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:39.299 
showed up on set even though it wasn't
the<00:06:38.529> same<00:06:38.679> equipment

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:39.309 
the same equipment

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:42.059 
the same equipment
it<00:06:39.609> was<00:06:39.759> certainly<00:06:40.059> I<00:06:41.019> sort<00:06:41.589> of<00:06:41.649> knew<00:06:41.829> what

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
it was certainly I sort of knew what

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.699 
it was certainly I sort of knew what
they<00:06:42.459> were<00:06:42.519> what<00:06:42.969> it<00:06:43.059> was<00:06:43.269> if<00:06:43.869> you<00:06:44.049> can<00:06:44.199> get<00:06:44.379> up

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:44.709 
they were what it was if you can get up

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:46.619 
they were what it was if you can get up
to<00:06:44.769> speed<00:06:45.129> on<00:06:45.159> electronics<00:06:45.849> understanding

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:46.629 
to speed on electronics understanding

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:48.599 
to speed on electronics understanding
soldering<00:06:47.049> you<00:06:47.379> know<00:06:47.619> what<00:06:47.799> happens<00:06:48.129> to<00:06:48.159> sound

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:48.609 
soldering you know what happens to sound

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:50.279 
soldering you know what happens to sound
when<00:06:48.849> it<00:06:48.939> goes<00:06:49.059> to<00:06:49.179> the<00:06:49.269> air<00:06:49.509> microphone
