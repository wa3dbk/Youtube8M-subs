00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.530 
that you are walking like in three and a
half<00:02:51.680> inches<00:02:52.190> that's<00:02:52.520> where<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:52.820> will<00:02:53.000> imagine

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
half inches that's where I will imagine

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.170 
half inches that's where I will imagine
we<00:02:54.050> will<00:02:54.230> ask<00:02:54.530> our<00:02:54.860> model<00:02:55.400> later<00:02:55.640> what<00:02:56.030> she

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
we will ask our model later what she

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.130 
we will ask our model later what she
thinks<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:58.220> has<00:02:58.520> also<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:59.120> ankle<00:02:59.690> strap

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
thinks and it has also this ankle strap

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.560 
thinks and it has also this ankle strap
that<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.560> will<00:03:00.770> be<00:03:00.980> able<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.340> keep<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:02.060> in

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
that you will be able to keep you in

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.170 
that you will be able to keep you in
place<00:03:02.960> hopefully<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:04.130> not<00:03:04.340> very<00:03:04.520> wobbly<00:03:04.910> I

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
place hopefully it's not very wobbly I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.650 
place hopefully it's not very wobbly I
would<00:03:05.540> think<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.700> very<00:03:07.700> high<00:03:07.970> heel<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:08.540> if

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
would think this is very high heel so if

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.750 
would think this is very high heel so if
you're<00:03:08.840> not<00:03:09.080> used<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.040> high<00:03:10.400> heels

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
you're not used to be in high heels

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.060 
you're not used to be in high heels
probably<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.450> will<00:03:11.570> not<00:03:11.870> recommend<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.710> and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
probably I will not recommend that and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.730 
probably I will not recommend that and

I think they feel more comfortable in

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.720 
I think they feel more comfortable in
most<00:04:02.420> heels<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.930> are<00:04:02.990> three<00:04:03.890> inches<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:04.250> I

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
most heels that are three inches so I

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.700 
most heels that are three inches so I
think<00:04:05.030> if<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:05.690> would<00:04:05.810> have<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.080> wear<00:04:06.170> heels<00:04:06.380> this

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
think if I would have to wear heels this

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.880 
think if I would have to wear heels this
