you know fairly typical netbook specs it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990 
you know fairly typical netbook specs it
also<00:01:24.360> has<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> 1024<00:01:25.530> x<00:01:25.650> 600<00:01:26.000> screen

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
also has just a 1024 x 600 screen

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.300 
also has just a 1024 x 600 screen
resolution<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> 10<00:01:27.960> inch<00:01:28.110> screen<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.740> is

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
resolution on a 10 inch screen it is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.760 
resolution on a 10 inch screen it is
glossy<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.299> well<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:31.439> something<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
glossy as well so that's something to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.170 
glossy as well so that's something to
keep<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.159> mind<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.520> case<00:01:32.549> you're<00:01:32.820> looking<00:01:32.909> for

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
keep in mind in case you're looking for

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.030 
keep in mind in case you're looking for
something<00:01:33.360> that's<00:01:33.540> Matt<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.409> sends<00:01:34.950> instead

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
something that's Matt and sends instead

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
something that's Matt and sends instead
so<00:01:38.040> she<00:01:38.130> actually<00:01:38.400> has<00:01:38.700> another<00:01:38.970> model<00:01:39.360> here

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
so she actually has another model here

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.240 
so she actually has another model here
that<00:01:40.229> has<00:01:41.180> Windows<00:01:42.180> 7<00:01:42.509> starter<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.470> 250

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that has Windows 7 starter and a 250

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.920 
that has Windows 7 starter and a 250
gigabyte<00:01:44.430> hard<00:01:44.759> drive<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.750> bit

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
gigabyte hard drive so it's a little bit

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.920 
gigabyte hard drive so it's a little bit
of<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.110> speck<00:01:46.439> boost<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:48.479> newer<00:01:48.750> operating

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
of a speck boost and the newer operating

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
of a speck boost and the newer operating
system<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.549> runs<00:01:50.729> about<00:01:50.909> 50<00:01:51.240> large

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
system but that one runs about 50 large

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.539 
system but that one runs about 50 large
more<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.799> thing<00:01:52.829> i'd<00:01:53.100> say<00:01:53.340> that's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
more so the one thing i'd say that's

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.730 
more so the one thing i'd say that's
best<00:01:53.909> about<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.180> netbook<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.649> know
