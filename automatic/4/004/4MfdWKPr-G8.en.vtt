00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.019
 for nosis 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.469
 is an orchid is that they are very delicate 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 nothing reading brother the room gnosis are 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.390
 Some very easy to care orchids are 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 very hard your blooms can us 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.550
 last up to three months or more and they are 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.590
 ideal to take anywhere 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.400
 as a plant indoors and we have already 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.110
 spoken before they need light no 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.010
 we can have it in rooms are 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.859
 very dark places 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.719
 then we're going to tell you how 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.780
 you have to take care of your sphere of 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:47.540
 Gnosis to have them so splendid 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.880
 with open flowers alive 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.450
 the irrigation in the afa the gnosis very 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.450
 important 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.280
 as in all indoor plants 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.830
 here we are not going to touch the substrate or the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.490
 let's get out of the pot but the afa 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.650
 the gnosis 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.840
 is the plant that will tell us when 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.409
 we have it closed 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.040
 many days like as very easy looking 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.550
 its roots 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.760
 as you can see the fae gnosis is cultivated in 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.690
 transparent pots because 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.730
 because they do photosynthesis with the root 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.520
 how does the photosynthesis with the root 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.560
 also in addition to the leaves the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.380
 grower puts a flower pot 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.380
 transparent to achieve that the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.110
 plant captures more energy and in less 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.220
 time may have a plant already 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.170
 commercial 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.390
 we really in our homes 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.400
 that the plant is in a pot 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.800
 transparent I am in a covers flower pots 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.930
 It's not that important 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.230
 the orchid is a growth plant 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.130
 very slow an orchid these will have 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.930
 approximately 3 or 4 years of cultivation 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.240
 since it is a young plant until 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.810
 they change it from a pot and it goes 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 developing 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.230
 when we have to water them falero sis 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.659
 First 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.960
 ensure that the water is not very chalky 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.640
 very saline 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.410
 It is also not necessary to use water from 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.450
 bottle in use calcified guardes 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.730
 if it can be better then it is not 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.950
 essential 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.970
 if it is more important that the water be 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.709
 warm that the water is not cold between 18 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.849
 or 20 degrees is ideal if it's too cold 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.090
 we can warm it up a bit in the 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.110
 microwave because that is sensitive 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.810
 keep in mind that all these 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.330
 plants are tropical and suffer with the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 cold both with the cold environment and with 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.290
 the cold in the irrigation water 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.360
 as you see 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.829
 the roots of the faa the gnosis 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.829
 this plant is green 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.150
 and in this other one you see is so gray 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.690
 we put them together so you can see the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.690
 difference 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.110
 is the roots of the afa the gnosis us 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.380
 they will indicate when we have it 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.380
 fix 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.620
 when the root acquires this tonality 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.319
 is when you have to water it and now we're going 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.340
 to do an irrigation demonstration for 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.340
 see how simple it is 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.250
 this is one so that it does not give itself root 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.960
 green 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.000
 and this is a nosis skirt that 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.070
 you need to water gray root if you observe 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 the aerial roots that are outside the 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.420
 flower pot 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.360
 they have that gray tonality just like 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.269
 is that because being in contact 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.430
 with the air they dehydrate and yet 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.370
 it is these that, as they are doing, 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.700
 photosynthesis that's why they have this color 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.700
 green 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.190
 as a lack of dose is added to 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.120
 fix a job if we need 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.120
 we take a vase with water 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.050
 we add fertilizer it is good to use a 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.050
 Orchid-specific fertilizer 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.770
 we add the dose indicated by the 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.770
 maker 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.360
 Once the plant is irrigated, we can use 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.330
 this water with fertilizer for other plants 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.490
 we are going to water the plant as you see we have 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:49.310
 added the liquid fertilizer with 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.310
 which we will give nutrition we submerge 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.120
 when we do this at home we will have it 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.130
 10 15 20 minutes no matter what time 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.020
 that you have to make sure is that the root 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.980
 is well hydrated and that is not going to 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.980
 indicate the color 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.300
 as you can see 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.730
 is already taking another hue 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.990
 and now when we take it out of the water and it 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.610
 put in contact with the oxygen of the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.610
 air will become completely green 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.270
 we're going to take it out 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.020
 and let it drain completely 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.020
 here 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:03.720
 you see the color of the roots if the 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.720
 we leave more time it will take more tonality 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.080
 to induce flowering back to the 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.510
 plant the most convenient is to have it 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.310
 period of two to three weeks below 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:23.380
 of 15 degrees between 8 9 10 12 degrees this 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.390
 what makes us is that the plant induces 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.540
 new shoots that are what will give us 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.790
 new flowers for example 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.430
 as you see cheating us and has already lost the 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.730
 flower but having passed a period of 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.460
 cold you can see there those new 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.270
 stems those new yolks sorry that 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.270
 will be the new ones 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.590
 the new branches will be the flowers 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.590
 new
