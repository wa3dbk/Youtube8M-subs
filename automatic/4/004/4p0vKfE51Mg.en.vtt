lead off with the Gliscor and I'm gonna

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.270 
lead off with the Gliscor and I'm gonna
lead<00:00:49.570> off<00:00:49.660> with<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.899> slider<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.500> this<00:00:50.890> isn't<00:00:51.070> my

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
lead off with a slider and this isn't my

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.889 
lead off with a slider and this isn't my
normal<00:00:51.309> choice<00:00:51.820> scarf<00:00:52.120> set<00:00:52.329> that<00:00:52.510> I'd<00:00:52.600> like<00:00:52.780> to

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
normal choice scarf set that I'd like to

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.810 
normal choice scarf set that I'd like to
lead<00:00:53.050> off<00:00:53.170> with<00:00:53.469> but<00:00:53.920> rather<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.190> banded<00:00:54.640> lead

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
lead off with but rather a banded lead

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.910 
lead off with but rather a banded lead
so<00:00:55.030> I'm<00:00:55.120> sacrificing<00:00:55.899> speed<00:00:56.110> over<00:00:56.350> power<00:00:56.590> and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
so I'm sacrificing speed over power and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.560 
so I'm sacrificing speed over power and
the<00:00:57.670> key<00:00:57.730> term<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:57.910> gonna<00:00:58.030> do<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.270> good<00:00:58.450> amount

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
the key term is gonna do a good amount

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.450 
the key term is gonna do a good amount
of<00:00:58.750> damage<00:00:58.809> even<00:00:59.350> against<00:00:59.649> this<00:00:59.710> gliscor<00:01:00.190> who

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
of damage even against this gliscor who

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.490 
of damage even against this gliscor who
resists<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.090> u-turn<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:01.809> has<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.020> lot<00:01:02.379> of

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
resists the u-turn and has a lot of

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.770 
resists the u-turn and has a lot of
defensive<00:01:03.100> bulk<00:01:03.309> now<00:01:04.000> he<00:01:04.059> uses<00:01:04.660> the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
defensive bulk now he uses the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.950 
defensive bulk now he uses the
opportunity<00:01:05.410> to<00:01:05.800> set<00:01:05.979> up<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.190> rocks<00:01:06.399> and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
opportunity to set up the rocks and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.150 
opportunity to set up the rocks and
that's<00:01:07.960> really<00:01:08.140> no<00:01:08.320> big<00:01:08.470> deal<00:01:08.500> because<00:01:08.830> I<00:01:09.009> go

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
that's really no big deal because I go

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.310 
that's really no big deal because I go
into<00:01:09.280> my<00:01:09.490> bulky<00:01:09.910> Starmie<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.810> just<00:01:11.080> go<00:01:11.200> for

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
into my bulky Starmie and just go for

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.840 
into my bulky Starmie and just go for
the<00:01:11.410> rapid<00:01:11.649> spin<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.009> next<00:01:12.250> turn<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.640> blow

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
the rapid spin the next turn to blow

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.580 
the rapid spin the next turn to blow
away<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.149> rocks<00:01:13.360> and<00:01:13.630> he<00:01:14.170> goes<00:01:14.350> into<00:01:14.500> a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
away the rocks and he goes into a

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.309 
away the rocks and he goes into a
Blissey<00:01:14.920> which<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.220> pretty<00:01:15.459> annoying<00:01:15.759> because

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.319 
Blissey which is pretty annoying because

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.419 
Blissey which is pretty annoying because
blazing's<00:01:17.319> are<00:01:17.440> notorious<00:01:18.130> for<00:01:18.160> being

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
blazing's are notorious for being

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.010 
blazing's are notorious for being
special<00:01:18.580> walls<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.149> I<00:01:19.209> have<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.569> switch<00:01:19.810> out

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
special walls and I have to switch out

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.080 
special walls and I have to switch out
and<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.649> go<00:01:20.800> into<00:01:20.950> Gliscor<00:01:21.459> who<00:01:21.610> can<00:01:21.789> take<00:01:22.060> a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
and I go into Gliscor who can take a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.320 
and I go into Gliscor who can take a
t-wave<00:01:22.509> are<00:01:22.720> toxic<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:24.490> top<00:01:25.149> the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
t-wave are toxic and also top the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.779 
t-wave are toxic and also top the
Blissey<00:01:25.690> if<00:01:25.869> it<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.319> on<00:01:26.619> one<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.429> support

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
Blissey if it is on one of the support

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.210 
Blissey if it is on one of the support
sets<00:01:28.030> but<00:01:28.539> it<00:01:28.750> actually<00:01:28.929> is<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.410> offensive<00:01:30.009> set

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
sets but it actually is a offensive set

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.669 
sets but it actually is a offensive set
which<00:01:30.429> is<00:01:30.610> not<00:01:30.789> good<00:01:31.509> for<00:01:31.539> me<00:01:31.840> because<00:01:32.020> he<00:01:32.470> hits

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
which is not good for me because he hits

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.740 
which is not good for me because he hits
me<00:01:32.800> up<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.979> fort<00:01:33.190> I'm<00:01:33.340> super<00:01:33.610> effective<00:01:34.149> I<00:01:34.300> see

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
me up the fort I'm super effective I see

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.630 
me up the fort I'm super effective I see
wind<00:01:34.990> which<00:01:35.259> is<00:01:35.289> actually<00:01:35.890> illegal<00:01:36.220> on<00:01:36.520> the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
wind which is actually illegal on the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.150 
wind which is actually illegal on the
Blissey<00:01:37.000> but<00:01:37.660> in<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.020> case<00:01:38.319> AFD<00:01:38.830> serves

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
Blissey but in this case AFD serves

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.699 
Blissey but in this case AFD serves
better<00:01:39.340> for<00:01:39.640> me<00:01:39.789> because<00:01:40.319> ice<00:01:41.319> beam<00:01:41.530> would

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
better for me because ice beam would

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:43.680 
better for me because ice beam would
have<00:01:41.830> been<00:01:42.009> better<00:01:42.280> over<00:01:42.819> the<00:01:42.970> icy<00:01:43.209> wind<00:01:43.450> as

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
have been better over the icy wind as

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.870 
have been better over the icy wind as
you<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.289> live<00:01:44.709> the<00:01:45.160> two<00:01:45.340> icy<00:01:45.640> winds

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
you can see I live the two icy winds

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.139 
you can see I live the two icy winds
with<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.929> 4<00:01:47.170> HP<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:48.069> able<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.520> get<00:01:48.789> off<00:01:48.940> an

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.779 
with a 4 HP and is able to get off an
earthquake<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.959> the<00:01:50.590> stealth<00:01:50.830> rocks<00:01:51.099> and<00:01:51.369> the

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
earthquake and the stealth rocks and the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.460 
earthquake and the stealth rocks and the
earthquake<00:01:52.179> is<00:01:52.330> going<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.539> do<00:01:52.690> surprisingly<00:01:53.349> a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
earthquake is going to do surprisingly a

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.320 
earthquake is going to do surprisingly a
good<00:01:53.800> amount<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.069> damage<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.030> reason

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
good amount of damage and the reason

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.270 
good amount of damage and the reason
behind<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.720> is<00:01:55.840> because<00:01:56.050> this<00:01:56.679> bliss<00:01:56.979> he<00:01:57.099> is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
behind that is because this bliss he is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.029 
behind that is because this bliss he is
carrying<00:01:58.060> Special<00:01:58.450> Attack<00:01:58.509> V's<00:01:59.020> rather<00:01:59.739> than

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
carrying Special Attack V's rather than

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.370 
carrying Special Attack V's rather than
carrying<00:02:00.369> defensive<00:02:00.789> V's<00:02:01.179> because<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:02.259> is

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
carrying defensive V's because this is

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.499 
carrying defensive V's because this is
an<00:02:02.500> offensive<00:02:02.890> set<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.880> I'm<00:02:04.030> gonna<00:02:04.209> leave<00:02:04.390> my

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
an offensive set and I'm gonna leave my

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.300 
an offensive set and I'm gonna leave my
Gliscor<00:02:04.720> here<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.319> death<00:02:05.770> fodder<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:06.280> I

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
Gliscor here as death fodder and so I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.609 
Gliscor here as death fodder and so I
can<00:02:06.520> get<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> free<00:02:06.940> switch<00:02:07.179> in<00:02:07.360> into<00:02:08.080> my<00:02:08.200> slicer

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
can get a free switch in into my slicer

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.770 
can get a free switch in into my slicer
and<00:02:08.860> just<00:02:09.340> revenge<00:02:09.610> kill<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.119> let's<00:02:10.690> see

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
and just revenge kill this let's see

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.170 
and just revenge kill this let's see
with<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.020> u-turn<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.739> um<00:02:12.430> if<00:02:12.580> he<00:02:12.610> does

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
with a u-turn and um if he does

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.300 
with a u-turn and um if he does
opt<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.989> switch<00:02:14.200> out<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.620> will<00:02:14.890> get<00:02:15.069> switch

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
opt to switch out I will get switch

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.680 
opt to switch out I will get switch
advantage<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.000> that's<00:02:16.180> exactly<00:02:16.569> what

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
advantage and that's exactly what

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.160 
advantage and that's exactly what
happens

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
happens

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.110

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
taking away and chipping away at this

taking away and chipping away at this
Gliscor<00:02:27.190> HP<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.790> i<00:02:27.849> go<00:02:28.060> into<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.980> blizzard<00:02:29.980> my

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
Gliscor HP and i go into a blizzard my

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.250 
Gliscor HP and i go into a blizzard my
sceptile<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.450> go<00:02:31.599> for<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.870> leaf<00:02:32.019> storm

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
sceptile to go for the leaf storm

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.600 
sceptile to go for the leaf storm
because<00:02:32.530> leaf<00:02:32.739> storm<00:02:32.950> will<00:02:33.099> pretty<00:02:33.280> much<00:02:33.430> hit

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
because leaf storm will pretty much hit

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.330 
because leaf storm will pretty much hit
anything<00:02:34.030> hard<00:02:34.560> except<00:02:35.560> unfortunately<00:02:35.769> he

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
anything hard except unfortunately he

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.160 
anything hard except unfortunately he
goes<00:02:36.519> into<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.819> heat<00:02:37.420> trend<00:02:37.690> which<00:02:37.840> quad

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
goes into a heat trend which quad

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.339 
goes into a heat trend which quad
resists<00:02:38.680> grass<00:02:39.099> moves<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.959> luckily<00:02:40.959> for<00:02:41.049> me<00:02:41.260> I

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
resists grass moves and luckily for me I

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.440 
resists grass moves and luckily for me I
do<00:02:41.500> get<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.799> critical<00:02:42.250> hit<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.580> after<00:02:43.299> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
do get a critical hit and after the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.160 
do get a critical hit and after the
critical<00:02:43.629> hit<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:45.040> actually<00:02:45.610> um<00:02:46.170> really

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
critical hit that is actually um really

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.900 
critical hit that is actually um really
great<00:02:47.440> for<00:02:47.560> me<00:02:47.650> because<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:47.980> focus<00:02:48.430> west<00:02:48.610> will

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
great for me because a focus west will

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.750 
great for me because a focus west will
be<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.090> safe<00:02:49.420> ko<00:02:49.860> even<00:02:50.860> after<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.400> Special

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
be a safe ko even after the Special

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.030 
be a safe ko even after the Special
Attack<00:02:51.879> drop<00:02:52.330> from<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.720> leaf<00:02:52.930> storm<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.440> a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
Attack drop from the leaf storm and a

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.559 
Attack drop from the leaf storm and a
little<00:02:54.310> bit<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.549> over<00:02:54.879> prediction<00:02:55.330> on<00:02:55.420> my

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
little bit of over prediction on my

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.720 
little bit of over prediction on my
opponents<00:02:56.140> part<00:02:56.380> because<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:57.310> went<00:02:57.489> for<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
opponents part because you went for the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.280 
opponents part because you went for the
earth<00:02:57.849> power<00:02:58.120> rather<00:02:58.420> than<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.780> safe<00:02:58.989> fire

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
earth power rather than the safe fire

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.870 
earth power rather than the safe fire
blast<00:02:59.560> probably<00:02:59.829> predicting<00:03:00.370> my<00:03:00.489> switching

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
blast probably predicting my switching

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.970 
blast probably predicting my switching
to<00:03:00.970> star<00:03:01.209> me<00:03:01.360> or<00:03:01.450> something<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:01.989> now<00:03:02.860> he

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
to star me or something and now he

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.410 
to star me or something and now he
doesn't<00:03:03.310> see<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> Blissey<00:03:03.849> and<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.150> really

doesn't see the Blissey and I really

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.339 
doesn't see the Blissey and I really

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
don't understand what is um his um

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.300 
don't understand what is um his um
mindset<00:03:08.349> was<00:03:08.470> at<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:08.709> point<00:03:08.980> because<00:03:09.220> I'm

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
mindset was at this point because I'm

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.589 
mindset was at this point because I'm
just<00:03:09.459> gonna<00:03:09.549> go<00:03:09.730> for<00:03:09.879> the<00:03:09.940> rock<00:03:10.090> slide<00:03:10.269> here

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
just gonna go for the rock slide here

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.089 
just gonna go for the rock slide here
and<00:03:10.840> rockslides<00:03:11.140> gonna<00:03:11.440> do<00:03:11.590> good<00:03:11.829> amount<00:03:12.040> of

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
and rockslides gonna do good amount of

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.580 
and rockslides gonna do good amount of
damage<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:13.269> gang<00:03:13.510> garden<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.049> if<00:03:14.379> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
damage to this gang garden and if the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.170 
damage to this gang garden and if the
bliss<00:03:14.739> he<00:03:14.860> did<00:03:15.069> indeed<00:03:15.280> want<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.790> stay<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.150> it

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
bliss he did indeed want to stay in it

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.610 
bliss he did indeed want to stay in it
would<00:03:16.450> have<00:03:16.540> been<00:03:16.720> killed<00:03:16.959> by<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.200> rock<00:03:17.410> side

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
would have been killed by the rock side

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.680 
would have been killed by the rock side
too<00:03:17.829> now<00:03:18.549> I'm<00:03:18.670> predicting<00:03:19.090> him<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.299> go<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:19.599> the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
too now I'm predicting him to go for the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.780 
too now I'm predicting him to go for the
stab<00:03:19.900> Shadow<00:03:20.200> Ball<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.010> go<00:03:21.250> into<00:03:21.370> my<00:03:21.579> what

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
stab Shadow Ball so I go into my what

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.180 
stab Shadow Ball so I go into my what
the<00:03:21.910> duck<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.840> take<00:03:23.049> it<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.379> fully<00:03:23.590> resist<00:03:24.040> it

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
the duck to take it and fully resist it

should have been an easy ko and right
here<00:05:32.170> I'm<00:05:32.410> gonna<00:05:32.940> go<00:05:33.940> for<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.180> extreme<00:05:34.450> speed

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
here I'm gonna go for the extreme speed

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.940 
here I'm gonna go for the extreme speed
because<00:05:34.840> I<00:05:34.930> don't<00:05:35.170> want<00:05:35.320> my<00:05:35.440> stone<00:05:35.650> edge<00:05:35.770> to

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
because I don't want my stone edge to

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.100 
because I don't want my stone edge to
miss<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:36.400> at<00:05:36.910> that<00:05:37.060> point<00:05:37.270> extreme<00:05:37.660> speed<00:05:37.900> is

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
miss and at that point extreme speed is

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.630 
miss and at that point extreme speed is
gonna<00:05:38.290> ko<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:39.270> his<00:05:40.270> glass<00:05:40.540> core<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:40.870> down<00:05:41.080> and

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
gonna ko and his glass core is down and

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.130 
gonna ko and his glass core is down and
at<00:05:42.640> this<00:05:42.820> point<00:05:43.180> I<00:05:43.360> think<00:05:43.480> he<00:05:43.720> only<00:05:43.900> has<00:05:44.110> one

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
at this point I think he only has one

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.620 
at this point I think he only has one
pokémon<00:05:44.800> left<00:05:44.830> and<00:05:45.280> his<00:05:45.760> last<00:05:45.970> Pokemon<00:05:46.420> is

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
pokémon left and his last Pokemon is

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.900 
pokémon left and his last Pokemon is
actually<00:05:46.990> a<00:05:47.020> Skarmory<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.830> that's<00:05:48.460> really

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
actually a Skarmory and that's really

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.220 
actually a Skarmory and that's really
amazing<00:05:49.120> because<00:05:49.540> I<00:05:49.570> can<00:05:49.780> hit<00:05:49.930> him<00:05:50.020> with<00:05:50.140> the

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
amazing because I can hit him with the

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.260 
amazing because I can hit him with the
stab<00:05:50.440> super-effective<00:05:50.980> flare<00:05:51.400> blitz<00:05:51.580> and

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
stab super-effective flare blitz and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.120 
stab super-effective flare blitz and
that's<00:05:52.420> gonna<00:05:52.570> do<00:05:52.750> good<00:05:53.020> damage<00:05:53.260> even<00:05:53.620> if<00:05:53.950> this

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
that's gonna do good damage even if this

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.520 
that's gonna do good damage even if this
Skarmory<00:05:54.730> is<00:05:54.910> defensive<00:05:55.450> bulky<00:05:55.780> which<00:05:56.350> it

Skarmory is defensive bulky which it

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.440
