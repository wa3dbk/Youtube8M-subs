another<00:03:30.180> camera<00:03:30.450> which<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.380> for<00:03:31.560> taking<00:03:31.890> the

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
another camera which is for taking the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.370 
another camera which is for taking the
chest<00:03:32.460> this<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.090> again<00:03:33.420> 2<00:03:33.570> megapixel<00:03:34.050> camera

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
chest this is again 2 megapixel camera

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.380 
chest this is again 2 megapixel camera
and<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.340> how<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.550> machine<00:03:35.730> looks<00:03:36.150> like

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
and this is how the machine looks like

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.990 
and this is how the machine looks like
the<00:03:36.900> machine<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.410> 13<00:03:37.830> pretty<00:03:38.340> much<00:03:38.520> nicely

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
the machine is 13 pretty much nicely

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.150 
the machine is 13 pretty much nicely
design<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.780> overall<00:03:40.020> specs<00:03:40.650> looks<00:03:40.920> good

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
design the overall specs looks good

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.400 
design the overall specs looks good
looks<00:03:41.490> nice<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:42.330> we<00:03:42.480> take<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.720> look<00:03:42.960> over<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
looks nice if we take a look over the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.030 
looks nice if we take a look over the
specs<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:44.160> comes<00:03:44.400> with<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:45.080> 128gb<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.620> 50

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
specs it comes with a 128gb is 50

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.130 
specs it comes with a 128gb is 50
hardest<00:03:47.460> which<00:03:48.000> cannot<00:03:48.360> be<00:03:48.480> upgraded<00:03:48.630> and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
hardest which cannot be upgraded and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.440 
hardest which cannot be upgraded and
because<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:50.070> machine<00:03:50.550> comes<00:03:51.090> with<00:03:51.300> that

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
because the machine comes with that

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.300 
because the machine comes with that
particular<00:03:51.900> storage<00:03:52.500> only<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.040> cannot

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
upgrade it even if you pay more and then

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.270 
upgrade it even if you pay more and then
you<00:03:55.710> have<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> 4<00:03:56.340> gb<00:03:56.730> ddr2<00:03:57.650> sdram<00:03:58.650> as<00:03:58.890> well<00:03:59.100> which
