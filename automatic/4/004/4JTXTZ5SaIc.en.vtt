00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.709
 these dear friends 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.160
 we continue our 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.120
 videos 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.360
 dedicated to work 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.029
 in the rest house they see Peter 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.889
 one of the most common 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.469
 questions matters is 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.019
 training 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.159
 using the speaker 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.519
 on account 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.350
 for this were works 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.240
 several specialized 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.119
 Bishkek 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.960
 work cards 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 which allow the child enough 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.460
 quickly 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.910
 will stop 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.450
 not easy with the score 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.060
 and such concepts as 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.540
 composition of the number 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.220
 and further 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.840
 It helps 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.530
 master the simplest arithmetic 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.420
 actions 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.050
 the fact is that very often parents 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.730
 start learning 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 invoice tariff exclusion 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.590
 for a child 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.460
 signs 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 unit deuce threesome seven 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.800
 they initially there is nothing means 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.980
 it's just today 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.930
 simply 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.900
 Pictures 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 the most correct way is 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.020
 that when we explain to the child that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 such a number of what it consists of 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.170
 point by point 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 he is just 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.010
 basic 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.970
 and principles that allow the child 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.000
 understand what consists of what 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.770
 so bad what are twos 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.860
 then we see in Bishkek what exists 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.480
 sets of 100 people 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.480
 1 2 3 4 so on and so forth 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.409
 looking at the work with which the child 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.350
 is learning 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.920
 think 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.810
 it happens very quickly 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.610
 This Bishkek is considered one of the most 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.450
 effective 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.180
 her pleasure is used as 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 preschoolers and so on 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.250
 younger students who only study 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.520
 begin to study 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.380
 composition 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.359
 the same box 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.359
 how can you work handed over books 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.259
 first of all 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.149
 as with any 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:23.519
 other 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.839
 and the floppy disk that we use 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.099
 depth of the river 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.099
 she and the baby mm open 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.919
 in order 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.919
 windows by rows 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.019
 in this case, we have in the first 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.349
 or cn 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.979
 situated 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:44.999
 in order 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.379
 is increasing 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.309
 unit 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.999
 the child will quickly close its mouth 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.999
 unit 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.489
 2 two points 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.549
 country can go over 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.539
 percent 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.259
 from simple by memorizing 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.519
 logical that is, for example, ask 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.419
 question 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.929
 What is the difference 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:15.829
 picture 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.839
 the first window from the second 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:22.279
 such chat costs are here for one 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:23.749
 more 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.279
 although perhaps this is simply not to answer 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.349
 it's all very individual 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.149
 then we explain that when adding 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.249
 another point is the following 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.219
 number 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.969
 two 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.849
 barely 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.849
 go ahead 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.759
 go ahead 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.250
 meaning baby 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.950
 thus remembers 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.339
 amount of points 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.829
 which were 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.829
 was the first in history in the second third 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.119
 in this case 4 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:05.229
 exactly the same goes on 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.229
 with subsequent 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.860
 but how did you notice 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.439
 in general, there are also 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.909
 that is, multicolored and 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.879
 which 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.900
 but located in schools 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.029
 Holpy what so to say poet 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.189
 it's just that the child is not 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.049
 just visually remembered 

00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:27.479
 location of points 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.409
 Anuchinsky believe 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.590
 that is, when we 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.889
 worked well enough 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.870
 the first reactor is hardly the third reached 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.889
 ten 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.090
 analysts 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.580
 then you can give the child assignments 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.930
 what about she still to 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.729
 counted 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:47.660
 for that they 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.640
 we can open in any order 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.259
 windows 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.259
 never just 10 points 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.849
 we considered 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.680
 remy opened 10 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.800
 He was someone believes 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.750
 Antonov survey was so much 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.569
 first-graders points 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:07.460
 that is, Akim in this way we 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.439
 at the same time 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.050
 we connect 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.300
 memorization function ie attention and 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.909
 memory 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.819
 and just looking thought 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.819
 and remembered 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.229
 simple arithmetic 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.740
 actions were going with so we show 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.939
 how much 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.939
 two points 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:28.990
 eg 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.309
 the Grand Prix 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:34.309
 I ask how much it will be 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.180
 he says 3 we say well in which 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.729
 for cats find the number 3 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.129
 and give in which is enough already 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.449
 well known created in december thats 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.419
 in this window next 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.469
 there must be a pedestrian 3 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.479
 yes indeed action when viewed 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.680
 plus 2 will be 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.509
 this way we are starting to summarize 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:01.860
 so begins the simplest 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.419
 arithmetic operations 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.650
 that allow 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.960
 clearly understands the total number 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.940
 what it consists of what parts
