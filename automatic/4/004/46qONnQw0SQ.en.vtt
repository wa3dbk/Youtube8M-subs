00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:12.280
 already the training system that was 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.799
 the fundamental change and is the advice 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.019
 that I give to any coach or 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.199
 anyone who takes the step of boxing 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:22.510
 Cuban to boxing this professional 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.400
 systems the concepts of the 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.240
 trainings have to change 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 totally 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.150
 well look at one of the things like 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.890
 we are going to set an example in 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.510
 the average time of Cuba that was fighting 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.489
 then he invented four rounds and 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.670
 five rounds but good time mine 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.620
 from there were three rounds of Cuba 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.020
 then three rounds of three minutes 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.719
 with one of rest we had 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.260
 that lead the fighter to perform in three 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.079
 minutes for three rounds I learned all the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.460
 time until we got to what we had 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.210
 what to win 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:04.570
 in professional boxing it 's different already 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:07.540
 to start is 4 6 9 10 and 12 rounds 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.850
 and the concept of the plan of the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.860
 Workouts have to vary us 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.020
 work in Cuba called him the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.180
 circuits that in English is called 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.009
 intervac training training 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.890
 interval 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.590
 that is that thought of the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.869
 internal train and in which we did 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.679
 we in Cuba are already changing 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:32.200
 totally in professional boxing for 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.880
 example we did what we 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.399
 call the interval training in the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.909
 Sports concept is called resistance 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.479
 at speed 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.549
 there already to us in what is in the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.579
 professional boxing then we work what 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.670
 that the general resistance and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.670
 training concepts and in return that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.030
 was what the Lord managed 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 angelo dandy I always worked 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.759
 he worked interval with the fighters 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.770
 Thai media and in Thailand the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.129
 Thai fighters this debut to anyone 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.599
 assault the boadilla jump I gave 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:14.579
 account that from 1 to 4 to 5 they were 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.390
 ok but then they go down and they go 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:21.269
 shrinking and it was the point of mine that I 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.770
 I wanted to know why and angelo dandy me 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.070
 he clarified it I put the problems of mine 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.650
 and he knew how to answer what it was that 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.810
 he made me change then from the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.660
 training point of view like 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.900
 we look for strength we work in what 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.040
 what the general concept of boxing 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.690
 We must perform from 0 to 12 in 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.290
 example of which championship fights 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.670
 global training periods are 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:56.630
 of 12 weeks not less not less than six 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.610
 weeks up to 12 weeks s of the period 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.710
 of a training what periods 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.370
 workouts in the amateur are three 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.740
 months six months a year four years 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.270
 it's called the four years and but 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.100
 good for her is going to talk a 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.310
 little more than the specific because 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.120
 changed my concepts the concept 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.600
 of the glove sparring or cuba 22 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.550
 things that I would give that many 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.620
 Cuban trainers still want her 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.140
 keep thinking is the system 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.660
 Cuban training to the professional there 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.510
 is where 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.020
 that one would be logical training for 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.250
 intervals and number two the work of 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.000
 the sparring 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.590
 they in Cuba are trying to use more 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.590
 what the combat school 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.200
 and a little bit softer a little bit more 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.610
 coordinated but already in the professional 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.390
 work individual work work 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.600
 individual and space the spaces are 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.120
 model the spaces are modeled 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.740
 agree to the contrary that we are going to have 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.050
 They are the famous school of combat that 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.310
 Cuban assets that were here and they 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.100
 they like in the professional in the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.070
 Professional all there is not a single use 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.329
 Cuban professional here that we have not 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.549
 talked about that but from the school of 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.169
 combat you as a coach takes like 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.450
 coach 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.400
 I was lucky that I give a lot to that 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.160
 great lord who is now in heaven 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.110
 and you should be hearing me change the 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.640
 combat school mentality the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.700
 combat school 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.390
 good because it develops you technically 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.370
 to a danger 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.560
 but already when we are 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.470
 getting into what is that we have to 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.760
 look for the performance of that fighter in 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.360
 the fight and the concept changes 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.750
 because if you 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.939
 dt modify the technical patterns of what 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.099
 better to the technical patterns but from 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:03.740
 the offensive point of view of what 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.990
 it diminishes because it creates you as 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:11.120
 we say in boxing here we 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.680
 exposes law if it puts you in play because 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.650
 it's already used to you 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.270
 they have one already and the other and I can 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.490
 make him the only Cuban coach 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.560
 that does not agree with the curve of 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.500
 combat and I say that the school of 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.240
 combat is for Cuba for the amateur the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.729
 combat school is not for the 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.110
 professional me and more do I say that 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.810
 that's what 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.510
 I've been through more than 20 years 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.950
 92 to date are 22 years that I have already 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.950
 of the professional business
