good or bad and I believe that that's

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.579 
good or bad and I believe that that's
true<00:06:19.809> with<00:06:19.990> art<00:06:20.289> and<00:06:22.259> transcending<00:06:23.259> even<00:06:23.469> this

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:23.589 
true with art and transcending even this

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.040 
true with art and transcending even this
notion<00:06:23.889> of<00:06:24.159> good<00:06:24.339> or<00:06:24.460> bad<00:06:24.639> it<00:06:24.909> is<00:06:25.089> a<00:06:25.300> power<00:06:25.599> and

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
notion of good or bad it is a power and

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.110 
notion of good or bad it is a power and
so<00:06:26.919> when<00:06:27.399> people<00:06:27.639> want<00:06:28.120> to<00:06:28.539> express<00:06:29.909> the<00:06:30.909> need

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
so when people want to express the need

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.550 
so when people want to express the need
for<00:06:31.389> liberty<00:06:31.839> I<00:06:32.110> think<00:06:32.860> that<00:06:33.219> art<00:06:33.550> can<00:06:33.669> be<00:06:33.939> a

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
for liberty I think that art can be a

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.519 
for liberty I think that art can be a
most<00:06:35.560> sublime<00:06:36.039> tool<00:06:36.610> because<00:06:37.539> it<00:06:37.839> speaks<00:06:38.199> in

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:38.529 
most sublime tool because it speaks in

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.719 
most sublime tool because it speaks in
in<00:06:39.039> a<00:06:39.430> language<00:06:39.699> that<00:06:39.999> can<00:06:40.749> be<00:06:40.810> visually<00:06:41.729> read
