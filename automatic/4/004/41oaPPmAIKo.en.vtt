against cloudy and hopefully it's going

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.170 
against cloudy and hopefully it's going
to<00:02:23.360> open<00:02:23.510> up<00:02:23.810> some<00:02:24.850> improvisational<00:02:25.850> ideas

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
to open up some improvisational ideas

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.220 
to open up some improvisational ideas
for<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:27.320> I'm<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.160> maybe<00:02:28.959> see<00:02:29.959> how

for you so I'm going to maybe see how
well<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.440> can<00:02:30.590> do<00:02:30.860> with<00:02:31.040> these<00:02:31.190> ideas

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.300 

so<00:02:53.820> basically<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.270> just<00:02:54.570> got<00:02:54.720> those<00:02:54.870> ideas<00:02:55.320> from

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
so basically I just got those ideas from

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.550 
so basically I just got those ideas from
really<00:02:56.940> understanding<00:02:57.600> how<00:02:58.170> these<00:02:58.350> rhythms

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
really understanding how these rhythms

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.950
