we<00:00:31.899> done<00:00:32.380> a<00:00:32.410> bit<00:00:32.619> of<00:00:32.649> research<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:33.219> we<00:00:33.280> found

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
we done a bit of research and we found

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.069 
we done a bit of research and we found
this<00:00:33.579> follow<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.059> best<00:00:34.450> product<00:00:34.840> on<00:00:34.930> the

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
this follow the best product on the

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.650 
this follow the best product on the
market<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:36.399> good<00:00:36.580> like<00:00:36.670> a<00:00:36.730> conventional<00:00:37.360> bus

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
market it's good like a conventional bus

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.350 
market it's good like a conventional bus
with<00:00:38.230> a<00:00:38.260> rear-engine<00:00:38.880> traditional<00:00:39.880> low<00:00:40.030> floor

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
with a rear-engine traditional low floor

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.420 
with a rear-engine traditional low floor
entry<00:00:40.810> we<00:00:41.680> like<00:00:41.830> it<00:00:41.950> because<00:00:42.010> it's<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.280> bit

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
entry we like it because it's a bit

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.970 
entry we like it because it's a bit
narrow<00:00:42.610> as<00:00:42.880> well<00:00:43.030> around<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.450> 2.44<00:00:44.410> being<00:00:44.860> a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
narrow as well around the 2.44 being a

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.770 
narrow as well around the 2.44 being a
narrower<00:00:45.310> state<00:00:45.700> we<00:00:45.970> get<00:00:46.090> cars<00:00:46.390> parked<00:00:46.720> on

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
narrower state we get cars parked on

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.510 
narrower state we get cars parked on
either<00:00:46.930> side<00:00:47.290> we're<00:00:48.010> trying<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.250> squeeze

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
either side we're trying to squeeze

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.729 
either side we're trying to squeeze
through<00:00:48.730> so<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.360> narrow<00:00:49.540> bus<00:00:49.870> it's<00:00:50.230> a<00:00:50.350> nine

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
through so the narrow bus it's a nine

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.680 
through so the narrow bus it's a nine
point<00:00:51.070> seven<00:00:51.610> meter<00:00:51.880> bus<00:00:52.090> and<00:00:52.360> we<00:00:52.480> thought

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
point seven meter bus and we thought

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.180 
point seven meter bus and we thought
that<00:00:52.900> would<00:00:53.020> be<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.260> right<00:00:53.380> bus<00:00:53.620> for<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.890> area

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
that would be the right bus for the area

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.440 
that would be the right bus for the area
we've<00:00:54.370> done<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.520> few<00:00:54.730> trial<00:00:55.030> runs<00:00:55.239> in<00:00:55.360> this

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
we've done a few trial runs in this

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.300 
we've done a few trial runs in this
working<00:00:55.630> out<00:00:55.780> really<00:00:55.930> well<00:00:56.200> and<00:00:56.920> why<00:00:57.130> do<00:00:57.190> you

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
working out really well and why do you

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.130 
working out really well and why do you
like<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.610> engine<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.030> rear<00:00:58.060> all<00:00:58.870> of<00:00:59.050> our

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
like the engine in the rear all of our

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.139 
like the engine in the rear all of our
route<00:00:59.320> service<00:00:59.500> buses<00:00:59.950> are<00:01:00.070> all<00:01:00.220> rear-engine

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
route service buses are all rear-engine

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.330 
route service buses are all rear-engine
buses<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:01.780> gives<00:01:02.020> us<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.200> better<00:01:02.470> entry<00:01:02.800> for<00:01:03.250> the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
buses it gives us a better entry for the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.249 
buses it gives us a better entry for the
wheelchair<00:01:03.670> accessibility<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.570> across<00:01:05.110> the

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
wheelchair accessibility and across the

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.230 
wheelchair accessibility and across the
front<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.649> it's<00:01:06.460> easier<00:01:06.790> for<00:01:06.820> all<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.119> our

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
front and it's easier for all of our

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.550 
front and it's easier for all of our
drivers<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.720> go<00:01:07.840> from<00:01:08.020> one<00:01:08.140> bus<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.469> another

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
drivers to go from one bus to another

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.590 
drivers to go from one bus to another
bus<00:01:08.859> another<00:01:09.130> bus<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.310> having<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.759> fun<00:01:10.299> engine
