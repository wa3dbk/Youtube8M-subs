00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.290
I am Herman Arendsen, 69 years old and my whole life, as long as I can remember I have

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.060
been working on cars.
In the early 60’s, every 18-19 year old

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.869
only dreamt of Minis and Mini Coopers.
Next to that, in those days Mini was very

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.860
successful in several Classic rallies, like
rally Monte Carlo which was won by a Mini

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.880
so the first car I bought was Mini.
Since then I remained interested and I have

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.640
been driving English cars ever since.
My interest in vintage cars began once I started

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.860
worshipping Jaguars.
In the sixties, a Jaguar was a car that was

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.690
absolutely unattainable for me. However since
my visit to the 1000 km of the Nurnburgring,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.070
which I went to on my moped, and seeing Mike
Hillwood driving away in his e-type series 1,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 I intended to buy a Jaguar once in my life.
Well, that’s what happened. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:27.360
I never lost my interest for an XK and during a holiday
in America in 1979, we found an XK 120 Roadster

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.000
on the side of the road. We bought the car
for a price that was still reasonable in those

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.700
days, shipped it to Holland and then started
restoring in myself, apart from the engine,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.980
which also needed a necessary overhaul.
Later, all I did was refining the car. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.840
Next to restoring and a good result, it was important
to me to drive the car.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.760
Even today, driving an XK is very special
because it is easy to keep up with modern

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.410
traffic, cruising at 130, 140 km/h
We have done many trips with the car, to the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.880
24 Hours of Le Mans but we also went on holyday
to Italy, Norway and Hungary and the car has

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.920
never let us down.
It is a car that has always been well maintained

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.820
and until today, the car gives me great pleasure.
Actually, the car has become part of the family

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.800
Also the total experience and the purchase,
it is a car that I had read a lot about, also

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.150
about the early fifties and that well known
drivers like Stirling Moss drove these cars.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.150
I have always been passionate about the atmosphere
around the car and the funny thing is that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.980
many racing aspects can be found in this car.
The road handling, the power, the agility,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.200
this are all aspects of the car that prove
that, in the fifties, they were ahead of their time.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.700
Meanwhile, the car has become a part of our

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.700
family and is inextricably linked with enjoyable
trips in the past and in the future.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:17.479
Apart from its design and the driving qualities,
the car has an exceptional modern sports car

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.140
performance. This allows you to drive the
car it has been made for!

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.710
Every mile driving the car is still a pleasure
and to me and spring break is still a very

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.100
special moment in time. When the winter salt
is off the roads, my first thought is taking

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.989
the XK for a ride.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.320
In England it used to be a custom amongst drivers who were going to race with an XK
120 to rub the nose of the jaguar,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.200
 this seemed to bring good luck.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:04.920
This is the famous Jaguar XK engine with adisplacement of 3.4 liter, 180 BHP and equipped
with two double SU carburetors. The engine

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.720
has been overhauled an a few years ago, the
head gasket has been replaced. That’s about

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.360
all that has been done to the engine in the
past thirty years.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.060
The funny thing about the XK 120 is that it
has been developed for testing the engine.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.690
Right after WWll Jaguar had developed this
six in line engine and was planned to fit

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:34.570
the Mark 4 and 5. To test the engine, a light
sports car has been developed.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.160
The design and development of the car took
4 to 5 years and in 1948 the car was introduced

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.120
at the Earls Court Motorshow in England. When
the car turned out to be a great success,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.660
it was in production for six years without
any changes made.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:03.460
When I bought the car in 1979, it was extremely
difficult to get hold of pars. The parts that

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.620
were available were mostly worn and rusty.
Nowadays, many essential parts are reproduced again. 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.780
That keeps this piece of heritage on
the road and I am pretty sure that these cars

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.820
will give much driving pleasure for many more
decades.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.980
After the car arrived in the Netherlands,
we found more papers regarding this car under

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:36.680
the floor mat. One of these papers was the
bill of sale which was issued in June 54.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.090
It also said that that there was a witness
during the sale.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.740
What was even more special was the envelope
from Jaguar Cars Coventry which I found in

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:56.780
the boot with the shipping papers. These state
that on 26 March 1954, five XK 120 Roadsters

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:05.660
were shipped by the steamer “Korea” and
arrived in the harbor of Seattle in England.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.400
This is, of course an extraordinary item to
keep.
