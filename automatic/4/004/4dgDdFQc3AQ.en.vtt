00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello everyone today because I bring you the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.620
 coverage and monday results 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.349
 raw night of July 27, 2015 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.780
 the show was very solid with good fights 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.519
 but I really expected a little more 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.519
 saying this we started 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.460
 good raw was carried out from the city 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.680
 oklahoma raw starts with the authority in 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.859
 the ring specifically with set rollins 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.829
 triple h and stephanie they talk about 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.629
 his plans to control ww and the by 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.360
 that rollins is one of the biggest 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.190
 champions until jones inah enters and 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.800
 interrupts the authority who 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.230
 the joke is immediately annoyed 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.839
 that after talking about cooking I do not know 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.210
 compare with rollins etcetera triple h 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.460
 announces a fight between them in the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.340
 main event of the night where you play 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.379
 the title of the usa the authority is going 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 while a confused one remains in the 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.010
 ring 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.140
 well we started with the first fight of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 the night where the big show is 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.790
 confronts dyn ambros the fight had 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.310
 enough action and movements very 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.650
 showy but I did not like it very much 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.360
 ship or combat in addition to that the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.450
 himself was at the table of the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.700
 commentators but the ww it seemed that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.369
 I wanted to form a rivalry between show and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.369
 ambrós the fight had a condition between 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.260
 both besides that the ww was trying 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.390
 give combats that were given for the first 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.790
 something that did not call me much the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.280
 attention but the combat worked 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.890
 ends by count of 10 because I 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.500
 I do not think ambrós after a haul 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.990
 suicidal after the combat show continues 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.759
 punishing ambrós and even tries to 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 to cross it through the containment barrier 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.210
 at the end the brou is removed and show 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210
 lie down 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.660
 now we are going directly to the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.150
 second fight of the night where 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.280
 neville was facing fandango the 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.740
 fight was quick as all of 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.960
 fandango where mostly neville was 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.390
 the absolute dominator and then I get 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.930
 same neville defeats fandango with his 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.759
 already known aerial move king darrow 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.830
 after the fight star dust appeared 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.810
 on the tee tyrone talking about the heroes 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.150
 and its acceptance and well I think that 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.230
 neville will have a submersion fight 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.230
 against this light 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.370
 alright now let's go to the next 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.520
 fight where page faced the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.100
 boss already know that the combat in my 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.490
 opinion was very solid was not the other 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.200
 world but I really liked the ww if 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.570
 wants to make a revolution in this 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.480
 division and specifically speaking itself 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.090
 the native divas of nx t are seen more 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.160
 strong than those of the main roster 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.440
 page and sasha were raffled with a technique 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.570
 and rudeness on the part of both being 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.910
 beautiful and dangerous x of d 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.280
 at the end sasha has an attack to page 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.860
 with your auction or the well-known key of your 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.370
 mission the cross page and so sasha it 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.370
 take the victory 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.500
 now we 're going with the fourth fight of 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.110
 the night where the killers are 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.390
 they faced the good fighters 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.210
 combat of couples although I do not understand the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.100
 why now the ww decides to use the 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.500
 killers in this rivalry but 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.290
 following with the combat it was actually 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.930
 very agile with a couple simplicity fits 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.330
 say that the prime time players were 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.460
 on the commentators' table at the end 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.410
 he leaves the new day with a sign that 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.920
 points to coffee as the mega dad of 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.320
 year to annoy so many the ww tag 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.480
 team champions get upset and almost leave 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.490
 to hands the attention goes 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.530
 completely from combat until 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.920
 we see Calixtus covering one of the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.920
 killers 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.610
 well now we're going to another fight 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.550
 divas and this time charlotte and becky lynch 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.920
 they faced alice fox and anita and 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.350
 candle the fight was fast although it 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.150
 He could see many things and more from 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.910
 Becky Lynch who makes her stand out 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.860
 much charlotte himself fumigated to 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.440
 nicky showing that it can be a 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.940
 challenging not too far in the end when 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.010
 Alice was looking for the failed ping 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.080
 surprisingly becky reverts with a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.080
 amber to make fox surrender 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.600
 now if we go to the penultimate fight 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.210
 night where the viper randy 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.550
 orton was facing kevin owens the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.500
 I really liked the fight, not at the level that I 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.479
 I was waiting but I do not think it was seen 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.330
 a lot for the time and the damn 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.060
 commercials really the end was this 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.510
 when randy already had the fight between his 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.580
 hands 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.380
 we kept coming and kicked the viper 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.060
 for which orton wins by 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.490
 disqualification due to 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.550
 foreign interference of james after 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.710
 when owens and séamus had cornered 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.840
 to orton césar or arrives and attacks both 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.419
 then Owens attacks him with a pop-up 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.900
 power pump for which the giles are going 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.900
 happy 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.190
 and now we go to the main event where 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.220
 the championship of the 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.490
 usa between john china and the champion of the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.560
 ww set rollins the combat was very 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.260
 solid and colorful and above all very 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.210
 surprising the combat was the best of 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.520
 the night the quality in both was done 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.010
 latent and the portentous prestige of 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.410
 both championships was also a fight 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.780
 very good that showed the best of both 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.060
 and from which we could say that it would be 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.300
 in anticipation of a possible combat for 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.910
 its 2015 version but really the end 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.729
 ruined everything because already when rollins 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.880
 had asina if you do not apply your st efe and 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.830
 yields in nearly three seconds champion 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.700
 I honestly would have lost rollins by 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.220
 three account 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.710
 but to surrender it and to surrender in less than 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.960
 three seconds was something stupid but 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.880
 good so ends raw slogan 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.990
 bleeding from the nose and being a champion 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.990
 of the USA 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.780
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.360
 before leaving I send greetings to hello I am 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.820
 skip since he asked me for greetings I send him 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.610
 greetings to richi gamer because he asked me 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.190
 Greetings and finally I send greetings to 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.710
 juan hernández and lucas chaparro both 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.139
 They asked me for greetings but well I hope 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.449
 that you liked the video said this 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.449
 we see you have a great time
