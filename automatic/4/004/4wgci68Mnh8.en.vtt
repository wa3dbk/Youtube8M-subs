let you use the razer kraken for the
xbox<00:03:20.950> one<00:03:21.070> with<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.940> pc<00:03:22.480> with<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.050> obviously

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
xbox one with a pc with the obviously

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.320 
xbox one with a pc with the obviously
then<00:03:23.530> what<00:03:23.650> phone<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.160> headphone<00:03:24.520> jacks<00:03:24.880> and

then what phone and headphone jacks and
I<00:03:25.780> actually<00:03:25.900> found<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.350> why<00:03:26.650> they<00:03:26.860> include

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
I actually found that why they include

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.180 
I actually found that why they include
the<00:03:27.430> USB<00:03:27.880> micro<00:03:28.660> USB<00:03:29.230> cable<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.830> because<00:03:30.100> you

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
the USB micro USB cable is because you

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.560 
the USB micro USB cable is because you
actually<00:03:30.340> need<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:30.700> update<00:03:30.820> your<00:03:31.150> controller

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
actually need to update your controller

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.230 
actually need to update your controller
before<00:03:31.930> using<00:03:32.500> this<00:03:32.800> headset<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.880> now<00:03:34.030> that's

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
before using this headset so now that's

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.520 
before using this headset so now that's
cleared<00:03:34.570> up<00:03:34.660> we<00:03:34.840> can<00:03:34.990> take<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> look<00:03:35.320> at<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
cleared up we can take a look at the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.290 
cleared up we can take a look at the
actual<00:03:35.680> stereo<00:03:36.280> headset<00:03:36.670> adapter<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:37.180> is

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
actual stereo headset adapter that is

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.240 
actual stereo headset adapter that is
provided<00:03:37.870> by<00:03:37.990> razer<00:03:38.320> with<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.770> headset<00:03:39.130> so

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
provided by razer with this headset so

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.590 
provided by razer with this headset so
as<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.460> can<00:03:39.580> see<00:03:39.670> it's<00:03:39.820> very<00:03:39.850> very<00:03:40.150> similar<00:03:40.390> to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
as you can see it's very very similar to

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.540 
as you can see it's very very similar to
microsoft's<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.440> little<00:03:41.950> bit<00:03:42.070> skinnier<00:03:42.460> in

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
microsoft's a little bit skinnier in

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.730 
microsoft's a little bit skinnier in
design<00:03:43.000> but<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.020> same<00:03:44.200> kind<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.530> concept

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
design but the same kind of concept

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.560 
design but the same kind of concept
nonetheless<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:46.150> then<00:03:46.450> obviously

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
nonetheless and then obviously

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.570 
nonetheless and then obviously
underneath<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.380> have<00:03:47.440> your<00:03:47.650> 3.5<00:03:48.280> jack

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
underneath that you have your 3.5 jack

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.860 
underneath that you have your 3.5 jack
here<00:03:48.820> which<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.150> connect<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.540> actual

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
here which you connect the actual

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.750 
here which you connect the actual
headset<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:51.010> let's<00:03:51.280> move<00:03:51.400> on<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:51.580> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
headset to so let's move on to the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.010 
headset to so let's move on to the
actual<00:03:51.880> headset<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:52.510> as<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.690> can<00:03:52.780> see<00:03:52.840> it

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
actual headset so as you can see it

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.480 
actual headset so as you can see it
comes<00:03:53.170> with<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.380> very<00:03:53.500> nice<00:03:53.710> green<00:03:54.010> cape<00:03:54.280> or

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
comes with a very nice green cape or

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.920 
comes with a very nice green cape or
actually<00:03:54.880> really<00:03:55.150> do<00:03:55.300> like<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.630> fact<00:03:55.660> they

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
actually really do like the fact they

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.140 
actually really do like the fact they
actually<00:03:55.960> sent<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:56.980> cable<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.550> razor<00:03:57.790> color

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
actually sent a cable the razor color

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.050 
actually sent a cable the razor color
makes<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.960> actual<00:03:59.230> headset<00:03:59.620> pop<00:03:59.920> as<00:04:00.220> well<00:04:00.430> as

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
makes the actual headset pop as well as

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.730 
makes the actual headset pop as well as
far<00:04:01.270> as<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.450> actual<00:04:01.570> headset<00:04:01.990> goes<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.440> seems

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
far as the actual headset goes it seems

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.500 
far as the actual headset goes it seems
a<00:04:02.800> little<00:04:02.860> bit<00:04:03.040> skinnier<00:04:03.490> than<00:04:03.610> Razer<00:04:03.970> Krakens

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
a little bit skinnier than Razer Krakens

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.170 
a little bit skinnier than Razer Krakens
usually<00:04:05.320> feel<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:06.280> also<00:04:06.400> feels<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:07.000> lot

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
usually feel and it also feels a lot

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.199 
usually feel and it also feels a lot
lighter<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:08.410> actual<00:04:08.680> microphone<00:04:09.100> seems<00:04:10.090> a

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
lighter the actual microphone seems a

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.810 
lighter the actual microphone seems a
lot<00:04:10.360> different<00:04:10.750> as<00:04:10.810> well<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.610> previous<00:04:12.610> Razer

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
lot different as well to previous Razer

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.860 
lot different as well to previous Razer
Kraken<00:04:13.060> but<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.390> don't<00:04:13.510> know<00:04:13.570> whether<00:04:13.690> that's

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
Kraken but I don't know whether that's

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.720 
Kraken but I don't know whether that's
because<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.560> actual<00:04:14.830> headset<00:04:15.250> feels<00:04:15.550> a

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
because the actual headset feels a

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.949 
because the actual headset feels a
little<00:04:15.790> bit<00:04:15.970> smaller<00:04:16.270> and<00:04:16.510> lighter<00:04:16.720> and

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
little bit smaller and lighter and

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.720 
little bit smaller and lighter and
skinnier<00:04:17.350> as<00:04:17.470> well<00:04:17.680> as<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.430> see<00:04:18.609> it

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
skinnier as well as you can see it

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.640 
skinnier as well as you can see it
clicks<00:04:19.030> down<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.810> obviously<00:04:20.109> clicks<00:04:20.410> back

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
clicks down and obviously clicks back

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.680 
clicks down and obviously clicks back
into<00:04:20.950> place<00:04:21.160> as<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.940> can<00:04:22.030> see<00:04:22.210> on<00:04:22.360> both<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.630> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
into place as you can see on both of the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.200 
into place as you can see on both of the
ear<00:04:22.810> cups<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.169> do<00:04:23.290> have<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.590> Razer<00:04:23.830> logo<00:04:24.210> I'm

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
ear cups you do have the Razer logo I'm

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.290 
ear cups you do have the Razer logo I'm
not<00:04:25.330> sure<00:04:25.510> don't<00:04:25.840> think<00:04:26.050> these

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
not sure don't think these

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.960 
not sure don't think these
LEDs<00:04:26.659> but<00:04:26.990> we'll<00:04:27.259> we'll<00:04:27.680> see<00:04:28.280> I'd<00:04:28.550> imagine

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
LEDs but we'll we'll see I'd imagine

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.760 
LEDs but we'll we'll see I'd imagine
maybe<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.389> might<00:04:29.509> be<00:04:29.659> maybe<00:04:29.840> I'm<00:04:30.110> not<00:04:30.289> too<00:04:30.560> sure

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
maybe it might be maybe I'm not too sure

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.619 
maybe it might be maybe I'm not too sure
obviously<00:04:31.310> on<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:31.759> top<00:04:31.970> obviously<00:04:32.419> you<00:04:32.509> have

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629 
obviously on the top obviously you have

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.390 
obviously on the top obviously you have
the<00:04:32.720> Razer<00:04:32.960> logo<00:04:33.229> it's<00:04:33.560> not<00:04:33.710> green<00:04:33.979> it's<00:04:34.009> just

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
the Razer logo it's not green it's just

the Razer logo it's not green it's just
looking<00:04:34.580> broided<00:04:35.090> in<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.330> actual<00:04:35.690> plastic<00:04:37.030> on

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
looking broided in the actual plastic on

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.249 
looking broided in the actual plastic on
the<00:04:38.120> other<00:04:38.240> side<00:04:38.449> obviously<00:04:38.599> Razer<00:04:38.990> logo

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
again got this nice mesh pattern around

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.589 
again got this nice mesh pattern around
the<00:04:42.289> sides<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:43.129> actual<00:04:43.400> ear<00:04:43.550> cups<00:04:43.849> as<00:04:44.180> well<00:04:44.419> or

the sides the actual ear cups as well or

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.480 
the sides the actual ear cups as well or
a<00:04:44.629> lot<00:04:44.810> more<00:04:44.840> stiff<00:04:45.440> compared<00:04:45.889> to<00:04:46.039> previous

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
a lot more stiff compared to previous
