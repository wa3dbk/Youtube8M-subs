00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.699
 this is a vw golf 7 115 hp four doors 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.130
 automatic transmission 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 sounds exciting or well I'm not 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.789
 sure if I'm looking forward to it 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.340
 For one thing, it's not mine 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.019
 car and on the other hand how to easily 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 recognize these wonderful stickers 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.250
 it is not diesel or gasoline 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.829
 but really a pure electric car 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 no hybrid with range extender or 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.700
 Otherwise, here vw has 300 kilograms 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.460
 built-in batteries 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.010
 thus weighs the car 15 tons has 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.950
 nevertheless only 115 ps power 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.140
 I wonder what vw thought 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.739
 has such a heavy car with so little 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.930
 power 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.170
 I do not think that this car is one 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.489
 good alternative to the old petroleum 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.160
 can represent destroyer 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.899
 but i will give my chance and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.589
 Just go and I'll find 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.659
 every case 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.080
 he looks much better than one 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080
 gti 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.869
 The interior really does not have any 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.369
 big surprises except that he 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 really good as standard 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.780
 On the one hand, we have that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.069
 great multimedia navigation system for 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.560
 others there for example many 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.289
 It's the same thing with a golf gti 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.939
 is everything if the red is here 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.890
 blue that starts at the front of the grill and 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.530
 runs through the entire interior 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.299
 if I did not know that one 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.729
 Electric car I would probably do it 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.469
 do not even notice and that's why I drive 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.720
 Now just go watch out 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.720
 impress insanity 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.140
 really impressive how quiet this 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.420
 car is heard, of course, noises 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.610
 little wind noise rolling noise 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.220
 right now with wind wheels though 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:11.140
 otherwise absolute silence 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.600
 even if you step on the gas he will 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.420
 not really loud one hears the engine 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.040
 not one hears the tires we report 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.230
 are now standing at a red traffic light and 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.640
 will pass through the accelerator pedal 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.480
 as soon as it turns green again look what 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.480
 the e-golf can 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.910
 my dear scholli and already 65 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.730
 on the tacho from 0 to 60 he needs 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.810
 just under five seconds in the city 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.280
 really an unbeatable quality though 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.240
 you somehow drive a gap rhine 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.390
 would like or so why a car was 15 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.180
 Tons weighs and only 115 ps has so much 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.340
 may need to push one 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.960
 short explanation a normal one 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.200
 combustion engine has an approximate 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.420
 Speed ​​range from zero to 5000 6000 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.740
 7000 or more turns at each 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.260
 He has different degrees of revolution 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.160
 this mood turns into curve 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.050
 first 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.430
 the higher the engine turns sometime 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.320
 she reaches her highest point and then 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.670
 Unfortunately it falls off again 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.800
 balance torques differences 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.080
 Portmann a gear which one to the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.460
 motor then screwed to one switches the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.630
 things so the car depending on 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.270
 speed always in the optimum 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.910
 speed range is the e golf 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.710
 however, has an electric motor and thus 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.720
 the same with every turn 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.820
 torque and that's enough for him 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.410
 only gangway 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.780
 the torque is a normal car 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.580
 only in the upper speed range after 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.410
 at the beginning and after switching on the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.600
 Different things has to do with the ego 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.730
 I want to be there from the beginning 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.550
 torque this is a polo gti to 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.470
 example has 250 newton meters at one 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.770
 single point in his joined bandages 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.080
 the e golf r 270 newton meters to each 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.959
 time and that's why this feels 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.750
 car not at all after 115 ps 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.900
 On the contrary, the golf looks agile 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.459
 alive yes downright sporty if one 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.370
 the traction control switches off 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.459
 actually all 115 horses and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.750
 270 newton meters from turn 1 on the 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.520
 front wheels let go 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.989
 the landing gear he largely from 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.930
 normal golf sees 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.340
 underlines this dynamic clearly 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.500
 maybe the golf will notice many 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.240
 boring and again it looks like it 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.430
 That is precisely this conventionality 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.530
 make this car the most successful 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.150
 his class has made a place 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.150
 for five people and luggage 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.710
 you often place the competition of renault 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.420
 and bmw you just have to say that at 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.760
 made compromises to this car sap 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.640
 and then golf is not berlin 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.500
 Unfortunately, the fun is after a maximum of 190 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.450
 miles you want to continue 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.400
 you have to drive it for eight hours 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.710
 load or you find one 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.290
 fast charging station then it's refueling 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.510
 done so well in 30 minutes 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.400
 but is there a real disadvantage 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.650
 if you want to park a sideways that 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.210
 that is sometimes very difficult with 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.920
 For example, there are some risks involved 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.530
 with a car what is behind it 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.540
 I like to open the door 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.540
 somehow already thousands look there 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:23.660
 Something is when I do that drives 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:25.220
 the golf no longer why that me 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.780
 just wanted to see if behind me 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.640
 a free yes not so that somehow 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.860
 a child or so has opened the door 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.170
 No, I wanted to make sure once 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.060
 because it's free to summarize 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.260
 It is said that this car is the future 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.580
 if you can handle the thing with the man 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.440
 Forgets or not 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.670
 vw is in my opinion with the e 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.530
 Golf in the right direction 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.630
 It is not a pure electric car 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.180
 hybrid or something that makes you feel 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.460
 is ecologically on the way because 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.520
 a hybrid has an internal combustion engine 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.390
 still using fossil fuels 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.610
 Tesla has to be driven for example 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.770
 has cars with ranges of over 500 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.150
 kilometers rising but tesla 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.460
 for example, there is no competition 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.490
 want to go to choose in-house 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.640
 of course gasoline and diesel continue 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.220
 and tuaregs and fans and so on 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.860
 sell electric vehicles need 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.200
 just get rid of it as an alternative and for that 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.169
 the manufacturers need new ones 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.880
 researching technologies and just about 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.770
 jump your own shadow and more 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.620
 install batteries in this thing if 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.590
 tesla 2017 his model 3 brings out something 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.530
 approximately in the price range of the golf 7 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.340
 will lie namely at 35,000 euros then 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.380
 This golf with 190 km has no maximum 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.070
 chance someday it will not be petroleum 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.639
 give more 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.740
 and then the golf comes into play 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.900
 shows us that electromobility in the 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.729
 arrived today and as far as possible 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.759
 but is suitable for everyday use at the end of the 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.620
 day makes this car just as fun 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.539
 a surprised green at the gas pedal 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.400
 if you pass the astonished 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.960
 faces of people looks in theirs 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.060
 mind an electric car like one 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.800
 Spaceship with wheels looks like it 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.599
 a smile on your face 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.180
 every time the gasoline prices rise 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:11.669
 because it is ecologically clean and because 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.279
 it's just a completely normal car 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:16.999
 just a golf above average 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.999
 average
