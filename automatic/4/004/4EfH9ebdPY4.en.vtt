00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.459
 let's see now what it means 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.690
 round and truncate the numbers in this 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.750
 case in a few decimals 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.550
 round what they will ask us first 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.680
 everything we are going to identify a number like 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.849
 the as seen in the first in the first 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.419
 part of the agenda 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.369
 we had the 15 678 identify each 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.289
 one of the parties the first number the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.090
 first digit are the tenths the second 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.430
 they are the before and the last one is not 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.649
 wait in this case the thousandths and so 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.620
 we would be putting forth 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.379
 ten thousandths thousandth ball does not enter 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.960
 a lot of detail simply sometimes the 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.350
 ask us to redunde we have a number to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.109
 a certain position for example if 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.179
 they asked us to round a number to the 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.190
 thousandths means that I would have 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.550
 a part 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.620
 in strip and then in the decimal part 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.509
 would have a figure two figures three figures 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.009
 I do not care if there's something else behind me 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.229
 what I will look for is that I only remain 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.340
 three figures since they prevent rounding to 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.789
 the thousandths 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.430
 therefore in this case the 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:21.490
 number that you have as an example since 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.250
 the number is already there until the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.250
 thousandths so there was nothing here 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.229
 in the next case we will now see what 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.510
 which means to really round 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.680
 we have the case that they ask us to 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.619
 reach the hundredths 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.190
 therefore we will look for a number that 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.720
 have a whole part the comma and one and 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.340
 two figures since they ask us to 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.500
 let's get to the hundredths that that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.190
 second figure in the previous case 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.680
 we had the 1 5,6 78 here we have 3 there 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.690
 one that we must eliminate that would be the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.020
 thousandths 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.280
 how do we eliminate this figure what 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.060
 we will do will be to look if it is greater or lesser 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.060
 what 5 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:16.430
 if the figure is greater than 5 what I will do 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:20.840
 will add one more figure in this case to 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.360
 the hundredths and I will eliminate you in the case 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.100
 that they were less than 5 what I will do 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.250
 it will simply be to eliminate it 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:35.100
 in this case 156 and now that the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.140
 8 is greater than 5 minor in this case is 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 greater than 5 therefore I will 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.320
 disappear and here add 18 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.990
 this because it happens let's see here in the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:55.600
 example let's say we have the scale 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:58.150
 in this case 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and 0 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.030
 here we can if you want good 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.480
 simply what they are telling us 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.610
 is that we try to round off 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.460
 approximate the zero that we have left more 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.220
 near 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.880
 so what happens this 8 would be here 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.410
 that it's easier for me to get here or 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.180
 get to this 0 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.160
 then here what we see that is not 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.420
 it's easy to reach the sky above 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.820
 for this to happen here would be the degree 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.790
 zero would be a 10 therefore so that 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.110
 can we turn this 8 into 0 to 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.480
 the next figure that we will have to 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.040
 left will have to add a life in 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.290
 the case that it was another number 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.090
 small directly we will convert it into 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.620
 0 and to the simple left we would leave it 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.260
 as is 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.440
 let's take the example that we have the 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.440
 number 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.170
 let's say something so simple 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.310
 like 73 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.310
 in this case 3 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.219
 322 what happens here because if we 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.079
 they ask to round to the hundredths 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.599
 I would look again for a figure that has 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.420
 only two decimals and therefore this 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.090
 last must load melo to do it 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.910
 I'll look where the 2 is like 2 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.789
 is below 5 the easiest is 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.949
 that this 0 arrives instead of this 0 by 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:27.550
 so directly what I will do will be 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:30.520
 delete it and I will remain as a figure 7 3 2 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.289
 and that would be my answer like that 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.259
 has been my previous answer in this 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.330
 case like 8 was greater than 5 what 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:41.169
 converted to 0 eliminated and the next 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.620
 number he added a unit 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.590
 in this case we are going to in the case of passing 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.620
 from where it will make up to the tenths 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.430
 here what I will look for will be to have a part 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.950
 whole and single and only one decimal 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.480
 after the comma therefore the 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:05.290
 case of the previous exercise 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.460
 of the example we have 15 678 to do it 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.260
 we'll start with the figures from the most 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.360
 to the right possible from the most 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.950
 small let's think what happens with this 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:21.200
 figure 8 is greater than 5 yes so 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:23.770
 so much we would go to have 15 6 and as they are 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.960
 the one that five here sum of one 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.509
 but here it is not enough for me, I must continue 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.610
 moving forward so I can stay alone with 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:34.569
 a decimal so I 'll repeat the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:38.889
 exercise and I'll ask 15 like now 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:41.530
 this 8 is 25 yes and therefore to the sea 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.699
 greater than 5 directly what you see 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.569
 will add a unit and this will be my 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.059
 answer 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.830
 let's see the case for example of what place 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:06:00.470
 of 15 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:06:03.670
 of 15.67 eight days is 15.6 28 in this 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.110
 If we had taken the last number 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.020
 we look at what is closer in this 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:14.510
 case goes more to the rise of five 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:17.410
 products approaches 10 and it would be 15.6 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.410
 we would add sonority 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.210
 to the nearest hundredths and 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.340
 we eliminate the 8 but it is not enough for me 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.169
 reach a figure with an entire part 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.350
 and just one decimal so I go back to 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:34.699
 repeat the operation and in this case 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:38.689
 would have 15 comma the 3d is greater than 55 is 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:41.360
 less than 5 therefore I will stay 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:48.190
 and simply the obvious and I 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:51.340
 will be 15 6 and this would be look 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.010
 that simple in the case of trunk is 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.100
 much easier and you have to truncate not 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.920
 search if it is greater or less than 5 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.160
 simply what I will do is destroy 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:07.290
 the figures that bother me therefore 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.290
 if I want to truncate to the thousandths 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.530
 do it like that so you know a little bit about 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.430
 figures truncated from the thousandths in this 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.790
 I already had a good case 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.290
 because the number that I have already has already 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.030
 goes up to the thousandths so no 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.580
 I would do nothing 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:27.090
 in the following case yes because it happened 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:29.070
 15 678 and I the only thing I look for in this 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.040
 case is also that I only have two 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:34.530
 decimal figures so what instead 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.190
 to ask me anything directly when 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.690
 truncated 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.120
 What I do is destroy the last 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:42.720
 number that bothers me and that's it and so 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.080
 as much as answer I will have 1567 and 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.099
 finished 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:51.939
 for the tenths more of the same 15 6 7 

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:54.099
 and 8 I'm just looking for a tenth to a 

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:56.169
 number above and therefore this 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:08:00.729
 I 'm upset, this bothers me 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:02.259
 destroyed and I only have left already 15,6 it seems 

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:04.979
 rather simple you have to truncate 

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:04.979
 which is to round
