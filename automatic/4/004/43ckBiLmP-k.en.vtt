00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730 

I<00:00:00.060> have<00:00:00.359> to<00:00:00.510> do<00:00:00.659> it<00:00:00.810> like<00:00:00.989> it's<00:00:01.230> just<00:00:01.410> like<00:00:01.500> the

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
I have to do it like it's just like the

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.690 
I have to do it like it's just like the
second<00:00:02.040> they<00:00:02.100> offered<00:00:02.370> it<00:00:02.429> was<00:00:02.580> like

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
second they offered it was like

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.650 
second they offered it was like
checkmate<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:04.549> mean<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.609> think<00:00:05.640> it's<00:00:06.029> obviously

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
checkmate I mean I think it's obviously

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.259 
checkmate I mean I think it's obviously
the<00:00:06.839> first<00:00:07.250> individual<00:00:08.250> film<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.910> doesn't

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the first individual film that doesn't

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.360 
the first individual film that doesn't
have<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.450> tee<00:00:09.750> up<00:00:09.780> another<00:00:10.170> movie<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.190> be

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
have to tee up another movie it can be

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.570 
have to tee up another movie it can be
its<00:00:11.700> own<00:00:12.590> self-contained<00:00:13.590> story<00:00:13.980> which<00:00:14.429> is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
its own self-contained story which is

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.189 
its own self-contained story which is
really<00:00:14.759> exciting<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.269> means<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.960> are

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
really exciting as it means that we are

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.260 
really exciting as it means that we are
not<00:00:16.529> held<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.980> anything<00:00:17.279> other<00:00:18.060> than

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
not held to anything other than

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.810 
not held to anything other than
ourselves<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> bit<00:00:20.730> more

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
ourselves and so we can be a bit more

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.540 
ourselves and so we can be a bit more
free<00:00:21.180> bit<00:00:21.390> more<00:00:21.660> brave<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.350> what's<00:00:23.100> great<00:00:23.279> is

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
free bit more brave and what's great is

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.220 
free bit more brave and what's great is
about<00:00:23.939> everyone<00:00:24.210> at<00:00:24.330> Lucasfilm<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.930> Disney

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
about everyone at Lucasfilm and Disney

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.580 
about everyone at Lucasfilm and Disney
is<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.820> they're<00:00:26.820> encouraging<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
is that they're encouraging that and and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.660 
is that they're encouraging that and and
so<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> think<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.160> film<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.550> quite

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
so I think this film is gonna be quite

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.479 
so I think this film is gonna be quite
different<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:31.019> think<00:00:31.740> when<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.130> go<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> see

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
different and I think when you go to see

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.760 
different and I think when you go to see
it<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.640> should<00:00:32.790> expect<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.390> unexpected

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
it you should expect the unexpected

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.620 
it you should expect the unexpected
because<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
because it's not going to be like the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.860 
because it's not going to be like the
saga<00:00:36.870> movie<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.129> best<00:00:38.610> job<00:00:38.969> offer<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.750> my

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
saga movie it's the best job offer of my

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.369 
saga movie it's the best job offer of my
life<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.480> have<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.170> it's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
life and so I have to do it like it's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.720 
life and so I have to do it like it's
just<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.860> second<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.250> offered<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.579> was

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
just like the second they offered it was

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.250 
just like the second they offered it was
like<00:00:44.850> checkmate<00:00:45.239> there's<00:00:45.660> loads<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.989> words

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
like checkmate there's loads of words

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.529 
like checkmate there's loads of words
that<00:00:46.829> filmmakers<00:00:47.370> pin<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.879> say<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> describe

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that filmmakers pin to say to describe

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.319 
that filmmakers pin to say to describe
their<00:00:48.719> films<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.700> they<00:00:50.700> end<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:50.969> being<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
their films and they end up being a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.080 
their films and they end up being a
little<00:00:51.449> bit<00:00:51.570> cliched<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.370> hope<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.940> one

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
little bit cliched but hope that the one

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
little bit cliched but hope that the one
that<00:00:54.270> people<00:00:54.539> feel<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.020> ours<00:00:55.710> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that people feel when they see ours is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 
that people feel when they see ours is
that<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:58.050> very<00:00:58.140> realistic<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.609> has<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that it's very realistic it has a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.170 
that it's very realistic it has a
naturalness<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:01.170> everything<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.180> it's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
naturalness to everything and it's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.260 
naturalness to everything and it's
grounded<00:01:03.979> like<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> subject<00:01:05.790> views<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
grounded like a lot of subject views of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.520 
grounded like a lot of subject views of
what<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.400> really<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.880> war<00:01:09.530> in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
what it's like to be really in a war in

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
as well it's because of where it's set

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.969 
as well it's because of where it's set
in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> timeline<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:18.210> hope<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.530> first<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
in the timeline and you hope the first I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.200 
in the timeline and you hope the first I
was<00:01:20.130> moving<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> good<00:01:20.729> guys<00:01:20.909> were<00:01:21.090> really

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and so this is really about a time where

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.350 
and so this is really about a time where
that<00:01:25.979> black<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> white<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.939> more<00:01:26.970> grey

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
about a little bit more about the nature

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.359 
about a little bit more about the nature
of<00:01:34.500> war<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.310> takes<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:38.189> do

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of war and what it takes to to do

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.870 
of war and what it takes to to do
something<00:01:39.170> important<00:01:40.340> for<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> greater<00:01:41.640> good

something important for the greater good
and<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.930> never<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> simple<00:01:45.350> there's<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and it's never that simple there's a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.159 
and it's never that simple there's a
heavy<00:01:46.560> price<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> pay
