very very bright across a hundred degree
beam<00:01:09.659> angle<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.260> very<00:01:10.530> uniform<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.189> well

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
beam angle so very uniform as well

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
beam angle so very uniform as well
obviously<00:01:11.610> designed<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> video<00:01:12.689> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
obviously designed for the video so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.530 
obviously designed for the video so
there's<00:01:13.350> obviously<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.650> true<00:01:14.010> color<00:01:14.310> white<00:01:15.180> for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
there's obviously a true color white for

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.929 
there's obviously a true color white for
that<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.780> well<00:01:16.640> simple<00:01:17.640> operation

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
that as well simple operation

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.520 
that as well simple operation
single<00:01:20.939> button<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.299> top<00:01:21.509> holding<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.380> down

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
single button on top holding it down

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.249 
single button on top holding it down
will<00:01:22.770> activate<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> beam<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.509> sits<00:01:24.840> nice

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
will activate the beam as it sits nice

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
will activate the beam as it sits nice
and<00:01:25.290> uniform<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.150> switch

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and uniform and then you can switch

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
and uniform and then you can switch
between<00:01:27.600> different<00:01:27.930> output<00:01:28.710> levels<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.189> by

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
between different output levels just by

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.710 
between different output levels just by
pushing<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.329> switched<00:01:30.540> between

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
pushing it and it was switched between

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
pushing it and it was switched between
the<00:01:30.960> modes<00:01:32.659> it<00:01:33.659> does<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.409> light<00:01:35.130> sensor<00:01:35.369> so

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the modes it does have a light sensor so

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.160 
the modes it does have a light sensor so
if<00:01:35.820> you're<00:01:35.939> using<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.240> strobe<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.720> well<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.110> if

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
if you're using a strobe as well so if

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.510 
if you're using a strobe as well so if
you<00:01:37.229> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> take<00:01:37.619> stills<00:01:38.009> you've<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you want to take stills you've got a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
you want to take stills you've got a
strobe<00:01:38.820> set<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> outside<00:01:39.530> when<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
strobe set up on the outside when it

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.399 
strobe set up on the outside when it
recognizes<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.490> strobe<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.329> fired<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
recognizes that a strobe is fired it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.130 
recognizes that a strobe is fired it
will<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:44.100> switch<00:01:44.909> off<00:01:45.119> temporarily<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
will actually switch off temporarily and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.969 
will actually switch off temporarily and
then<00:01:46.200> come<00:01:46.560> back<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> recognizes

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
then come back on so as it recognizes

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
then come back on so as it recognizes
there's<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> light<00:01:50.430> build-up<00:01:50.850> from<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.149> strobe

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
there's a light build-up from a strobe

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.319 
there's a light build-up from a strobe
it<00:01:51.810> will<00:01:52.079> switch<00:01:52.350> off<00:01:52.560> they<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.250> that

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
it will switch off they don't get that

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.609 
it will switch off they don't get that
cross-contaminated<00:01:54.329> light<00:01:54.659> beams<00:01:57.380> also<00:01:58.380> have

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
cross-contaminated light beams also have

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.690 
cross-contaminated light beams also have
battery<00:01:59.340> status<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> back<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> three<00:02:02.250> LEDs

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
battery status on the back so three LEDs

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.389 
battery status on the back so three LEDs
so<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.380> battery<00:02:04.380> capacity<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.009> police's

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
so as the battery capacity to police's

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.590 
so as the battery capacity to police's
depletes

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
depletes

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
depletes
it<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.140> also<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.439> indicate<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.099> battery

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
it will also you indicate your battery

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.369 
it will also you indicate your battery
status<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.950> uses<00:02:11.129> a

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
status on there and then it uses a

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.770 
status on there and then it uses a
rechargeable<00:02:13.379> battery<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.690> compartment

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
rechargeable battery in the compartment

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.309 
rechargeable battery in the compartment
so<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.520> buy<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:18.090> spares<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.900> well<00:02:19.080> so

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
so you can buy this as spares as well so

swap around double o-ring protection in

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.710 
swap around double o-ring protection in
the<00:02:29.580> battery<00:02:29.790> compartment<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.510> you've<00:02:30.629> got

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the battery compartment so you've got

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.259 
the battery compartment so you've got
two<00:02:31.080> areas<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.680> provide<00:02:31.920> extra<00:02:32.160> safety<00:02:33.890> and
