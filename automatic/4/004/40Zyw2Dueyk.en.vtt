00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.709
 in this circle we combine again 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.690
 box exercises with full body exercises 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.340
 that's a very intense one about that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.320
 is not only for advanced people 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.939
 however, you can do it all a bit 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.950
 Simplify by simply stopping by 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.750
 the tempo in runterschraubt of a 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.119
 Repeat choice makes a few less 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.100
 with leaking failure 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.970
 For example, it was quite easy 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.859
 normal failure steps makes in g 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 and who has no partner for boxing 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.650
 and places to hold none 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.540
 training partner or no trainer 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.860
 just blows up like us 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.570
 to do that now is easy 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.830
 just beautiful blown in the air 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.049
 tense body and nice and fast 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.260
 work then that's just as good 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:48.269
 training okay we start with 20 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.369
 quick punches and ten hard ones 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.619
 proposals we make twice this 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.210
 routinely beat each other over 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:01:01.940
 fight and left foot is in front 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.940
 and 20 pieces less hard faster all the way 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.680
 certainly not leave alive 18 19 20 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.130
 floor most recent also right 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130
 really hard 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:38.990
 three right foot did not get through it 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.250
 second time 20 pieces fast fast 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:50.180
 fast fast fast fast right there 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:50.750
 do not leave faster with 89 20 deep 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.820
 breathe 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.820
 I count every second stroke as 1 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:05.119
 10,13 right foot with foot turn 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.640
 you do not have to put the body in that way 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:13.280
 Over lashes will be your own 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.930

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.090

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.890
 either the dealers apart 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.910

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.910

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.049
 two boxes exactly the same game the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.510
 fast fists so far a bit 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.750
 faster but not so hard here 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.129
 easy just touch there not out 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:08.060

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:31.220
 congo 10,66 77 88 99 10 10 breathing breathe 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.190
 even the default step after 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.080
 Do what you do with the arms in the front 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.660

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.500
 knee weight is 50 50 mb and jump 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.500

 land take off land take off branch still 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:16.700
 The last one was the Turk 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.650
 Bocs exercises full body exercise as I said 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.350
 very intense you can see it is as 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.540
 breathing hard does not exaggerate here 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.920
 far more in the thing itself 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.110
 that is also very advanced 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.420
 exhausting what i mean is complete 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.670
 in oxygen deficit so does piano 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.380
 if you still have power you can have one 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.610
 long break, the pulse is down again 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.730
 is and then do it all over again 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.020
 maybe a little less intense 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.290
 according to fitness level ever 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.290
 after this
