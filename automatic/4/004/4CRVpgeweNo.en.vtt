 they use to make meat 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.870
 and they also usually put artichokes and potatoes as you can see it's a very 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.150

 hugo the head of garlic 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.259
 and we are going to cut the base so that later it is easier to fight the teeth 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:41.519
 and so that it is done well inside we are going to wrap it with aluminum foil and 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.879
 we're going to put everything in the oven or the 180 degrees the tomatoes will be in the 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.559
