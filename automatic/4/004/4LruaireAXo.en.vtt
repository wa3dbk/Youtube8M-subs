this and you take your hair tied down to
where<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.100> want<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> cut<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.720> I'm<00:02:29.840> going<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.049> be

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
where you want to cut so I'm going to be

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.850 
where you want to cut so I'm going to be
cutting<00:02:30.349> like<00:02:30.709> right<00:02:31.280> here<00:02:31.519> this<00:02:31.730> time<00:02:31.970> and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
cutting like right here this time and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.860 
cutting like right here this time and
you<00:02:33.860> can<00:02:34.099> change<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:35.030> usually<00:02:35.360> take<00:02:35.720> my

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
you can change this I usually take my

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.830 
you can change this I usually take my
hair<00:02:36.080> out<00:02:36.110> after<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:36.680> port<00:02:37.099> part<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.849> do<00:02:38.750> it

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
hair out after this port part and do it

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.390 
hair out after this port part and do it
again<00:02:39.080> until<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.530> get<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.739> right<00:02:39.860> length<00:02:40.040> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
again until I get the right length and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.850 
again until I get the right length and
now<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:42.799> just<00:02:43.040> cut<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:45.019> like<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.380> said<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.799> am

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
now you just cut and like I said I am

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.990 
now you just cut and like I said I am
not<00:02:46.220> using<00:02:47.200> anything<00:02:48.200> fancy<00:02:48.859> I<00:02:49.160> bet<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.880> all

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
not using anything fancy I bet you all

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.819 
not using anything fancy I bet you all
the<00:02:50.120> people<00:02:50.359> have<00:02:50.480> licenses<00:02:51.079> to<00:02:51.260> do<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.560> or

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
the people have licenses to do this or

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.380 
the people have licenses to do this or
cringing<00:02:56.650> okay

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
cringing okay

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.420 
cringing okay
now<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.450> reason<00:02:59.840> for<00:02:59.870> this<00:03:00.109> is<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:01.069> take<00:03:01.310> it

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
now the reason for this is you take it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.020 
now the reason for this is you take it
off<00:03:01.519> again

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
off again

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.650 
off again
and<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:03.170> put<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.590> down<00:03:03.709> again<00:03:04.269> because<00:03:05.269> you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
and you put it down again because you

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.340 
and you put it down again because you
likely<00:03:06.019> cut<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.130> uneven<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.900> way<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.109> can

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
likely cut it uneven so this way you can

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.069 
likely cut it uneven so this way you can
go<00:03:09.500> back<00:03:09.709> down<00:03:10.359> you<00:03:11.359> can<00:03:11.510> check<00:03:11.690> things<00:03:11.840> out

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
go back down you can check things out

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:24.000 
go back down you can check things out
you<00:03:12.440> can<00:03:13.250> trim<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.730> off<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:13.970> little<00:03:14.269> bit

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.369 

this<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.610> really<00:03:24.760> difficult<00:03:25.330> with<00:03:26.110> bit

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
this is really difficult with bit

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.890 
this is really difficult with bit
careful

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.780 

I'm<00:03:33.409> sure<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:33.739> would<00:03:33.890> be<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:34.190> much<00:03:34.310> easier<00:03:34.370> if

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
I'm sure this would be so much easier if

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.420 
I'm sure this would be so much easier if
you<00:03:34.909> had<00:03:35.150> professional<00:03:35.989> scissors<00:03:36.319> so<00:03:36.650> if<00:03:37.010> you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
you had professional scissors so if you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:47.199 
you had professional scissors so if you
have<00:03:37.610> them<00:03:37.849> I<00:03:38.150> would<00:03:38.930> say<00:03:39.110> if<00:03:39.260> use<00:03:39.500> them<00:03:46.209> okay

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
have them I would say if use them okay

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.449 
have them I would say if use them okay
but<00:03:48.049> there's<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.319> spark<00:03:48.620> you're<00:03:48.799> cheap<00:03:49.040> like<00:03:49.250> us

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
but there's a spark you're cheap like us
