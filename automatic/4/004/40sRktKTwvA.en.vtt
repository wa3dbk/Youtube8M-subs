00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.599
 more 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.869
 Hello and welcome to the 9 2 goals Reto from Arx in this sense make you fat 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.560
 scoring opportunities 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.019
 how to go with the help of his ascension 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.409
 created a 3d text 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:26.379
 this text to order with the help of tests randomness effects rust 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.069
 changed a bit 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.169
 that's what the whole thing will look like 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.850
 but as always you can write your text 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.880
 to make it to your taste but I will do it » 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.190
 okay, you can start already first saw you make a new one 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.240
 your new file 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.540
 and managed to make a text object do not even crowed your text parts 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.150
 we remember the writing 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.770
 I am now 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.430
 Batman Forever 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.640
 also had the wildcard in the example 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.850
 do it all on Bolt 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.420
 and split Nokia 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.710
 yes always and the first text but to create a tiebreak text 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.250
 So far two texts have levels 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.580
 So let's copy this one 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190
 and 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.500
 insert 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.090
 some already two texts 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.890
 and with it all 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.180
 Disadvantage that looks like Donate the depth to 50 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.370
 okay here but already Monson at first text 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.980
 makes the 2 with Chéri Elz 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.080
 So 2 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.920
 Forbo objects I am now 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.830
 for the color green 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.520
 but recognized as always 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.280
 a different color Mimi would have to calculate around a green wallet just now 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.290
 times 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 Chen goes early too 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.200
 Theo reflection on 7 90 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 and goes to text Chur and power 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.770
 The effect was then sometimes 50 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.830
 and you can see the whole thing has a pretty good effect though 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.179
 He is still too white for that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.899
 that's why there should be spots here 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.149
 The color once on green also do with it all 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.629
 does not look white green but only greens 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.899
 Workers still a little problem 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.069
 it is still a bit white 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 That's because we do not have the gate all at once 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:28.839
 so 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.449
 he can be our first color 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.599
 that's the other end to the color over time, but we'll do the black ones 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.599
 would also have to do black continue 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.299
 Intertek will be 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.579
 Ingots advertising space 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.799
 7 90 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.739
 picture more Melle 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.809
 50 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.869
 and black 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.869
 and then something for sure 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.430
 Dan the Kaufbeurer 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.430
 first text often lay first day object 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.430
 Katz often walks and peaks are explained 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.839
 Machens Depp 100 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.909
 Carius 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.609
 after the 3rd 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.859
 then he goes from a second text object also makes Schleck notch 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.549
 StepStone type and radios once 12 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.779
 the whole sense of why must be colorless 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.779
 The child was there to add a concern to our demands 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.509
 and we do it in that way 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:31.939
 there black 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.699
 he opens 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.029
 around the second the second test object 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.639
 and per 0 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.289
 the first 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:42.880
 change the whole thing now 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.909
 we will not do anything about it again 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.469
 Imelda to who the whole race see who is still black that is because 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.489
 that the green in the sun 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.299
 the green tea served behind the black Nied 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.639
 and that if now by changing her on top of that one fake 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.819
 and now we have four different windows and then we'll see 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.819
 in which the green BMW see above right 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.259
 that this green is behind the black one 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.819
 then pass the 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.069
 green fort of the black 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.159
 and with Nino Ben 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.340
 on perspective 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.689
 this 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.689
 Failures window on 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.460
 now we see the reasons 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.090
 Text level is 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.449
 highlighted 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.150
 Click Morand again 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
 we see we have our 3d text 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.710
 that's ours the text ever and now 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.409
 the matter comes with the percent textedit Iran 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.449
 or to change the text on the left to slide down 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.460
 and so on 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.590
 First of all, "Game of More Count and Shin for Cejka Object 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.729
 everybody does 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.909
 around that does the fracture whether the reason the texts Makiadi peat bog count 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.029
 Effects and SMIM because random effect org or coincidence falls apart 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.990
 in more than 40 countries 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.080
 and Shia 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.670
 if he had chosen the one already had to 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.639
 such an effect come the Europeum Storm are postponed 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.559
 but doing the whole thing differently 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.709
 Riether's turmoil will change so Bayern percent before 10 factor or 

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:21.999
 effect 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.299
 and then click on Parameters then clicks on their position 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.039
 and tortures rotation 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.039
 and if he plays two rounds with the settings you can see 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.020
 I see the letters represented 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.439
 and the letters g backwards or forwards 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.439
 and she turns left and right 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.240
 and with various settings you can play now 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.040
 so Westcott want to have as we said we can 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.009
 so still make your taste 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.009
 I'll just do it 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.930
 we all the time countries 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.460
 let's see ourselves as 3d text and 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.400
 he is 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.229
 he is now with the race end Fekter 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.819
 Océ so that we get the whole draw Photoshop 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.660
 and Sun background 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.520
 if now the Plato at it if that ever 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.279
 meant goals over the show 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.439
 to make more neck 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.860
 the settings 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.790
 around 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.659
 Size and length 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.699
 Time at a thousand one hundred eighty times ten or twenty 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.400
 goes on save 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.490
 baptized formats and select PNG 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.490
 takes the zeal little 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.169
 Aalen that pigeons ear where he always would like to have 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.759
 Breuer name for it 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.279
 Save Kik 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.900
 closes the remote window 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.059
 edges 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:53.059
 and then the Gatzer has 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.680
 szo 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.680
 when he goes to the photo-show Wortmann 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.639
 who called up Photoshop 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:08.639
 Pascals have to last 

00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:22.679
 at a slideshow profile have the run files 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.339
 call for it 

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:28.939
 and it just has to be a file so I just let it 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:32.009
 a YouTube of clowns 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:35.009
 Brady 2 Beckmann template 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:42.860

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.399
 and 

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.979
 we can see 

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:49.389
 Yes or text 

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:53.169
 with no background and we have the nice indexed it by accident too 

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:54.039
 pay 

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.580
 or Fekter 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.570
 and she knows all that now for a youtube account or other stuff like that 

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:01.669
 for example, once bitrate or 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:02.909
