00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
who cost the station hundreds of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.050 
who cost the station hundreds of
thousands<00:01:44.539> of<00:01:44.630> dollars<00:01:44.840> actually<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.850> was

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
thousands of dollars actually it was

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
of slow so I thought a TV ad would help

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.819 
of slow so I thought a TV ad would help
so<00:01:53.450> mr.<00:01:53.780> Bell<00:01:53.959> said<00:01:54.229> we<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:54.530> put<00:01:54.709> on<00:01:54.799> a

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829
