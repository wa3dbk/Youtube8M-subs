00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:29.810
 or the good girls we're going to do with the 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.160
 crosses that we have we are going to make the most 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.160
 simple the simplest model 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.060
 with bright co 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.700
 so we are going to need color accounts 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.700
 that we want these are their lives 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.280
 Now I'm going to do them with pearls and with 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.560
 with silver 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.690
 how is the silver from the cross 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.739
 Well, we're going to need a piece of 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.950
 silicone thread silicone 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.670
 I'm going to double it so it stays 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.670
 safer 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.840
 well we put it by the cross 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:24.909
 you call me for the cross 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.909
 and we take and we get out there like that 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.300
 I'll do it again 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.300
 I prefer it to stay safe 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:52.570
 and we take it and we take it out again 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.570
 and we adjust a little 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.530
 and we can start to put balls 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.220
 let's see let's start with a 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.220
 pearl 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 a bead 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.680
 and a silver 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.420
 a bead 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.280
 and a silver 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.540
 pass 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.189
 you see 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.920
 Well, I 'm going to keep putting 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.780
 because like this is all the same is 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.580
 foolishness are you consuming minutes here 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.540
 foolishly 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.769
 Well, it's already 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.769
 let's try 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.360
 it looks good but we are going to put it another 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.760
 no better not then nothing now for 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.770
 close it 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:19.040
 we put it like that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.040
 because that way the pearl will be better 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.680
 we make 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.380
 knot 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.770
 and we will also double 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.530
 and we're going to do double for 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.530
 make sure 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.760
 anyway always good 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.750
 then a Gothic in what in the knot 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.610
 because this one for this paper was going to say 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.580
 the very slippery elastic 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.970
 then for good 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.700
 what we had to do is take a 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.760
 glue apothecary and so 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.370
 the knot does not slip and we do not know 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.620
 opens 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.979
 and I'm going to make a couple of them too 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.979
 here 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.060
 and we cut 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.590
 this the simplest model we will do 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.590
 also others with thread 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.500
 well, well, we cut 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.500
 ah 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.280
 and then we have a pharmacy and 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.280
 strong glue 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.490
 but anyway 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:20.100
 well then we would stay in silver with pearl 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.900
 and now I'm going to teach another one that I've 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.980
 I made it so you can see that also 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.980
 it looks great with the strings in 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.980
 golden 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.600
 and it also looks good even if the cross is 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.190
 in silver it looks good in gold and then 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.920
 nothing we can put the color that 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.300
 we want 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.580
 both black brown 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.240
 or the color that we want red 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.260
 colorines for then for the summer but 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.840
 let's stay cool 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.230
 these are the simplest models what 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.590
 which is with rhinestones with account me in 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.150
 this case I have taken silver and pearl and in 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.780
 golden 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.970
 but well I tell you, you can make it from 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.460
 color you like any color 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.670
 it fits well, well, I do not expect anything 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.640
 you liked it and then we'll do 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.970
 another day because no longer those of 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.780
 threads are worth the cord come 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.780
 we see good-looking
