00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.060
cars dot com auto review

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.170
Hi this is Joe Bruzek for cars dot com

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.260
were here with the all-new Porsche 911

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.160
now on typical four-ship fashion it
looks like the old one

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.490
but just about every dimension is change
this is our first look at it

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.869
so let's check it out so what's changed

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.869
911 is longer lower and wider

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.960
most importantly the wheelbase increased
by

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.769
or n shit let's substantial a longer
wheelbase

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.839
helps with high-speed stability and also
copper

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.500
comforted also helped by the adjustable
suspension which has different modes

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.659
were here with a correr

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.930
F which now makes 400 horsepower up from

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.859
385

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.989
in with an ex our Porsche 1991 to be
more fuel-efficient

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.570
for their few features to help that one
is an autostart

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.940
stop now that shut the engine off when
you come without

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.160
when you let of the break and in fact

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.310
really not like yet well and you do have
the option

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.740
Hernan of which most people probably
well because it's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.980
loud the whole car shakes from the car
starts handed

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.210
pretty abrupt also added is a more

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.380
efficient electronically assisted power
steering system

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.900
a lot in the system don't feel very
natural

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.110
steering wheel feels loose disconnect
the road and when you're in a corner

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.900
and you let off the steering wheel
sometimes doesn't always come back

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.350
Center

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.980
with my first impressions driving the
9/11

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.380
there is none other that it feels very
good disappearing has a very precise

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.190
feel and it still communicate a lot the
road that you're going over

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.370
for the stairwell even though Porsche
gaps

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.110
hearing right there's one glaring
omission and the new interior

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.440
and that parking brake there is no
handbrake

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.119
like a traditional sports car all
electronic now

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.920
just push a button I miss the finely
stitched

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.979
leather handbrake it just classic sports
car

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.430
that is gone less classic

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.170
is the summer now on a car's sunroof

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.209
retract into the room but on the 911 a
popped up and slide

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.730
out that looks a little hot gorgeous
sitting above reply

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.970
and combine with the spoiler it looks
like a transformer that cat stuck

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.760
halfway

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.280
for those who are worried that portion
was gonna screw up

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.580
9/11 by making it more efficient no
worries just disable the auto start-stop

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.010
and enjoy

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.660
