show you step-by-step how to do photo

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.720 
show you step-by-step how to do photo
restoration<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:16.170> step

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
restoration and this is the first step

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.679 
restoration and this is the first step
here<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> photo<00:00:18.359> that's<00:00:19.109> not<00:00:20.689> aligned

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
here we have a photo that's not aligned

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.500 
here we have a photo that's not aligned
to<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> edge<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.830> our<00:00:23.130> frame<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.269> see

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to the edge of our frame you can see

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.230 
to the edge of our frame you can see
it's<00:00:24.660> off<00:00:24.840> kilter<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.609> order<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> get<00:00:27.090> it

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
it's off kilter and in order to get it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
it's off kilter and in order to get it
to<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.429> straightened

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to be straightened

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.930 
to be straightened
we<00:00:30.300> need<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.750> wrote<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.109> rotate<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
we need to wrote it rotate it and the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.990 
we need to wrote it rotate it and the
easiest<00:00:33.270> way<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.200> first<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.399> go<00:00:35.940> up

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
easiest way to do this is first to go up

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
easiest way to do this is first to go up
here<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.239> view<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:38.030> show<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.360> grid<00:00:42.829> once<00:00:43.829> we

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
here to view and show a grid once we

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040 
here to view and show a grid once we
have<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> grid<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.640> sort<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.420> how<00:00:45.750> far

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
have a grid we can sort of see how far

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.229 
have a grid we can sort of see how far
off<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.980> photo<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.579> from<00:00:47.969> being<00:00:48.180> square<00:00:50.239> now

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
off the photo is from being square now

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
off the photo is from being square now
the<00:00:51.629> next<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.620> need<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the next thing is that you need to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.840 
the next thing is that you need to
rotate<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.430> image<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:55.020> order<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
rotate the image and in order to do that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.770 
rotate the image and in order to do that
you<00:00:56.850> go<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.090> image<00:00:58.100> image<00:00:59.100> rotation<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you go to image image rotation and you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
you go to image image rotation and you
have<00:01:00.930> choices<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.579> choice<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.910> we

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
have choices here the choice that we

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.600 
have choices here the choice that we
want<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> use<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.960> arbitrary<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.460> we

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
want to use is arbitrary because we

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.920 
want to use is arbitrary because we
don't<00:01:05.820> want<00:01:05.970> any<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> three<00:01:06.659> choices

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
don't want any of the three choices

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.250 
don't want any of the three choices
first<00:01:07.619> three<00:01:07.890> choices<00:01:08.659> arbitrary<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.869> allow

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
first three choices arbitrary will allow

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.580 
first three choices arbitrary will allow
you<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.590> control<00:01:11.220> how<00:01:12.060> much<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.900> rotate<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you to control how much you rotate it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.270 
you to control how much you rotate it
and<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.369> direction<00:01:14.930> this<00:01:15.930> C<00:01:16.590> W<00:01:16.979> stands

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and in which direction this C W stands

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.990 
and in which direction this C W stands
for<00:01:17.430> clockwise<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.540> C<00:01:19.439> C<00:01:20.009> W<00:01:20.460> stands<00:01:20.909> for

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
for clockwise and C C W stands for

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.990 
for clockwise and C C W stands for
counter<00:01:21.570> clockwise<00:01:22.250> we<00:01:23.250> want<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> rotate<00:01:23.880> our

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
counter clockwise we want to rotate our

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.649 
counter clockwise we want to rotate our
image<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.990> way<00:01:25.320> which<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.130> clockwise<00:01:26.659> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
image this way which is clockwise and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
image this way which is clockwise and
we'll<00:01:27.810> try<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.080> first<00:01:28.560> an<00:01:28.890> angle<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.430> five

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
we'll try it first an angle of five

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.090 
we'll try it first an angle of five
degrees<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.340> looks<00:01:32.400> like

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
degrees and see what that looks like

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.060 
degrees and see what that looks like
we've<00:01:35.100> gone<00:01:35.250> overboard<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> go

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
we've gone overboard so I'm going to go

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:47.539 
we've gone overboard so I'm going to go
back<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.680> try<00:01:41.090> doing<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> again<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:46.430> bring<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
back and try doing it again and bring it

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.440 
back and try doing it again and bring it
down<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:48.060> two<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.890> degrees<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:51.329> if

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
down to two and two degrees and see if

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.920 
down to two and two degrees and see if
that<00:01:51.630> works<00:01:53.149> now<00:01:54.149> what<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.450> doing<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.810> I'm

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that works now what I'm doing is I'm

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
that works now what I'm doing is I'm
looking<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.579> where<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> edge

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
looking here to see the where the edge

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
looking here to see the where the edge
of<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.450> photograph<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.590> relation<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of my photograph is in relation to the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090 
of my photograph is in relation to the
grid<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:01.049> we've<00:02:01.259> done<00:02:01.290> we've

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
grid and you can see we've done we've

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.550 
grid and you can see we've done we've
gone<00:02:02.280> too<00:02:02.520> far<00:02:02.729> again<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> undo

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
gone too far again so I'm going to undo

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.999 
gone too far again so I'm going to undo
this<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.869> go<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> image<00:02:08.989> rotation<00:02:10.009> arbitrary

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
this and go to image rotation arbitrary

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.360 
this and go to image rotation arbitrary
and<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:12.030> time

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and this time

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.970 
and this time
set<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.879> one<00:02:14.480> degree<00:02:14.629> ah<00:02:17.409> now<00:02:18.409> that<00:02:18.680> looks<00:02:18.860> good

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
set in one degree ah now that looks good

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.949 
set in one degree ah now that looks good
you<00:02:19.970> can<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.599> distance<00:02:21.080> from<00:02:21.319> our

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
you can see that the distance from our

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.770 
you can see that the distance from our
horizontal<00:02:23.959> line<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.500> our<00:02:24.980> grid<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:26.599> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
horizontal line on our grid to the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.850 
horizontal line on our grid to the
parcel<00:02:27.640> horizontal<00:02:28.640> line<00:02:28.819> on<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.590> top<00:02:30.590> edge

parcel horizontal line on the top edge

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.580 
parcel horizontal line on the top edge
is<00:02:31.220> equal<00:02:32.209> across<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.590> whole<00:02:33.799> photo<00:02:34.250> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
is equal across the whole photo and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.630 
is equal across the whole photo and
similarly<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:37.849> side<00:02:38.150> edges<00:02:38.659> are<00:02:39.400> parallel<00:02:40.400> to

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
similarly the side edges are parallel to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.869 
similarly the side edges are parallel to
the<00:02:41.120> vertical<00:02:41.420> edges<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:43.129> we<00:02:43.280> see<00:02:43.549> here

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
the vertical edges that we see here

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.849 
the vertical edges that we see here
vertical<00:02:44.450> lines<00:02:44.659> in<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.319> grid

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
vertical lines in the grid

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.150 
vertical lines in the grid
so<00:02:46.760> we've<00:02:46.940> now<00:02:47.150> accomplished<00:02:47.780> getting<00:02:48.769> our

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
so we've now accomplished getting our

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.569 
so we've now accomplished getting our
photo<00:02:49.790> aligned<00:02:51.129> I'm<00:02:52.129> going<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:53.560> take<00:02:55.629> the<00:02:56.629> grid

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
photo aligned I'm going to take the grid

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.319 
photo aligned I'm going to take the grid
and<00:02:58.579> make<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.940> disappear<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.950> now<00:03:00.950> we<00:03:01.010> have<00:03:01.340> an

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
and make it disappear and now we have an

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.569 
and make it disappear and now we have an
aligned<00:03:02.690> photo<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.709> that's<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.099> first<00:03:04.340> step

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
aligned photo so that's the first step

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.809 
aligned photo so that's the first step
in<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.879> photo<00:03:05.120> restoration<00:03:05.359> process<00:03:06.819> thanks

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
in the photo restoration process thanks

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.329 
in the photo restoration process thanks
for<00:03:07.970> watching
