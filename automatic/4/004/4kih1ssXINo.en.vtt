the camera is way improved I mean it's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.280 
the camera is way improved I mean it's
it<00:02:11.640> probably<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.810> best<00:02:12.959> if<00:02:13.110> not<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it probably one of the best if not the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.760 
it probably one of the best if not the
best

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
best

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.290 
best
amer<00:02:13.920> I've<00:02:14.010> used<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> phone<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.000> then

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
amer I've used on a phone and then

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.490 
amer I've used on a phone and then
there's<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> software<00:02:15.900> improvements<00:02:15.990> most

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
there's the software improvements most

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.650 
there's the software improvements most
of<00:02:16.620> which<00:02:16.710> will<00:02:16.860> come<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> iphone<00:02:17.640> 4<00:02:17.970> but

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
of which will come to the iphone 4 but

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.140 
of which will come to the iphone 4 but
Siri<00:02:19.110> will<00:02:19.380> not<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:19.980> you've<00:02:20.220> got<00:02:20.400> an<00:02:20.490> iphone<00:02:20.790> 4

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
Siri will not if you've got an iphone 4

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.600 
Siri will not if you've got an iphone 4
I<00:02:21.450> think<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.290> somewhat<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:23.010> hard<00:02:23.250> sell

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
I think this is somewhat of a hard sell

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.190 
I think this is somewhat of a hard sell
I<00:02:23.640> don't<00:02:24.330> feel<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.720> there's<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.960> ton<00:02:25.170> of

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
I don't feel like there's a ton of

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.450 
I don't feel like there's a ton of
compelling<00:02:25.530> stuff<00:02:25.800> here<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.100> make<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.340> want

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
compelling stuff here to make you want

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.100 
compelling stuff here to make you want
to<00:02:26.550> upgrade<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.570> you're<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.750> an<00:02:27.840> older

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
to upgrade but if you're on an older

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
to upgrade but if you're on an older
model<00:02:28.320> or<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:28.740> you're<00:02:28.830> thinking<00:02:28.920> about

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
model or if you're thinking about

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.010 
model or if you're thinking about
switching<00:02:29.520> there's<00:02:30.360> no<00:02:30.510> question<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.870> this

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
switching there's no question that this

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.300 
switching there's no question that this
is<00:02:31.200> definitely<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> best

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
is definitely one of the best

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.610 
is definitely one of the best
smartphones<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.240> could<00:02:33.480> possibly<00:02:33.900> get<00:02:34.350> right

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
smartphones you could possibly get right

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.420 
smartphones you could possibly get right
now<00:02:35.360> Siri<00:02:36.360> who<00:02:36.630> made<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:40.040> like<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.220> says<00:02:41.400> on
