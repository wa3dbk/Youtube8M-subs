00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.019
 yes I am poorly cared for by be quiet 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.330
 the market leader for pc power supplies in 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.199
 Germany for seven years but also 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.180
 Very strong in recent years 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.000
 placed around cooling area and we 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.689
 can be new at computex 2013 today 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 cool imagine that plate skirt slim 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.500
 for the quad conditions, it is a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.619
 very compact cooler about half 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.149
 size before the catwalk 2 but we want 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.899
 still offer very good performance 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.910
 in this cooler 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.680
 that means we had to go very strong 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.239
 Cool design work by yourself 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.360
 you can already see that on this one 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.550
 the cool lamellae makes a slight vault 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.829
 Do this advertising should be a better one 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.530
 lead air circulation and better 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.870
 contact with the surface 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.780
 We also have 4 6 mm heatpipes 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.090
 The pipes are very interesting 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.949
 but I the suitable manufacturer the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.190
 he actually use it for the dark 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.420
 rock so for the high end series that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.070
 by the way, the same manufacturer also apple 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 supplies were installed here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.189
 the bottom plate is one this time 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 Taiwanese plate that is called 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.250
 heatpipes are responsible for this 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 take in the bottom plate 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.080
 the bottom plate additional eyeglasses around 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.460
 yes so cool design to emerge 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.470
 so that the surface again here 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.299
 to expand 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.490
 it is fitted with its wings fan in 135 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.689
 millimeters but also in slim design and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.280
 the interesting thing is when here 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.079
 already carried out technology update 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.210
 but that's where it usually comes from 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.619
 with four poles and this works already 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.570
 with six poles that leads to us 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.600
 less vibrations have a low 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.670
 power consumption in the cooler sap are 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.140
 By the way 2 sets the old parentheses 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.020
 that means you can also later 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.740
 mount two fans 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 also interesting 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.299
 certainly for the audience or readers 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.860
 we have new mounting system here too 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.049
 when the cooler can for the first time 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.030
 also mounted from the top of the mainboard 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.040
 become and the holding system higher 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.040
 contact pressure dankeschÃ¶n
