00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello a greeting to all I am 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.790
 miguelángel of techno revolution and today 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.710
 can teach you how to do the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.200
 jailbreak your device while in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 aigües 8.1 point 2 with the tool 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.880
 app with this tool comes by hand 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.070
 of the group pp 25 you must have 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.380
 heard about this tool 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.020
 because it is one that allows you to install 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.820
 Pay applications for free 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 on your device well now well 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.080
 it turns out that they have released this 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.480
 tool called app ghost and here 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 has its version for windows and also 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.199
 they have a version for mac that 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.999
 is very good because currently the 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.620
 taiji tool does not have a 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.539
 version for bad now well I want 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.460
 comment them first are the data some 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.039
 notes and initial thoughts 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.569
 about this tool the first thing is that 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.789
 have to make a backup 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.530
 of your device in order to avoid 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.600
 the loss of data before doing 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.789
 jailbreak that is to say you are going to itunes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.190
 and makes a backup of your 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.109
 device your applications and all this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 jailbreak is compatible with all 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.800
 computers that are running from the 8.0 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.730
 up to 8.1 point 2 and another thing is that 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.350
 This is a tool that 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.900
 much has been said in fact I've 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.150
 found minimal information on this 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.730
 if I have found any and then 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.740
 this carries its risks like I can 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.660
 Contain any malware or software 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.660
 unwanted with which you must 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.610
 use this at your own risk 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.620
 I do not want to say that I have it but if 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.450
 I might include it is not like the 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.280
 taiji tool for example that you 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.590
 has spoken a lot about her for the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.930
 problems that were there before and it seems 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.060
 be that in principle does not include any 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.560
 additional software that we do not 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.780
 interest to have in our device 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.000
 Now, well, if we are going to start with 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.100
 the steps and the preparation first 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.290
 what they have to do is restore their 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.170
 device to the latest version in this 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.630
 case is at 18.1 point 2 you are going to 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.670
 iTunes and click on restore iphone or the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.470
 device you have once you have done 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.340
 that you are going to insure in your 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.890
 device will go to icloud settings and 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.180
 is going to make sure that it is 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.160
 disabled the option to search my 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.780
 iphone or the device that you have 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.250
 in this case as recently has 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.959
 restored the device so neither 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 It has even introduced my account 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.650
 icloud that would be the option that 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.660
 I recommend you restore and do it if 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.050
 directly without putting accounts or anything 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.750
 then they are going to go to their key area is 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.850
 say the code taccetti if they have touch 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.650
 Haitian disabled him as well as the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.000
 security code and if they have no ceiling 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.770
 of type you just have to 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.680
 turn the key and ready will 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.230
 get out and okay that's the preparation now 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.540
 you already have your pp tool 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.810
 ghosts open it and we can see how it has 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.030
 recognized here is 8.1 point 2 in a 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.860
 iphone 5 s let's unmark this 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.040
 box here that what you are going to do is 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.410
 install additional pepe software 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.090
 25 the assistant and we're just going to 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.920
 click on this central button that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.500
 we have here that would come to put something 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.570
 as well as start see how it reminds us 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.580
 that we deactivate icloud and that 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.200
 we deactivate the taccetti and the key if 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.390
 we have it activated in the last point 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.590
 it reminds us that we should make a copy 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.170
 of security because if the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.210
 jailbreak fails some error occurs this 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.760
 could lead to data loss 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.130
 now we have two buttons here that 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.810
 would cancel and this would be that already 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.260
 we have made the backup and 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.599
 continue we click here 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.549
 and you can see how the 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.640
 jailbreak completion process 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.500
 They can also see my device 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.920
 time have not added any with or 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.920
 nothing 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.630
 ok and now we can see here this tick 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.760
 green that indicates that you have finished 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.890
 the process and some letters that puts us 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.110
 something like congratulations has already completed 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.610
 successfully jailbreak so it seems 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.470
 be that we already have it 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.630
 ok here we can see how it has already 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.460
 rebooted the device and it puts us 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.870
 this error that the storage of 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.060
 it's almost full that's completely 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.800
 normal we're just going to slide to 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.930
 unlock it and in the bb tool 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.610
 ghosts we can see how it tells us here 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.950
 that the jailbreak is done now 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.170
 well let's see on our devices 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.390
 we slide and we effectively have xiria 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.750
 in our device already installed 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.840
 let's open it by preparing the system 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:18.329
 as it always does, it's worth it 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.400
 restarting and let's go back to suicide 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.229
 and well, in principle everything looks 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.210
 right here simply that we have 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.000
 an update but it seems that 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.129
 everything works fine if you have some 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.080
 problem with this jailbreak I can 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.030
