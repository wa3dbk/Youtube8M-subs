difference<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> I'm<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.289> probably

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
difference is I'm like I have probably

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.700 
difference is I'm like I have probably
about<00:00:26.670> ten<00:00:27.119> gameplays<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:28.590> when<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
about ten gameplays for when I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.349 
about ten gameplays for when I
considered<00:00:29.189> myself<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:29.699> learning<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> game

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
considered myself as learning the game

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.229 
considered myself as learning the game
and<00:00:30.689> you'll<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> lot<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> difference<00:00:33.030> here

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and you'll see a lot of difference here

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.569 
and you'll see a lot of difference here
as<00:00:33.420> opposed<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.110> where<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.469> kid<00:00:34.680> selection<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
as opposed to where my kid selection and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.280 
as opposed to where my kid selection and
my<00:00:35.700> perk<00:00:35.940> setup<00:00:36.180> selection<00:00:36.809> you'll<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> lot

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
my perk setup selection you'll see a lot

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990 
my perk setup selection you'll see a lot
of<00:00:37.320> changes<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.129> aspect<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.700> I'll<00:00:38.790> kind

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
of changes in that aspect and I'll kind

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
of changes in that aspect and I'll kind
of<00:00:39.059> point<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> mountain<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.870> suppose<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of point the mountain as I suppose the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.670 
of point the mountain as I suppose the
gameplays<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> famas<00:00:42.899> with

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
gameplays up this is a famas with

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
gameplays up this is a famas with
hardened<00:00:44.160> pro

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
hardened pro

hardline Pro and hacker Pro and this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
hardline Pro and hacker Pro and this
right<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> my<00:00:50.670> preferred<00:00:51.030> setup<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
right now is my preferred setup for the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.189 
right now is my preferred setup for the
game

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
game

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.740 
game
reason<00:00:53.010> being<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.520> harden<00:00:54.090> pretty<00:00:54.239> much<00:00:54.449> makes

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
reason being is harden pretty much makes

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.410 
reason being is harden pretty much makes
it<00:00:54.899> takes<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.260> flinch<00:00:55.530> away<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.420> unlike

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it takes your flinch away and unlike

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
it takes your flinch away and unlike
previous<00:00:57.449> Call<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.289> some<00:00:58.620> other<00:00:58.859> call<00:00:59.160> dues

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
previous Call well some other call dues

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
previous Call well some other call dues
did<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.850> did<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> extent

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
did it they did it do it to the extent

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
did it they did it do it to the extent
of<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.350> game<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.820> hit<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.510> flinch

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
of this game and you get hit you flinch

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.750 
of this game and you get hit you flinch
and<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.379> changes<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> area<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.700> your

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and it changes the area of your

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
and it changes the area of your
crosshairs<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> readjust

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
crosshairs at so you have to readjust

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
crosshairs at so you have to readjust
every<00:01:08.610> time<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.060> hit<00:01:09.180> by<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.420> bullet<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
every time you get hit by a bullet and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.679 
every time you get hit by a bullet and
that<00:01:10.080> we're<00:01:10.950> dealing<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.220> recall<00:01:11.729> makes<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that we're dealing with recall makes it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.289 
that we're dealing with recall makes it
pretty<00:01:12.900> hard<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.520> kill<00:01:14.520> people<00:01:14.850> while<00:01:15.000> under

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
pretty hard to kill people while under

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.960 
pretty hard to kill people while under
sustained<00:01:15.689> fire<00:01:16.280> harden<00:01:17.280> takes<00:01:17.580> away<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
sustained fire harden takes away the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
sustained fire harden takes away the
flinch<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.810> when<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.170> hit<00:01:19.409> my<00:01:19.530> bullet<00:01:19.890> it's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
flinch so when you hit my bullet it's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.810 
flinch so when you hit my bullet it's
like<00:01:20.340> you're<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.939> has<00:01:21.479> no<00:01:21.659> no<00:01:22.049> effect<00:01:22.439> or<00:01:22.590> phase

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
like you're it has no no effect or phase

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.109 
like you're it has no no effect or phase
to<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.600> pretty<00:01:25.080> much<00:01:25.640> can<00:01:26.640> shoot<00:01:26.880> with

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to it so you pretty much can shoot with

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.060 
to it so you pretty much can shoot with
stet<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.540> shoot<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> keep<00:01:28.320> steady<00:01:28.619> right<00:01:28.920> on

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
stet you shoot and keep steady right on

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.190 
stet you shoot and keep steady right on
through<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> hail<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> gunfire<00:01:30.049> might<00:01:31.049> not

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
through a hail of gunfire might not

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600 
through a hail of gunfire might not
sound<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> does<00:01:31.890> much<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> does<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
sound like it does much but it does a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.670 
sound like it does much but it does a
lot<00:01:32.759> especially<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.930> there's<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:34.320> when

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
lot especially when there's a lot when

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.410 
lot especially when there's a lot when
you<00:01:34.740> come<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> one-on-one<00:01:35.490> engagements

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you come on the one-on-one engagements

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.580 
you come on the one-on-one engagements
like<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.409> where<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.460> guys<00:01:38.610> just

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
like this right here where the guys just

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
like this right here where the guys just
just<00:01:40.590> staring<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.100> down<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.610> you're

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just staring you down and you you're

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.010

they're<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.310> low<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:26.610> they're<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.660> low<00:03:27.870> it's

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
they're so low that they're so low it's

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.630 
they're so low that they're so low it's
almost<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.410> everybody<00:03:28.680> has<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> ninja<00:03:29.400> Pro<00:03:29.580> to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
almost like everybody has a ninja Pro to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.720 
almost like everybody has a ninja Pro to
begin<00:03:30.030> with<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.830> hear<00:03:32.100> them<00:03:32.250> like

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
begin with and you can hear them like

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.160 
begin with and you can hear them like
wouldn't<00:03:33.030> enjoy<00:03:33.239> pro<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:33.750> when<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.989> makes

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
wouldn't enjoy pro like when it makes

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.430 
wouldn't enjoy pro like when it makes
their<00:03:34.350> footsteps<00:03:34.650> louder<00:03:35.989> but<00:03:36.989> for<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.230> most

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
their footsteps louder but for the most

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.449 
their footsteps louder but for the most
part<00:03:38.239> it's<00:03:39.239> not<00:03:39.330> it's<00:03:39.720> not<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.200> new<00:03:40.560> Pro

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
part it's not it's not but new Pro

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.170 
part it's not it's not but new Pro
basically<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.350> hearing<00:03:43.350> ninja<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.790> he's

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
basically is like hearing ninja and he's

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.550 
basically is like hearing ninja and he's
like<00:03:45.300> hearing<00:03:45.570> ninja<00:03:45.810> Pro<00:03:45.989> would<00:03:46.110> sit<00:03:46.350> Brett

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
like hearing ninja Pro would sit Brett

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.170 
like hearing ninja Pro would sit Brett
Pro<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.400> won't<00:03:47.580> hear<00:03:47.790> them<00:03:47.850> until<00:03:48.060> they're

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
Pro you won't hear them until they're

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.300 
Pro you won't hear them until they're
right<00:03:48.360> on<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.530> motion<00:03:49.860> sensor<00:03:50.160> has<00:03:50.280> a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
right on you and the motion sensor has a

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.830 
right on you and the motion sensor has a
bigger<00:03:50.580> range<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.090> figured<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.390> motion<00:03:51.690> sensor

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
bigger range I figured a motion sensor

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.910 
bigger range I figured a motion sensor
would<00:03:52.020> be<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> bigger<00:03:52.380> part<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.770> like

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
would be a bigger part of like

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.610 
would be a bigger part of like
free-for-all<00:03:53.459> in<00:03:53.700> any<00:03:54.630> Oh<00:03:54.720> certain<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.290> took

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
free-for-all in any Oh certain it took

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.860 
free-for-all in any Oh certain it took
points<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.070> maps<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.090> what<00:03:57.420> then<00:03:57.660> other

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
points the maps and what then other

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.920 
points the maps and what then other
things<00:03:58.170> in<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.470> past<00:03:59.870> mainly<00:04:00.870> because<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:02.930> just

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
things in the past mainly because I just

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.150 
things in the past mainly because I just
lost<00:04:04.110> my<00:04:04.260> train<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.530> fault

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
lost my train of fault

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.210 
lost my train of fault
mainly<00:04:05.520> because<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.880> lack<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.090> footsteps<00:04:07.220> you

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
mainly because the lack of footsteps you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.590 
mainly because the lack of footsteps you

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
probably expecting to see out the gate

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.910 
probably expecting to see out the gate
is<00:04:54.850> submachine<00:04:55.850> guns<00:04:56.120> silenced<00:04:57.110> with<00:04:57.620> ghost

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
is submachine guns silenced with ghost

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.120 
is submachine guns silenced with ghost
with<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.520> ghost<00:04:58.730> perk<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.870> yeah<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:00.860> can

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
with the ghost perk and yeah you can

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.800 
with the ghost perk and yeah you can
still<00:05:01.310> take<00:05:01.520> that<00:05:01.670> helicopters<00:05:02.390> they're<00:05:02.570> very

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
still take that helicopters they're very

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.810 
still take that helicopters they're very
easy<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.200> take<00:05:03.380> down<00:05:03.440> like<00:05:03.890> I've<00:05:04.040> had<00:05:04.190> shot<00:05:04.460> you

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.280 
easy to take down like I've had shot you
can<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.150> could<00:05:05.300> take<00:05:05.450> down<00:05:05.600> helicopters

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
can you could take down helicopters

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.180 
can you could take down helicopters
before<00:05:07.190> they<00:05:07.550> even<00:05:07.730> get<00:05:08.090> onto<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.660> stage

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
before they even get onto the stage

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.020 
before they even get onto the stage
gunships<00:05:10.190> are<00:05:10.310> a<00:05:10.340> little<00:05:10.460> bit<00:05:10.610> tougher<00:05:10.880> to

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
gunships are a little bit tougher to

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.880 
gunships are a little bit tougher to
take<00:05:11.210> down<00:05:11.420> gunships<00:05:11.930> can<00:05:12.140> dodge<00:05:12.350> you<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:12.800> you

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
take down gunships can dodge you and you

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.340 
take down gunships can dodge you and you
can't<00:05:13.100> lock<00:05:13.280> on<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.670> them<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.810> you<00:05:14.870> can<00:05:15.110> free

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
can't lock on to them so you can free

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.320 
can't lock on to them so you can free
fire<00:05:15.620> like<00:05:15.920> the<00:05:16.040> law<00:05:16.190> rocket<00:05:16.520> at<00:05:16.760> it<00:05:16.910> but<00:05:17.150> it

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
fire like the law rocket at it but it

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.490 
fire like the law rocket at it but it
can<00:05:17.480> dodge<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:17.690> because<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.110> can<00:05:18.260> see<00:05:18.290> it

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
can dodge it because you can see it
