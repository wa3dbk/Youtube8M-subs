this<00:01:25.970> momentum<00:01:26.970> building<00:01:29.630> when<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.720> made<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this momentum building when we made the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.900 
this momentum building when we made the
first<00:01:31.140> Toy<00:01:31.410> Story<00:01:31.830> we<00:01:32.280> made<00:01:32.520> some<00:01:32.880> very

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
first Toy Story we made some very

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.840 
first Toy Story we made some very
conscious<00:01:33.600> decisions<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.710> these<00:01:35.040> toys<00:01:35.400> were

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
conscious decisions that these toys were

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.370 
conscious decisions that these toys were
going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> behave<00:01:36.300> like<00:01:36.479> real<00:01:37.080> toys

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
going to behave like real toys

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.469 
going to behave like real toys
physically<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.940> lot<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.330> is

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
physically and I think a lot of that is

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.310 
physically and I think a lot of that is
translated<00:01:39.990> into<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> game<00:01:42.140> what<00:01:43.140> he's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
translated into the game what he's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.719 
translated into the game what he's
completed<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.830> mission<00:01:43.950> he<00:01:44.220> flails<00:01:44.550> around

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
completed the mission he flails around

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.469 
completed the mission he flails around
like<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.660> multi-jointed<00:01:46.380> rag<00:01:46.619> toilet<00:01:47.070> he<00:01:47.160> is

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
like the multi-jointed rag toilet he is

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
like the multi-jointed rag toilet he is
he<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.600> flails<00:01:49.110> his<00:01:49.320> arms<00:01:49.380> around<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.130> kind

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
he like flails his arms around and kind

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
he like flails his arms around and kind
of<00:01:50.340> spins<00:01:50.640> around<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:52.800> know

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
of spins around like this and you know
