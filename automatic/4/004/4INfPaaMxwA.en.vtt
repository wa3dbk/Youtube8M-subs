center<00:01:43.280> section<00:01:43.670> in<00:01:43.790> between<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:44.500> fender

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
center section in between the fender

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.880 
center section in between the fender
wells<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.670> get<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:46.970> fit<00:01:47.180> right<00:01:47.500> we<00:01:48.500> had<00:01:48.619> a<00:01:48.650> bunch

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
wells to get to fit right we had a bunch

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.930 
wells to get to fit right we had a bunch
of<00:01:49.070> bad<00:01:49.250> weather<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:49.820> week<00:01:51.400> my<00:01:52.400> plywood<00:01:52.640> got

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
of bad weather this week my plywood got

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.480 
of bad weather this week my plywood got
a<00:01:52.970> little<00:01:53.210> bit<00:01:53.330> wet<00:01:53.509> but<00:01:53.660> it<00:01:53.780> didn't<00:01:53.990> warp<00:01:54.200> or

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
a little bit wet but it didn't warp or

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.790 
a little bit wet but it didn't warp or
start<00:01:55.490> coming<00:01:55.759> apart<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:59.530> wouldn't<00:02:00.530> be<00:02:00.590> afraid

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
start coming apart I wouldn't be afraid

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.060 
start coming apart I wouldn't be afraid
to<00:02:00.950> put<00:02:01.130> too<00:02:01.310> many<00:02:02.410> anchors<00:02:03.410> in<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.650> bottom<00:02:03.979> of

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
to put too many anchors in the bottom of

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.090 
to put too many anchors in the bottom of
this<00:02:04.160> thing<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.930> spread<00:02:06.229> them<00:02:06.380> out<00:02:06.500> have<00:02:07.070> a

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
this thing and spread them out have a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.820 
this thing and spread them out have a
lot<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.400> time<00:02:07.580> off<00:02:07.729> points<00:02:11.530> then<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.620> put

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
lot of time off points then I put

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.560 
lot of time off points then I put
pressure-treated<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.820> outer<00:02:13.970> cap<00:02:15.220> here

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
pressure-treated on the outer cap here

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.640 
pressure-treated on the outer cap here
probably<00:02:17.570> didn't<00:02:17.930> need<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.170> but<00:02:18.350> it's<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> good

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
probably didn't need it but it's a good

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.199 
probably didn't need it but it's a good
idea<00:02:18.830> if<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.280> have<00:02:19.370> water<00:02:19.730> running<00:02:20.000> off<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
idea if you have water running off the

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.660 
idea if you have water running off the
siding<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:22.040> don't<00:02:22.250> forget<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.580> use

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
siding you don't forget to use

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.370 
siding you don't forget to use
galvanized<00:02:23.330> nails<00:02:23.630> anything<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.230> goes

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
galvanized nails anything that goes

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.630 
galvanized nails anything that goes
through<00:02:24.620> pressure-treated<00:02:25.100> needs<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.550> be

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
through pressure-treated needs to be

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.250 
through pressure-treated needs to be
galvanized<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:28.750> use<00:02:29.750> subfloor<00:02:30.350> adhesive<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
galvanized I use subfloor adhesive the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.800 
galvanized I use subfloor adhesive the
glue<00:02:33.470> down<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.950> plywood<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:35.060> number<00:02:35.510> twelve

ring<00:02:36.200> shank<00:02:36.500> nails<00:02:37.900> they<00:02:38.900> work<00:02:39.110> about<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:39.590> well

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
ring shank nails they work about as well

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.199 
ring shank nails they work about as well
as<00:02:39.799> screws<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.580> they're<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> lot<00:02:40.850> easier<00:02:41.120> to

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
as screws and they're a lot easier to

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.050 
as screws and they're a lot easier to
put<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:42.430> once<00:02:43.430> they've<00:02:43.610> been<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.880> there<00:02:44.030> a
