unique serial number and tag information

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.539 
unique serial number and tag information
we<00:00:49.569> collect<00:00:49.749> data<00:00:50.170> such<00:00:50.679> as<00:00:50.709> measurements

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:51.549 
we collect data such as measurements

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:54.419 
we collect data such as measurements
weight<00:00:51.869> blood<00:00:52.869> samples<00:00:53.409> and<00:00:53.679> when<00:00:54.219> we

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
weight blood samples and when we

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.009 
weight blood samples and when we
verified<00:00:54.999> that<00:00:55.030> we<00:00:55.329> have<00:00:55.479> all<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.749> data<00:00:55.869> we

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
verified that we have all the data we

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.199 
verified that we have all the data we
need<00:00:56.170> we<00:00:56.829> release<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.339> animals<00:00:57.729> right<00:00:57.969> back

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:58.209 
need we release the animals right back

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:00.590 
need we release the animals right back
onto<00:00:58.479> the<00:00:58.719> site<00:00:58.929> where<00:00:59.139> they<00:00:59.289> were<00:00:59.350> captured

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
onto the site where they were captured

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.989 
onto the site where they were captured
and<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:01.899> are<00:01:02.199> learning<00:01:02.589> an<00:01:02.920> awful<00:01:03.039> lot<00:01:03.549> about

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
and we are learning an awful lot about

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:10.110 
and we are learning an awful lot about
sea<00:01:04.390> turtles<00:01:04.420> through<00:01:04.960> this<00:01:05.109> program

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.380 

and<00:01:10.270> he's<00:01:10.570> moving<00:01:11.670> another<00:01:12.670> one<00:01:12.940> right<00:01:13.180> here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
and he's moving another one right here

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.690 
and he's moving another one right here
there's<00:01:13.690> two<00:01:13.900> right<00:01:14.170> here<00:01:14.410> one<00:01:14.860> man<00:01:15.100> one<00:01:15.460> top

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
there's two right here one man one top

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.660 
there's two right here one man one top
of<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.910> boat<00:01:16.350> some<00:01:17.350> got<00:01:17.500> very<00:01:17.740> low<00:01:17.950> wise<00:01:18.220> right

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
of the boat some got very low wise right

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.730 
of the boat some got very low wise right
so<00:01:19.180> when<00:01:19.660> they<00:01:19.750> hear<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:19.930> bus<00:01:20.170> will<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:20.500> sit

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
so when they hear the bus will just sit

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.870 
so when they hear the bus will just sit
down<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.100> bottle<00:01:21.370> and<00:01:21.460> they<00:01:21.550> know<00:01:21.700> that's

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
down on the bottle and they know that's

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.270 
down on the bottle and they know that's
what's<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.210> safe<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.500> sometimes<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.010> hard<00:01:24.220> to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
what's a safe so sometimes it's hard to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.110 
what's a safe so sometimes it's hard to
try<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.520> get<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.730> maxi<00:01:25.090> hit<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> net

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
try and get a maxi hit the net

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:39.289 
try and get a maxi hit the net
they<00:01:27.570> got<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.050> there

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:53.819 

not<00:01:40.299> turtle<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:47.259> was<00:01:47.320> free
