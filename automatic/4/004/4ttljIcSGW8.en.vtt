00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello and welcome to all on planets 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.670
 galaxies then as part of our 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.550
 galaxy s 5 test we decided to 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.910
 introduce you to the ip67 certification of 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.980
 terminal so that means our 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.170
 smartphone and dust-proof 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.900
 is waterproof up to one meter 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.340
 depth for 30 minutes during 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.140
 tests we have already published 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 show precisely these two sides 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.730
 waterproof up to one meter deep 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.920
 for 30 minutes 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 we will not reproduce paletes but we 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.520
 let's see how behaves the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 galaxy s 5 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.980
 when he is immersed in the water then 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.239
 so we have our galaxy s 5 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.079
 here and for that we took everything 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.940
 stupidly a salad bowl filled with water in 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.829
 which we are going to dive our galaxy 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.899
 is simple then for all to confess 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 put a phone in water is not 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.079
 not really a natural gesture and we have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.660
 some apprehension 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.450
 so first point to check before you 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.210
 to do this test is that our galaxy 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.360
 is one who has his back hull that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.900
 is totally closed so as not to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 to filter the water and other points that the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.299
 port hood mhl 3.0 is it also 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.939
 well closed so presumably our 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.380
 galaxy s5 is ready to immerse we have a 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.990
 some apprehension even before 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.040
 to do the test 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:42.450
 so here's another galaxy and 5 of him 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.850
 discover the joys of water in a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.240
 first time we see that our galaxy 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.740
 is 5th normally acting good news 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.280
 no air bubble has come back to the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.110
 surface which means that there is no 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.790
 immediately 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.469
 so at the level of activation of 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.200
 physical buttons still no 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:10.379
 problem on the other hand we will notice 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.090
 that in the water the screen is no longer 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.599
 all touch no longer has any reaction 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.629
 from the screen that's how you 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:23.700
 see here we will come out our 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:25.470
 phone so we can always the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.599
 unlock with buttons buttons 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.420
 we can have but you see that 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.310
 when on the screen that is wet 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.519
 it is that they more d but must also 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.459
 wet it's a lot harder 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.459
 difficult to react the phone 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.930
 you will understand that certification 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.170
 ip67 which is present on the galaxy s 5 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.099
 which is more of a security one 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.860
 to be able to ensure that the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.349
 phone be more water resistant 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.610
 that underwater use is going 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.819
 to do a little is so we will try 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.200
 quickly the phone imagine that 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:13.769
 during your vacation at the pool you 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.880
 wanted to take pictures underwater or 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.470
 videos 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.040
 in this case you will have to prevent 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.569
 before diving 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.250
 so for that so here we are 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.540
 to wipe a little bit the phone this 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.730
 which allows one to be able to order them to 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:34.260
 new usable so here we go 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:36.239
 take the camera here is in 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.489
 do you need to turn on the camera 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:44.190
 activated it before in the dive into 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:46.350
 water like this is in this case with 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.239
 the volume buttons so locate ellis on 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.760
 this slice you will be able to take 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:57.209
 the photos and good points towards the gold 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:01.769
 since again on the screen has beautiful 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.450
 support this pass nothing but you have it 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.709
 heard when you press the button 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.989
 volume be it low or have it the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.299
 opportunity to take the picture then 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.430
 by cons for the video mode there is 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.270
 no possibility of activating it when 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.330
 we are in the water 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.830
 so it will first activate the video 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:25.830
 is then along the smartphone in 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.280
 so that's it for the test of resistance to 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.030
 the water of our galaxy 5 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.980
 as said the galaxy s 5 has its 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.440
 ip67 certification more like a 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.410
 security and not as a use 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.470
 underwater after you can still 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.720
 take photos but you will need 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.430
 launch the camera even before 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.440
 plunge 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.240
 So, do not hesitate to follow us 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.240
 on penalty soon
