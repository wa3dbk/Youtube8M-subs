00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
one important thing to say here how the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.310 
one important thing to say here how the
UI<00:02:37.950> UI<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.670> are<00:02:38.820> see<00:02:39.030> here<00:02:39.300> was<00:02:39.810> made<00:02:40.020> with<00:02:40.290> our

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
UI UI you are see here was made with our

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.550 
UI UI you are see here was made with our
own<00:02:40.590> UI<00:02:40.890> system<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.910> don't<00:02:42.420> use<00:02:42.630> unity<00:02:43.200> butene

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
own UI system we don't use unity butene

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.250 
own UI system we don't use unity butene
a<00:02:43.830> UI<00:02:44.040> system<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:45.300> built<00:02:45.540> our<00:02:45.690> own<00:02:45.810> with

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
a UI system and we built our own with

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.280 
a UI system and we built our own with
using<00:02:46.830> OpenGL<00:02:47.250> viewports<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.210> job<00:02:48.870> texture

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
using OpenGL viewports and job texture

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.370 
using OpenGL viewports and job texture
so<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.240> character<00:02:51.870> customization

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
so this is the character customization

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.910 
so this is the character customization
screen<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.880> change<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:55.020> game<00:02:55.170> has<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
screen you can change the game has the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.230 
screen you can change the game has the
concept<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.400> loadouts

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
concept of loadouts

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.870 
concept of loadouts
you<00:02:57.450> can<00:02:57.660> change<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.710> five<00:02:58.920> loadouts<00:02:59.580> so

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
you can change up to five loadouts so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.630 
you can change up to five loadouts so
you<00:02:59.940> can<00:03:00.180> real<00:03:00.870> change<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.620> then<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:02.100> real<00:03:02.400> time

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
you can real change it then in real time

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:15.000 
you can real change it then in real time
inside<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:02.940> game<00:03:03.180> after<00:03:04.080> each<00:03:04.590> response

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.550

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.510 
almost everyone is in Brazil when you
have<00:05:29.300> half<00:05:29.720> hour<00:05:29.900> here<00:05:30.110> plane<00:05:30.380> so<00:05:30.620> you<00:05:31.400> may

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
have half hour here plane so you may

00:05:31.520 --> 00:06:17.890 
have half hour here plane so you may
expect<00:05:31.550> up<00:05:31.940> a<00:05:32.000> little<00:05:32.210> bit<00:05:32.330> of<00:05:32.419> lag

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.499 

so<00:06:18.900> basically<00:06:19.470> that's<00:06:19.800> it<00:06:19.979> we<00:06:20.340> wanted<00:06:20.669> to<00:06:20.849> to

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
so basically that's it we wanted to to

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.510 
so basically that's it we wanted to to
give<00:06:21.960> you<00:06:22.080> this<00:06:22.289> live<00:06:22.740> presentation<00:06:23.340> so<00:06:23.430> you

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
give you this live presentation so you

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.860 
give you this live presentation so you
can<00:06:23.669> actually<00:06:23.819> understand<00:06:24.449> what<00:06:24.569> the<00:06:24.690> games

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
can actually understand what the games

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.230 
can actually understand what the games
about<00:06:25.050> and<00:06:25.830> now<00:06:26.069> we<00:06:26.130> can<00:06:26.370> talk<00:06:26.580> about<00:06:26.789> the

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
about and now we can talk about the

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:37.219 
about and now we can talk about the
development<00:06:27.690> process<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:35.810> for<00:06:36.810> this<00:06:36.930> game<00:06:37.110> we

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
development process and for this game we

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.499 
development process and for this game we
also<00:06:37.349> build<00:06:37.680> a<00:06:37.830> our<00:06:38.370> own<00:06:38.639> graphics

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
also build a our own graphics

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.499 
also build a our own graphics
configuration<00:06:40.139> system<00:06:40.500> and<00:06:40.770> and<00:06:41.069> of<00:06:41.880> input

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
configuration system and and of input

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.839 
configuration system and and of input
configuration<00:06:43.020> so<00:06:43.110> we<00:06:43.199> can<00:06:43.380> actually<00:06:43.849> change

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849 
configuration so we can actually change

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.409 
configuration so we can actually change
all<00:06:45.120> the<00:06:45.270> input<00:06:45.539> keys<00:06:46.759> with<00:06:47.759> our<00:06:47.909> own<00:06:48.120> system

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
all the input keys with our own system

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.210 
all the input keys with our own system
because<00:06:48.659> a<00:06:48.690> unity<00:06:49.409> system<00:06:49.680> doesn't<00:06:49.860> support

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
because a unity system doesn't support

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.149 
because a unity system doesn't support
that<00:06:50.400> all<00:06:51.330> the<00:06:51.479> graphics<00:06:51.930> and<00:06:52.229> and<00:06:52.770> everything

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:53.159 
that all the graphics and and everything

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.960 
that all the graphics and and everything
I<00:06:54.259> think<00:06:55.259> that's<00:06:55.590> it<00:06:55.770> if<00:06:56.520> you<00:06:56.580> want<00:06:56.759> to<00:06:56.849> see

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
I think that's it if you want to see

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.990 
I think that's it if you want to see
more<00:06:57.120> of<00:06:57.509> the<00:06:57.690> game<00:06:57.810> you<00:06:57.960> can<00:06:58.430> can<00:06:59.430> come<00:06:59.699> to<00:06:59.880> us

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
more of the game you can can come to us

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.460 
more of the game you can can come to us
after<00:07:00.180> representation<00:07:00.930> and<00:07:01.110> now<00:07:01.229> we<00:07:01.289> are

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
after representation and now we are

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.990 
after representation and now we are
going<00:07:01.650> to<00:07:01.740> talk<00:07:01.919> about<00:07:02.130> the<00:07:02.400> development

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
going to talk about the development

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.149 
going to talk about the development
process<00:07:03.210> itself<00:07:03.780> and<00:07:04.020> some<00:07:04.710> time<00:07:06.919> from<00:07:07.919> time

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:08.159 
process itself and some time from time

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:09.649 
process itself and some time from time
to<00:07:08.310> time<00:07:08.340> will<00:07:08.669> be<00:07:08.789> changing<00:07:09.240> back<00:07:09.389> to<00:07:09.419> the

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:09.659 
to time will be changing back to the

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:12.860 
to time will be changing back to the
game<00:07:09.840> and<00:07:10.080> showing<00:07:10.320> some<00:07:11.150> some<00:07:12.150> stuff<00:07:12.389> lively

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
inside the editor or inside the game

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.499 
inside the editor or inside the game
itself<00:07:15.020> okay<00:07:16.020> so<00:07:16.800> can<00:07:17.490> we<00:07:17.550> change<00:07:18.030> back<00:07:18.240> to<00:07:18.270> the

itself okay so can we change back to the

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:25.060 
itself okay so can we change back to the
presentation<00:07:18.960> machine

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070
