have all been overclocked as you guys
all<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.870> run<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> our<00:01:01.350> GPU<00:01:01.739> tests

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.130 
all know we run all of our GPU tests
overclocked<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.930> any

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
overclocked so that will not be any

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.630 
overclocked so that will not be any
different<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.129> without<00:01:05.220> further<00:01:05.519> ado

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
different here and without further ado

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.859 
different here and without further ado
we're<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> jump<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.540> into<00:01:06.689> my

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
we're going to jump right into my

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.960 
we're going to jump right into my
benchmarking<00:01:07.350> run

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.880 

so<00:01:16.480> I<00:01:16.510> do<00:01:16.630> this<00:01:16.780> benchmark<00:01:17.050> on<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.380> Singapore

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
so I do this benchmark on the Singapore

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.500 
so I do this benchmark on the Singapore
mission<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.340> like<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.670> start<00:01:18.850> benchmarks<00:01:19.360> on

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
mission I like to start benchmarks on

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.330 
mission I like to start benchmarks on
chapter<00:01:20.170> starts<00:01:20.500> for<00:01:20.920> Battlefield

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
chapter starts for Battlefield

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.890 
chapter starts for Battlefield
especially<00:01:21.760> because<00:01:21.910> that's<00:01:22.330> kind<00:01:22.720> of<00:01:22.750> how

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
especially because that's kind of how

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.080 
especially because that's kind of how
the<00:01:22.960> safe<00:01:23.260> safe<00:01:23.890> system<00:01:24.250> works<00:01:24.460> so<00:01:24.580> if<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:24.910> do<00:01:25.060> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
the safe safe system works so if we do a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.160 
the safe safe system works so if we do a
chapter<00:01:25.330> start<00:01:25.630> mission<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:25.930> will<00:01:26.050> work

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
chapter start mission that will work

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.190 
chapter start mission that will work
well<00:01:27.120> one<00:01:28.120> thing<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.420> note<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.720> I'm<00:01:28.810> recording

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.150 
with fraps where it was throwing this
crazy<00:01:42.850> rainbow<00:01:43.240> effect<00:01:43.690> everywhere<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.350> it

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
crazy rainbow effect everywhere and it

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.940 
crazy rainbow effect everywhere and it
made<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.520> basically<00:01:46.270> unwatchable<00:01:46.720> if<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.740> had

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
made it basically unwatchable if you had

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.060 
made it basically unwatchable if you had
any<00:01:48.100> problems<00:01:48.460> with<00:01:48.490> epilepsy<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.570> I<00:01:50.070> decided

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
any problems with epilepsy so I decided

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.830 
any problems with epilepsy so I decided
I'll<00:01:51.250> try<00:01:51.580> recording<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.180> shadow<00:01:52.420> play<00:01:52.630> and

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
I'll try recording a shadow play and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.180 
I'll try recording a shadow play and
actually<00:01:52.960> work<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.440> I'm<00:01:53.680> pretty<00:01:53.890> happy<00:01:54.040> about

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
actually work as I'm pretty happy about

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.100 
actually work as I'm pretty happy about
that<00:01:54.400> when<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.240> get<00:01:55.360> up<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.660> beach<00:01:55.840> here

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
that when you get up to the beach here

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.600 
that when you get up to the beach here
when<00:01:56.260> you<00:01:56.320> try<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.530> get<00:01:56.680> out<00:01:56.800> of<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.980> boat<00:01:57.220> do

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
when you try and get out of the boat do

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.910 
when you try and get out of the boat do
not<00:01:57.790> try<00:01:58.150> and<00:01:58.180> move<00:01:58.510> until<00:01:59.110> he<00:01:59.260> brings<00:01:59.470> his<00:01:59.710> gun

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
not try and move until he brings his gun

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.710 
not try and move until he brings his gun
fully<00:02:00.220> up<00:02:00.400> because<00:02:00.790> if<00:02:00.910> you<00:02:00.940> do<00:02:01.240> for<00:02:01.510> some

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
fully up because if you do for some

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.140 
fully up because if you do for some
reason<00:02:02.020> he<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.170> jumps<00:02:02.500> back<00:02:02.650> in<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.890> boat

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
reason he just jumps back in the boat

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.460 
reason he just jumps back in the boat
which<00:02:04.150> is<00:02:04.180> really<00:02:04.780> frustrating<00:02:04.930> when<00:02:05.350> you

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
which is really frustrating when you

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.100 
which is really frustrating when you
have<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:06.010> free<00:02:06.400> watch<00:02:06.550> cutscenes<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.330> retry

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
have to free watch cutscenes to retry

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.250 
have to free watch cutscenes to retry
ignition<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.770> yeah<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.460> recommend<00:02:09.880> not<00:02:10.840> moving

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
ignition so yeah I recommend not moving

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
ignition so yeah I recommend not moving
till<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.740> brings<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.040> gonna<00:02:12.250> try<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.940> kill<00:02:13.210> guys

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
till I brings is gonna try to kill guys

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.000 
till I brings is gonna try to kill guys
in<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> consistent<00:02:14.110> order<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.650> want<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.860> try

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
in a consistent order you want to try

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.440 
in a consistent order you want to try
and<00:02:15.100> kill<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.250> same<00:02:15.520> people<00:02:15.700> every<00:02:15.880> time<00:02:16.180> to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
and kill the same people every time to

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.570 
and kill the same people every time to
keep<00:02:16.570> consistency<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.350> especially<00:02:18.130> that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
keep consistency up especially that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.340 
keep consistency up especially that
turret<00:02:18.910> gunner<00:02:19.090> because<00:02:19.630> if<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.989> don't<00:02:20.200> get

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
turret gunner because if you don't get

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.080 
turret gunner because if you don't get
him<00:02:20.560> down<00:02:20.739> things<00:02:21.160> will<00:02:21.400> change<00:02:21.430> quickly

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
him down things will change quickly

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390 
him down things will change quickly
because<00:02:22.390> he<00:02:22.510> will<00:02:22.690> wreck<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.220> those<00:02:24.220> guys

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
because he will wreck you those guys

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.280 
because he will wreck you those guys
nicely<00:02:25.030> flying<00:02:25.300> up<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.720> hill<00:02:25.870> every

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
nicely flying up on the hill every

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.560 
nicely flying up on the hill every
single<00:02:26.590> time<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:27.070> allow<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.270> mow<00:02:28.390> them

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
single time just allow you to mow them

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.900 
single time just allow you to mow them
down<00:02:28.680> make<00:02:29.680> sure<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:29.980> mark<00:02:30.190> those<00:02:30.459> guys<00:02:30.670> with

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
down make sure you mark those guys with

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.640 
down make sure you mark those guys with
QE<00:02:31.239> gotta<00:02:31.480> point<00:02:31.690> out<00:02:31.900> them<00:02:32.020> extremely

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
QE gotta point out them extremely

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.710 
QE gotta point out them extremely
effectively<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.790> tank<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.180> ready<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.540> take

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
effectively so the tank is ready to take

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.900 
effectively so the tank is ready to take
them<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:34.959> with<00:02:35.080> one<00:02:35.290> giant<00:02:35.530> blast<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.670> makes

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
them out with one giant blast that makes

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.840 
them out with one giant blast that makes
the<00:02:37.030> rest<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.390> benchmark<00:02:37.780> really<00:02:38.140> easy

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
the rest of the benchmark really easy

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.979 
the rest of the benchmark really easy
and<00:02:39.850> then<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.000> just<00:02:40.239> get<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.450> stand<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.810> top<00:02:40.930> of

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
and then you just get to stand on top of

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.949 
and then you just get to stand on top of
the<00:02:41.110> rock<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.560> pick<00:02:41.709> people<00:02:41.739> down

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
the rock and pick people down

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.949 
the rock and pick people down
once<00:02:43.799> we<00:02:43.980> get<00:02:44.099> these<00:02:44.250> two<00:02:44.310> kills<00:02:44.849> here<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.480> I

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
once we get these two kills here and I

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.130 
once we get these two kills here and I
run<00:02:46.200> out<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.349> ammo<00:02:47.150> at<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.359> convenient<00:02:48.870> times

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
run out of ammo at that convenient times

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.349 
run out of ammo at that convenient times
they're<00:02:49.590> all<00:02:49.739> dead<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.819> can<00:02:51.000> move<00:02:51.150> up<00:02:51.329> the

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
they're all dead we can move up the

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:51.920 
they're all dead we can move up the
beachhead

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
beachhead

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.229 
beachhead
and<00:02:52.140> when<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.159> get<00:02:53.340> up<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.640> top<00:02:53.879> here<00:02:54.090> we're

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
and when we get up to the top here we're

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.610 
and when we get up to the top here we're
just<00:02:54.269> going<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.569> throw<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.840> few<00:02:55.019> grenades<00:02:55.379> at<00:02:55.590> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
just going to throw a few grenades at a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.920 
just going to throw a few grenades at a
clearing<00:02:56.099> kill<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> personnel<00:02:57.209> carrier<00:02:57.629> and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
clearing kill a personnel carrier and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.289 
clearing kill a personnel carrier and
then<00:02:58.409> shoot<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.739> few<00:02:58.950> times<00:02:59.219> in<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.579> air<00:02:59.609> just

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
then shoot a few times in the air just

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.910 
then shoot a few times in the air just
as<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.629> benchmark<00:03:00.930> ends<00:03:01.439> just<00:03:01.650> because<00:03:01.799> we

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
as the benchmark ends just because we

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.259 
as the benchmark ends just because we
don't<00:03:02.040> want<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> action<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:02.760> stop<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
don't want the action to stop in the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.970 
don't want the action to stop in the
last<00:03:03.480> second<00:03:03.810> or<00:03:03.900> two<00:03:04.109> so<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.680> personnel

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
last second or two so the personnel

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.039 
last second or two so the personnel
carrier<00:03:05.310> blows<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.700> hell<00:03:05.849> up<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:06.870> we

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
carrier blows the hell up and then we

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.509 
carrier blows the hell up and then we
shoot<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.290> few<00:03:07.439> times<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.889> your<00:03:08.010> benchmark<00:03:08.370> and

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
shoot a few times in your benchmark and

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.629 
shoot a few times in your benchmark and
go<00:03:08.760> right<00:03:09.060> around<00:03:09.180> here<00:03:10.219> the<00:03:11.219> story's<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.549> bit

launch video it showed that 290x when
overclocked<00:03:16.349> lost<00:03:16.980> against<00:03:17.310> an<00:03:17.459> overclocked

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
overclocked lost against an overclocked

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.509 
overclocked lost against an overclocked
780<00:03:18.419> but<00:03:18.720> when<00:03:18.840> they<00:03:18.959> are<00:03:19.019> both<00:03:19.230> stock<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.889> won

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
780 but when they are both stock it won

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.429 
780 but when they are both stock it won
in<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:21.239> case<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:21.659> actually<00:03:21.780> better<00:03:22.200> in

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
in this case it's actually better in

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.170 
in this case it's actually better in
both<00:03:22.590> cases<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:22.980> wins<00:03:23.280> stock<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:24.030> wins

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
both cases that wins stock and it wins

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.089 
both cases that wins stock and it wins
overclocked<00:03:24.750> which<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.500> not<00:03:25.680> super

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
overclocked which is not super

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.349 
overclocked which is not super
surprising<00:03:26.220> as<00:03:26.669> battlefield<00:03:27.120> 4<00:03:27.329> is

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
surprising as battlefield 4 is

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.259 
surprising as battlefield 4 is
predominantly<00:03:27.930> an<00:03:28.049> AMD<00:03:28.290> title<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.269> looking

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
predominantly an AMD title and looking

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.819 
predominantly an AMD title and looking
down<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.480> line<00:03:30.629> with<00:03:30.840> both<00:03:31.019> teams<00:03:31.260> optimizing

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
down the line with both teams optimizing

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:32.929 
down the line with both teams optimizing
drivers<00:03:32.159> we<00:03:32.340> don't<00:03:32.489> really<00:03:32.579> know<00:03:32.730> where<00:03:32.849> this

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
drivers we don't really know where this

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.399 
drivers we don't really know where this
is<00:03:33.060> going<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.269> end<00:03:33.450> up<00:03:33.629> but<00:03:34.109> then<00:03:34.290> again

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
is going to end up but then again

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.110 
is going to end up but then again
eventually<00:03:34.980> mantle<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.639> going<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.819> come<00:03:36.000> out

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
eventually mantle is going to come out

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.069 
eventually mantle is going to come out
and<00:03:36.239> that's<00:03:36.299> going<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> throw<00:03:36.719> everything<00:03:36.780> on

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
and that's going to throw everything on

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.289 
and that's going to throw everything on
its<00:03:37.230> head<00:03:37.349> again<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.310> we're<00:03:39.000> going<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.150> go

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
its head again so we're going to go

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.640 
its head again so we're going to go
along<00:03:39.419> this<00:03:39.689> ride<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:39.930> just<00:03:40.200> see<00:03:40.349> how<00:03:40.500> it

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
along this ride and just see how it

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.959 
along this ride and just see how it
turns<00:03:40.859> out<00:03:41.069> we<00:03:41.159> will<00:03:41.280> obviously<00:03:41.489> have<00:03:41.909> a

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:41.969 
turns out we will obviously have a

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.699 
turns out we will obviously have a
mantel<00:03:42.329> video<00:03:42.540> when<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.989> starts<00:03:43.290> becoming<00:03:43.590> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
mantel video when that starts becoming a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.500 
mantel video when that starts becoming a
thing<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.159> we'll<00:03:44.730> cover<00:03:44.849> as<00:03:45.000> many<00:03:45.180> games<00:03:45.359> as

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
thing and we'll cover as many games as

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.659 
thing and we'll cover as many games as
we<00:03:45.659> possibly<00:03:46.049> can<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.560> these<00:03:47.099> benchmarks

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
we possibly can and these benchmarks

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.819 
we possibly can and these benchmarks
like<00:03:47.729> I<00:03:47.940> just<00:03:48.000> said<00:03:48.419> AMD<00:03:48.930> arcs<00:03:49.169> out<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.349> win<00:03:49.590> and

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
like I just said AMD arcs out a win and

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.800 
like I just said AMD arcs out a win and
ends<00:03:50.489> up<00:03:50.609> on<00:03:50.790> top<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.359> many<00:03:51.629> different

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
ends up on top in many different

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.409 
ends up on top in many different
categories<00:03:52.139> and<00:03:52.739> again<00:03:53.699> that<00:03:54.060> wasn't<00:03:54.269> that

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
categories and again that wasn't that

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.449 
categories and again that wasn't that
surprising<00:03:54.900> if<00:03:55.199> you<00:03:55.650> liked<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.979> video<00:03:56.099> like

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
surprising if you liked the video like

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.800 
surprising if you liked the video like
the<00:03:56.609> video<00:03:56.819> if<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.000> disliked<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.569> video

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
the video if you disliked the video

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.689 
the video if you disliked the video
dislike<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.439> video<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.949> in<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.310> comments

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
dislike the video and in the comments

dislike the video and in the comments
below<00:03:59.819> is<00:04:00.209> there<00:04:00.359> any<00:04:00.540> gaming<00:04:00.840> benchmarking

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500

in<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.389> future<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.810> named<00:04:04.139> off<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.319> bunch<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
in the future I named off a bunch of the

in the future I named off a bunch of the
beginning<00:04:05.099> of<00:04:05.159> this<00:04:05.250> video<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.879> I<00:04:05.970> just<00:04:06.000> named

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
beginning of this video and I just named

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.869 
beginning of this video and I just named
off<00:04:06.569> at<00:04:06.870> least<00:04:07.169> one<00:04:07.379> as<00:04:07.530> well<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.949> is<00:04:08.729> there
