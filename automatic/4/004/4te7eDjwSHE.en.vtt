00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
a utensil holder and I thought I would

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.330 
a utensil holder and I thought I would
try<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.120> use<00:00:12.420> my<00:00:12.500> new<00:00:13.500> jig<00:00:14.900> so<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.960> start<00:00:16.350> I'll

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
try and use my new jig so to start I'll

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.570 
try and use my new jig so to start I'll
use<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.730> piece<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.000> oak<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.740> comes<00:00:20.520> from

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
use this piece of oak this is comes from

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.880 
use this piece of oak this is comes from
a<00:00:20.789> pallet<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.930> I'll<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.260> take<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.619> piece

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
a pallet so I'll just take this piece

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.910 
a pallet so I'll just take this piece
and<00:00:23.100> cut<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.550> size<00:00:24.019> so<00:00:25.019> there's<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> few<00:00:25.650> nail

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and cut it to size so there's a few nail

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.790 
and cut it to size so there's a few nail
holes<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.400> these<00:00:26.519> piece<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:28.170> best<00:00:28.410> way<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
holes in these piece so the best way is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.049 
holes in these piece so the best way is
just<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.220> me<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.699> cut<00:00:30.000> them<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.240> out

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.819 

so<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> height<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> box<00:00:36.809> will<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.200> 5

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
so the height of the box will be 5

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.660 
so the height of the box will be 5
inches
