00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.210
 Welcome to Schwörer TV 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.209
 Energy-saving building and living stand 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.860
 in this contribution in the foreground the 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.230
 Basis of the Schwörer energy saving 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.769
 concept is a highly thermally insulated 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.769
 building envelope 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.050
 such a well- insulated house has one 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.150
 extremely low energy consumption 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.180
 conventional heaters the oil gas or 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.180
 pellet heaters while therefore significantly 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.210
 oversized 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.670
 important for such a heavily insulated house 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.059
 is a continuous ventilation with 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.489
 as little heat loss as possible 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.120
 Fresh air heating means 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.450
 controlled living room ventilation with 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.410
 heat recovery and integrated 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.710
 Heat pump as basic heating to 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.240
 heating a particularly cold days 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.450
 support small ceramic 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.070
 heating elements in the air outlets the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.780
 Heat pump in the Schwörer heat directly house 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.460
 become the highly thermally insulated 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.980
 Building envelope and the innovative 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.490
 Fresh air heating system with each other 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.490
 united 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.130
 fresh air is sucked pollen dust 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.310
 and pollutants from the fresh air 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.140
 are largely filtered out 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.270
 There are special ones for air filters 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.570
 The heat exchanger installed quickly 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.920
 and can be easily exchanged 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.600
 in the heat exchanger is the fresh 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.130
 outside air contactless with the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.610
 Energy content of the warm exhaust air 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.760
 preheated the preheated fresh air 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.640
 is heated to 35 to 40 by the heat pump 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.380
 Grad warms the warm healthy 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.360
 Fresh air becomes the individual 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.470
 living areas permanent and draft-free 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.570
 fed before the fresh air in 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.210
 distributed to the individual living areas 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.000
 if needed with ptc 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.070
 Elements continue to be heated for this 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.740
 are in the rooms 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.560
 room thermostats in kitchen bathroom and toilet will 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.870
 the used air sucked off disturbing 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.910
 odors and water vapor, for example 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.920
 disappear by cooking or showering 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.450
 characterized quickly from the evacuate the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.410
 used air is in the heat exchanger 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.410
 supplied 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.379
 In the heat exchanger, the exhaust air is the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.750
 heat withdrawn 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.670
 the energy content of the warm exhaust air is 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.920
 non-contact to the fresh outside air 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.329
 transfer 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.810
 The exhaust air is passed through the heat pump 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.340
 further cooled 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.709
 the used air is released 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.659
 directed 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.939
 heat directly homes are energy efficient 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.709
 and future-proof buildings with lots 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.120
 Comfort 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.849
 For example , the air supply can be in the summer 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.159
 to be cooled and, above all, for 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.319
 Allergy sufferers are the best of these houses 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.730
 suitable for dust and dust 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.780
 pollutants are becoming widespread 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.299
 filtered 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:25.870
 a good example is that 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:28.569
 Client house of the family Jansen Tor ran 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.180
 every day and cortisone suppositories were there 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.319
 actually in wochenration with us 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.359
 Miriam actually lived on one 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.669
 asthma applicable to the next one as soon as he 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.540
 she was already over 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.430
 on the 9th 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.940
 she did not even have two weeks 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.620
 rest in between and as soon as we get into this 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.239
 house moved 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.360
 knows with the attacks over inside 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.329
 two to three weeks became more 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.250
 healthy so we have many many nights 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.170
 carrying her on our arm in ours 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.579
 old house always spent after 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.079
 look for moist air so that 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:05.329
 your breathing then relaxes and yes this 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.360
 Nights become for us as we in the 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.159
 new swans have moved out and the 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.709
 pediatrician was very enthusiastic and also 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.420
 So he pushes this sound evaluation of 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.370
 miriam actually on the healthy 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.500
 building materials used here by Schwörer 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.000
 and of course on the 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.580
 integrated ventilation through the heat 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.740
 win technology a positive side effect 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.990
 is for us too that we during the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.330
 transition time completely on the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.070
 radiators can do without that alone 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.740
 the heat gain technology reaches to the 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.539
 make rooms homely 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.100
 So we also save in the 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.250
 Transition times and also at winter time 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.320
 a quantity heizkosten 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.419
 I think it's great that we're in ours 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.639
 house always have fresh air 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.280
 when i come out of the shower, for example 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.449
 the mirror does not fog up 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.639
 as others today after ten years 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.520
 we are still feeling well all around 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.070
 our swan house in may and june 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.320
 In 2008, sweltering heat became direct 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.830
 Homeowner on the satisfaction and 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.470
 the energy consumption questioned came 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.479
 out that mainly between 26 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.130
 and 30 kilowatt hours of electricity per 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.620
 square meter of usable area 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.780
 are consumed by the following 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.639
 For example, we would like to show you how 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.889
 this consumption is in a 150 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.330
 square meter house on the 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.180
 monthly costs 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.669
 at a price of electricity of 15 cents per 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.020
 kilowatt hour price first july 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.729
 In 2008 they will raise 638 euros and 40 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.189
 cent of electricity costs per year 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:42.710
 that means the monthly consumption 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.580
 amounts to only 53 eur 20 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.050
 further information to 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.150
 energy consumption as well
