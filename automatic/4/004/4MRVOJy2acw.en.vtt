Theater tours the interesting thing

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.790 
Theater tours the interesting thing
about<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.900> ePro<00:00:23.590> is<00:00:23.950> for<00:00:24.940> me<00:00:25.120> it's<00:00:25.960> feel<00:00:26.410> is

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
about the ePro is for me it's feel is

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.180 
about the ePro is for me it's feel is
just<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.780> drum<00:00:29.110> set<00:00:29.350> and<00:00:29.560> that's<00:00:29.860> what

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
just like a drum set and that's what

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.900 
just like a drum set and that's what
makes<00:00:30.430> it<00:00:30.580> special<00:00:30.730> for<00:00:31.060> me<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:31.600> it<00:00:31.780> also<00:00:32.910> it

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
makes it special for me and it also it

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.400 
makes it special for me and it also it
needs<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.329> be<00:00:34.449> something<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:35.140> has<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.350> be

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
needs to be something that has to be

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.529 
needs to be something that has to be
understood<00:00:35.920> in<00:00:36.340> that<00:00:36.399> it's<00:00:36.789> not<00:00:36.999> trying<00:00:37.269> to<00:00:37.390> be

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
understood in that it's not trying to be

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.200 
understood in that it's not trying to be
something<00:00:37.960> else<00:00:38.769> like<00:00:39.100> a<00:00:39.129> regular<00:00:39.489> electronic

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
something else like a regular electronic

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.509 
something else like a regular electronic
kit<00:00:40.390> there<00:00:40.899> are<00:00:41.079> electronic<00:00:41.769> kits<00:00:41.980> out<00:00:42.249> there

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
kit there are electronic kits out there

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.270 
kit there are electronic kits out there
but<00:00:42.760> this<00:00:42.940> one<00:00:42.999> when<00:00:43.989> I<00:00:44.050> practice<00:00:44.620> on<00:00:44.829> it<00:00:44.859> it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
but this one when I practice on it it

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.660 
but this one when I practice on it it
makes<00:00:45.699> me<00:00:46.210> hit<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.890> way<00:00:48.069> that<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.399> pads

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
makes me hit and the way that the pads

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.419 
makes me hit and the way that the pads
respond<00:00:49.329> is<00:00:49.569> exactly<00:00:50.379> like<00:00:50.589> a<00:00:50.649> drum<00:00:51.010> head<00:00:51.039> I

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
respond is exactly like a drum head I

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:52.950 
respond is exactly like a drum head I
mean<00:00:51.760> it's<00:00:51.909> it's<00:00:52.120> not<00:00:52.329> like<00:00:52.539> it's<00:00:52.690> hitting<00:00:52.870> a

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
mean it's it's not like it's hitting a

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.139 
mean it's it's not like it's hitting a
rubber<00:00:53.170> pad<00:00:53.469> and<00:00:53.800> bouncing<00:00:54.129> up<00:00:54.249> too<00:00:54.429> high<00:00:54.639> or

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
rubber pad and bouncing up too high or

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.619 
rubber pad and bouncing up too high or
just<00:00:55.479> doesn't<00:00:56.109> have<00:00:56.409> the<00:00:56.440> right<00:00:56.859> feel<00:00:57.629> this

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
just doesn't have the right feel this

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.709 
just doesn't have the right feel this
one<00:00:58.839> does<00:00:59.139> so<00:00:59.350> the<00:01:00.339> way<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:00.489> look<00:01:00.789> at<00:01:00.999> it<00:01:01.030> is<00:01:01.389> to

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
one does so the way I look at it is to

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.569 
one does so the way I look at it is to
let<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.109> be<00:01:02.260> what<00:01:02.530> it<00:01:02.620> is<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:03.039> understand

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
let it be what it is and to understand

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.510 
let it be what it is and to understand
why<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:03.999> was<00:01:04.269> designed<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.650> get<00:01:05.860> that<00:01:06.100> then

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
why it was designed if you get that then

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.819 
why it was designed if you get that then
you'll<00:01:06.940> have<00:01:07.120> as<00:01:07.270> much<00:01:07.299> joy<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.110> usage<00:01:08.530> from

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
you'll have as much joy and usage from

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.929 
you'll have as much joy and usage from
it<00:01:09.039> as<00:01:09.189> me<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:10.630> I'm<00:01:11.590> using<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.189> practice<00:01:12.759> I

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
it as me so I'm using it to practice I

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.789 
it as me so I'm using it to practice I
use<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.329> at<00:01:13.420> home<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:14.049> can<00:01:14.200> see<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.530> in<00:01:14.680> the
