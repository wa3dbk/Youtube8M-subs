some<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.360> guess<00:00:12.840> compensation<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:14.070> all<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
some I guess compensation for all the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.550 
some I guess compensation for all the
mistakes<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.509> think<00:00:15.780> Rockstar<00:00:16.260> really

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
mistakes and I think Rockstar really

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.130 
mistakes and I think Rockstar really
realized<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:18.600> servers<00:00:19.020> weren't<00:00:19.369> to<00:00:20.369> be

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
realized that the servers weren't to be

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.750 
realized that the servers weren't to be
what<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.320> would<00:00:22.470> expect<00:00:22.890> from<00:00:23.039> Rockstar<00:00:23.580> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
what you would expect from Rockstar and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.359 
what you would expect from Rockstar and
I<00:00:23.820> think<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.180> analogy<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.369> they're

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I think they analogy that and they're

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.160 
I think they analogy that and they're
doing<00:00:26.640> something<00:00:26.939> kind<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> unique<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
doing something kind of unique now I

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.689

here<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> second<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.019> think<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:31.949> great

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
here in a second but I think it's great

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
here in a second but I think it's great
not<00:00:33.149> only<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.420> they're<00:00:33.690> doing<00:00:33.989> something<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710

thing<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.159> do<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.519> they<00:02:20.790> realized<00:02:21.180> if

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
thing to do because they realized if

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.839 
thing to do because they realized if
every<00:02:21.689> single<00:02:21.959> player<00:02:22.140> get<00:02:22.379> 500,000<00:02:23.280> it's

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
going to ruin the economy so instead of

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.099 
going to ruin the economy so instead of
giving<00:02:26.250> everybody<00:02:26.640> 500,000<00:02:27.540> all<00:02:27.659> at<00:02:27.900> once

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
giving everybody 500,000 all at once

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.020 
giving everybody 500,000 all at once
they're<00:02:28.829> going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.189> to<00:02:29.430> random<00:02:29.790> dates

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
they're going to have to random dates

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.280 
they're going to have to random dates
that<00:02:30.180> they<00:02:30.269> haven't<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.629> found<00:02:30.900> out<00:02:31.109> which

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that they haven't really found out which

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
on grand theft auto 5 and I thought that

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.050 
on grand theft auto 5 and I thought that
was<00:02:40.829> kind<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.099> cool<00:02:41.159> because<00:02:41.459> they're

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
was kind of cool because they're

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.780 
was kind of cool because they're
realizing<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.780> every<00:02:43.079> single<00:02:43.349> person<00:02:43.650> has

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
realizing if every single person has

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.330 
realizing if every single person has
500,000<00:02:44.790> there's<00:02:45.510> going<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.019> be<00:02:46.340> extremely

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
500,000 there's going to be extremely

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.119 
500,000 there's going to be extremely
more<00:02:48.269> Bugattis<00:02:48.840> extremely<00:02:49.560> more<00:02:49.709> cheetahs

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
more Bugattis extremely more cheetahs

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.220 
more Bugattis extremely more cheetahs
extremely<00:02:50.730> more<00:02:50.879> helicopters<00:02:51.209> extreme<00:02:52.019> more

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230

Jets<00:02:52.530> titans<00:02:53.189> what<00:02:53.609> do<00:02:53.700> we<00:02:53.790> want<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.120> say<00:02:54.299> tanks

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
Jets titans what do we want to say tanks

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.190 
Jets titans what do we want to say tanks
and<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:56.340> think<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:56.909> definitely<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.870> to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
and I think that's definitely going to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.319 
and I think that's definitely going to
be<00:02:58.409> something<00:02:59.310> that's<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.849> right

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
be something that's going to be right

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.119 
be something that's going to be right
you<00:03:00.659> know<00:03:00.689> if<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.439> spread<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.859> out<00:03:01.919> a<00:03:01.980> couple

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
you know if they spread it out a couple

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.530 
you know if they spread it out a couple
weeks<00:03:02.519> for<00:03:02.790> each<00:03:02.849> one<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.239> them<00:03:03.389> I<00:03:03.480> think

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
weeks for each one of them I think

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.119 
weeks for each one of them I think
that'd<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:03.989> great<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.470> they<00:03:04.680> wait<00:03:04.889> a<00:03:04.919> little

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
that'd be great if they wait a little

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.190 
that'd be great if they wait a little
bit<00:03:05.280> longer<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.819> can<00:03:06.269> see<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.629> being<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:07.019> little

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
bit longer I can see it being a little

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.979 
bit longer I can see it being a little
bit<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.730> guess<00:03:08.730> better<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.450> they<00:03:09.659> would<00:03:09.810> wait

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
bit I guess better if they would wait

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.470 
bit I guess better if they would wait
even<00:03:10.260> longer<00:03:10.409> than<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:11.069> but<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.909> can<00:03:12.060> also<00:03:12.209> see

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
even longer than that but I can also see

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.179 
even longer than that but I can also see
both<00:03:12.659> sides<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.139> argument<00:03:13.290> here<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:13.919> I'm

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
both sides of the argument here so I'm

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.559 
both sides of the argument here so I'm
not<00:03:14.310> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.489> go<00:03:14.639> ahead<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.879> argue<00:03:15.450> about

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
not going to go ahead and argue about

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.879 
not going to go ahead and argue about
this<00:03:15.780> anymore<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.200> think<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.620> great<00:03:16.769> that

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
this anymore I think it's great that

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.069 
this anymore I think it's great that
Rockstar<00:03:17.489> stood<00:03:17.819> up<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.389> their<00:03:18.510> actions<00:03:18.690> and

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
Rockstar stood up for their actions and

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.020 
Rockstar stood up for their actions and
took<00:03:19.260> responsibility<00:03:19.579> you<00:03:20.579> know<00:03:20.609> it's<00:03:20.819> it's

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
took responsibility you know it's it's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.689 
took responsibility you know it's it's
