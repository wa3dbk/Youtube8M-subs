00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
basically the waters really warm over

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.619 
basically the waters really warm over
here<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.460> try<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> really

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
here so you we do try and get you really

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.209 
here so you we do try and get you really
wet<00:00:48.780> other<00:00:49.170> than<00:00:49.289> New<00:00:49.440> Zealand<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.980> can't

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
wet other than New Zealand you can't

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
wet other than New Zealand you can't
because<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> water<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> too<00:00:51.239> cold<00:00:51.320> water<00:00:52.320> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
because the water is too cold water is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.430 
because the water is too cold water is
about<00:00:52.649> using<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.370> 25<00:00:53.879> 26<00:00:54.420> degrees<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.079> we

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
about using about 25 26 degrees so we

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.090 
about using about 25 26 degrees so we
basically<00:00:55.590> treasure<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.500> Sydney<00:00:58.980> no

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
basically treasure and in Sydney no

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.680 
basically treasure and in Sydney no
depth<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.670> obviously<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.210> much<00:01:00.270> traffic

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
depth is not obviously so much traffic

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
depth is not obviously so much traffic
that<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.109> pretty<00:01:01.260> hard<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> maneuver<00:01:01.800> s<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that it's pretty hard to maneuver s and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
that it's pretty hard to maneuver s and
they<00:01:02.579> take<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> long<00:01:03.359> time<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.930> down<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
they take a long time to get down to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.890 
they take a long time to get down to
different<00:01:04.619> phase<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> spins<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> lot
