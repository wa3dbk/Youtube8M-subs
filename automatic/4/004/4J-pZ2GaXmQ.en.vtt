00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
you need four shots at least to kill

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.770 
you need four shots at least to kill
something<00:01:40.000> you're<00:01:40.150> never<00:01:40.240> gonna<00:01:40.390> get<00:01:40.630> like

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
something you're never gonna get like

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.870 
something you're never gonna get like
you<00:01:41.080> know<00:01:41.200> anything<00:01:42.130> under<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.490> really

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
you know anything under that really

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.789 
you know anything under that really
unless<00:01:43.090> you're<00:01:43.270> really<00:01:43.360> close<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.260> right

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
unless you're really close and right

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.260 
unless you're really close and right
there<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.490> bad<00:01:45.640> thing<00:01:45.670> about<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:46.060> gun<00:01:46.240> is

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
there the bad thing about this gun is

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.910 
there the bad thing about this gun is
you<00:01:46.540> have<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:46.810> reach<00:01:47.049> aim<00:01:47.290> burritt<00:01:47.500> every<00:01:47.710> four

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
you have to reach aim burritt every four

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.800 
you have to reach aim burritt every four
shots<00:01:48.189> so<00:01:48.430> it<00:01:48.970> doesn't<00:01:49.330> really<00:01:49.450> work<00:01:49.570> out

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
shots so it doesn't really work out

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.109 
shots so it doesn't really work out
sometimes<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.439> don't<00:01:50.619> have<00:01:50.799> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
sometimes and you don't have the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.800 
sometimes and you don't have the
sometimes<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.180> don't<00:01:52.270> have<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.540> time<00:01:52.750> to

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
sometimes you don't have the time to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.410 
sometimes you don't have the time to
retain<00:01:53.439> Brit<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:53.920> it's<00:01:54.520> it's<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.909> decent<00:01:55.270> shot

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
retain Brit so it's it's a decent shot

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.149 
retain Brit so it's it's a decent shot
gun<00:01:55.600> it's<00:01:55.750> up<00:01:55.840> there<00:01:55.930> with<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.140> s12<00:01:56.680> its<00:01:56.890> if

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
me a little bit but before I think I

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.420 
me a little bit but before I think I
think<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.540> had<00:02:28.630> like<00:02:28.720> nine<00:02:28.959> key<00:02:29.170> subs<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.680> did

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
think I had like nine key subs I did

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.410 
think I had like nine key subs I did
this<00:02:30.519> thing<00:02:30.730> where<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:30.940> would<00:02:31.180> randomly

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
this thing where I would randomly

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.050 
this thing where I would randomly
randomly<00:02:32.049> uphold<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:32.650> community<00:02:33.610> clips<00:02:33.850> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
randomly uphold like community clips and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.150 
randomly uphold like community clips and
that<00:02:34.180> was<00:02:34.329> really<00:02:34.690> stupid<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.200> me<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.590> to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
that was really stupid of me and to

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.770
