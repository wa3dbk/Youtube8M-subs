multitasking<00:00:36.579> a<00:00:36.640> switcher<00:00:37.420> here<00:00:37.629> so<00:00:37.780> before

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
multitasking a switcher here so before

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.049 
multitasking a switcher here so before
when<00:00:38.649> you<00:00:38.710> did<00:00:38.859> multitasking<00:00:39.460> it<00:00:39.579> just<00:00:39.850> showed

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
when you did multitasking it just showed

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.569 
when you did multitasking it just showed
you<00:00:40.179> the<00:00:40.300> icons<00:00:40.780> so<00:00:41.469> you'd<00:00:41.859> have<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.159> remember

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
you the icons so you'd have to remember

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.639 
you the icons so you'd have to remember
like<00:00:42.969> ok<00:00:43.269> which<00:00:43.390> icon<00:00:43.690> was<00:00:43.839> doing<00:00:44.079> what<00:00:44.260> or

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
like ok which icon was doing what or

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.290 
like ok which icon was doing what or
what<00:00:44.769> was<00:00:44.920> going<00:00:44.949> on<00:00:45.219> in<00:00:45.399> there<00:00:45.519> now<00:00:45.969> has<00:00:46.179> this

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
what was going on in there now has this

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.479 
what was going on in there now has this
card<00:00:46.600> system<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.109> this<00:00:47.199> strongly<00:00:47.890> resembles

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
card system and this strongly resembles

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.969 
card system and this strongly resembles
the<00:00:48.640> old<00:00:48.819> webos<00:00:49.629> from<00:00:49.899> palm<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.739> what's<00:00:50.920> great

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
the old webos from palm and what's great

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.559 
the old webos from palm and what's great
about<00:00:51.100> this<00:00:51.339> is<00:00:51.399> rather<00:00:51.909> than<00:00:52.089> just<00:00:52.389> seeing

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
about this is rather than just seeing

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.450 
about this is rather than just seeing
the<00:00:52.719> icon<00:00:53.139> now<00:00:53.319> you<00:00:53.379> see<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.649> preview<00:00:53.889> so<00:00:54.190> it

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
the icon now you see a preview so it

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.360 
the icon now you see a preview so it
helps<00:00:54.729> a<00:00:54.819> little<00:00:55.030> bit<00:00:55.300> um<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:57.039> helps<00:00:57.129> you<00:00:57.339> a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
helps a little bit um it helps you a

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.649 
helps a little bit um it helps you a
little<00:00:57.460> more<00:00:57.609> intuitive<00:00:58.059> on<00:00:58.179> jumping<00:00:58.539> between

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
little more intuitive on jumping between

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.719 
little more intuitive on jumping between
them<00:00:58.989> because<00:00:59.109> you<00:00:59.799> know<00:00:59.889> if<00:01:00.039> you're<00:01:00.219> inside

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
them because you know if you're inside

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.170 
them because you know if you're inside
of<00:01:01.120> if<00:01:01.899> you're<00:01:02.049> inside<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.969> application<00:01:03.969> you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
of if you're inside the application you

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.940 
of if you're inside the application you
recognize<00:01:04.750> what<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.050> application<00:01:05.200> looks

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
recognize what the application looks

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.460 
recognize what the application looks
like<00:01:06.190> while<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:07.510> know<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.720> icon<00:01:08.050> maybe<00:01:08.260> not

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
like while you know the icon maybe not

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.140 
like while you know the icon maybe not
quite<00:01:08.770> as<00:01:08.830> intuitive<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:09.910> get<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.030> little

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
quite as intuitive so you get a little

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.190 
quite as intuitive so you get a little
preview<00:01:10.360> there<00:01:10.690> and<00:01:10.840> also<00:01:11.020> give<00:01:11.140> you

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
preview there and also give you

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.170 
preview there and also give you
something<00:01:11.470> more<00:01:11.500> substantive<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.520> click<00:01:13.030> on

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
something more substantive to click on

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.250 
something more substantive to click on
so<00:01:13.330> this<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.540> pretty<00:01:13.660> cool<00:01:13.840> if<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:14.020> want

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
so this is pretty cool if you just want

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
so this is pretty cool if you just want
to<00:01:14.320> switch<00:01:14.470> between<00:01:14.620> them<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:15.100> know<00:01:15.160> if<00:01:15.220> you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
to switch between them you know if you

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520 
to switch between them you know if you
might<00:01:15.400> check<00:01:15.610> your<00:01:15.900> check<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.020> scores<00:01:17.290> real

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
might check your check the scores real

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.440 
might check your check the scores real
quick<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:17.980> also<00:01:18.340> for<00:01:18.520> me<00:01:18.730> it<00:01:18.970> feels<00:01:19.240> like

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
quick and also for me it feels like

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.070 
quick and also for me it feels like
unless<00:01:20.110> um<00:01:21.000> kind<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.060> going<00:01:22.600> in<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:22.930> out<00:01:23.020> of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
unless um kind of going in and out of

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.630 
unless um kind of going in and out of
the<00:01:23.290> application<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.010> really<00:01:24.190> feels<00:01:24.370> like<00:01:24.460> I'm

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
the application it really feels like I'm

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.250 
the application it really feels like I'm
switching<00:01:24.790> between<00:01:25.090> applications<00:01:25.480> makes<00:01:26.110> it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
switching between applications makes it

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.290 
switching between applications makes it

people<00:05:52.750> work<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.140> they<00:05:53.260> use<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.620> search<00:05:53.830> to

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
people work and they use the search to

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.200 
people work and they use the search to
find<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:54.580> actually<00:05:54.790> that's<00:05:54.970> more

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
find it and actually that's more

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.490 
find it and actually that's more
efficient<00:05:55.660> rather<00:05:55.870> than<00:05:55.930> spending<00:05:56.200> the<00:05:56.320> time

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
efficient rather than spending the time

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.440 
efficient rather than spending the time
categorizing<00:05:57.340> and<00:05:57.400> whatever<00:05:57.730> special<00:05:58.270> you're

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
categorizing and whatever special you're

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.790 
categorizing and whatever special you're
not<00:05:58.600> from<00:05:58.840> that<00:05:58.960> desktop<00:05:59.230> world<00:05:59.530> you're<00:05:59.680> not

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
not from that desktop world you're not

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.620 
not from that desktop world you're not
used<00:05:59.980> to<00:06:00.070> doing<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.490> so<00:06:00.910> it's<00:06:01.150> really<00:06:01.270> changed

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
used to doing it so it's really changed

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.180 
used to doing it so it's really changed
