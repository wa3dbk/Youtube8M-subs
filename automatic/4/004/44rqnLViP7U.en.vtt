00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.169 
alright guys I spent a lot of time
thinking<00:00:01.530> about<00:00:01.829> how<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:02.100> should<00:00:02.220> actually<00:00:02.550> do

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
thinking about how I should actually do

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.499 
thinking about how I should actually do
a<00:00:04.130> pvp<00:00:05.130> unholy<00:00:05.549> death<00:00:05.819> knight<00:00:06.000> rotation

a pvp unholy death knight rotation
thingy<00:00:07.160> priorities<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.340> guess<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:09.630> just<00:00:10.500> figured

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
thingy priorities I guess I just figured

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.230 
thingy priorities I guess I just figured
i'd<00:00:11.099> say<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.370> PVE<00:00:11.639> one<00:00:11.910> because<00:00:12.120> it's

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
i'd say the PVE one because it's

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.930 
i'd say the PVE one because it's
basically<00:00:12.540> how<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.809> do<00:00:13.049> damage<00:00:13.759> but<00:00:14.759> other

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
basically how you do damage but other

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.010 
basically how you do damage but other
than<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.540> really<00:00:15.870> confusing

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
than that it's really confusing

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.439 
than that it's really confusing
basically<00:00:16.980> your<00:00:17.640> first<00:00:17.850> priorities<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
basically your first priorities going to

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.390 
basically your first priorities going to
be<00:00:18.510> dark<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:18.720> transformation<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:20.189> enrage

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
be dark for transformation to enrage

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.330 
be dark for transformation to enrage
your<00:00:20.580> pet<00:00:20.760> always<00:00:21.300> even<00:00:22.140> more<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.710> pvp<00:00:23.100> than

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
your pet always even more so in pvp than

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.519 
your pet always even more so in pvp than
PvE<00:00:23.609> because<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> gives<00:00:24.269> your<00:00:24.420> pet<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
PvE because it gives your pet the

PvE because it gives your pet the

of a lot harder in and interrupt after
that<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.619> pretty<00:00:32.009> much<00:00:32.130> irritation<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.480> PVE

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that it pretty much irritation for PVE

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.139 
that it pretty much irritation for PVE
at<00:00:33.989> least<00:00:34.170> becomes<00:00:34.469> maintain<00:00:34.920> diseases<00:00:35.370> that

at least becomes maintain diseases that

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
at least becomes maintain diseases that
is<00:00:36.770> arguable<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.950> PvP<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:38.850> um<00:00:39.890> necrotic

strike doesn't necessarily require

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
strike doesn't necessarily require
diseases<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.230> diseases<00:00:43.469> don't

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
diseases and your diseases don't

diseases and your diseases don't
actually<00:00:44.070> hit<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.670> heart<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
actually hit all of that heart all that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
actually hit all of that heart all that
hard<00:00:45.570> um<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.250> scourge<00:00:48.149> strike<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:49.010> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
hard um then it's scourge strike and a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.319 
hard um then it's scourge strike and a
festering<00:00:50.399> strike<00:00:50.670> mainly<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> want

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
festering strike mainly because you want

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.090 
festering strike mainly because you want
to<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:51.840> runes<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.320> cooldown<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
to get all of your runes on cooldown so

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
to get all of your runes on cooldown so
that<00:00:53.250> when<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.520> hit<00:00:54.300> death<00:00:54.539> coil<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.050> takes

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that when you hit death coil it takes

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
that when you hit death coil it takes
off<00:00:55.469> roughly<00:00:56.129> three<00:00:56.430> seconds<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.059> brew

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
off roughly three seconds of your brew

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.779 
off roughly three seconds of your brew
and<00:00:57.960> cool<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:59.190> want<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.520> three

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and cool down you want to have all three

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.950 
and cool down you want to have all three
uncool<00:01:00.090> done<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> most<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.930> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
uncool done so you get the most out of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.540 
uncool done so you get the most out of
it<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.859> don't<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.219> current

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it if you don't know how the current

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.920 
it if you don't know how the current
system<00:01:02.670> works<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> probably<00:01:03.449> should<00:01:03.570> read<00:01:03.780> up

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
system works you probably should read up

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.420 
system works you probably should read up
on<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.199> because<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
on that because it's really not that

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.520 
on that because it's really not that
complicated<00:01:05.780> but<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.960> hard<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> explain

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
complicated but it's hard to explain

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410 
complicated but it's hard to explain
until<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.430> stare<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.330> your

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
until you actually like stare at your

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
until you actually like stare at your
ruined<00:01:09.720> bars<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.020> figure<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.350> anyway

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
ruined bars and figure it out anyway

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179 
ruined bars and figure it out anyway
after<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.710> basically<00:01:13.710> use<00:01:14.010> your

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
after that it's basically use your

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.580 
after that it's basically use your
second<00:01:14.490> set<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.729> ruins<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.720> PvP<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
second set of ruins of for PvP you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.520 
second set of ruins of for PvP you
probably<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.250> those<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.729> cooldown

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
probably want to get those on cooldown

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.109 
probably want to get those on cooldown
sooner<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.460> des<00:01:20.610> advance<00:01:20.970> so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
sooner you want to get up des advance so

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.280 
sooner you want to get up des advance so
you<00:01:21.150> wanna<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> two<00:01:21.630> unholy<00:01:21.900> ruins<00:01:22.200> on

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you wanna get the two unholy ruins on

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.980 
you wanna get the two unholy ruins on
cool<00:01:22.530> down<00:01:22.650> pretty<00:01:22.890> quickly<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.390> then

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
cool down pretty quickly and then

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.130 
cool down pretty quickly and then
chances<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.710> probably<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.400> this

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
chances are you probably don't have this

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.149 
chances are you probably don't have this
second<00:01:28.140> festering<00:01:28.560> strike<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.979> because

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
second festering strike up because

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.469 
second festering strike up because
you've<00:01:29.280> used<00:01:29.460> trans<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.850> ice<00:01:29.970> somewhere<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you've used trans of ice somewhere and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630 
you've used trans of ice somewhere and
there<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> snare<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.259> um<00:01:31.520> most<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
there to get the snare up um most of the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.789 
there to get the snare up um most of the
time<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.030> first<00:01:33.240> global<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.530> chains

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
time it's my first global to get chains

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.260 
time it's my first global to get chains
of<00:01:34.920> ice<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.189> her<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.670> usually<00:01:36.030> blood

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
of ice in her up so I usually blood

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.140 
of ice in her up so I usually blood
strike<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:38.119> for<00:01:39.119> some

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
strike there if I have it if for some

geared but however it works out and then
it's<00:02:41.340> really<00:02:41.700> mostly<00:02:42.480> kiting<00:02:43.020> if<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.950> don't

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
needed it's kind of hard to explain just

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.030 
needed it's kind of hard to explain just
keep<00:03:36.630> pvping<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.260> hopefully<00:03:37.560> you'll<00:03:37.709> realize

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
keep pvping and hopefully you'll realize

when you need to be running for your

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.479 
when you need to be running for your
life<00:03:39.660> which<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.049> pretty<00:03:40.650> much<00:03:40.769> all<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.310> time

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
life which is pretty much all the time

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.920 
life which is pretty much all the time
and<00:03:41.670> when<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:41.910> can<00:03:42.030> actually<00:03:42.180> go<00:03:42.480> into<00:03:42.630> melee

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and when you can actually go into melee

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.600 
and when you can actually go into melee
just<00:03:43.170> go<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.440> melee<00:03:43.709> when<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.100> more

benefit than them yeah it's how it's
really<00:03:48.269> hard<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.540> explain<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.410> hope<00:03:49.739> that

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
really hard to explain so I hope that

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.580 
really hard to explain so I hope that
helps<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.430> probably<00:03:51.000> didn't<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.420> I'm<00:03:51.540> sorry

helps it probably didn't and I'm sorry
it's<00:03:52.590> really<00:03:52.920> complicated<00:03:53.690> well<00:03:54.690> not

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
it's really complicated well not

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.040

complicated<00:03:55.440> confusing<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.010> explain
