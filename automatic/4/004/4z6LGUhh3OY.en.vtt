00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
breath blows the whistle it's not enough

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.090 
breath blows the whistle it's not enough
it's<00:03:40.750> not<00:03:40.840> enough<00:03:40.959> time<00:03:41.380> for<00:03:41.470> koozai<00:03:41.920> soon

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
it's not enough time for koozai soon

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.490 
it's not enough time for koozai soon
they<00:03:42.639> actually<00:03:43.000> dominated<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.750> entire<00:03:44.079> game

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
they actually dominated the entire game

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.979 
they actually dominated the entire game
after<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:44.980> Tijuana<00:03:45.250> scored<00:03:46.180> their<00:03:46.389> second<00:03:46.810> goal

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
after a Tijuana scored their second goal

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.270 
after a Tijuana scored their second goal
but<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.290> wasn't<00:03:47.560> enough<00:03:47.709> day<00:03:47.920> they<00:03:48.100> weren't

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
but it wasn't enough day they weren't

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.250 
but it wasn't enough day they weren't
able<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.639> score<00:03:48.970> they<00:03:49.600> weren't<00:03:49.840> able<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.109> get

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
able to score they weren't able to get

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.710 
able to score they weren't able to get
back<00:03:50.470> into<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.040> game<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.609> because<00:03:52.569> of<00:03:52.600> that

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
back into the game and because of that

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.509 
back into the game and because of that
they<00:03:53.019> lose<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.650> one<00:03:53.859> according<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.400> the

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
they lose to the one according to the

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.280 
they lose to the one according to the
simulation<00:03:54.910> Tijuana<00:03:55.450> will<00:03:55.660> be<00:03:55.780> able<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.079> seal

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
simulation Tijuana will be able to seal

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.309 
simulation Tijuana will be able to seal
the<00:03:56.829> results<00:03:57.370> from<00:03:57.760> from<00:03:58.209> Cruz<00:03:58.420> Azul<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:59.109> we'll

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
the results from from Cruz Azul so we'll

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.050 
the results from from Cruz Azul so we'll
see<00:03:59.620> if<00:03:59.859> that<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> being<00:04:00.519> true<00:04:00.579> but<00:04:00.880> let's

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
see if that is the being true but let's

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.120 
see if that is the being true but let's
move<00:04:01.180> on<00:04:01.389> to<00:04:01.569> our<00:04:01.810> second<00:04:02.290> set<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.500> simulations

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
move on to our second set of simulations

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.270 
move on to our second set of simulations

don't know what's going on with the

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.090 
don't know what's going on with the
referee<00:06:24.220> this<00:06:24.400> game<00:06:24.960> haha<00:06:25.960> I<00:06:26.380> don't<00:06:26.680> know<00:06:26.920> my

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
referee this game haha I don't know my

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.670 
referee this game haha I don't know my
to<00:06:27.640> me<00:06:27.760> then<00:06:27.970> Leon<00:06:28.120> penalty<00:06:29.050> should<00:06:29.320> have<00:06:29.530> been

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
to me then Leon penalty should have been

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.680

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
a penalty and in this one I think the

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.540 
a penalty and in this one I think the
rest<00:06:31.870> was<00:06:32.050> just<00:06:32.080> compensating<00:06:32.890> for<00:06:33.040> America

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550
