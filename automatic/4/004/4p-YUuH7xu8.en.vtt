at<00:00:08.520> the<00:00:08.610> start<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.060> just<00:00:09.090> pushed<00:00:09.450> between<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
at the start I just pushed between the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.350 
at the start I just pushed between the
flat<00:00:10.350> of<00:00:10.440> my<00:00:10.500> thumb<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.430> first<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.060> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
flat of my thumb and the first and the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.360 
flat of my thumb and the first and the
second<00:00:12.900> fingers<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> index<00:00:13.530> finger<00:00:14.220> in<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
second fingers the index finger in the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.310 
second fingers the index finger in the
middle<00:00:14.550> finger<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.270> I<00:00:15.420> squeeze<00:00:15.840> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.109> push

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
middle finger and I squeeze and I push

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.050 
middle finger and I squeeze and I push
into<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> head<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.220> reason<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.640> do<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.880> is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
into the head the reason I do that is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.310 
into the head the reason I do that is
that<00:00:18.300> means<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.599> my<00:00:18.689> grip<00:00:18.900> doesn't<00:00:19.109> actually

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that means that my grip doesn't actually

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.189 
that means that my grip doesn't actually
have<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.589> change<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:20.220> much<00:00:20.960> some<00:00:21.960> people

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
have to change that much some people

have to change that much some people
have<00:00:22.349> like<00:00:22.499> a<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.490> they're<00:00:24.179> if<00:00:25.050> their

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
have like a really like they're if their

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.630

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
stick right at the edge of their fingers

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.370 
stick right at the edge of their fingers
and<00:00:26.789> play<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.089> real<00:00:27.300> old-school<00:00:27.659> classical

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and play this real old-school classical

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.259 
and play this real old-school classical
type<00:00:28.949> thing<00:00:29.159> I<00:00:29.189> find<00:00:29.669> that<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.849> doesn't

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
type thing I find that that doesn't

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.979 
type thing I find that that doesn't
really<00:00:30.419> work<00:00:30.569> for<00:00:30.630> me

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
really work for me

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.080 
really work for me
because<00:00:31.859> if<00:00:31.980> I'm<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> buzz<00:00:32.820> role

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
because if I'm going to use a buzz role

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.000 
because if I'm going to use a buzz role
it's<00:00:33.239> usually<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:33.930> coming<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> singles

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it's usually I'm coming out of singles

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.319 
it's usually I'm coming out of singles
or<00:00:35.129> I'm<00:00:35.190> coming<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.609> some<00:00:35.850> fill<00:00:36.180> or

or I'm coming out of some fill or

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.580 
or I'm coming out of some fill or
something<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:37.020> especially<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
something like that as especially as a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.349 
something like that as especially as a
drumkit<00:00:37.859> player<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.489> don't<00:00:38.789> want<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.269> to

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
drumkit player I don't want to have to

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.150 
drumkit player I don't want to have to
change<00:00:39.660> my<00:00:39.809> technique<00:00:40.140> drastically<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.039> I've

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
change my technique drastically so I've

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.000 
change my technique drastically so I've
tried<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> teach<00:00:41.730> myself<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.149> technique<00:00:43.010> where

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
tried to teach myself a technique where

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.439 
tried to teach myself a technique where
I<00:00:44.039> don't<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.460> need<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> change<00:00:44.910> my<00:00:45.030> grip<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
I don't really need to change my grip a

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.259 
I don't really need to change my grip a
whole<00:00:45.629> lot<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.019> launch<00:00:46.440> into<00:00:46.769> it<00:00:47.030> alright<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
whole lot to launch into it alright so

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.270 
whole lot to launch into it alright so
that's<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> first<00:00:48.750> exercise<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that's the first exercise really the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
that's the first exercise really the
only<00:00:50.399> difference<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> end<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.929> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
only difference at the end is that you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
only difference at the end is that you
just<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.410> lay<00:00:52.739> into<00:00:52.980> each<00:00:53.219> buzz<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.210> said

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
just don't lay into each buzz as I said

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.130 

once<00:01:51.640> again<00:01:51.789> sounds<00:01:52.390> absolutely<00:01:52.840> horrible

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
once again sounds absolutely horrible

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.779 
once again sounds absolutely horrible
but<00:01:53.439> we're<00:01:53.560> just<00:01:53.710> trying<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:53.950> chain<00:01:54.219> a<00:01:54.399> train

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
but we're just trying to chain a train

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.999 
but we're just trying to chain a train
the<00:01:54.939> brain<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.840> fingers<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.409> be

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
the brain and the fingers to be

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.670 
the brain and the fingers to be
comfortable<00:01:57.579> with<00:01:58.180> playing<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.960> same<00:01:59.380> note

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
comfortable with playing the same note

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.960 
comfortable with playing the same note
rate<00:01:59.920> that<00:02:00.070> we're<00:02:00.189> playing<00:02:00.369> in<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.670> single

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
rate that we're playing in the single

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.490 
rate that we're playing in the single
strokes<00:02:01.240> let's<00:02:01.780> just<00:02:01.929> play<00:02:02.079> it<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.229> little<00:02:02.289> bit

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
strokes let's just play it a little bit

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.850 
strokes let's just play it a little bit
faster<00:02:09.899> okay<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.140> as<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.349> said<00:02:11.500> at<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> start

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
faster okay and as I said at the start

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.589 
faster okay and as I said at the start
what<00:02:12.099> we're<00:02:12.220> trying<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.519> do<00:02:12.670> here<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.269> avoid

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
what we're trying to do here is to avoid

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.890 
what we're trying to do here is to avoid
going<00:02:17.190> panicking<00:02:18.190> okay<00:02:18.550> everyone<00:02:19.510> panics

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
going panicking okay everyone panics

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.150 
going panicking okay everyone panics
when<00:02:20.019> they<00:02:20.110> see<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> roll<00:02:20.530> don't<00:02:20.800> panic<00:02:21.130> just

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
when they see the roll don't panic just

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.199 
when they see the roll don't panic just
keep<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:25.260> now<00:02:26.819> obviously<00:02:27.819> if<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.180> was

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
keep going now obviously if I was

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.000 
keep going now obviously if I was
actually<00:02:28.840> playing<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.260> piece<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.470> music<00:02:29.620> at

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
actually playing a piece of music at

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.650 
actually playing a piece of music at
that<00:02:30.040> speed<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.760> had<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.000> play<00:02:31.150> two<00:02:31.209> beats

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
that speed and I had to play two beats

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.420 
that speed and I had to play two beats
with<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.959> triplets<00:02:32.349> as<00:02:32.530> singles<00:02:32.920> as<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.220> did

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
with the triplets as singles as I did

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.690 
with the triplets as singles as I did
and<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:34.000> two<00:02:34.360> more<00:02:34.540> beats<00:02:34.810> as<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.019> buzz<00:02:35.349> roll

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
and then two more beats as a buzz roll

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.890 
and then two more beats as a buzz roll
obviously<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.970> hand<00:02:37.209> change<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.630> I'm<00:02:37.720> doing

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
obviously the hand change that I'm doing

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.170 
obviously the hand change that I'm doing
it<00:02:38.080> at<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.260> moment<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.739> too<00:02:38.950> slow<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.849> would

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
it at the moment is too slow so I would

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.509 
it at the moment is too slow so I would
have<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.569> pick<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.049> figure<00:02:41.440> out<00:02:41.519> probably

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
have to pick and figure out probably

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.690 
have to pick and figure out probably
right<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.000> fly<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.980> faster<00:02:44.980> subdivision<00:02:45.549> so

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
right on the fly a faster subdivision so

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.860 
right on the fly a faster subdivision so
I<00:02:45.730> might<00:02:45.970> go

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.240 

in<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.080> instance<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.620> actually<00:02:54.710> just<00:02:54.980> did<00:02:55.130> it

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
in that instance I actually just did it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.670 
in that instance I actually just did it
exactly<00:02:55.550> twice<00:02:56.000> as<00:02:56.210> fast<00:02:56.480> but<00:02:57.050> again<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
exactly twice as fast but again the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.410 
exactly twice as fast but again the
point<00:02:57.890> being<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.250> didn't<00:02:58.490> just<00:02:58.610> go<00:02:58.730> randomly

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
point being I didn't just go randomly

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.600 
point being I didn't just go randomly
faster<00:02:59.960> I<00:03:00.110> knew<00:03:00.260> exactly<00:03:00.380> how<00:03:00.980> much<00:03:01.130> faster<00:03:01.520> to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
faster I knew exactly how much faster to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.980 
faster I knew exactly how much faster to
go<00:03:01.760> that's<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.150> whole<00:03:02.360> thing<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.780> I'm<00:03:02.900> gonna

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
go that's the whole thing that I'm gonna

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.530 
go that's the whole thing that I'm gonna
be<00:03:03.200> drilling<00:03:03.410> home<00:03:03.710> I<00:03:03.890> home<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.400> whole<00:03:04.550> DVD<00:03:05.060> so

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
be drilling home I home the whole DVD so

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:15.130 
be drilling home I home the whole DVD so
what<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.750> did<00:03:05.960> was<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.200> went<00:03:13.180> okay<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.390> all<00:03:14.990> of

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
what I did was I went okay and all of

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.530 
what I did was I went okay and all of
those<00:03:15.260> extra<00:03:15.560> notes<00:03:15.830> I<00:03:15.950> just<00:03:16.100> buzz<00:03:16.280> them<00:03:19.540> I'll

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
those extra notes I just buzz them I'll

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.840 
those extra notes I just buzz them I'll
play<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.040> incorrectly<00:03:22.040> for<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:22.430> just<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:22.760> you

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
play it incorrectly for you just so you

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:32.590 
play it incorrectly for you just so you
can<00:03:22.940> hear<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:29.890> all<00:03:30.890> right<00:03:30.950> now<00:03:31.310> let's<00:03:32.270> continue

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
can hear it all right now let's continue

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.540 
can hear it all right now let's continue
on<00:03:32.870> with<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.170> idea<00:03:33.530> if<00:03:33.770> we<00:03:33.950> were<00:03:34.130> playing<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
on with this idea if we were playing a

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.280 
on with this idea if we were playing a
faster<00:03:34.940> fool<00:03:35.120> playing<00:03:35.420> like<00:03:37.510> then<00:03:38.510> playing

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
faster fool playing like then playing

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.990 
faster fool playing like then playing
all<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.590> those<00:03:39.680> extra<00:03:40.040> notes<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.400> would<00:03:40.580> be<00:03:40.760> way

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
all of those extra notes it would be way

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.560 
all of those extra notes it would be way
too<00:03:41.030> fast<00:03:41.480> it'd<00:03:41.720> be<00:03:41.780> like<00:03:43.000> it'd<00:03:44.000> be<00:03:44.210> ridiculous

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
too fast it'd be like it'd be ridiculous

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.540 
too fast it'd be like it'd be ridiculous
and<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:45.080> would<00:03:45.200> be<00:03:45.320> overkill<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.070> we<00:03:46.160> actually

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
and it would be overkill and we actually

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.920 
and it would be overkill and we actually
we<00:03:46.670> sort<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.120> like<00:03:47.240> you<00:03:47.420> reach<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.750> top

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
we sort of it's like you reach the top

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.480 
we sort of it's like you reach the top
of<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.080> bell<00:03:48.260> curve<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.680> beyond<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.370> certain

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
of the bell curve and beyond a certain

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.160 
of the bell curve and beyond a certain
speed<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:49.970> actually<00:03:50.330> sounds<00:03:50.780> it's

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
speed it actually sounds it's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.010 
speed it actually sounds it's
detrimental<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.130> sound<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:53.510> you<00:03:53.570> have<00:03:53.900> to

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
detrimental to the sound so you have to

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.860 
detrimental to the sound so you have to
be<00:03:54.140> really<00:03:54.380> careful<00:03:54.590> with<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.310> buzz<00:03:55.550> roll<00:03:55.870> well

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
be really careful with a buzz roll well

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.030 
be really careful with a buzz roll well
with<00:03:57.020> any<00:03:57.140> of<00:03:57.260> your<00:03:57.380> rolls<00:03:57.560> really<00:03:57.800> but<00:03:58.010> I

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
with any of your rolls really but I

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.110 
with any of your rolls really but I
think<00:03:58.070> especially<00:03:58.370> with<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.760> buzz<00:03:58.940> roll

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
think especially with the buzz roll

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.760 
think especially with the buzz roll
because<00:03:59.390> you<00:03:59.480> really<00:04:00.170> trying<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.470> aim<00:04:00.650> for

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
because you really trying to aim for

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.860 
because you really trying to aim for
that<00:04:00.950> seamless<00:04:01.489> sound<00:04:01.820> that<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.600> pick<00:04:02.840> the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
that seamless sound that you pick the
