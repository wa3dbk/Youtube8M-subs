00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 point out if you are between recordings occasionally and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.759
 too much to beat the drill from the neighbor I forgive myself 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.539
 for this unprofessionality 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.299
 it's no different I can wait two three days for someone to wear it 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:13.059
 home improvement 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.079
 personal information has been leaked 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.919
 the crucial thing is not to just share with you right away how much 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:20.869
 ski station 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.959
 this leads after the current escaped open 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.429
 wonderful to be in the broadcast again all the traffic you can do yourself 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:37.450
 come by 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.250
 I am deeply measuring new pedals, among others, which is good to hear why 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.440
 because to let you know my very small effort it is possible 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.520
 to modify every weapon tonne-kilometer traffic jams pay attention to it 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.400
 inserting the skull crystal that sets you up an internship that you can 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.090
 communicate with the spirits deceased persons for daddy sick who say there 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.300
 be ready for my race later you can do this skull too 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.450
 and the katie feel you get is even through very simple so where have just the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.570
 Lalla opened up We also look specifically for the potential to become better 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.980
 in the middle that is through the tidal wave work that is very simple 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.100
 further extract the two screws 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.530
 so anp 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.380
 the boeck 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.640
 seriously he wanted to stab 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.830
 clark first that always relatively successful I say not broken 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.930
 to here 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.340
 specific 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.610
 is standing i'm dead from christmas anp 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 and so the sphere may be around the potential meter 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.300
 and so me 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.520
 make contact with one side often to step 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.960
 but now 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.440
 we will contact pim 3 one of the potential 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.829
 So make it deliberate 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.940
 of your potential with the app 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.890
 but contacts with one of the poles of the skull crystals 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.390
 Another poll of death also opposed the flow of real estate 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 in position 3 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.140
 Meanwhile it has assembled the new building for a long time 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:17.740
 and so it sees us assembled see in the manslaughter the stable 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.889
 in the housing 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.299
 of young people 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.619
 daughter mockery 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.619
 lost the leg conversion time 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.899
 25 seconds 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.289
 it's that simple 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.639
 the crystals built in 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.769
 in the ramparts you will see 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.649
 thus enabling contacts with the spirits of the deceased 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:49.179
 en this shrinkage is a fascinating work, we see the quakes I have 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.309
 all the time 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.799
 he mecamold leon riekwell though black ice and a party a political factor and 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.760
 bishops reluctantly using a laptop, it is a very weak bullshit 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.119
 but the government makes 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.119
 what's the point 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.429
