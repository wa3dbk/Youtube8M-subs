you have the Nvidia Optimus technologies

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.979 
you have the Nvidia Optimus technologies
or<00:01:01.199> means<00:01:01.469> very<00:01:01.710> energy<00:01:02.489> efficient<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.270> case

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
or means very energy efficient in case

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.289 
or means very energy efficient in case
you're<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.290> using<00:01:04.710> office<00:01:05.580> applications

you're just using office applications

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.899 
you're just using office applications
that<00:01:06.630> means<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.350> don't<00:01:07.530> use<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.310> dedicated

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that means you don't use the dedicated

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.719 
that means you don't use the dedicated
graphics<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.780> save<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> lot<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.290> energy

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
graphics and you save a lot of energy

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.359 
graphics and you save a lot of energy
you<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.760> 16<00:01:12.420> gig<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.810> main<00:01:13.799> memory<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:15.080> a
