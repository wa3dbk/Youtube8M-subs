00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.610
 cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cats 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.180
 contributions of paula gandini 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.220
 First remove the necklace if it is worn 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.410
 put and place the feline sideways 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.430
 we will eliminate any type of fluid 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.770
 that obstructs the passage of the passage of air 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.890
 If the cat does not breathe but the heart 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:39.260
 still beating will be resorted to the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.559
 cardiopulmonary respiration rcp first 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.590
 With the help of a towel , the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.890
 tongue to clear throat thing 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.670
 that can stimulate your breathing 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 restoring his conscience if he continues 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.250
 unconscious and we will put the two 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.420
 hands over the chest and we will apply a 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.079
 light pressure this operation allows 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.540
 expel rarefied air allowing 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.660
 the entrance of fresh air 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.720
 the operation will be repeated every five 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.840
 seconds until the cat recovers the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.710
 breathing 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.100
 cardiac massage if the feline is 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.219
 unconscious that impulse must be 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 stimulate the heart we will place the 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:34.060
 fingers on the chest at the height of 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.590
 armpit and it will be pressed gently but 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:43.229
 firmly repeating this operation 5 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.819
 to 6 times in the interval of one second 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.289
 it will alternate with breathing 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:55.450
 artificial for 10 minutes past that 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:58.479
 time is likely to be unsuccessful if 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.420
 the kitten did not react breathing 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.930
 artificial 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.990
 if the thoracic cavity has been damaged 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.890
 the lungs will not fill up 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.130
 automatic and we will have to blow air in 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.760
 they will keep the cat in position 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.450
 vertical with closed mouth blowing 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.790
 we have in the nostrils we will see the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.970
 movement in the chest when doing this 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.380
 operation pauses for two 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.319
 seconds and the operation is repeated if 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.960
 we continue until the feline starts 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.130
 to breathe on its own 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.900
 another alternative method is to blow 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.380
 simultaneously through the nose and mouth 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.590
 of the animal 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.200
 this explanation is on the website 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:57.160
 of kittens www 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.170
 one of tiny script of the half kittens 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:06.550
 dot com.ar in the notes section and is 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.180
 even explained with slides that 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.150
 they will help us so this happens to us if 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.230
 we have an emergency how to act 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.959
 quickly while we call or the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.319
 we take to the urgencies in the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.319
