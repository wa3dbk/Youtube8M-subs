00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.120
We are talking about the Chili dog of Sonic

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.100
Today's ingredients are:

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.600
2 sausages and 2 hot dog buns,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.180
and 50g of asiago cheese.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.460
1 spoon of chili powder,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.700
1/2 tsp of cumin seeds

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400
and 1/2 tsp of rosemary,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.440
1 tsp of worcester sauce,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.520
2 tsps of tomato paste,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.800
300g of ground beef,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.460
400g of chopped tomatoes.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.640
For the caramelized onions we will need:

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.220
1 spoon of brown sugar,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.920
1 spoon of balsamic vinegar

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.240
and 2 red onions.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.640
Start by warming up a little bit of oil on a pan

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.880
add the onions and let them become translucent.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.320
Now add garlic,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.180
chili powder and cumin seeds.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.180
Add the ground beed and let it get brown,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.640
then add a pinch of salt,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.880
worcester sauce and tomato paste.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.540
Finally add chopped tomatoes, sugar,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.380
oregano, a bit more salt and pepper

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.180
and let it cook for around 20 minutes.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
Let's make the caramelized onions now.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.720
Warm up a little bit of oil

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.460
and let the sliced red onions sweat

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.200
for around 15 minutes.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.260
After that add vinegar and sugar.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.320
Let it evaporate for 5 minutes and put it aside.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.200
Finally, boil the sausages or if you prefer

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840
you can also grill them.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.480
Now we can assemble the hot dog!

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.900
Cut the bun in half

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.140
and put the cooked sausage and the caramelized onions in it.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.040
Now garnish it with the seasoned meat

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.520
and finally add cheese and slices of leek.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.400
TADAAAANNN!!!

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.240
