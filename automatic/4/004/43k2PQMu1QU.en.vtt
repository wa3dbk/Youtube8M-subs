started<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.489> gold<00:00:32.790> game<00:00:32.940> film<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> course

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
started with gold game film of course

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 
started with gold game film of course
and<00:00:33.840> off<00:00:34.469> camera<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.070> before<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.460> started

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and off camera just before we started

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.860 
and off camera just before we started
we're<00:00:35.880> talking<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> importance<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
we're talking about the importance of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.319 
we're talking about the importance of
p.m.<00:00:37.410> eyes<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.710> month<00:00:37.980> PM<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.030> are<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
p.m. eyes this month PM is are going to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
p.m. eyes this month PM is are going to
be<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> main<00:00:39.750> focus<00:00:39.780> why<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.950> well<00:00:41.399> if

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
be the main focus why is that well if

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.240 
be the main focus why is that well if
p.m.<00:00:41.700> eyes<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:42.090> slightly<00:00:42.360> softer<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:44.190> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
p.m. eyes got slightly softer but I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
p.m. eyes got slightly softer but I
think<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:45.120> still<00:00:45.360> remain<00:00:45.899> positive

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
think that there still remain positive

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.790 
think that there still remain positive
and<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.280> us<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.600> month<00:00:48.930> remains

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and for us that is the one month remains

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040 
and for us that is the one month remains
above<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> three-month<00:00:50.879> average<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
above the three-month average and that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
above the three-month average and that
trend<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.800> friend<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
trend is your friend so I think that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.080 
trend is your friend so I think that
that's<00:00:54.690> what's<00:00:54.960> key<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:56.219> sensitivity

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that's what's key here the sensitivity

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
that's what's key here the sensitivity
of<00:00:57.120> weaker<00:00:57.539> economic<00:00:57.719> data<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.350> America

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
of weaker economic data in America

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.729 
of weaker economic data in America
immediately<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.730> saw<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.300> 10-year<00:01:00.960> bond<00:01:01.199> soften

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
immediately we saw a 10-year bond soften

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.299 
immediately we saw a 10-year bond soften
up<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> think<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> goes<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.170> show<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.769> any

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
up so I think it goes to show that any

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.460 
up so I think it goes to show that any
fear<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> softening<00:01:06.570> economy<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
fear of a softening economy the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
fear of a softening economy the
government<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> US<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.970> keep<00:01:09.150> interest

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
government in the US will keep interest

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.719 
government in the US will keep interest
rates<00:01:09.630> low<00:01:09.869> let's<00:01:10.560> move<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> strengths<00:01:11.580> for

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
rates low let's move on to strengths for

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
rates low let's move on to strengths for
gold<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.299> last<00:01:12.630> week<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.960> saw<00:01:13.189> disappointing

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
gold now last week we saw disappointing

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
gold now last week we saw disappointing
jobs<00:01:14.610> numbers<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.299> had<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> positive

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
jobs numbers that had a positive

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920 
jobs numbers that had a positive
reaction<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.740> gold<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> bullishness<00:01:18.509> with

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
reaction for gold the bullishness with

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.289 
reaction for gold the bullishness with
geopolitics<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.640> Ukraine<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
geopolitics out in the Ukraine and the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
geopolitics out in the Ukraine and the
Middle<00:01:21.509> East<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.650> also<00:01:22.770> noted<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.220> there's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
Middle East you also noted that there's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
Middle East you also noted that there's
ETFs<00:01:24.570> back<00:01:24.869> by<00:01:25.020> precious<00:01:25.350> metal<00:01:25.590> that's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
ETFs back by precious metal that's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.320 
ETFs back by precious metal that's
aren't<00:01:25.860> positive<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.520> year<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.939> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
aren't positive for the year and of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.240 
aren't positive for the year and of
course<00:01:27.540> historically<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.619> second<00:01:28.920> half<00:01:29.070> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
course historically the second half of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.670 
course historically the second half of
the<00:01:29.850> year<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.210> generally<00:01:30.630> better<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.409> gold

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the year is generally better for gold

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.580 
the year is generally better for gold
prices<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.850> Frank<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.229> perfect

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
prices so Frank is this all the perfect

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.190 
prices so Frank is this all the perfect
storm<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:34.950> gold<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> rise<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.420> incredible

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
storm for gold to rise it's incredible

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.760 
storm for gold to rise it's incredible
35<00:01:38.040> years<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.400> data<00:01:38.670> points<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> think

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
35 years of data points and so I think

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
35 years of data points and so I think
that's<00:01:41.070> important<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> try<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> do

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that's important just to try to do

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.270 
that's important just to try to do
probability<00:01:43.110> analysis<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> wind<00:01:44.159> at

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
probability analysis to have the wind at

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.490 
probability analysis to have the wind at
your<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.490> rather<00:01:45.270> than<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:45.659> face<00:01:45.930> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
your back rather than your face it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080 
your back rather than your face it
doesn't<00:01:46.890> guarantee<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.640> gives<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
doesn't guarantee it it just gives you a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
doesn't guarantee it it just gives you a
higher<00:01:48.240> probability<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:49.170> gold<00:01:49.439> being<00:01:49.619> an

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
higher probability of gold being an

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.249 
higher probability of gold being an
uptrend<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.299> gold<00:01:51.600> stocks<00:01:51.990> are

get their costs down that's the most

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.289 
get their costs down that's the most
critical<00:03:36.780> factor<00:03:37.470> because<00:03:38.250> going<00:03:38.639> forward<00:03:39.180> I

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
critical factor because going forward I

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.000 
critical factor because going forward I
think<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.689> big<00:03:40.139> thing<00:03:40.169> that<00:03:40.409> investors<00:03:40.979> are

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
think the big thing that investors are

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.399 
think the big thing that investors are
going<00:03:41.189> to<00:03:41.250> look<00:03:41.310> at<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.729> is<00:03:42.150> profitable<00:03:42.930> ounces

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
going to look at is is profitable ounces

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.170 
going to look at is is profitable ounces
of<00:03:43.530> gold<00:03:43.709> not<00:03:44.159> just<00:03:44.400> growth<00:03:44.699> for<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:44.939> sake<00:03:45.150> of

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
of gold not just growth for the sake of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.030 
of gold not just growth for the sake of
growth<00:03:45.659> but<00:03:46.199> give<00:03:46.379> me<00:03:46.500> something<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:46.859> is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
growth but give me something that is

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.759 
growth but give me something that is
profitable<00:03:47.699> so<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.599> is<00:03:48.629> forecasted<00:03:49.620> that

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
profitable so it is forecasted that

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.589 
profitable so it is forecasted that
there's<00:03:50.159> going<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.489> supply<00:03:50.970> shortage<00:03:51.299> of

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
there's going to be a supply shortage of

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.330 
there's going to be a supply shortage of
gold<00:03:51.840> coming<00:03:52.139> out<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.439> mind<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:52.799> but<00:03:52.949> actually

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
gold coming out of mind so but actually

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.280 
gold coming out of mind so but actually
shrinking<00:03:53.849> their<00:03:53.970> overall<00:03:54.060> production<00:03:54.599> over

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
shrinking their overall production over

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.800 
shrinking their overall production over
the<00:03:55.379> next<00:03:55.530> five<00:03:55.859> years<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.939> I<00:03:56.970> think<00:03:57.299> as<00:03:57.599> these

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
the next five years so I think as these

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.960 
the next five years so I think as these
companies<00:03:58.169> become<00:03:58.560> more<00:03:58.769> focused<00:03:58.979> on<00:03:59.370> costs

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
companies become more focused on costs

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.360 
companies become more focused on costs
this<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.079> positive<00:04:01.290> for<00:04:01.709> investors<00:04:02.159> and

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
this is positive for investors and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.339 
this is positive for investors and
sticking<00:04:03.060> with<00:04:03.150> minors<00:04:03.479> for<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.840> opportunity

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
sticking with minors for the opportunity

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.020 
sticking with minors for the opportunity

the US dollar that you mentioned had a

the US dollar that you mentioned had a
breakout<00:04:41.460> recently<00:04:42.000> now<00:04:42.539> you<00:04:42.599> don't<00:04:43.169> see<00:04:43.319> it

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410

one<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.449> big<00:04:45.599> things<00:04:45.720> are<00:04:45.930> taking<00:04:46.139> a<00:04:46.169> look

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
one of the big things are taking a look

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.230 
one of the big things are taking a look
at<00:04:46.380> Europe's<00:04:46.710> dilemma<00:04:47.069> and<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.580> pound<00:04:47.849> you

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
at Europe's dilemma and the pound you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.120 
at Europe's dilemma and the pound you
know<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.419> pounders<00:04:48.840> came<00:04:49.410> up<00:04:49.620> against<00:04:50.039> the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
know the pounders came up against the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.309 
know the pounders came up against the
dollar<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:50.910> it's<00:04:51.090> really<00:04:51.330> not<00:04:51.569> so<00:04:51.780> much<00:04:51.930> as<00:04:52.110> of

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
dollar so it's really not so much as of

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.320 
dollar so it's really not so much as of
a<00:04:52.440> currency<00:04:52.770> being<00:04:53.069> strong<00:04:53.520> it's<00:04:54.090> just

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
a currency being strong it's just

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.779 
a currency being strong it's just
relative<00:04:54.810> weaknesses<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:56.610> other

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
relative weaknesses so the other

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.909 
relative weaknesses so the other
currencies<00:04:57.210> are<00:04:57.330> weaker<00:04:57.870> than<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.710> dollar

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
currencies are weaker than the dollar

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.860 
currencies are weaker than the dollar
it's<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.580> better<00:05:00.090> way<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.330> think<00:05:00.479> you<00:05:00.659> want<00:05:00.810> to

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
it's a better way I think you want to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.689 
it's a better way I think you want to
