ok so let's see their options they have

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
ok so let's see their options they have
a<00:01:09.689> proxy<00:01:10.140> option<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.070> obviously<00:01:11.159> just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
a proxy option so you can obviously just

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450 
a proxy option so you can obviously just
put<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.030> server<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:13.200> whatever<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.860> lon<00:01:14.100> I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.160 
so basically if you want to turn on ESPN
you<00:02:21.840> could<00:02:22.020> bind<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.190> key<00:02:23.400> was<00:02:23.430> f

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
you could bind it so that the key was f

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.170 
you could bind it so that the key was f
yeah<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:26.070> think<00:02:26.400> that's<00:02:27.030> pretty

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
yeah so I think that's pretty

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.560 
yeah so I think that's pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:28.880> colors<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
self-explanatory colors this is just the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.570 
self-explanatory colors this is just the
colors<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:30.960> everything<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.710> wouldn't<00:02:31.950> don't

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
colors of everything I wouldn't don't

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.030 
colors of everything I wouldn't don't
play<00:02:32.790> around<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.180> those<00:02:33.300> things<00:02:33.570> too<00:02:33.840> much

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
play around with those things too much

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.010 
play around with those things too much
debug<00:02:35.040> code<00:02:35.400> not<00:02:36.030> even<00:02:36.270> sure<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.660> does

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
debug code not even sure what that does

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.380 
debug code not even sure what that does

fix connection no idea All Right see I

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.300

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
got an alternative account it's a chance

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.540 
got an alternative account it's a chance
but<00:02:44.580> I'll<00:02:45.330> go<00:02:45.600> back<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.080> don't<00:02:46.290> worry<00:02:46.550> all

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
but I'll go back to it don't worry all

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.790 
but I'll go back to it don't worry all
right<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.970> crap<00:02:48.390> froze<00:02:48.750> all<00:02:49.380> right<00:02:49.650> they

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
right I'm crap froze all right they

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.060 
right I'm crap froze all right they
would<00:02:49.950> go<00:02:50.070> ok<00:02:51.000> back<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.330> here<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.320> clear

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
would go ok back to here I and clear

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.070 
would go ok back to here I and clear
config<00:02:53.550> files<00:02:53.850> i'm<00:02:54.180> guessing<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.660> switches

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
config files i'm guessing just switches

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.280 
config files i'm guessing just switches
everything<00:02:55.700> there<00:02:56.700> restarts<00:02:57.630> your<00:02:57.780> config

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
everything there restarts your config

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.080 
everything there restarts your config

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.000 
files so which account you can quickly
enter<00:03:00.510> account<00:03:00.840> i<00:03:00.990> guess<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.500> should

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
