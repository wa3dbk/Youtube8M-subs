00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.370
 hello everyone with you fil and vander tapes and in 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.509
 I will show you how to use this video. 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.400
 false eyelashes 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:21.420
 the first thing we do is choose 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.039
 correct false eyelashes that that would 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.380
 I recommend you choose this 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.070
 eyelashes and which are very thin near 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.170
 the grounds 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 they will be easier to stick and longer 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.710
 hold on and you won't feel them 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.559
 on their eyes 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.200
 one of my favorites is a doctor whether a horse 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.450
 I always use them very much 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.550
 naturally look and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 and even unnoticed that they are in front of you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.180
 Here is a very good hotel and swing which 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.219
 I would not recommend this to you 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.500
 since it is very thick 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.219
 grounds as permissible here again 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.289
 low type first what you will 1 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.870
 feel it like you have caterpillars 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.030
 on the eyes it will be very convenient and you 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.610
 hate those eyelashes so 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.760
 always choose thin near the base 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.640
 how to remove them from the package in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.509
 In no case do not pull over the end so you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.020
 you can break them and just a little bit 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:23.150
 move away from the base very quietly 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.150
 it's not just easier to shoot q 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.060
 so the first thing i do is curling 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.760
 eyelashes after that I put them on 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.100
 eyelashes mascara 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.619
 something though not rubbing your tongue but you 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.510
 understand the mascara and why me 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.140
 like to use clades and 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.900
 dreaming 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.229
 carcasses can be used much less 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.380
 so the lashes of the principle does not spoil 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.710
 the better is the glue that I constantly 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.509
 I use it yes oh just in principle without 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.119
 what difference will you use glue 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.340
 the main thing to him is good and I we just 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.770
 I put a small amount on hand 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.280
 then using tweezers I put on 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.660
 eyelashes give dry for about seconds 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.380
 10-15 and only after that already on glue 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.030
 how are you putting them on 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.760
 firstly with tweezers it will be so 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.250
 it is more convenient in the second so that you are closer 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.769
 be applied to the base of the forest in 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.690
 the better and natural the eyelashes will be 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:35.989
 look more natural and no way 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.060
 fake will give just with tweezers yak 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.090
 I quietly put them on first 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.070
 middle and then adjust them with 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.940
 end from one end 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.940
 girlfriend 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.250
 also a very important step that i take 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.310
 after you have gone somewhere 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.200
 seconds 10 more when still glue 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.470
 not dry enough, I press them slightly 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.230
 tweezers this way lashes better 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.510
 will stick together and they won't differ between 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.140
 Your natural and natural eyelashes 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.140
 invoices 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.680
 then what do we do to get your 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.989
 false eyelashes generally become 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.560
 imperceptible just take matte shadows 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.290
 if you did arrows and asks just 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.989
 we put a little along your eyelashes 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.360
 the number of such matte shadows is because 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.690
 that at least glue glue dried up but he chamois 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.060
 slightly noticeable so that you hide 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.940
 a small amount of matte shadows and 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.560
 your eyelashes are more accurate than the base where you are 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.560
 they are stuck will be generally invisible 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.480
 The last step I do is still 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.030
 develop your eyelashes in this way 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.549
 your eyelashes and false with glued 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.110
 well together and hold out much 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.930
 longer and will look more 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.819
 natural on this all thank you all for 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.680
