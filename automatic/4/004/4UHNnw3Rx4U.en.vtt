00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.819
 I don't know if you hear any of the news we have said this too 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.489
 parallel that was made known de pertis and where 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.579
 I am in Verona and enjoyed playing games for a choir in Parma instead 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.469
 denon fata 7 was suspended 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.869
 I know that he can impose among other things you immediately came to know about what happened e 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.720
 immediately on shuttles 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.619
 putting up the flags 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.509
 you asked for it to be suspended no 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.509
 which we say that 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 hotel I procure the first few seconds in which there was no doubt however losing could 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.940
 shutdown command now due to heat 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.100
 after anyway eyes 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.890
 after like a minute so we started to suspect what you can 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.690
 but actually happened 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.340
 but I wanted to emphasize a similar thing about the exploitation 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.080
 intrigued because also spoken of 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.660
 that are happening in these hours even in Palermo where the broadcasts start 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.630
 more squalid I will take advantage to talk about new stadiums talking about models 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.060
 English 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.030
 savona sound one thing that I wanted to say that the ultras only one of the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.210
 hypocrites 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.850
 when he will understand that it is understood 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.320
 what could have happened that pohybel festival happened to be there 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.710
 something inside us 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.060
 has changed practically 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.490
 and it didn't change that way because we had to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.540
 to show us to you 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.520
 tourists from someone else 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 what really changed something inside us 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.470
 someone 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.540
 he came away but you can't be sad for everything that happens 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.280
 in our society 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.740
 then there is here 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.030
 that is, we were in our space 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.080
 this thing happened in front of us we saw the vicentines go away the 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.250
 match was suspended 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.400
 for me this thing we have it anyway 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.550
 having felt like someone, what we had experienced came to mind 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.200
 with the death of the pancreas last year 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.509
 here is something that touches dead 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.840
 touched 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.860
 above all beyond what is said now 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.010
 above all I touched us 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.920
 I don't mean now 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.580
 we don't want to say we cried them because at the song you plant your friends 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.379
 lips cried his parents 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.879
 however, this is a story that is earth touched a lot because 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.379
 however, we knew having understood what the dynamics was, we knew it was gas 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.249
 however, at the end of life 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:38.629
 On the contrary, we have not remained sensitive, unlike many others 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.059
 who are the ones who usually do the moral to the ultras 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.389
 those who usually moralize the ultra are those who have sung 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.839
 let's play let's play 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.089
 but therefore there is not a problem of type of cure a social problem 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.259
 that there is a society that no longer has value has nothing left of 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.700
 same company face 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.439
 it is not surprising that the people affected have moved forward 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.699
 when it is a slice of audience that sings to you we play we play 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.079
 how you reacted to these costs 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.960
 re running map 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.960
 ridiculous. we have not done practically 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.869
 not at all business can eat 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:23.589
 what could you fake is someone who got pissed off an angry kiefer 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.359
 you really look for 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.709
 he really felt a huge void wind if I personally have me 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.979
 ashamed 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.299
 d certain people m 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.529
 certain hallo all my greatest contempt I personally can 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:42.639
 express their solidarity to those who are pissed off with these can 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.919
 take in front of so many bags that make morals cercis 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.000
 ispo solo 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.090
 anger the problem that this is our society 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.999
 look for your pointed heart of humanity now you agree to go to the ultras 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:56.299
 parquet 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.559
 I love you text there is absolutely nothing all the superficiality all 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:01.629
 you ism 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.199
 that is, to try absolutely nothing when it comes to hypocrisy dinner there 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.419
 we are angry because anyway we understood what was happening 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.280
 cst 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.400
 if a cat is dying even for you and you feel nothing 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.189
 six 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:18.489
 you are an animal 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.079
 obviously 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.510
 massimiliano just to remove any doubt 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.960
 there was no danger of public order as it was in a first 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.720
 time hypothesized because of the questore released precise 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.720
 statements in this regard in the newspapers no 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.120
 is the palace of the women match the exact match is not 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.380
 it wasn't that it had to be resumed because there were problems of public order 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.810
 resumed suspended due to problems of public order to try often at night 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.810
 absolutely the speech f4f talked about just pc that you could suspend the 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.900
 game 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.039
 only if there were problems of public order 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.529
 cellini the problems of public order there was not one that there is a problem of 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.400
 like a taste of divinity 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.540
 ashley because they are excellent in italy. usopp meaning that is 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.719
 they do not count 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.539
 must go ahead a game that among other things the padua will 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.040
 can complain val di susistan we heard I'm going to palm 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.780
 he didn't want to play, they didn't want to play because he could see himself 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.310
 it is a very embarrassing even they took us on we left 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.000
 that is to say, continue this thing in cag anyway you are 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.150
 you know the hospital is going and it's free 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.969
 entertain but what sense? 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.969
 massimiliani certainly do not thank you 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.460
 they could not improve this guy's condition even if the match a 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.389
 had been played however as you say it is really a question of dignity e 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:50.960
 of humanity 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.849
 fool strong 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.659
 right for that there is children I to say how the other girls are there 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:58.639
 gone out 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.449
 starace but 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.460
 just think that there is no stopping a game 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.720
 that is, the consent to good taste the little dignity that does not give importance 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.320
 that you can suspend the series whistle 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.999
 a black player 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.999
 in the name of he is dying boy 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.979
