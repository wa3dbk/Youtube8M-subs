00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
think that's going to be a great fight I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.410 
think that's going to be a great fight I
think<00:02:19.579> that<00:02:19.790> it's<00:02:19.970> one<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.180> those<00:02:20.239> situations

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
think that it's one of those situations

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.819 
think that it's one of those situations
where<00:02:21.069> if<00:02:22.660> zombies<00:02:23.660> coral<00:02:24.170> doesn't<00:02:24.470> struggle

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
where if zombies coral doesn't struggle

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.800 
where if zombies coral doesn't struggle
with<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.250> way<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.760> think<00:02:26.239> he<00:02:26.450> has<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.599> great

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
with the way I think he has a great

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.449 
with the way I think he has a great
great<00:02:27.079> chance<00:02:27.349> of<00:02:27.470> winning<00:02:27.530> only<00:02:27.950> thing<00:02:28.250> that

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
great chance of winning only thing that

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.850 
great chance of winning only thing that
packed<00:02:28.940> out<00:02:29.150> what<00:02:29.269> he<00:02:29.360> has<00:02:29.540> better<00:02:30.500> than<00:02:30.590> him

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
packed out what he has better than him

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.539 
packed out what he has better than him
then<00:02:31.129> it's<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.430> speed<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> mean<00:02:34.310> I

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
then it's the speed and so I mean I

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.940 
then it's the speed and so I mean I
think<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:34.879> is<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.180> pick'em<00:02:35.599> fight<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.920> I

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
think this is a pick'em fight but so I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.979 
think this is a pick'em fight but so I
would<00:02:37.160> never<00:02:38.060> but<00:02:38.209> i've<00:02:38.329> interviewed<00:02:38.540> like<00:02:38.660> 20

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989

Pacquiao<00:02:40.790> but<00:02:41.569> I<00:02:41.599> really<00:02:41.900> think<00:02:41.930> that

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
Pacquiao but I really think that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.080 
Pacquiao but I really think that
Pacquiao's<00:02:43.160> knock<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:43.549> of<00:02:43.640> Ricky<00:02:43.790> had<00:02:43.910> was<00:02:44.060> a
