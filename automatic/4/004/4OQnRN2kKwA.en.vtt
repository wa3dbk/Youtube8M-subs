00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.009
 having completed mission with the discovery 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 of the day finally raphael and hand 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.130
 on a bike for a child who is not in 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.019
 bike so you may know the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.610
 sketch of florence foresti his show 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.499
 mother fucker in which she 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 says that when you become parents the 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.730
 ugly comes home with the bikes 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.409
 pink barbie that does not stick at all 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.210
 with your interior early for your 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.800
 leather sofa and well I have you 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.409
 found a design object it was invented 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.210
 by English that 's it 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:32.609
 marketed since this summer and it's 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.109
 arrived in belgium there is a big 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.730
 week two weeks big maximum so 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.199
 that's really all that new home 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.629
 is called doing the bike like that 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.519
 issa was design and by English they 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.809
 have received a prize from elsewhere for 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.670
 this innovation and it's a new 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.199
 principle of balance bike then as a reminder 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.089
 what is a resin we have a small 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.710
 picture here to refresh you the 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.179
 memory it's actually a bike without 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.699
 pedal to teach children 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.589
 the balanced as you said then 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.940
 off the air and well your children were able to 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.960
 to make cycling easier by 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.280
 even though they have only 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.679
 teach us to go and slow down 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.539
 since for the rest it's a good one 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.220
 psychomotility tool the problem 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.020
 is that the balance bike this from 2 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.490
 years and hearing children and parents 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.079
 forgiveness tend to put children 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.340
 earlier and earlier on this resin the 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.110
 problem is that the balance bike and the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.909
 others when children are tiny 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.930
 by people do not really touch the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.299
 soil they have trouble finding the balanced 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.210
 he falls and they are scared here with this 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.950
 System deer bike and he quickly 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.960
 falls from mwaro and he falls not at all 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.219
 even at the beginning we are going to do the little 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.479
 exchange because as you see it 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.479
 here below there are small holes 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.590
 who keeps the stability of this angel has a 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.170
 little weirdos 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 so like that good good child of 1 year to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.740
 about fifteen months he can use it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.329
 here so there are people well spread 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.829
 so at the level of stability it's 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.420
 more stable also than the balance bike there 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.890
 jobs with both small 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.079
 casters and then but that's the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.369
 white model as then in hand on 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.710
 remove the little wheels and that's it 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.380
 just the balls that are here that him 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.460
 serve to find the balanced the here on 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.110
 a development finally 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.570
 a linear movement with the received baule 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.860
 on the other hand the ball of the jump here it is 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.900
 she can go absolutely in all 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.369
 meaning which means that the little 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.930
 boy the little girl is going to be able to do 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.760
 skids and do it a little bit 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.270
 a little bit everything you are 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.030
 besides tested his little girl who has 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.500
 15 months I unpacked the angel to it was the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.700
 red put them on the floor directly she 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.510
 has arrived compared to awesome daddy 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.610
 awesome 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.140
 so she is easily fit on 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.370
 and started pedaling can be seen 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.080
 besides some pictures I do not know 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.459
 not if we have already seen a little emotion 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.110
 to see a little bit that's it these are 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.750
 computer graphics because these 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.040
 subjects and so that's it it was the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.930
 concept images because it's 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.790
 really really new and that's it 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.590
 so here we remove the small holes and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.390
 the child must really find the point 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.540
 to hatch more like the center of 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.610
 gravity is really very low with this 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.410
 gear is well finally a lot more 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.730
 easy to find his balance put 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.340
 my husband raphael 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.769
 but the park is precisely it's a 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.090
 special material since the English get 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.530
 are quickly realized in the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.819
 first prototypes isolate or there but 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.049
 that it varied inside since it's 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.850
 made to be used indoors 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.160
 basically and so they found 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.290
 a kind of rubber a material here 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.450
 who is not going to scratch your interest me 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.870
 I have a question how much weighs 2 kg 4 and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.870
 August 5 for three months 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.240
 but it's a good idea it's new 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.230
 it just came out and it comes to 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.850
 we and it's for the little ones in 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.960
 the film shop perfumes are the 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.280
 comments of the good plans do not hesitate 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.760
 not to communicate them via facebook 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.350
 via twitter or via the website rtbf.be slash 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.320
 pigeon tomorrow we will find you well

 sure in radio on liveliness from 11 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.720

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.790
 thank you for following us weather diary 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.210
 televised it's following this
