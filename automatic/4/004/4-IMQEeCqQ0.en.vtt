00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.290
 let's prepare chicken with garlic and 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.420
 Quick the ingredients that we need 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.790
 they are for four people three against 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.849
 boneless chicken thighs skin if 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.330
 in pieces the juice of a lemon four 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.090
 garlic cloves minced olive oil and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.910
 Salt 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.430
 and we are going to start by taking a good 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.830
 pan to which we are going to put a couple 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.310
 of tablespoons of oil and we're going to 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.250
 to warm 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.379
 once it's hot, we add the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.650
 chicken and it's about browning how well 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.230
 if it is necessary a little bit lower than 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.350
 maximum fire so that the pieces are 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.330
 go roasting and stay golden without 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.760
 it dries too much even though it 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.590
 good of this cut of the chicken is that not 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.040
 dries as much as the breast 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.550
 we a zone masters and we keep moving them 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.600
 constantly to get that point 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.600
 of semi-caramelized gold that acquires 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.510
 easily this part of the flesh of the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.760
 chicken 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.670
 once we see that we have already gone 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.310
 browning all the pieces we will add the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.950
 lemon juice 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.500
 that we will let evaporate to strong fire 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.110
 while all the pieces are impregnated 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.870
 of chicken from the lemon sauce 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.970
 as we see that the lemon no longer casts 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.930
 so much steam because of the water it contained 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.050
 we add the garlic and keep moving 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.770
 constantly so that we do not burn 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.170
 and the chicken is still impregnated with flavor 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.200
 After a minute and a half 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.510
 we can serve quickly and ready and 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.390
 we have our chicken with garlic easy and 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.760
 fast that as you can see is very simple 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.890
 of making the second dish with a 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.090
 gazpacho or with a salad for this 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:06.300
 summer is ideal and it is very rich very 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.300
 tasty and of course delicious
