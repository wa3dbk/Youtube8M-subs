00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.779
 walt greet them biloute Cevennes and 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.359
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.400
 new tutorial episode on the 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.929
 order block 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.000
 so today I'm going to show you 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.290
 how to use the blog command for 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.820
 view scores 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.290
 so that is to say especially for a 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.480
 death counter that is very very 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.430
 important and who is very very hungry 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.230
 to install on different maps 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.119
 adventure and so it's like me 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.130
 I use in my final fantasy series ii 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.420
 with the cherub then simply he 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.950
 you just need to have block commands 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.930
 to have orders so blocks there 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.260
 I'm on my own server it 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:46.000
 knew it must be so you operator 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:48.449
 do up slash up me it's andy 159 and 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.680
 I'm already up there so he's writing for 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.469
 well another person caused by there is 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.719
 no problem and from that moment on 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.309
 you can go to games and 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:05.140
 creative as you want so you 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:06.910
 do slash game mode and hop were 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.260
 game has been nonsense and I'm in 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.210
 clear or else to get the so 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.800
 Adaptation to obtain and as 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.080
 hangs you can not go through the menu 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.000
 classic inventory so it does not get 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.110
 not find here at all so we can 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.540
 search for orders with an ocr a 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.310
 maybe better but how is it not 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.130
 so here we have that compass or redstone 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:36.210
 comparator you have to go through the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 orders so long live your nickname 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.430
 these 137 and there I gave myself a 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.870
 block command or pass you through too 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.700
 many temse like me so you are looking for 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.490
 either the command box via this bar 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.190
 or directly in the inventory so the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.190
 jelly directly and you install it 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.330
 no matter how anywhere 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.590
 anyway if it's destroyed it's not 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.789
 annoying it's not going to destroy your your 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.719
 your objective is then to edit 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.310
 a command block 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.840
 Attention must be absolutely 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.790
 creative otherwise we will not be able to write 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.360
 in there so if we wrote in there 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.860
 and we have the creative bank 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.640
 order block will not work so 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.129
 I will show you tac up anywhere 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.440
 what is it john &amp; you must be and 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.670
 creative fashion so there hop I put myself 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.290
 to write simpler and I will you 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.780
 show orders at one meter in 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.849
 block commands to install the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.340
 goals so then first orders 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.360
 locke so there installed the objectives there 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.819
 just do slash score board 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.799
 objective had the name of your goal 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.489
 so I put dead because it's a 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:54.030
 d a death counter and escande 7 ce 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.079
 as soon as this cancer to seize the goal that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.819
 so you want here in this case the 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.180
 death counter translated into English all 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.829
 simply 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.629
 so from that moment on you 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.730
 do so enter the written ai adele 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.160
 better dead goal what this madness 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.310
 so the lens has been installed but 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.489
 you can see ja we see it null 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.139
 part what is it necessary to write a 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.190
 second command to display 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.370
 the goal be slash scoreboard 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.069
 objective 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.630
 this display and I decided to 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.120
 put on the screen here so that and their 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.420
 bar and the name louise cliff so dead 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.889
 give the up 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.609
 there he put himself well and we will see that 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.609
 if i do this ch 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.580
 I 'm going to get there I 'm dying we see that 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:48.130
 here it actually settled on that side 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.720
 there was the arrival of the counter of 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.360
 dead simply so here I have one 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.590
 I can do as much as I put if 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.890
 your death counter in the end you 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.830
 gene 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.020
 there are no worries you can 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.890
 remove extra to remove the lens 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.530
 just do slash scoreboard 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.850
 Objective remove dead everyone 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.010
 the goal always you can 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.120
 call him as wanted to fuck all this 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.970
 that you want and so it's enough 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.440
 to do hop and there is gone but 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.420
 then to install them just 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.310
 do that finally the first as in 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.380
 block the second etc 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.960
 it was really very easy to 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.240
 do there are only three orders to 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.920
 register in the control console of the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.510
 common ocs so it's really very 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.730
 very fast and very simple to do 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.250
 we can do that too with life so 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:43.720
 so the page vermette 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:46.240
 So here is my my counter 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.080
 went on and that's all for this 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.180
 very quick little tutorial to install 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.390
 so I remember it just do 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.980
 slash scoreboard objective to 2 the name of 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.950
 your goal scans for 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.900
 counter stays then for the posted 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.870
 it's slash goal scoreboard 7 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.210
 display side by side bar for the 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.370
 put next to the dead screen him so 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.500
 it's the name of the goal is then 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.450
 to remove his objects scoreboard 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.790
 finally slash objective scoreboard 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.460
 raymond dead so the name of the goal 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.500
 so hopefully that will have you 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.750
 been useful and profitable for your 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.270
 next multiplayer adventures 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.919
 can be nice and very nice 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.600
 we find ourselves very quickly for a new 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.600
 little tutorial go bye bye
