 well vistointv.net 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:19.359
 we have under our halfon lens with firmware 4. 0 beta 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.899
 the first version of this signed man is released to developers 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.699
 we are testing daara one day better in between since last night when 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.810
 we installed the signature immediately after that 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.350
 am apple ne gone 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.070
 communication of the keynote thanks 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.860
 and we see to the best ideas there are even 100 small the big ones 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.230
 the first improvements 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.370
 multitasking when we open a program for example 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.820
 but in this case, by leaving the central button pressed, the program does not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.629
 closes but remains of in the ground 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.180
 it's a bit of a particular multitasking that would require applications 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.219
 the written and modified for this double uncultivated multitask 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.759
 click on the omxu network button we can go to see all the applications 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.060
 hahaha open I think clicked on the application this can therefore 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.670
 close to vote memory 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.920
 18 multitask in particular in fact the application the state is open 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.480
 in the background therefore consuming batteries but resources 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.610
 last open in a seedless state 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.090
 eh by accessing some phone services with a single network rather than 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.400
 notifications 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 second new push notifications that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.979
 they can also be local as well as direct women in third 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.979
 interesting news 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.229
 the possibility of creating folders like we have inserted all the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.369
 games in a very simple folder do it just hold the icon 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.380
 when these rebellious ones it is enough to put a program over the other that will be created 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.140
 automatically as you see an icon 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.280
 the name in the quietly customized folder we can 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.640
 breast pull out 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.759
 pickaxe put it back on 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.829
 cinema on ferrari splinder 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.939
 remove that 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:18.090
 delete a folder springolo dette editable with regard to the 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:19.810
 background and with this 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.499
 but sort of three-dimensional and transparent background 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:28.120
 as for the 4 favorite tam icons 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.610
