00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.990
 so well what else back to the shortcomings 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.630
 which a beautiful facade probably do not know 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.759
 all the same there is a quality painted 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.279
 the facade is expensive it is expensive 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:36.170
 how expensive are two times more expensive than 8 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:43.730
 cheaper than an array but much more expensive than 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:47.629
 film here so back how do how 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.790
 do budget so to speak painted 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.460
 facades that is simply the paint is applied 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.130
 On mdf you so to speak if roughly 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.860
 talk just took the paint put on 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.820
 MDF she dried up such a lilac 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.189
 and we may even be more than 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.950
 film on film further Grin Well 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.020
 almost yourself so well the film is 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.790
 considered as a budget option if we 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.469
 talking about quality painted facades 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.890
 then there shouldn't be any shagreen 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:22.690
 to be and this is achieved precisely in expensive 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.979
 facades i mean expensive facade is done 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:32.060
 repaint like a car like a car 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.490
 how is it how is it not just telling then 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.390
 there is 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 prepared perfectly 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.020
 generally prepared facade that is, he 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.390
 grinded then primer applied all 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.280
 completely constantly polished ie 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.320
 primer is applied to grind this 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.659
 put the mixture must be putty if there 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.770
 some banks there are polished 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.439
 paint applied 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.950
 gently polished super varnish applied 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.340
 polished super expensive options 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.250
 2 coats of varnish are applied 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.670
 then all this is perfect polished and she 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.540
 how would super super super polished such 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.390
 perfect 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.329
 at any angle no width there you 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.460
 don't find this present dear 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.590
 red facade 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.880
 if you come on the facades made up you 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.490
 saw shagreen like this at an angle 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.380
 the smaller the bigger the worse 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.730
 you all understand this is a regular budget 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.760
 super budget 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.700
 facade coloring can lick 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.910
 I do not know yet there is something with her plus the most 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.850
 no different from the film facade 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.100
 who are rude time allowed 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:54.410
 so it makes no sense to take painted facades 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:57.320
 with the width if you take to order the kitchen 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.560
 with facades they be with painted they 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.630
 there must be quality here ok 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.750
 I told you so but all the principle so far 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:16.480
 on the facades all that I wanted to tell you I 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:20.990
 already said what else can i say so 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.000
 so what else do I want to say about 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:28.630
 about these rounds were there 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.520
 customer issues on film facades 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.630
 theoretically theoretically well now i'm 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.600
 in my opinion you still know what's not 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.400
 there is technology 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.500
 so that it was 90 degrees film 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.850
 when wrapped itself around 90 degrees 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.610
 but it should not be there should be 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.450
 minimal at least a semicircular can 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.120
 here and a little more than the minimum but 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.709
 that is square to be here 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.230
 theoretically cannot theoretically 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.930
 or rather cannot be qualitatively 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.890
 but there will be no sizing someone and 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.110
 does well theoretically nobody does 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.830
 although perhaps some new technology 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.020
 there it will soon be all decorated 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.650
 facades here are but with the market 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.220
 with glasses they can they are square 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.040
 they are square it can be 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.010
 docked or chosen well not 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.780
 important it is important Shani will be here in the middle 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.710
 square therefore 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.190
 you consider if you do not like this 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.960
 And I met such clients who 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.790
 principle to put it mildly did not like this 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.910
 you need to order only painted 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.919
 film facades will not suit you everywhere 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.520
 us such inner corners 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.340
 there will be such fixings and this 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.669
 would look like this 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.919
 it's all the same principle know that only 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.130
 here so it can be on film facades 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:05.210
 so basically everything that I wanted 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.340
 today everything has already been told by him 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.390
 Thank you for waiting my 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.720
 other useful reviews will still be me 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.500
 In principle, I have already laid out a bunch of everything there 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:21.350
 who wants to watch my playlist 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.080
 there a bunch of a bunch of different reviewers 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.900
 oh furniture all sorts of nuances and so on and 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.000
 so on it will be very helpful but 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.160
 first of all it is useful for consumers 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.040
 no consumer to professionals 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.560
 consumers so the first you 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.020
 you could not cheat when you 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.700
 will tell something and you think 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.800
 that this is true that is, you should like 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.430
 most of all to know but to whom all is useful 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.789
 it is to know who wants it is useful too 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:55.729
 listen so well thank you for your attention 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:59.570
 have you had this proxy look for me about everywhere 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:02.150
 I am everywhere in classmates is a proxy 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.880
 there is a yu tuba 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:09.070
 there is from the proxy you are now watching 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:15.940
 can find me through playlist 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:20.110
 principle, all to meet new and while 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.110
 good as you
