be a lumen 'm or an alloy wheel in terms

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.479 
be a lumen 'm or an alloy wheel in terms
of<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> rim

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
of the rim

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
of the rim
you've<00:00:59.879> got<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> hub<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.780> sits<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you've got the hub that sits in the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.260 
you've got the hub that sits in the
middle<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> wheel<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
middle of the of the wheel and the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.200 
middle of the of the wheel and the
spokes<00:01:03.780> attacks<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> hub<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.189> rim<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.030> all

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
spokes attacks the hub to the rim so all

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.880 
spokes attacks the hub to the rim so all
three<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:06.570> components<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.260> into<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
three of those components go into the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130 
three of those components go into the
make<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.880> wheel<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:10.049> are

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
make up of a wheel and there are

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
make up of a wheel and there are
different<00:01:10.500> levels<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.860> quality<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.850> each<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
different levels of quality in each of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
different levels of quality in each of
those<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.799> low<00:01:14.100> quality

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
those so you can get very low quality

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
those so you can get very low quality
