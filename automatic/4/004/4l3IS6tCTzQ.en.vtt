00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:10.209
 Kedomo are you copy teamed up with reflected the Do not Hen dam today 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.910
 That loco is always taken with au's high iphone 5s when taking videos 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:19.080
 Also I'd Teru 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:25.580
 Originally I did not have something like a tripod, so when I took the video from above , I felt like this 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:31.900
 Well, let's bring 23 boxes of the appropriate number and come back to the top of the 100 yen shop at the top 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:36.370
 Place the smartphone stand Saku to ride to the iphone 5 s on the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:40.420
 Hey now I'm I'm in the body of this Is the Seidai von 5 s iphone 5 s 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:44.190
 In'm using it to shoot at roughly like this but did I say sh 09 d 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.190
 Every time 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.880
 Processing of the issue book height of such a magician etc. 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.880
 I thought it was a little annoying . 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:05.970
 I went towards the Yodobashi Camera likely of the Well kinda thought that want a tripod was 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:10.820
 I bought a tripod, and I bought this one. 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.820
 It is Belbon's 9th oil- painted tripod 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.120
 Commodity also practices a little bit open and come chill 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.730
 Though big thing becomes this 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.730
 his 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.690
 Yodobashi Camera's amount of money of this cube of Belbon was Â¥ 4,170 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.500
 But 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:35.420
 Honestly, there was a little cheaper tripod. 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.770
 But there is a reason why John and the other party have made this high this opponent 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.549
 actually 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.780
 I tried a variety of tripods of the exhibit but 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:50.370
 So was little noticed is I tripod 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:54.510
 If you stretch and use the local area naturally stretch the stretch 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:02:00.120
 When it comes to lifting, it will be necessary to work on shrinking 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.050
 It's easy to extend but it 's easy to shrink but you need to do some hard work 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.970
 It's often Tan 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.890
 Or remove the lock of the joint Toka River 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.869
 Light lock 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.750
 Or cancel 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.590
 Well after Marui 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.560
 Tripod that way say my part is Barry guy is posted 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.510
 It is something to fix by turning 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.810
 I just wondered if there was a stress buildup there and then something would stop being used 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.710
 so 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.240
 I'm looking for something 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.510
 What 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:39.980
 Stretching and shrinking legs From the problem of easily extending and shrinking 3 legs 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 It is the ninth of this Belbon to have exposed in 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.580
 This is the say when the stretch first in this state 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.700
 I do not walk in this state 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.690
 It is part of these three tips 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.240
 To go 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.560
 Third place in 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.769
 It is with such a feeling I'm sorry not fully enter the little screen 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.020
 It extends to about 1m, but 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.530
 When extending the is 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.810
 Enough for this 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.739
 that 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.280
 It is good though it is ready to use 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.670
 Until now, I will extend the other tripod as well. 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.690
 There were a lot of things that could be stretched without stress , but here 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.040
 It is the cube of Velbon 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:31.670
 As soon as you shrink the time 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.670
 When, in turn, holds much three it is here to shorten 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.730
 Go is against anti-anti-it is more of a center 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.180
 3 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.180
 Hot 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.000
 It's like that 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.740
 It's easy to get shorter 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.720
 It is after 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:04:01.390
 I don't need this in a slightly stretched state, but it is the best 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.390
 As the tripod, cut this middle in front 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.230
 It feels like this sideways Japan will spread sideways 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.320
 This is even though I've been with individual lever 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.250
 It is this to push and wash the mount 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.250
 You can also shoot freshly 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.169
 Then there are two levers etc. Here is the state where this is held firmly This angle is easy 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.400
 To 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.380
 When it changes 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:39.360
 What 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:43.020
 I really want to put an iphone 5s on this and if this is left on this lysine 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.370
 iphone 5s Toma Ma smartphone is not attached 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:52.759
 This rainbow directs the wind to this hole of the little finger digital camera 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.759
 Did bought another one because the screws for attaching end 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.810
 Asanuma Chamber of Commerce 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:08.470
 Where I wonder if I say foot professional 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:15.000
 I don't know for a moment I think it is called smartphone 15588 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.000
 This is a mount for smartphones, because it has a tripod and a screw to attach to a piece 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.030
 It looks like this 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.030
 Put on the screw 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.580
 Rounding pet 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.300
 Chia it does say in this day 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.300
 Close little 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.969
 This is also a smartphone other than digital cameras 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.420
 Now it's possible to install 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:52.510
 It is sudden without installing in 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:57.460
 I'd It is the width here is written 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:01.069
 Developing from a blanket 5.5 cm on foot 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:05.310
 It means that corresponds to the width 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:09.670
 Squirrel 10 td is bigger than iphone 5 s so if this is true 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:12.840
 iphone 5s should be thinking hard 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:17.729
 If you pull on the top 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:23.320
 The river spreads, and the upper and lower cushions 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:26.100
 Goodbye tension good the above with a little push down 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.950
 Was presented 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:34.740
 In this state, for example, 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.740
 The angle of the cube illuminates the bar 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.940
 The bar Since we went to earlier first 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.940
 If you do 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.860
 To be able to bamboo shoot 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.820
 Isn't this a nice combination? 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:56.440
 Of course 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.169
 Well, if usually because more of the cube because we use the time as possible extended 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.930
 Role 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:05.550
 I think that it is about 1m even though 94 cm is written 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:11.400
 I also use it for digital cameras normally 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:15.200
 I will try to wear it as many times, many times, many times, many times in a state of instability 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.200
 Because I think that there will be no taking in future 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.060
 Very 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:31.300
 We think that good environment might not have taken photography environment 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:34.580
 I would like to use this in the future to shoot more 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.790
 It is a cube of Belbon 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.910
 Suma 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:43.890
 It's smartphone holder of Asanumashokai for us Tsu Suma holder 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.890
 Thank you for the introduction of
