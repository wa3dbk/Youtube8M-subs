process over on the passenger side as

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.400 
process over on the passenger side as
you<00:03:19.209> can<00:03:19.360> see<00:03:19.510> here<00:03:19.750> now<00:03:19.900> we've<00:03:20.080> got<00:03:20.230> both

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
you can see here now we've got both

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.280 
you can see here now we've got both
sides<00:03:20.650> installed<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.600> boat<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.930> actually

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
sides installed the boat is actually

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.540 
sides installed the boat is actually
sitting<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.680> both<00:03:23.830> sides<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.310> it's<00:03:24.430> not

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
sitting on both sides so it's not

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.130 
sitting on both sides so it's not
rocking<00:03:25.000> back<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.180> forth<00:03:25.540> anymore

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
rocking back and forth anymore

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.650 
rocking back and forth anymore
now<00:03:26.799> we<00:03:26.860> were<00:03:27.190> able<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.519> slide<00:03:28.180> these<00:03:28.420> out

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
now we were able to slide these out

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.690 
now we were able to slide these out
because<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.170> boat<00:03:29.380> was<00:03:29.890> supported<00:03:30.430> here<00:03:30.549> by

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
because the boat was supported here by

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.280 
because the boat was supported here by
the<00:03:30.760> center<00:03:31.120> keel<00:03:31.360> roller<00:03:31.630> as<00:03:31.900> well<00:03:32.170> as

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the center keel roller as well as

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.320 
the center keel roller as well as
there's<00:03:32.470> one<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.680> little<00:03:32.890> farther<00:03:33.190> up<00:03:33.370> now<00:03:34.269> for

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
there's one a little farther up now for

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.910 
there's one a little farther up now for
some<00:03:34.690> reason<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.140> didn't<00:03:35.380> have<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.530> setup

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
some reason you didn't have that setup

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.229 
some reason you didn't have that setup
on<00:03:36.130> your<00:03:36.280> boat<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.670> would<00:03:36.790> definitely<00:03:36.940> want

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
on your boat you would definitely want

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.240 
on your boat you would definitely want
to<00:03:37.450> support<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.989> boat<00:03:38.170> when<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.890> remove

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
to support the boat when you remove

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.100 
to support the boat when you remove
these<00:03:39.489> or<00:03:39.790> ideally<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.540> could<00:03:40.690> have<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.959> boat

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
these or ideally you could have the boat

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.740 
these or ideally you could have the boat
off<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.470> trailer<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.120> change<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.299> bunks<00:03:43.600> out

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
off the trailer and change the bunks out

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.110 
off the trailer and change the bunks out
it<00:03:43.900> would<00:03:44.019> be<00:03:44.049> much<00:03:44.320> easier<00:03:44.519> but<00:03:45.519> if<00:03:45.850> you<00:03:45.940> don't

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it would be much easier but if you don't

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.210 
it would be much easier but if you don't
have<00:03:46.269> any<00:03:46.420> other<00:03:46.570> option<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:47.260> can't<00:03:48.010> do<00:03:48.160> it

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
have any other option you can't do it

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.680 
have any other option you can't do it
with<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.430> boat<00:03:48.580> on<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.850> trailer<00:03:48.880> still<00:03:49.450> just

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
with the boat on the trailer still just

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.420 
with the boat on the trailer still just
you<00:03:49.750> want<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.019> support<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.470> boat<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.829> make

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
you want to support the boat and make

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.360 
you want to support the boat and make
sure<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:52.030> supportive<00:03:53.019> properly<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:54.220> then

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
sure that supportive properly and then

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.460 
sure that supportive properly and then
you<00:03:54.459> can<00:03:54.610> change<00:03:54.760> out<00:03:55.000> each<00:03:55.239> side<00:03:55.510> of<00:03:55.690> these<00:03:55.810> as

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
you can change out each side of these as

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.110 
you can change out each side of these as
you<00:03:56.560> can<00:03:56.739> see<00:03:56.890> it's<00:03:57.040> not<00:03:57.190> real<00:03:57.370> hard<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.700> do<00:03:57.850> and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
you can see it's not real hard to do and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.420 
you can see it's not real hard to do and
it<00:03:58.810> greatly<00:03:59.110> improves<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.739> stability<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.310> the
