00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 You like it a lot, but what's 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.239
 Missing, as I always say, I'm coming back. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.510
 time then as soon as we have 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.860
 Time we're going to record a samba and it's 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 just a matter of time even if you wait 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.059
 who will come back 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.630
 Well, you're going to be born here at this trustee. 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.220
 I'll put it in the description obviously and 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.020
 As soon as you are born you already have these 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.450
 mountains but this is not what I wanted 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.500
 show but anyway I'll show 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.360
 for you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.209
 remembering that this main focus know 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.569
 so black seeds has nothing to do 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:23.280
 galera also generating pro that this 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:30.000
 cool mountain to have a cave and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.970
 so cool that will change what 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.179
 you will already notice that the map is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.590
 cool this is not advised here such is 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.709
 a beautiful 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.000
 now you're going to give the pras 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.640
 coordinates that I'll leave in the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.619
 description and arriving at them I 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 to record you too 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.670

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.399
 There you will get to this place and you. 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 ask me but there will be a simple 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.209
 Villa's face is a simple village villa 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.940
 only this village that is very confused 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.690
 face is a mutant village because it has 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.640
 a ravine giving a look that the zombie 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.350
 already has the bar here with some riffs 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.060
 for you alone 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.890
 how the iron bar tastes it bucket 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:23.250
 line and wheat have the amadeus in zombie 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.650

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.770
 avid good with lots of ore 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.870
 for you and bats 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.970
 but up there is the personal good part 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.460
 because here's a blacksmith's house 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.120
 also the whole blacksmith's house has got 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.750
 ba the boy then you ok watchful 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.880

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.280
 Chest guy will have a diamond then you guys 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.020
 The diamond will start a pen of 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.270
 iron apple and outside that here the cnpc them 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.850
 have some that have good exchanges 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.040
 It's just you go see it well I think this 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.160
 here in a good exchange but if you go 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.690
 Looking good, he's going to have some. 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.820
 he needs here that I will not go 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.820
 remember how it's going to be because he 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.030
 will have a good trading system for you 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.690
 so it's just you take a look around 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.020
 example here is going to have the 17 bi cross type 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.760
 just killing kitty there the pig I do not know 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.680
 which of the two raw citizens do I think 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.410
 two too and will get one 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.170
 emerald so it's really worth it 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.660
 Let me see what else the raw chicken is then 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.820
 until one is a good place for you O the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.040
 seven minerals for a diamond helmet 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.760
 is not a good place to 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.630
 things 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.060
 out here that also has enough is is a 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.640
 well diversified place we have it 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.220
 enough thing to do here like this 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.960
 There is enough to see you, mountain. 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.840
 I do not know why each manifest delay 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.390
 too much to load the maps is a 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.250
 I do not know anything about it, too. 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.930
 but it 's when the exchange does not load fast 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.140
 will understand the sale 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.970
 but over time it is improving and also 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.910
 It's the guy to thank everyone for the support. 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.580
 that is giving in the channel is very legal the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.980
 Did you guys come back or come back? 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.470
 to honor our work think 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.230
 everyone already had a good 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.560
 people went back to there and comment things 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.690

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.700
 we that the good comments of the bad 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.050
 depending on what the agent says 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.360
 scully and sure it's more the staff 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.190
 if you want to give a jewel and will help 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.840
 damn if you want to share some 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.060
 it also helps a lot 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.830
 sorry for that voice half scratched the face 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.030
 I just woke up and I'm with 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.430
 flu with both of them and it sucks 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.950
 but that's it people forgive the goal 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.690
 Short video is also because it's raining 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.390
 so I can not take the risk of 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.100
 I was watching a video and fell on the net for 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.169
 cause of the rain that falls a lot 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.400
 Gvt when it 's raining here I do not know 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.320
 Yes, it's up to you too. 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.600

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.270
 even as soon as it stops raining I 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.140
 A big deal already and we're good people. 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.140
