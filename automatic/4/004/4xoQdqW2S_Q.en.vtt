00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.210
 so simon follow here it is wednesday we 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.120
 Do not stand in the kitchen sitting in the car 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.549
 There is still a nutritional video 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.809
 Unfortunately, I can not do it for you today 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.520
 I'm cooking all day today 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 on the way, I forgive myself 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.270
 Still, I really want you one 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 give nutritional video because of me 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510
 Of course I'm on the way 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.310
 I actually do it 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.230
 the same lining show you right now and me 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.090
 I would like to say something to you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 me so when I 'm on the go 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200
 in between , many questions also eat 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.640
 who participate in the nutrition system like 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.320
 participate in my training system 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 the questions from simon why do you recommend 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.590
 with such longer breaks if one does not 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.070
 chance has something to eat 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.870
 pick up 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.840
 why do you recommend there for example 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.120
 things like cheese for example or 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.260
 things where a lot of protein in there is simon what 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 what is it all about? 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.890
 we come exactly to the topic what 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.210
 Maybe I have friends and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.649
 like his no advertising but overall 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.570
 I do not want to promote the products 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.649
 but a total advertising for dias 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.289
 make a diet in between 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.480
 I know many of you here 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.170
 Maybe I am, I'm from 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.299
 poland native there is one 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.700
 delicious smoked cheese to visit 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.900
 even in such small things from city 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.060
 they are called and exist in such a way 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.909
 big portion that's a nice one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.950
 the greasy cheese smoked is beautiful 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.200
 salty insanely horny taste can 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.100
 You 'll be delicious too 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.920
 I immediately cut into slices 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.340
 and what else do I have at freddys 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.659
 many of you say simon advertising for 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.250
 It does not work at all 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.210
 not about the product i find the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.439
 Very tasty and I for the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.280
 You can practically be her 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.189
 open up to eat 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.990
 they are made of soya isolates 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.579
 really a very good raw material 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.770
 I also know the guys who do that 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.170
 that's why as I said I know what's in there 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 is really a good product over the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.899
 taste can be argued one can 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.979
 which also make spice in the pan and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.899
 so I continue to really high 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.060
 tastes not so special but now 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.799
 you can just eat it well if you are 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.630
 looking over the nutrition with one looks 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.430
 Definitely eat it because of the things 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.619
 just insist on 100 we have 21 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.329
 Protein will be as good as no fat 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.040
 and virtually no carbs no 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.680
 salt and so on or very little 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.869
 little salt I'm very clear that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.590
 opinion especially for in between 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.580
 you should not just 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.500
 you already know that from others 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.540
 many videos then resort to one 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.890
 banana or an apple just have 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.360
 a big problem if we are a bit 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.530
 fruit or maybe even worse 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.280
 couple of gummy bears eating in between 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.599
 you all know it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.599
 We will have lots of sugar so good 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.340
 like no protein and we have 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.349
 mainly coal consultants and so good 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.599
 like no fat that means insulin 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.700
 That's why high blood sugar goes high like 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.590
 I fill up quite well but how 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.629
 then you get hungry after hungry 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.950
 gets cabbage steam and you all know it 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.299
 if someone ate burger or 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.760
 something where also many carbohydrates 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.060
 you are very strong in there 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 tired you become lazy afterwards the stomach 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.530
 really needs time all the way around 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.819
 process to metabolize her 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.599
 get tired about the wearer and you 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.160
 you can not anymore 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.200
 Concentrate that you all know 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.379
 if you really now the whole 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.879
 exchanged and a lot of protein is to have 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.980
 We do not constantly for example in 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.720
 we have a lot of cheese as special 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.110
 in cheese much fear of cheese is more complete 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.239
 nonsense 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.849
 in the cheese we have very very much 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.989
 high quality protein the value 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.190
 biological value is for the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.260
 Body even higher than for example 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.750
 meat so cheese very good protein 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.459
 we have no carbohydrates we have 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.920
 but a lot of fat should say many simon 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.630
 Fed is going through terrible 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.400
 Fat is not true if you 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.480
 in between a little bit because of me 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.190
 Of course I do not like it 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.630
 whole cheese but not only the idea 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.489
 the hard to do this with purely one 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.049
 a little bit of fat in between will be easy 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.389
 Make sure that the digestion 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.790
 slows that you be longer 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.310
 besides, we have cheese in cla too 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.799
 Conjugated linoleic acid is also available as 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.630
 as a supplement, it really is one 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.280
 fatty acid your fat metabolism 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.560
 even accelerated you will 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.780
 Of course you will be through cheese if he 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.849
 on the pizza is on the cheeseburger 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.069
 is etc or on the noodles then lies 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.169
 you will get thick cheese in between 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.549
 not really exaggerating is really 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.750
 well you really need it then 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.340
 no worries at all 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.709
 Insane as calcium would be very very 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.910
 so many b-vitamins really do 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.359
 also from the metabolism such a small one 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.459
 kick 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.220
 but the very good vitamins are just 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.200
 for the metabolism vegan protein is 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.760
 really good vegetable protein is 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.400
 especially in my opinion 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.109
 kombi with other words times then 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.680
 Eggs just complement each other very much 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.220
 very good and we have so full 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680
 protein 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.240
 These things do that kind of satie 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.130
 knows it too, there is also this 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.900
 saying cheese is closing the stomach there 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.540
 really something because it saturates 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.580
 crazy and you can of course in 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.050
 Giant quantities would make you fat 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.220
 because there are very many 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.930
 Calories are but you become easy 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.380
 do not eat much of it and it is better 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.300
 very little cheese and others 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.170
 to eat protein sources as lots of 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.160
 Sweets 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.440
 you can have a little bit 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.900
 chicken breast take you can also one 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.030
 salad with tuna or a piece of fish 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.730
 and so on where we really are 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.620
 Good ice cream has a lot of protein because of that 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.810
 also stimulates metabolism, it is 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.860
 do not like to fat converted her 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.840
 you do not have to worry at all 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.490
 do not make it long and as I said 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.470
 a bit fat especially if you 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.150
 Take a long break to eat 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.490
 just for making it slower 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.470
 for metabolism is therefore perfect 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.930
 snack and so maybe believe me 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.750
 again advertising for Polish 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.790
 smoked cheese horses so awesome and 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.310
 now I just promise 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.180
 you guys are fit you feel better when 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.490
 you just go for a protein-rich meal 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.560
 in between I'm out front 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.669
 subscribes to the channel as since 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.840

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.370
 Nutrition system you have me too 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.500
