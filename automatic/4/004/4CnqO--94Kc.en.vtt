I've<00:00:30.240> been<00:00:30.539> struggling<00:00:30.929> since<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:32.099> whole

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I've been struggling since this whole

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.600 
I've been struggling since this whole
process<00:00:32.880> started<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.800> realization<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
process started with the realization of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
process started with the realization of
the<00:00:35.730> Bulls<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.149> wanted<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.540> achieve<00:00:37.040> or<00:00:38.040> even

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the Bulls I wanted to achieve or even

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.010 
the Bulls I wanted to achieve or even
having<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> hard<00:00:38.700> time<00:00:38.790> with<00:00:39.210> setting<00:00:39.719> goals

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
having a hard time with setting goals

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.959 
having a hard time with setting goals
because<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.649> my<00:00:40.800> head<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.340> always<00:00:41.489> looked<00:00:41.820> at

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
because in my head I always looked at

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.330 
because in my head I always looked at
them<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:43.969> unachievable<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.710> far<00:00:47.010> away<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
them as unachievable or so far away that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
them as unachievable or so far away that
I<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:48.030> didn't<00:00:48.270> think<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.660> possible

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I just didn't think they are possible

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.580

to set realistic goals that i know that

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.840 
to set realistic goals that i know that
i<00:04:52.320> can't<00:04:52.620> achieve<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.250> know<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.460> I've<00:04:53.670> come

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
i can't achieve I know that I've come

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.870 
i can't achieve I know that I've come
this<00:04:53.910> far<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.720> I've<00:04:54.900> lost<00:04:55.140> you<00:04:55.410> know<00:04:55.650> over<00:04:56.550> 50

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
this far and I've lost you know over 50

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.410 
this far and I've lost you know over 50
pounds<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:58.800> know<00:04:59.370> that<00:04:59.550> I<00:04:59.610> can't<00:04:59.880> do<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.090> and

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
pounds and I know that I can't do it and

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.160 
pounds and I know that I can't do it and
I<00:05:01.170> wonder<00:05:01.590> if<00:05:01.740> people<00:05:01.890> have<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:02.970> same<00:05:03.180> doubt

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
I wonder if people have the same doubt

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.230 
I wonder if people have the same doubt
when<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.800> comes<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.250> their<00:05:05.400> goal<00:05:05.610> setting<00:05:06.060> and

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
when it comes to their goal setting and

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.200 
when it comes to their goal setting and
whether<00:05:06.960> it's<00:05:07.200> a<00:05:07.320> number<00:05:07.650> size<00:05:08.010> or<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:08.940> weight

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
whether it's a number size or a weight

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.260 
whether it's a number size or a weight
amount<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.900> went<00:05:10.080> away<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:11.610> know<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:12.210> just

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
amount you went away you know it just

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.420 
amount you went away you know it just
seems<00:05:12.630> so<00:05:12.900> far<00:05:13.200> away<00:05:13.230> but<00:05:13.860> now<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.190> I'm<00:05:14.280> at

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
seems so far away but now that I'm at

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.810 
seems so far away but now that I'm at
that<00:05:14.490> point<00:05:15.140> of<00:05:16.140> over<00:05:16.470> half<00:05:16.650> way<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.310> it's

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
that point of over half way to it it's

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.510 
that point of over half way to it it's
becoming<00:05:18.210> more<00:05:18.450> realistic<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.320> it's<00:05:19.500> it's<00:05:20.280> so

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
becoming more realistic and it's it's so

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.270 
becoming more realistic and it's it's so
close<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:21.000> can<00:05:21.060> taste<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.690> by<00:05:22.680> any<00:05:22.860> means<00:05:22.980> right

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
close I can taste it by any means right

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.940 
close I can taste it by any means right
now<00:05:23.400> I'm<00:05:23.610> not<00:05:23.790> close<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.240> 100<00:05:24.600> pounds<00:05:24.900> lost<00:05:25.140> but

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
now I'm not close to 100 pounds lost but

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.650 
now I'm not close to 100 pounds lost but
I<00:05:25.980> way<00:05:26.280> closer<00:05:26.610> than<00:05:26.730> when<00:05:26.970> I<00:05:27.000> started<00:05:27.090> this

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
I way closer than when I started this

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.409

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
journey and that to me puts that flavor

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.020 
journey and that to me puts that flavor
