non compound bow and it's been modified

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.950 
non compound bow and it's been modified
it's<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.880> Chinese<00:00:09.179> bow<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.490> reported<00:00:11.960> by

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
it's a Chinese bow that I reported by

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.320 
it's a Chinese bow that I reported by
postage<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:14.309> only<00:00:14.519> cost<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.030> hundred<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
postage it only cost about a hundred and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.980 
postage it only cost about a hundred and
sixty<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.880> it's<00:00:17.880> been<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.270> up<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> same<00:00:18.779> way

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
sixty and it's been that up the same way

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.290 
sixty and it's been that up the same way
but<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.439> found<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.609> doesn't<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.270> a

or recurve bow it's a non compound like

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.920 
or recurve bow it's a non compound like
I<00:00:54.210> said<00:00:54.449> before<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:56.390> that's<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> mount<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I said before and that's to mount the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.729 
I said before and that's to mount the
Mudcat<00:00:58.379> real<00:00:58.649> left<00:00:59.090> with<00:01:00.090> line<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.710> has

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
Mudcat real left with line and it has

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.369 
Mudcat real left with line and it has
the<00:01:02.160> same<00:01:02.370> adaption<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.420> put<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> front

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the same adaption I put on the the front

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
the same adaption I put on the the front
of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> Mudcat<00:01:04.860> real<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.430> hold<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.810> that

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
of the Mudcat real to hold this so that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.770 
of the Mudcat real to hold this so that
when<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:08.060> falls<00:01:09.060> forward<00:01:09.479> when<00:01:09.659> you're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
when that falls forward when you're

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
when that falls forward when you're
trying<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> aim<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.860> doesn't<00:01:11.220> drag

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
trying to aim down that doesn't drag

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.899 
trying to aim down that doesn't drag
line<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.119> over<00:01:12.330> everything<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.909> that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
line out all over everything and that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.420 
line out all over everything and that
makes<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.330> easy<00:01:15.479> enough<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.250> prevent<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
makes it easy enough to prevent it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.149 
makes it easy enough to prevent it
tangle<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> has<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.360> short<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.159> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
tangle it has to be short like that so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
tangle it has to be short like that so
that<00:01:20.490> doesn't<00:01:20.759> fall<00:01:21.150> around<00:01:21.450> behind<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.680> real

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that doesn't fall around behind the real

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.679 
that doesn't fall around behind the real
because<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.759> falls<00:01:24.000> behind<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.509> real

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
because if that falls behind the real

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.620 
because if that falls behind the real
the<00:01:24.990> arrow<00:01:25.290> goes<00:01:25.710> forward<00:01:26.220> grabs<00:01:26.700> snaps<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the arrow goes forward grabs snaps the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
the arrow goes forward grabs snaps the
line<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.470> flings<00:01:28.770> around<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.310> hits<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
line or flings around and hits the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.690 
line or flings around and hits the
ground<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:29.939> comes<00:01:30.150> back<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> hits<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
ground or comes back and hits you and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.670 
ground or comes back and hits you and
that's<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.720> safety<00:01:34.140> slider<00:01:34.439> is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that's what this the safety slider is

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.990 
that's what this the safety slider is
about<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> other<00:01:36.570> point<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
about the other point in that is this

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.149 
about the other point in that is this
piece<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.409> stops<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> slider

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
piece here and that stops the slider

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.350 
piece here and that stops the slider
falling<00:01:41.549> off<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> end<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.170> end<00:01:43.229> is

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
falling off the end down at this end is

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.399 
falling off the end down at this end is
really<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.540> device<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:48.750> gets<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> way<00:01:49.380> of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
really a device that gets in the way of

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
really a device that gets in the way of
your<00:01:49.649> finger<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> need<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.540> hold<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
your finger so you need to hold the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
your finger so you need to hold the
the<00:01:54.840> slider<00:01:55.109> forward<00:01:55.530> about<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:55.979> when

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the slider forward about here when

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.510 
the slider forward about here when
you've<00:01:56.280> drawn<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.549> boat<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:58.679> side<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.369> up

you've drawn the boat on the side not up
here<00:01:59.759> otherwise<00:02:00.359> you<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.750> very<00:02:01.079> brusque

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
here otherwise you get a very brusque

here otherwise you get a very brusque
finger<00:02:01.969> you<00:02:02.969> won't<00:02:03.149> enjoy<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.569> day

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.500 
is enough thread it's coarse metric
thread<00:02:15.830> inside<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> limb<00:02:17.160> there<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.940> it's

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
thread inside the limb there and it's

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.720 
thread inside the limb there and it's
the<00:02:18.660> same<00:02:18.870> bolt<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.160> still<00:02:20.340> goes<00:02:20.519> down

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the same bolt so it still goes down

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.390 
the same bolt so it still goes down
along<00:02:20.849> like<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:22.860> there's<00:02:23.040> plenty<00:02:23.160> enough

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
along like and so there's plenty enough

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.060 
along like and so there's plenty enough
to<00:02:23.610> hold<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.940> on
