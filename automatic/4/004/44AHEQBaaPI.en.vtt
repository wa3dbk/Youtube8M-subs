00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.660
 we'll see the turn back so we're going to leave on% after what we have 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.740
 made a death before, that is to say with the waves 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.810
 we're going to leave and pots of colors the red plane 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.680
 which is right before will be braking the three points we saw the ranking 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.770
 braking 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.060
 he was going 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.530
 coupet the actor of the throttle that is to say dropped the acceleration 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.340
 secondly the position 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.219
 as a reminder it was knees behind at the arrivals in front foot 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.130
 taken off the stage 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 and after this penalty back 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.440
 this part is still important 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.300
 it is still part of the braking that illustrates today by afp it 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.590
 speak all red 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.610
 when we arrive we can today 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 the two men is the decisive part of the turn ie this 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.320
 when we have to let go of women 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.350
 to be able to sit on the front of the bike 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.190
 the body or steel or stars 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.230
 you want to hide everything that is the part of the scene this is on the 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.530
 beginning 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.640
 wounded at all of the stage and well hidden there the only your point of 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.549
 talent once one sits 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.180
 the most important point and that has the success of the flat turn 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.130
 clouds is not the case is the inclination of the body 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.689
 it means on the abbas corner to ask that the bike bowed and 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.840
 that the body is more right of entry sitting on the side of the stage 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600
 there the first laureates 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.340
 it was important to scare the bike when it was necessary 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.950
 be in the same axis been aligned with the bike with a slope is 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.030
 very important 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.960
 that's how you can use the support actually the most expensive like c 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
 was a low wall where he came you try to support you the roads 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.080
 against the wall 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.710
 it's the easiest way 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.540
 once well stayed in 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.399
 also to the program to be focused on the bottom of the rut 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.049
 not just in front of the roma me times from further away 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.779
 and it's very important in the city for their connection with me but the 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.719
 Finnish did that the king will return 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.209
 if we look over their means this is where the king goes to see how 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.199
 we can go out 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.639
 yet not always easy 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:28.459
 I heard to enter it's just duclos white to the diver did not yield 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.279
 this space that has in between 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.499
 it's very important to do nothing when the bike is trying to 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:38.199
 turn rip if you add for example a shot of gas if you use 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.749
 the rear brake what will happen is that on the bike will recover 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.419
 that you will lose what has fallen back inside so it is 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.869
 important of the apartment you sit at the divers m 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.859
 during language course it is to let the casting motorcycle left by 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.609
 mm as soon as we get to the white plane this is the period when you start having 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.510
 accelerated 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.919
 to accelerate progressively 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.350
 to the blue cloud 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.999
 so blue that you can really put 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.729
 the ice how to install the feet on a footrest for a fee 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.199
 it's partially you start accelerating to find out if you have 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.559
 made a good turn these flats you speed up you never do 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.869
 turn around that is to say when we started to keep you speed 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.570
 population 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.700
 where he added but never where he lay there trip to come for against 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.629
 executives 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.219
 if you are a receiver 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.469
 it's a simple way for you to know 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.729
 liger lopez leverage I continue to work on it 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.719
 more one who has the most shot at 5 of the clutch 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.219
 gerin did not discuss on 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.419
 the braking part or used by 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.599
 medhat a curve it's the same thing you do not need to use the 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.309
 journey you are already using the engine brake 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:03.169
 So we come back to a passage without a trip we can have our finger on it 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.059
 security 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.880
 the story 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.229
 shareholder 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.079
 compare members at age 24 delighted with time 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.260
 as soon as you have a little time you have to keep the net use 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.509
 the couple of the whole france house 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.730
 on the other hand with India trying to get you to the highest white 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.930
 it's important to sign a real pledge to take the power and 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.979
 starts to get out of speed but dwarf on the curve exit 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.500
 but you brought back the foot is important 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.259
 to keep 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.529
 an acceleration and especially the repositioning of the upper body 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.490
 but to bring your Quebec could accelerate 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.990
 it is necessary to bring the head forward the projection between the head and the handle 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.690
 of gas is very important appa who is a member to start accelerating the 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.590
 peace must begin to advance on the front 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.669
 and it allows you to have control 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.819
 steel acceleration album and your motorcycles
