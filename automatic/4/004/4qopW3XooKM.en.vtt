00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
is a single strand of heavy gauge silver

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.319 
is a single strand of heavy gauge silver
the<00:00:52.530> next<00:00:52.800> model<00:00:52.979> up<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.699> using<00:00:53.999> multiple

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the next model up is using multiple

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.099 
the next model up is using multiple
strands<00:00:54.929> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.319> smaller<00:00:55.620> gauge<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.989> then<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
strands of the smaller gauge so then the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.229 
strands of the smaller gauge so then the
top<00:00:58.319> model<00:00:58.679> is<00:00:59.609> using<00:01:00.149> multiple<00:01:01.139> strands<00:01:01.920> of

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
top model is using multiple strands of

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.820 
top model is using multiple strands of
small<00:01:03.239> gauge<00:01:03.479> suburb<00:01:03.929> with<00:01:04.409> damping

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
small gauge suburb with damping

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.539 
small gauge suburb with damping
compounds<00:01:05.400> inside<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.680> damping<00:01:08.039> compound

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
compounds inside the damping compound

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.999 
compounds inside the damping compound
surrounding<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> strands<00:01:10.079> themselves<00:01:10.590> yes

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
surrounding the strands themselves yes
