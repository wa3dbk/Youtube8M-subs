complicated skill trees I've ever seen

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.560 
complicated skill trees I've ever seen
it's<00:06:36.950> all<00:06:37.130> about<00:06:37.280> subroutines<00:06:38.030> and<00:06:38.300> it's<00:06:38.420> just

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
it's all about subroutines and it's just

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.350 
it's all about subroutines and it's just
completely<00:06:38.990> nuts<00:06:39.580> every<00:06:40.580> two<00:06:40.760> minutes<00:06:41.120> you

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
completely nuts every two minutes you

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.930 
completely nuts every two minutes you
get<00:06:41.540> a<00:06:41.570> new<00:06:41.870> random<00:06:42.290> subroutine<00:06:43.100> and<00:06:43.340> the

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
get a new random subroutine and the

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.180 
get a new random subroutine and the
subroutine<00:06:44.540> is<00:06:44.780> focused<00:06:45.230> on<00:06:45.320> a<00:06:45.380> random<00:06:45.890> gun

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
subroutine is focused on a random gun

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.700 
subroutine is focused on a random gun
type<00:06:46.460> like<00:06:46.880> shotgun<00:06:47.390> or<00:06:47.600> sniper<00:06:47.720> or<00:06:48.290> rockets

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
type like shotgun or sniper or rockets

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.340 
type like shotgun or sniper or rockets
or<00:06:48.800> pistols<00:06:49.220> and<00:06:49.810> shields<00:06:50.810> and<00:06:50.930> health<00:06:51.140> and

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
or pistols and shields and health and

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.770 
or pistols and shields and health and
melee<00:06:51.590> attacks<00:06:52.070> then<00:06:52.880> for<00:06:53.120> those<00:06:53.240> two<00:06:53.450> minutes

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
melee attacks then for those two minutes

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.920 
melee attacks then for those two minutes
you<00:06:54.110> do<00:06:54.230> 25%<00:06:55.190> more<00:06:55.370> damage<00:06:55.820> with<00:06:56.150> that<00:06:56.390> damage

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
you do 25% more damage with that damage

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.770 
you do 25% more damage with that damage
type<00:06:57.290> and<00:06:57.560> 15%<00:06:58.370> less<00:06:58.760> with<00:06:59.120> everything<00:06:59.630> else

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
type and 15% less with everything else

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.140 
type and 15% less with everything else
so<00:07:00.470> if<00:07:00.710> you<00:07:00.800> get<00:07:00.950> a<00:07:00.980> sniper<00:07:01.250> rifle<00:07:01.460> subroutine

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
so if you get a sniper rifle subroutine

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.210 
so if you get a sniper rifle subroutine
and<00:07:02.180> you<00:07:02.450> don't<00:07:02.630> have<00:07:02.900> a<00:07:02.960> sniper<00:07:03.290> you're<00:07:03.950> stuck

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
and you don't have a sniper you're stuck

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.740 
and you don't have a sniper you're stuck
doing<00:07:04.520> less<00:07:04.700> damage<00:07:04.730> for<00:07:05.300> the<00:07:05.330> next<00:07:05.600> two

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
doing less damage for the next two

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.110 
doing less damage for the next two
minutes<00:07:06.010> there's<00:07:07.010> also<00:07:07.190> a<00:07:07.310> triple<00:07:07.760> clocked

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
minutes there's also a triple clocked

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.500 
minutes there's also a triple clocked
skill<00:07:08.540> that<00:07:08.750> then<00:07:08.930> triples<00:07:09.560> bonuses<00:07:10.100> and

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
skill that then triples bonuses and

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.690 
skill that then triples bonuses and
penalties<00:07:11.510> for<00:07:12.020> each<00:07:12.200> subroutine<00:07:13.040> so<00:07:13.460> this<00:07:13.580> is

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
penalties for each subroutine so this is

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.700 
penalties for each subroutine so this is
going<00:07:13.850> to<00:07:13.910> be<00:07:14.060> a<00:07:14.090> great<00:07:14.510> skill<00:07:14.840> tree<00:07:15.110> after

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
going to be a great skill tree after

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.780 
going to be a great skill tree after
you've<00:07:15.830> unlocked<00:07:16.190> all<00:07:16.490> four<00:07:17.140> weapon<00:07:18.140> slots<00:07:18.790> so

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
you've unlocked all four weapon slots so

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.010 
you've unlocked all four weapon slots so
