00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.450
 we want to know that in doing we were playing 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.549
 fun and cool for your bunny or 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.080
 finally hamster your rodent or rabbit 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:17.400
 because rabbits is not the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.660
 rodent sees there you will need the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.970
 toilet larvotto 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:30.620
 there are not many residues of a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.810
 it's optional to the cutter but good 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.820
 of a pointed object so concentrated that 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.310
 I use for the price collage and the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.290
 filmo but hey it's like a toothpick 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:45.810
 we can that's what it is in spreading 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.230
 its most solid and that's it we also 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.870
 need 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.130
 I do not have any more but I think 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.170
 been the end but I will not use 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.870
 but I will explain you must 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.489
 will want to take out vegetables either pellets 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.079
 end it actually is especially practical 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.530
 for hamsters because the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.240
 adversaries get in and for them 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.759
 rabbits to explain after so I 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.310
 advise more austere so it interests 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.329
 not that they have a rabbit but go to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.770
 the end of the video you have 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:28.469
 started against our object at the end 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:30.689
 you're going to be small so sorry 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:34.049
 you counted to make little ones 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.259
 holes that are parallel to each other 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.779
 so many others I do the first 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.329
 so these are parallel to one 

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:45.090
 other he makes you greatness in 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.069
 depending on the color of your vegetables 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.130
 have burnt out they do not want to take any 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.409
 series because its ends and so that's it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.759
 goes through the holes still be the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.829
 goal is that your hamster 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.780
 he's going to want to eat celery or 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.600
 or the other which some of you from them 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.850
 put in and so he's going to want 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.140
 center and so to be able to reach 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.239
 the different types you have 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.330
 answered you're too so I really see 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.640
 just lipse so first have to get one 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.200
 little trouble to eat so 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.580
 wait I take a hug because 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:29.110
 it's bigger and so it will do with the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:31.000
 own and your name a little kid 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.739
 other stems fell and I will take a 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.650
 bomb 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.880
 there you wait it's your hole is 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.250
 be careful i'm going to his troops so 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.230
 to be careful not to put any 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:48.130
 launch veil wait i will use 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:51.340
 the euro side there are you holes 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:56.890
 like this drove a little bit then 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:03.060
 I showed you voices of holes like 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:06.070
 this and that's it and you're just going 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.859
 place your stick of celery your 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.630
 pellet or things like that in 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.340
 so it's actually a step without a stick 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.579
 go you want who stands out from the other 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.019
 side 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:24.280
 the fascinator not the three races and 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.870
 wood pine three stuff like that is 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.489
 saw from the hole on the other side so 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.069
 imagine what game do I want to put him 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.069
 a series stick to lose a little 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.069
 kind 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.580
 young and that's my serial stick so 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.730
 you will be able to pass it in the 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.610
 first too much and make them leave by the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.200
 second 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.980
 that's it and that's it for your fleet 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.140
 ramsar family so your hamster will have to 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.300
 eat your preserve it to arrive 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.760
 behind and so you do like that 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:06.390
 full of lots of little holes this is what 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.060
 that little between two functions the 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:17.820
 thematic for it's not sticks that 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:19.470
 is the SaaS and sticks 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.970
 lollipops but it can this food 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:27.500
 for the end for a master so and who 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.260
 also puts at your service beauty 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.360
 what do they finally have you can 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.850
 cutting the long lines is 40-6 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.180
 in short, we can do a lot of small things 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.230
 things like that that makes or that your 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.310
 rabbit your inventory be amused so 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.500
 now here I'm going to show how 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.660
 end that any delay so you have 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.310
 need beautiful your job I 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:57.990
 taken over the same because I do not 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:05:00.330
 will not use it alas cutter so for 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.419
 simple thinking also you have 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.419
 just expected to see them 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.729
 cut people language is your work 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:35.459
 this is one of you just going for 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:39.209
 to make a start we can take as 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:39.959
 that why she can be a little 

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.149
 more open 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:44.489
 here is one inside you go 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:48.869
 put a big two brake handle 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:50.849
 times and get them out by mr do 

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:54.149
 holes but then a little more to 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.879
 different classes not like but 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:06:01.519
 not as before as I believe most of 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.519
 higher passes 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:13.429
 that's all kind of one there that's a there and 

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:16.709
 and then we put your faith and 

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:18.689
 you're going to bring out the two matches 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:20.490
 times by the troops so your hand 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.259
 he goes he'll see the wicks twice and 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.479
 it made me want to eat 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:32.309
 so he's going to want danger he has to 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:36.029
 get repaired by the stuff and so he 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:36.959
 can here it will be earlier I would have 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.279
 may have done a little shorter 

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:40.469
 normally to cut up until then 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:43.919
 about half like that and then there he 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:47.159
 can discover it he will be able to eat 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.919
 once there by the towers you 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:52.769
 can also put a big handle 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:55.019
 you and bring out other vegetables 

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:57.269
 by the sides of which leaves 

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:58.739
 endive denial of carrots 

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:00.419
 so it's very fun right rabbit 

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:04.619
 you put it like that in our 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:06.689
 case this arrangement of cages with my 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:08.009
 son and cash I have because I have 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:11.579
 still the cages so also never 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:14.719
 shocked after I'm ready for what the 

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:14.719
 put there 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.470
 put the hay and hao brings out 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.849
 hay or vegetable matches 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.680
 so to me I have never tested with my 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:29.500
 rabbit I have already tested that with 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.690
 my hamster so the technique to the cus 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.860
 and the city except that our beautiful series 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.360
 and so it's really nice for them 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:40.030
 because for hamsters because 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:44.470
 after they have eaten celery 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:47.020
 he uses towards the rollers to make 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.690
 his nest so here it was really too much 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.490
 cute I loved so he was called 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.919
 crotch my hamster 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.720
 unfortunately he died at the same 

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:58.270
 time it was age a hamster knew 

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.940
 not long brief homage to ash trees 

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:03.270
 more video where I will speak than of my soul 

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.639
 sister and he was telling us that no but the 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.199
 here I hope that this little one 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:11.819
 explanation how to make a toy for 

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:11.819
 rabbit is a land you will have liked
