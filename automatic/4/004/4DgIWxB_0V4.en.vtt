the<00:00:00.840> reason<00:00:01.319> that<00:00:01.560> XML<00:00:02.429> looks<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.850> way<00:00:03.000> it

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
the reason that XML looks the way it

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.269 
the reason that XML looks the way it
does<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.750> because<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.920> nature<00:00:05.130> of

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
does is because of the nature of

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.550 
does is because of the nature of
computer<00:00:05.879> input<00:00:06.089> we<00:00:06.750> need<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.080> be<00:00:07.200> able<00:00:07.230> to

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
computer input we need to be able to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.610 
computer input we need to be able to
tell<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> computer<00:00:08.570> where<00:00:09.570> markup<00:00:10.230> begins

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
tell the computer where markup begins

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.490 
tell the computer where markup begins
and<00:00:10.830> ends<00:00:11.389> we<00:00:12.389> need<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.690> give<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.870> some<00:00:13.019> means

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
and ends we need to give it some means

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.890 
and ends we need to give it some means
of<00:00:13.620> easily<00:00:14.190> distinguishing<00:00:15.030> between<00:00:15.059> markup

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
of easily distinguishing between markup

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.140 
of easily distinguishing between markup
and<00:00:15.990> content<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:17.460> need<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> account<00:00:18.000> for

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and content and we need to account for

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.410 
and content and we need to account for
the<00:00:18.330> fact<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.109> computer<00:00:19.439> sees<00:00:19.800> everything

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
the fact that a computer sees everything

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.070 
the fact that a computer sees everything
linearly<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:23.119> Lesson<00:00:24.119> number<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.869> took<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
linearly in Lesson number one we took a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
linearly in Lesson number one we took a
look<00:00:25.260> at<00:00:25.410> an<00:00:25.500> example<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> restaurant<00:00:26.519> menu

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
look at an example of a restaurant menu

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.150 
look at an example of a restaurant menu
and<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.840> kind<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.109> laid<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.619> according<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and we kind of laid it out according to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.769 
and we kind of laid it out according to
how<00:00:29.279> you'd<00:00:29.460> see<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> restaurant<00:00:30.300> menu<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
how you'd see a restaurant menu with a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.380 
how you'd see a restaurant menu with a
heading<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.230> top<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.800> menu<00:00:32.759> line<00:00:32.969> items

at<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.579> bottom<00:00:36.020> but<00:00:37.020> here<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:37.829> how<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
at the bottom but here we see how a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
at the bottom but here we see how a
computer<00:00:38.489> would<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> same<00:00:39.390> information

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
computer would see the same information

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.190 
computer would see the same information
see<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> text<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.520> arriving<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.809> long

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
see all the text is arriving in one long

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.330 
see all the text is arriving in one long
stream<00:00:45.469> there<00:00:46.469> would<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.620> no<00:00:46.739> distinction

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
stream there would be no distinction

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.430 
stream there would be no distinction
necessarily<00:00:48.239> between<00:00:48.600> where<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.960> section<00:00:49.320> of

the document began and ended as humans
we<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.800> happen<00:00:53.309> visually<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
we can see that happen visually a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.080 
we can see that happen visually a
computer<00:00:54.930> cannot<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.100> all<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
computer cannot see that with all of a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.470 
computer cannot see that with all of a
lot<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.390> extra<00:00:57.660> programming<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:59.480> so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
lot of extra programming going on so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290 
lot of extra programming going on so
here<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.899> how<00:01:01.079> XM<00:01:01.949> how<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> computer<00:01:02.699> would<00:01:03.120> see

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
here is how XM how a computer would see

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.320 
here is how XM how a computer would see
our<00:01:03.420> menu<00:01:03.780> example<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:07.700> if<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.909> take<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> look

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
our menu example and if you take a look

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
our menu example and if you take a look
at<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.590> file<00:01:10.860> called<00:01:11.159> menu<00:01:11.610> XML<00:01:12.920> we<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.070> see

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
at the file called menu XML we can see

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.859 
at the file called menu XML we can see
how<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.530> took<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.770> same<00:01:17.100> content<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.060> laid

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
how we took that same content and laid

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.760 
how we took that same content and laid
it<00:01:19.049> out<00:01:19.140> according<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.840> what<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:21.960> XML<00:01:22.470> file

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it out according to what an XML file

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.020 
it out according to what an XML file
would<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.509> okay<00:01:25.310> we've<00:01:26.310> accounted<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
would be okay we've accounted for the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.179 
would be okay we've accounted for the
fact<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.750> computer<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> see

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
fact that the computer is going to see

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the ending of that subsection and we've

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.630 
the ending of that subsection and we've
used<00:01:45.119> corner<00:01:45.630> brackets<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.460> they're<00:01:47.460> not

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
used corner brackets because they're not

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.700 
used corner brackets because they're not
used<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.210> often<00:01:48.420> normal<00:01:49.020> text<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.560> it's

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
used all that often normal text so it's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.679 
used all that often normal text so it's
easy<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.280> computer<00:01:50.880> program<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.360> be

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.120 
easy for a computer program to be
written<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.020> such<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> way<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.890> sees

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
written in such a way that when it sees

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.789 
written in such a way that when it sees
well<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.180> corner<00:01:54.960> bracket<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.649> might

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
well a corner bracket or as you might

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.929 
well a corner bracket or as you might
call<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> blessed<00:01:56.310> than<00:01:56.460> or<00:01:56.610> greater<00:01:56.640> than
