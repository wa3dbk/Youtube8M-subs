00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
awareness of what they're trying to do

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
awareness of what they're trying to do
and<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.400> need<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> take<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> next

and they need to take it to the next
level<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.770> shows<00:01:26.070> where

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
level now I think this shows where

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.149 
level now I think this shows where
soccer<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.810> America<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
soccer is going in America and it's a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
soccer is going in America and it's a
rising<00:01:29.670> sport<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.689> everything<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
rising sport and I think everything that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.179 
rising sport and I think everything that
you<00:01:31.200> guys<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.439> been<00:01:31.500> able<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you guys have been able to do with the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.730 
you guys have been able to do with the
fans<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.880> think<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> crest<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.960> amazing<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
fans I think the crest is amazing I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.109 
fans I think the crest is amazing I
think<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> team<00:01:35.280> has<00:01:35.430> been<00:01:35.549> marketed

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
think the way the team has been marketed

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.450 
think the way the team has been marketed
I<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.720> his<00:01:36.840> co<00:01:37.049> affiliation<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.189> even

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I think his co affiliation is even

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
I think his co affiliation is even
stronger<00:01:38.670> than<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> single<00:01:39.180> affiliation<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
stronger than a single affiliation I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.450 
stronger than a single affiliation I
think<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.320> Warren<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> his<00:01:40.920> team<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.189> done

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
think what Warren and his team have done

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.969 
think what Warren and his team have done
and<00:01:41.790> everyone<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.990> commendable<00:01:43.439> when

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and everyone is really commendable when

question<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.329> Sacramento<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
question for Sacramento was would the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
question for Sacramento was would the
fans<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> community<00:01:53.430> support<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> club

are<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.000> huge<00:01:57.540> yes
