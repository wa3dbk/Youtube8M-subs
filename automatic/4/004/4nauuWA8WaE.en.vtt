00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.790
 he found no comics wounded environment 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 and today we are going to look for each day 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.000
 jumped the point uncle good we have not 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.309
 done now we wanted a lot of people 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 so you're going to see a somewhat collision 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.670
 trunk because there was nobody where I 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.039
 went up in summer is also because that's how I 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.779
 I remove from political accident decalogo 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.760
 grab and is very nice that plan 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 as a pattern that they can control but 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.410
 what are you telling me I kept the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 career troll 2.0 ballet and as a second 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.150
 the green this is the first action that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.150
 to jazz 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.400
 and my friends, quiet guys 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
 calm that already what I have to 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.130
 get out of here and once we get out of 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.290
 here you have to catch some type of lupine 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.350
 some kind of ramp and get on top of 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.239
 the military base around here you do not see me 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.760
 is that I try to avoid it 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.430
 try to dodge it for boy I think that 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.630
 my last but normal guy 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.730
 He tried to dodge that man because he 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.059
 I wanted to look I wanted to give me a 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.059
 clout 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.150
 do not get nervous to hit him 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.090
 punch to the quiet computer the mobile 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.270
 it also tastes good since the moon does not 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.770
 will like to see here eyes jump 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.940
 for perfect perfect perfect 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.140
 let's go eye quarters to the flip 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.880
 everything perfect everything well calibrated and I 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.490
 like a car of faces and why then 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.020
 because without such a thing the suddenly does not 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.859
 I understand what happened 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.299
 it seems there are 15 control points 6 if 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:41.560
 9 are missing according to my mathematics 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.380
 we're doing fine, well, well, the thing seems 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.570
 that flows flows so much I wanted to float 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.520
 I do not know how it floats guys I do not ask anymore 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.159
 how but but not exploited lately 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.549
 did not explode is how are we going streak there is no 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:02.020
 gusts that in all the principles that 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:04.149
 the man stopped him perfect leads 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.920
 accelerate and it will not have arrived here it's worth 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.720
 well well well guys is either a 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.800
 little bit this guy get a little bit 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.560
 I know why but your car gives me gives me 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.360
 like mania is like something strange we go no 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.780
 no no 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.750
 pathetic or the car of life 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.510
 we disappear reappears moss and jump 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.860
 around here and there we are very well give and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.380
 we raise fifth we see people here 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.120
 plays too well uncle a lesson of 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.709
 Perfect perfect turn are two laps 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.370
 boy we have possibilities we have 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.040
 chances of winning ok let's go sixth 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.090
 ok birds out there that is a cactus yesterday 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.239
 means fir of the feet 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.709
 voucher is worth voucher and the one that jumps for 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.540
 that parents as a result break 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.370
 addictive sorcerers remove seems like a 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.099
 I thought it was a movie 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.660
 inc long cold water with 1800 we saw it 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.390
 God cost me or collective 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.770
 did not disappear the man who from the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.040
 smack that what got him has been 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.160
 disintegrated I think is my companion theory 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.260
 fellow mate mate this is 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.040
 like the rapport in person uncle 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.040
 amazing 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:20.660
 in all with streetlights 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.660
 to the limit and I like that 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.980
 I do not say more let's go seconds 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.170
 in front I think I'm not going to enter uncle 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.780
 you have no way to go back 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.520
 uncle that more luck to have taken more 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.610
 long the fucking great yard without ideas 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.020
 before the first one that rage happens nothing 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:50.780
 I 'm going to keep everything 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.780
 to take him same label too 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:02.010
 and there we go we are going to go to things with so much 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.350
 so complicated we go there is the one of 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:13.520
 we go fifth we can get it 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:19.970
 it's really okay the race is good 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.970
 incredible signs 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.650
 we do not want to dodge sometimes we're not going to 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.900
 see as an infinite loop goodbye to a 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.460
 positive please do not explode now but 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.580
 Obviously obviously there is too much 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.580
 luck 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:44.419
 the people are amazing it is possible that 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.419
 me to the first that lack nothing but good 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.720
 We will try to enter the podium and if not 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.760
 we can become important to participate 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:59.500
 around here to the perfect jump 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:02.040
 I wish acrobatics go go balance already 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.040
 amazing 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.850
 the shot over here 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.130
 on the podium can I really can I 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.130
 love 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.400

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.810
 could be third I think good this one gave 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.810
 the different parts that I can 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.930
 in life and in life 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.669
 I wrote my position for large schools 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.350
 incredible playground the third one is there at 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.699
 end of the room is left or so I think 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.650
 indeed there is in the third 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.259
 determined so cast the stake 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.270
 rest 9 eye to double looping your 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.880
 movements limits a double fire 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.720
 lateral looping better said the case 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.039
 Pretty cool is quite happening 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:01.130
 We get but I have not been able to win 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:03.110
 because that's how happy he looks and see you 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.060
 in the next video bye bye in the next 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.139
 of being the next in the next 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.139
 it's when the bad uncle
