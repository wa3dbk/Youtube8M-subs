00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.530
 I hit you good guys before teaching them 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 another another quini I'm going to show you how 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.580
 because many of you like them 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.520
 will try to talk to the owl 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.869
 and for that you can avoid it 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.320
 successful way what you need is therefore 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.079
 your sword obviously and with the stick and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.370
 the joke is that you are alternating 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:42.129
 The sword and the sword of Teko 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.539
 this game will cost a small 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.489
 of working to do a little bit of 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.540
 work because even up to me as 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.670
 that I still go goats 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.100
 but if it is going to come out and in this way 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.100
 they will be able to dodge the skewer 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.199
 the joke is to be fast not so fast 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.850
 but you are going to find 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.850
 finding the rhythm at 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.950
 by alternating the buttons 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.580
 they are going to do something like the super slide 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.580
 and well, since spit forms are 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.610
 they save all their talk the joke in 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 masters is that to walk backwards 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.540
 but go alternate sword and deco 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.820
 and go find the rhythm 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.190
 where they see that the coffee maker is better than 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.630
 They will come back and do it again there 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.360
 who is said is what I still do not 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.090
 I understand why because sometimes I do not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.060
 I get it when I'm supposed to be 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.890
 doing well 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.460
 but there you practice in your 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.460
 emulator 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.570
 they have guaranteed results 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.240
 it was no longer short this and many 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.720
 they will stop complaining about 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.080
 talk with that fucking is worth seeing 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.080
 kids
