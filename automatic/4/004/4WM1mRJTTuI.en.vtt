limitation at this point I've done these

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.430 
limitation at this point I've done these
two<00:02:36.319> where<00:02:36.530> they<00:02:36.769> look<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:38.410> butterfly<00:02:39.410> wings

two where they look like butterfly wings
I've<00:02:40.310> done<00:02:40.549> them<00:02:40.700> where<00:02:40.849> they<00:02:40.940> look<00:02:41.060> like

I've done them where they look like

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
I've done them where they look like
flower<00:02:41.569> petals<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:47.650> be<00:02:48.650> sure<00:02:48.799> not<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.069> flood

don't add too much water cuz it will

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.780 
don't add too much water cuz it will
simply<00:02:54.260> run<00:02:54.620> all<00:02:54.799> over<00:02:55.069> everywhere<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.700> you

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
what a third circle here I'm gonna add

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.300 
what a third circle here I'm gonna add
some<00:03:10.190> more<00:03:10.220> water

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.130 

a<00:03:17.400> little<00:03:18.239> bit<00:03:18.330> more

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
all right now I'm gonna let this dry

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.260 
all right now I'm gonna let this dry
because<00:03:29.100> I'm<00:03:29.250> gonna<00:03:29.430> start<00:03:29.610> adding<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.000> blue

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
because I'm gonna start adding the blue

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.600 
because I'm gonna start adding the blue
I<00:03:30.630> don't<00:03:30.960> want<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.320> add<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.620> blue<00:03:31.890> until<00:03:32.370> these

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
I don't want to add the blue until these

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.460 
I don't want to add the blue until these
rings<00:03:32.910> are<00:03:33.090> completely<00:03:33.660> dry<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.080> reason<00:03:34.350> for

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
rings are completely dry the reason for

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.770 
rings are completely dry the reason for
that<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.770> if<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.040> start<00:03:35.420> adding<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.690> they

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
that is if you start adding it and they

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.580 
that is if you start adding it and they
happen<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.200> overlap<00:03:37.470> they<00:03:38.430> will<00:03:38.610> simply<00:03:39.590> run

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
happen to overlap they will simply run

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.100 
happen to overlap they will simply run
into<00:03:41.190> each<00:03:41.280> other<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.700> circles<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.600> Rings

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
into each other in the circles the Rings

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.940 
into each other in the circles the Rings
will<00:03:44.690> will<00:03:45.690> disappear<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.470> won't<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.800> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
will will disappear you won't have the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.500 
will will disappear you won't have the
nice<00:03:47.100> sharp<00:03:47.430> rings<00:03:47.700> around<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> circle<00:03:48.480> so

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
nice sharp rings around the circle so

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.750 
nice sharp rings around the circle so
I'm<00:03:48.720> gonna<00:03:48.840> let<00:03:48.960> this<00:03:49.020> dry<00:03:49.380> pause<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.550> video

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
I'm gonna let this dry pause the video

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.860 
I'm gonna let this dry pause the video
and<00:03:51.150> come<00:03:51.450> back<00:03:51.630> after<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.440> dries

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
and come back after that dries

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.350 
and come back after that dries
alright<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.110> my<00:03:55.260> purple<00:03:55.740> has<00:03:56.010> dried<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.850> now

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
alright so my purple has dried and now

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.220 
alright so my purple has dried and now
we'll<00:03:57.630> begin<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.990> apply<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:59.100> blue<00:03:59.520> color<00:04:03.230> and

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
we'll begin to apply the blue color and

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.650 
we'll begin to apply the blue color and
for<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.530> sum<00:04:04.770> to<00:04:05.280> add<00:04:05.430> interest<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.209> am<00:04:06.360> going

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
for the sum to add interest I am going

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.440 
for the sum to add interest I am going
to<00:04:06.780> overlap<00:04:07.230> into<00:04:07.650> those<00:04:07.800> purple<00:04:08.220> areas<00:04:11.450> and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
to overlap into those purple areas and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.830 
to overlap into those purple areas and
pick<00:04:12.720> up<00:04:12.870> your<00:04:13.020> water<00:04:13.220> place<00:04:14.220> your<00:04:14.459> dog<00:04:14.840> get

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.360 
the dog hair out of there this blue is
pretty<00:04:23.880> vibrant<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.750> tend<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.050> have<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.410> dilute

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
pretty vibrant I tend to have to dilute

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.620 
pretty vibrant I tend to have to dilute
it<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.610> little<00:04:26.790> bit<00:04:26.970> more<00:04:27.120> than<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.330> have<00:04:27.600> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
it a little bit more than I have the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.330 
it a little bit more than I have the
purple<00:04:28.610> but<00:04:29.610> it's<00:04:29.760> still<00:04:29.910> very<00:04:29.970> pretty

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.550

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
another blue circle I'm getting any

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.760 
another blue circle I'm getting any
shape<00:04:45.600> size<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:47.760> need<00:04:48.530> anyway<00:04:49.530> your

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
shape size you need anyway your

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.330 
shape size you need anyway your
imagination<00:04:50.460> goes<00:04:50.640> on<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.919> see<00:04:56.310> I

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
imagination goes on this and see I

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.100 
imagination goes on this and see I
entered<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:56.790> little<00:04:57.060> bit<00:04:57.210> too<00:04:57.419> much<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.990> the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
entered a little bit too much of the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.170 
entered a little bit too much of the
water<00:04:58.350> here<00:04:58.919> so<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.310> is<00:04:59.340> starting<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.790> blur<00:05:00.150> a

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
water here so it is starting to blur a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:10.420 
water here so it is starting to blur a
little<00:05:00.360> bit<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:01.370> might<00:05:02.370> be<00:05:02.520> able<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.820> salvage<00:05:03.030> it

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:27.159 

that's<00:05:11.000> not<00:05:11.210> bad<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:14.570> I'll<00:05:14.810> add<00:05:14.930> another<00:05:15.229> one

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:40.020 

and<00:05:27.740> blocked

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.490 

alright<00:05:41.030> now<00:05:41.420> this<00:05:41.570> point<00:05:41.750> again<00:05:42.020> I<00:05:42.080> would<00:05:42.320> let

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
alright now this point again I would let

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.290 
alright now this point again I would let
this<00:05:42.620> dry<00:05:42.950> if<00:05:43.370> I<00:05:43.490> was<00:05:43.640> going<00:05:43.850> to<00:05:43.940> add<00:05:44.030> any<00:05:44.210> more

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
this dry if I was going to add any more

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.860 
this dry if I was going to add any more
colors<00:05:45.670> and<00:05:46.670> I<00:05:46.850> have<00:05:46.880> done<00:05:47.180> up<00:05:47.300> a<00:05:47.390> sample<00:05:47.630> to

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
colors and I have done up a sample to

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.430 
colors and I have done up a sample to
show<00:05:47.900> you<00:05:48.140> when<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:48.920> looks<00:05:49.100> like<00:05:49.340> after<00:05:50.210> I've

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
show you when it looks like after I've
