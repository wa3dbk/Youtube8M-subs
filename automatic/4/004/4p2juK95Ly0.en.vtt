in this case here as you can see we are

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770 
in this case here as you can see we are
using<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.949> pistol<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> some<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.329> wacky

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
things are going on here we use the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
things are going on here we use the
grappling<00:01:06.600> hook<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.810> attach<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.619> SUV<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
grappling hook to attach that SUV to the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
grappling hook to attach that SUV to the
back<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> semi<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.330> now<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.750> dragging

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
back of the semi so now it is dragging

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.929 
back of the semi so now it is dragging
it<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
it and so you can see that it kind of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.330 
it and so you can see that it kind of
chunks<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.110> semi<00:01:13.350> takes<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.130> roll

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
chunks out here the semi takes a roll

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.679 
chunks out here the semi takes a roll
but<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> problem<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.390> when

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
but that's not a problem because when

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
but that's not a problem because when
you<00:01:15.810> fall<00:01:16.080> somewhere<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.280> need<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> get

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you fall somewhere or you need to get

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
you fall somewhere or you need to get
somewhere<00:01:17.939> quickly<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.290> some<00:01:19.500> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
somewhere quickly this is like some of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469 
somewhere quickly this is like some of
the<00:01:19.650> fastest<00:01:20.220> travel<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> game<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.420> can

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the fastest travel in the game you can

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.630 
the fastest travel in the game you can
just<00:01:21.750> point<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.200> shoot<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
just point and shoot and there is a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.910 
just point and shoot and there is a
distance<00:01:24.299> limit<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.990> how<00:01:25.200> far<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.680> fly
