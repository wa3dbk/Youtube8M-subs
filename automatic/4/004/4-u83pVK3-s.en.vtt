00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:10.779 
think the next thing we have coming up

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.249 
think the next thing we have coming up
is<00:07:10.809> that<00:07:11.139> in<00:07:11.769> sectors<00:07:12.399> cuz<00:07:12.909> he<00:07:12.999> has<00:07:13.029> both<00:07:13.419> cuz

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:14.259 
is that in sectors cuz he has both cuz
