with<00:01:36.639> people<00:01:36.670> waiting<00:01:37.270> in<00:01:37.539> line<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.770> think

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
with people waiting in line and I think

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.889 
with people waiting in line and I think
it<00:01:39.099> really<00:01:39.130> comes<00:01:39.490> down<00:01:39.579> to<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.090> very<00:01:40.389> strange

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
it really comes down to the very strange

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.230 
it really comes down to the very strange
messaging<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:42.219> Nintendo's<00:01:42.789> been<00:01:42.969> putting

still<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:26.940> day<00:02:27.240> don't<00:02:27.270> understand<00:02:27.900> why

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
still to this day don't understand why

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.230 
still to this day don't understand why
they<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.230> didn't<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> wii<00:02:28.980> golf<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:30.030> more

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
they just didn't do a wii golf with more

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.430 
they just didn't do a wii golf with more
courses<00:02:30.570> because<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.020> was<00:02:31.110> one<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.320> most

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
courses because that was one of the most

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.780 
courses because that was one of the most
fun<00:02:31.650> things<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.010> could<00:02:32.130> ever<00:02:32.160> play<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
fun things you could ever play on the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.030 
fun things you could ever play on the
wii<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.180> think<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.230> alienation<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.740> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
wii I think the alienation of the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.880 
wii I think the alienation of the
hardcore<00:02:35.520> really<00:02:36.360> became<00:02:36.810> an<00:02:37.200> issue<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
hardcore really became an issue and that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.700 
hardcore really became an issue and that
people<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.490> don't<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:39.000> even<00:02:39.480> despite<00:02:40.080> what

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
people just don't know even despite what

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.530 
people just don't know even despite what
they're<00:02:40.920> saying<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.520> they're<00:02:42.000> really<00:02:42.180> going

they're saying if they're really going

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.390 
they're saying if they're really going
to<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.810> indulging<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> sense<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.890> hardcore

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
well but it really comes down to the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.450 
well but it really comes down to the
price<00:04:24.270> three<00:04:25.169> hundred<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.620> fifty<00:04:25.919> dollars<00:04:26.310> is

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
price three hundred and fifty dollars is

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.480 
price three hundred and fifty dollars is
much<00:04:27.270> more<00:04:27.419> expensive<00:04:27.690> than

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
much more expensive than

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.309 
much more expensive than
the<00:04:28.610> we<00:04:28.789> sold<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.630> that's<00:04:29.990> going<00:04:30.199> to

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
the we sold that and that's going to

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.629 
the we sold that and that's going to
make<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.650> case<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:30.949> people<00:04:31.400> might<00:04:31.520> be

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
make the case that people might be

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.760 
make the case that people might be
buying<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.060> as<00:04:32.180> their<00:04:32.419> one<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.900> only<00:04:32.990> system

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
buying it as their one and only system

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.589 
buying it as their one and only system
and<00:04:33.979> of<00:04:34.069> course<00:04:34.310> we<00:04:34.490> have<00:04:34.729> potential<00:04:35.210> systems

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
and of course we have potential systems

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.360 
and of course we have potential systems
from<00:04:35.750> Sony<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.169> Microsoft<00:04:36.259> that<00:04:37.069> may<00:04:37.310> be

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
from Sony and Microsoft that may be

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.850 
from Sony and Microsoft that may be
announced<00:04:37.970> next<00:04:38.030> year<00:04:38.569> I<00:04:38.720> think<00:04:39.319> Nintendo<00:04:39.710> has

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
announced next year I think Nintendo has

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.680 
announced next year I think Nintendo has
a<00:04:39.889> bout<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.400> four<00:04:40.759> month<00:04:41.030> window<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.630> they

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
a bout a four month window and they

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.939 
a bout a four month window and they
really<00:04:41.930> need<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.169> make<00:04:42.319> the<00:04:42.440> case<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.650> this

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
really need to make the case that this

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.950 
really need to make the case that this
is<00:04:43.130> an<00:04:43.250> essential<00:04:43.610> thing<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.539> have<00:04:44.750> in<00:04:44.930> the

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
is an essential thing to have in the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.379 
is an essential thing to have in the
home<00:04:45.259> and<00:04:45.530> if<00:04:45.889> they<00:04:46.009> can't<00:04:46.310> do<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.669> is<00:04:46.940> going

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
home and if they can't do that is going

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.689 
home and if they can't do that is going
to<00:04:47.449> be<00:04:47.509> a<00:04:47.539> pretty<00:04:47.930> rough<00:04:48.169> road<00:04:48.530> but<00:04:48.830> at<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
to be a pretty rough road but at the

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.430 
to be a pretty rough road but at the
very<00:04:49.729> least<00:04:49.940> we'll<00:04:50.840> have<00:04:50.900> something<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.319> talk

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
very least we'll have something to talk
