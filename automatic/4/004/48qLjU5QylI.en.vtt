00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
actually reviewing the other colors

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually reviewing the other colors
because<00:01:07.020> there's<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.590> I'm<00:01:07.830> purple<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.270> blue

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
because there's like I'm purple and blue

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.649 
because there's like I'm purple and blue
and<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.920> know<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.040> lots<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.610> vibrant<00:01:12.150> colors

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and you know just lots of vibrant colors

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.649 
and you know just lots of vibrant colors
that<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.729> liquid<00:01:15.119> eyeliner

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that you can do for the liquid eyeliner

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.960 
that you can do for the liquid eyeliner
but<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.170> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.710> black<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.580> that's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
but I want to just black because that's

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.749 
but I want to just black because that's
all<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.360> where<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.259> course<00:01:19.619> waterproof<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
all I where it's of course waterproof it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.440 
all I where it's of course waterproof it
gives<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.960> dark<00:01:22.680> intense<00:01:23.640> effect<00:01:24.119> or

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
gives up a very dark intense effect or

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.969 
gives up a very dark intense effect or
you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> use<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> lighter<00:01:25.979> hand<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.740> place<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you can use a lighter hand to place it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.560 
you can use a lighter hand to place it
on<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> won't<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.570> intense<00:01:31.079> i

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570

quickly<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.130> set<00:01:44.430> i<00:01:44.759> suppose<00:01:45.240> i<00:01:45.420> could<00:01:45.479> show

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
quickly it's set i suppose i could show

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.520 
quickly it's set i suppose i could show
you<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.409> hand<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:48.630> will<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.930> stuck<00:01:49.290> on

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you on my hand and it will be stuck on

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.399 
you on my hand and it will be stuck on
forever<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.310> ever<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:51.450> i<00:01:51.479> drew<00:01:51.869> line<00:01:52.140> right

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
forever and ever see i drew line right

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
forever and ever see i drew line right
there<00:01:52.619> see<00:01:53.340> how<00:01:53.399> dark<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.030> that's

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
there see how dark that is that's

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.319 
there see how dark that is that's
intensely<00:01:55.200> dark<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.369> thought<00:01:56.579> my<00:01:56.880> Milani

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
intensely dark and I thought my Milani

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.069 
intensely dark and I thought my Milani
liquefied<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:58.259> dark<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.369> mean<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.820> is

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
liquefied was dark and I mean this is

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.600 
liquefied was dark and I mean this is
this<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.259> comparable<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.280> maybe<00:02:02.460> even

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
this is comparable to it maybe even

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.480 
this is comparable to it maybe even
better<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.329> I've<00:02:03.630> actually<00:02:03.659> been

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
better because I've actually been

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.859 
better because I've actually been
finding<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.700> my<00:02:05.909> Milani<00:02:06.299> liquefied

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
finding that my Milani liquefied

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.169 
finding that my Milani liquefied
smudging<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.950> me<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.220> don't<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.580> why<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.879> is

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
smudging on me I don't know why it is

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.869 
smudging on me I don't know why it is

in<00:07:12.630> but<00:07:13.080> you<00:07:13.170> have<00:07:13.260> to<00:07:13.320> do<00:07:13.410> it<00:07:13.530> really<00:07:13.740> fast

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
in but you have to do it really fast

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.250 
in but you have to do it really fast
because<00:07:14.430> it<00:07:14.730> dries<00:07:15.090> it<00:07:15.740> sets<00:07:16.740> very<00:07:17.370> fast<00:07:18.260> so

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
because it dries it sets very fast so

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:32.110 
because it dries it sets very fast so
just<00:07:19.800> create<00:07:20.220> your<00:07:20.520> wing

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120
