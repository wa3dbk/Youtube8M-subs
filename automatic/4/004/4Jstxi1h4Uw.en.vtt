00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.020
 behind me is the old 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.180
 train station in three centuries in 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.800
 aguascalientes next to me is 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.290
 paulino martinez the shaman tonight 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.969
 today the investigation starts in this 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.309
 specific point we had never 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.710
 entered this old station but today 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.360
 it's the day to do this job of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.580
 Pauline field good night 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.070
 Alberto good night a loaded place 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.800
 no doubt with strong demonstrations 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.470
 forces presences since long ago that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.770
 we entered, I had the opportunity to see 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.410
 and to feel several people several 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.780
 people various situations bio 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.539
 plasmÃ¡ticas that are here 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.879
 still and that for some reason they continue 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.649
 linked to this place you told me 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.659
 a few moments ago that you arrived 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.510
 observe even people who looked like 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.870
 even revolutionaries if I have observed 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.269
 my backs in those top parts of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.989
 the windows as they walk and how they 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:01.199
 move and these shadows are some beings 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.179
 of light and some of low ace after the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.480
 tonight's cabalistic number would be 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.850
 7 because 7 because 7 is the car 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.460
 and this is a station from where they started 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.350
 the railroad cars you think if 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.360
 we enter paulino ahead we enter very 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 alright then let's go into the old 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.810
 train station in three centuries in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 aguascalientes this is the moment 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.870
 suitable to enter the point 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.510
 specific to our research is 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.830
 a very big place if we have to 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.570
 have all the gardens with the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.630
 fountains with all the patios that it has 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.620
 this place is immense but we already have 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.450
 the specific points to analyze 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.810
 how can you realize this 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.760
 currently it has already been used as a 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.220
 museum and has been remodeled what some 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.220
 out the old train station 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.420
 I feel a presence 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.990
 strong 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.100
 feeling a chill 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.100
 all over my body 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.240
 they are very old objects it even says 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.100
 good not to touch but they are objects 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.010
 extremely old collection 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.180
 obviously today they belong to what 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.360
 which is already a museum that recreates a little what 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.540
 that once was here or at least 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.600
 how was this place in antiquity 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.430
 distributed until now the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.470
 energies of the old train station 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.750
 they seemed to be outside our 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.030
 research team but we were 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.670
 very wrong then when analyzing the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.709
 material we could realize an 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.709
 strange shadow that happens just behind 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.010
 our team pay attention children of 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.010
 yourself 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.319
 there's something up there, something is up to me 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.550
 calling but nevertheless I feel more 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.069
 more heavy heavy of the environment 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.819
 be very careful 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.819
 hear 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.200
 like an animal jackson 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.200
 ah 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.340
 and beyond 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.340
 it was down here if there is one 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.150
 we will lead, 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.360
 I like it 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.379
 attracted 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.379
 for something 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.890
 careful why 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 it's the same 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.980
 it feels 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.380
 very strong 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.330
 It's a long corridor 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.670
 and 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.560
 a woman a girl crying from a 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.560
 sobbing like a line 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.170
 I hear clearly 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.170
 listen 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.760
 the nervousness was notorious being in 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.470
 a place where it was once full 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.480
 of life and of people who came to the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.180
 station with the illusion of changing its 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.760
 destination from this point we 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.010
 kept alert at all times and more 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.680
 even when we managed to listen 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.490
 constantly what appeared to be a 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.490
 little girl playing 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.350
 it's funny how a very good girl 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.880
 let's go to that side I feel there's 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.880
 someone apart 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.320
 this is strong this is very solid as 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.320
 so that it has moved that easy 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.440
 there is no one inside wind 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.009
 we are arriving as 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.009
 a kind of auditorium 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.520
 and something very strange 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.169
 I do not think they've had it, there's something 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.169
 flew over there but not 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.400
 listen out 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.710
 i 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.630
 save more of the genre 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:22.690
 it feels very cold is very strange 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.690
 bitter 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.850
 the mind but very strong not 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.970
 if they heard them Senate
