00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
2.5 inch drive earlier and I matched up
the<00:02:05.430> holes<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> they<00:02:06.210> seem<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> line<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.930> so

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the holes and they seem to line up so

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.190 
the holes and they seem to line up so
that<00:02:07.590> could<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.280> 2.5<00:02:08.879> inch<00:02:09.119> drive<00:02:09.750> mount

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
that could be your 2.5 inch drive mount

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.809 
that could be your 2.5 inch drive mount
and<00:02:12.900> let's<00:02:13.900> go<00:02:14.319> straight<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.490> right

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
and let's go straight in to the right

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.210 
and let's go straight in to the right
side<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> rather<00:02:16.810> light<00:02:17.410> case<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:18.069> it's

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
side this is a rather light case so it's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.190 
side this is a rather light case so it's
easy<00:02:18.340> for<00:02:18.670> me<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.940> flip<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.780> all<00:02:19.930> around

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
easy for me to just flip it all around

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.640 
easy for me to just flip it all around
the<00:02:20.380> place<00:02:20.620> all<00:02:21.580> right

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the place all right

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.100 
the place all right
slides<00:02:23.650> off<00:02:23.860> very<00:02:24.250> easily<00:02:24.569> on<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.690> right<00:02:25.840> side

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
slides off very easily on the right side

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.530 
slides off very easily on the right side
get<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> little<00:02:27.400> bit<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.640> space<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.910> route<00:02:28.360> some

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
get a little bit of space to route some

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.030 
get a little bit of space to route some
cables<00:02:28.900> through<00:02:29.050> obviously<00:02:29.260> not<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
cables through obviously not like the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.640 
cables through obviously not like the
super<00:02:30.340> thick<00:02:30.550> ones<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.390> hole<00:02:31.600> here<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.959> help

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
super thick ones and a hole here to help

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.390 
super thick ones and a hole here to help
with<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.860> cable<00:02:33.870> routing<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.220> we're<00:02:36.220> just

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
with the cable routing and we're just

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.440 
with the cable routing and we're just
going<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.610> go<00:02:36.989> straight<00:02:37.989> into<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.640> interior

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
going to go straight into the interior

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.400 
going to go straight into the interior
since<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.800> very<00:02:42.520> very<00:02:42.880> simple<00:02:43.870> right

and<00:04:52.440> undo<00:04:52.710> these<00:04:53.550> cables<00:04:56.630> let's<00:04:57.630> take<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.840> look

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
and undo these cables let's take a look

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.170 
and undo these cables let's take a look
at<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.470> power<00:04:58.740> chart<00:04:59.070> it<00:04:59.490> says<00:04:59.729> here<00:05:00.000> that

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
at the power chart it says here that

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.840

with<00:05:54.270> this<00:05:54.419> ruler<00:05:54.870> you<00:05:55.590> get<00:05:55.770> about<00:05:55.950> 6<00:05:56.310> inches

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
with this ruler you get about 6 inches

I'd<00:06:00.270> say<00:06:00.630> safely<00:06:01.110> about<00:06:01.500> 9<00:06:02.010> inches<00:06:02.250> that<00:06:02.850> wraps

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
I'd say safely about 9 inches that wraps
