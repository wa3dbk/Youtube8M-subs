00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530 

this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.079> quick<00:00:01.380> video<00:00:01.560> over<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.580> potassium

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
this is a quick video over the potassium

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.330 
this is a quick video over the potassium
channel<00:00:06.109> so<00:00:07.109> here's<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.560> channel<00:00:07.859> right<00:00:07.980> here

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
channel so here's the channel right here

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.039 
channel so here's the channel right here
and<00:00:10.040> we<00:00:11.040> will<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.219> some<00:00:11.700> sodium<00:00:12.450> ions<00:00:12.870> which

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
and we will have some sodium ions which

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.680 
and we will have some sodium ions which
are<00:00:13.230> those<00:00:13.950> are<00:00:14.400> potassium<00:00:15.210> ions<00:00:15.450> which<00:00:15.570> are

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
are those are potassium ions which are

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.859 
are those are potassium ions which are
those<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.109> sodium<00:00:17.539> which<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:18.690> these<00:00:18.810> little

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
those and sodium which are these little

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.650 
those and sodium which are these little
green<00:00:19.260> guys<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.279> seemed<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:21.300> green

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
green guys and it seemed like this green

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.660 
green guys and it seemed like this green
guy<00:00:21.810> could<00:00:21.990> easily<00:00:22.230> fit<00:00:22.890> right<00:00:23.310> through<00:00:23.550> this

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
guy could easily fit right through this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.630 
guy could easily fit right through this
channel<00:00:25.820> but<00:00:26.820> that's<00:00:27.000> not<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> case<00:00:27.449> now

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
channel but that's not the case now

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.740 
channel but that's not the case now
remember<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.670> these<00:00:29.939> are<00:00:30.179> charged

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
remember that these are charged

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.119 
remember that these are charged
particles<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:34.100> they<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.250> positively<00:00:35.760> charged

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
particles so they are positively charged

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.229 
particles so they are positively charged
and<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.340> are<00:00:38.430> they<00:00:38.550> floating<00:00:38.910> around<00:00:38.969> in

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and what are they floating around in

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.000 
and what are they floating around in
well<00:00:39.870> they're<00:00:40.050> actually<00:00:40.140> floating<00:00:40.680> around<00:00:40.739> in

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
well they're actually floating around in

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.389 
well they're actually floating around in
water<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.610> need<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> add<00:00:41.969> water<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.750> these

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
water so we need to add water to these

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.880 
water so we need to add water to these
so<00:00:44.399> we'll<00:00:44.550> add<00:00:44.640> some<00:00:44.789> water<00:00:45.590> now<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.620> have

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
so we'll add some water now we have

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
so we'll add some water now we have
water<00:00:47.100> added<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> them<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
water added to them and we're going to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
water added to them and we're going to
say<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.440> four<00:00:50.250> oxygen<00:00:50.910> atoms<00:00:51.800> four

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
say that you need four oxygen atoms four

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.240 
say that you need four oxygen atoms four
oxygen<00:00:53.309> atoms<00:00:54.590> for<00:00:55.590> every<00:00:55.620> ion<00:01:00.140> ion<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
oxygen atoms for every ion ion this is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.729 
oxygen atoms for every ion ion this is
an<00:01:02.399> oversimplification<00:01:03.589> but<00:01:04.589> we're<00:01:04.710> just

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
an oversimplification but we're just

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.179 
an oversimplification but we're just
doing<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> show<00:01:06.000> how<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.270> works<00:01:07.189> so

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
doing it just to show how it works so

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.570 
doing it just to show how it works so
now<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:09.630> sodium<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.619> needs<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.250> four

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
now this sodium it needs to have four

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
now this sodium it needs to have four
oxygens<00:01:12.060> attached<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.380> easily

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
oxygens attached to it and it can easily

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.870 
oxygens attached to it and it can easily
fit<00:01:13.860> through<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:15.680> what<00:01:16.680> happens<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> water

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
fit through here what happens is water

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.050 
fit through here what happens is water
actually<00:01:18.210> can't<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.840> through<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.259> tube

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
actually can't go through this tube

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.999 
actually can't go through this tube
water<00:01:21.060> cannot<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.720> through<00:01:24.500> can't<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.740> through

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
water cannot go through can't go through

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.140 
water cannot go through can't go through
and<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.880> reason<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:29.150> these

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and the reason is because of these

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.710 
and the reason is because of these
oxygen<00:01:30.990> atoms<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:32.270> they<00:01:33.270> prevent

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
oxygen atoms right here they prevent

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.679 
oxygen atoms right here they prevent
water<00:01:34.020> from<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.619> through<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.509> water

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
water from going through so if water

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.630 
water from going through so if water
came<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.200> go<00:01:37.259> through<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.979> what's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
came and go through what can what's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.550 
came and go through what can what's
actually<00:01:38.880> these<00:01:39.150> sodium<00:01:39.479> ions<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:40.320> these

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
actually these sodium ions are these

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.850 
actually these sodium ions are these
potassium<00:01:40.950> ions<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.649> had<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
potassium ions can so if we had a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280 
potassium ions can so if we had a
potassium<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.549> here<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.780> randomly

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
potassium right here that just randomly

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.160 
potassium right here that just randomly
bumped<00:01:46.649> into<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:48.479> had<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:48.810> water<00:01:48.840> on

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
bumped into it and it had some water on

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.660 
bumped into it and it had some water on
the<00:01:49.259> outside<00:01:52.100> right<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.329> some<00:01:55.670> water

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the outside right there so as some water

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.550 
the outside right there so as some water
molecules<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:59.399> has<00:01:59.790> four<00:02:00.360> oxygen<00:02:00.869> four

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
molecules it has four oxygen four

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.609 
molecules it has four oxygen four
oxygens<00:02:02.070> attached<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:03.409> interacting<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
oxygens attached are interacting with it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.670 
oxygens attached are interacting with it
that<00:02:04.829> will<00:02:04.979> balance<00:02:05.219> its<00:02:05.610> charge<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.560> that's

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that will balance its charge and that's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.460 
that will balance its charge and that's
good<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.670> could<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.239> say<00:02:09.840> maybe<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
good but could we have say maybe a

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.970 
good but could we have say maybe a
a<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:15.420> sodium<00:02:16.420> ion<00:02:16.570> do<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.050> let's<00:02:17.710> draw

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
a what a sodium ion do this let's draw

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.620 
a what a sodium ion do this let's draw
up<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.280> sodium<00:02:18.580> ion<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.670> sodium<00:02:21.670> ion<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:24.630> it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
up a sodium ion so sodium ion and it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.170 
up a sodium ion so sodium ion and it
cannot<00:02:26.080> interact<00:02:26.380> with<00:02:26.560> both<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.130> these<00:02:27.220> it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
cannot interact with both of these it

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.170 
cannot interact with both of these it
can<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.830> too<00:02:30.100> small<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.400> can't<00:02:30.700> interact<00:02:31.030> with

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
can it's too small I can't interact with

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.880 
can it's too small I can't interact with
that<00:02:31.300> one<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:31.720> one<00:02:32.110> at<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.410> same<00:02:32.590> time

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
that one and that one at the same time

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.880 
that one and that one at the same time
so<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.910> can<00:02:34.060> never<00:02:34.150> really<00:02:34.450> get<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.470> four

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
so it can never really get that the four

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.010 
so it can never really get that the four
oxygens<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.880> needs<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.330> balance<00:02:37.660> its

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
oxygens that it needs to balance its

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.880 
oxygens that it needs to balance its
positive<00:02:38.620> charge<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.420> that's<00:02:40.600> why<00:02:40.890> sodium

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
positive charge so that's why sodium

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.830 
positive charge so that's why sodium
can't<00:02:42.100> go<00:02:42.250> through<00:02:42.460> this<00:02:42.610> channel<00:02:43.060> only<00:02:43.420> a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
can't go through this channel only a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.060 
can't go through this channel only a
large<00:02:44.490> ion<00:02:45.490> like<00:02:45.970> potassium<00:02:46.390> can<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.770> we<00:02:47.920> had

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
large ion like potassium can so we had

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.830 
large ion like potassium can so we had
our<00:02:48.100> potassium<00:02:48.700> ion<00:02:48.910> going<00:02:49.360> through<00:02:49.630> and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
our potassium ion going through and

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.290 
our potassium ion going through and
started<00:02:50.440> right<00:02:50.530> here<00:02:50.910> now<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.060> going<00:02:52.209> to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
started right here now it's going to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.940 
started right here now it's going to
squeeze<00:02:52.600> through<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.050> go<00:02:53.560> right<00:02:53.709> here<00:02:53.860> and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
squeeze through and go right here and

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.820 
squeeze through and go right here and
it's<00:02:54.040> gonna<00:02:54.160> lose<00:02:54.310> all<00:02:54.520> its<00:02:54.730> water<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.830> at

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
it's gonna lose all its water and at

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.530 
it's gonna lose all its water and at
this<00:02:57.010> point<00:02:57.310> it's<00:02:57.880> just<00:02:58.060> going<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.240> keep<00:02:58.390> on

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
this point it's just going to keep on

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.570 
this point it's just going to keep on
going<00:02:58.720> through<00:02:59.020> so<00:02:59.650> this<00:03:00.190> will<00:03:00.370> be<00:03:00.459> right

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
going through so this will be right

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.430 
going through so this will be right
there<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:00.970> when<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.600> passed<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.080> first

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
there and when it's passed this first

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.890 
there and when it's passed this first
step<00:03:02.740> another<00:03:03.520> one<00:03:03.820> can<00:03:03.970> come<00:03:04.120> back<00:03:04.270> come

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
step another one can come back come

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.490 
step another one can come back come
behind<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.709> start<00:03:06.430> interacting<00:03:06.640> with<00:03:06.910> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
behind it and start interacting with it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:18.160 
behind it and start interacting with it
so<00:03:09.300> draw<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.360> red

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.430 

and<00:03:18.740> again<00:03:19.010> these<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:20.569> water<00:03:20.810> would<00:03:20.990> just<00:03:21.170> pop

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
and again these the water would just pop

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.600 
and again these the water would just pop
off<00:03:21.710> as<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.520> one<00:03:22.700> goes<00:03:22.850> down<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:24.280> as<00:03:25.280> that

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
off as this one goes down and as that

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.630 
off as this one goes down and as that
one<00:03:25.760> goes<00:03:25.910> down<00:03:26.090> again<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:27.170> now<00:03:27.459> what<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.550> would

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
one goes down again so now what it would

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:42.400 
one goes down again so now what it would
look<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:39.070> where<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:41.410> potassium

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
look like is this where this potassium

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.840 
look like is this where this potassium
ion<00:03:42.740> is<00:03:43.900> interacting<00:03:44.900> with<00:03:45.100> this<00:03:46.100> oxygen<00:03:46.370> this

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
ion is interacting with this oxygen this

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.260 
ion is interacting with this oxygen this
oxygen<00:03:47.300> this<00:03:48.170> one<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:49.069> one<00:03:49.130> where<00:03:50.060> this

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
oxygen this one and this one where this

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.260 
oxygen this one and this one where this
one's<00:03:50.540> interacting<00:03:51.530> with<00:03:51.650> this<00:03:52.070> oxygen<00:03:53.000> atom

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
one's interacting with this oxygen atom

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.130 
one's interacting with this oxygen atom
this<00:03:53.570> one<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:54.590> our<00:03:54.920> potassium<00:03:55.880> ion<00:03:56.480> still<00:03:56.900> has

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
this one so our potassium ion still has

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.729 
this one so our potassium ion still has
four<00:03:57.620> oxygens<00:03:58.430> interacting<00:03:59.060> with<00:03:59.209> it<00:03:59.680> now<00:04:00.680> the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
four oxygens interacting with it now the

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.380 
four oxygens interacting with it now the
reason<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.250> goes<00:04:01.370> down<00:04:01.610> is<00:04:01.790> just<00:04:01.820> because<00:04:02.209> of

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
reason it goes down is just because of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.660 
reason it goes down is just because of
concentration<00:04:02.690> gradients<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.560> just<00:04:04.190> randomly

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
concentration gradients it just randomly

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.979 
concentration gradients it just randomly
bumps<00:04:05.030> into<00:04:05.150> this<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:07.130> let's<00:04:07.400> say<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.610> had

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
bumps into this so let's say you had

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:15.250 
bumps into this so let's say you had
some<00:04:10.959> whoops<00:04:13.269> some<00:04:14.269> fasting<00:04:14.660> Mayans<00:04:14.930> floating

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
some whoops some fasting Mayans floating

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.539 
some whoops some fasting Mayans floating
around<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.650> they<00:04:15.739> have<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.980> water<00:04:16.190> around<00:04:16.400> it

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
around and they have the water around it

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.440 
around and they have the water around it
but<00:04:16.640> I'm<00:04:16.730> not<00:04:16.820> going<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.060> draw<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.209> water

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
but I'm not going to draw the water

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.270 
but I'm not going to draw the water
anymore<00:04:18.579> let's<00:04:19.579> say<00:04:20.650> there's<00:04:21.650> also<00:04:21.859> some<00:04:22.160> in

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
anymore let's say there's also some in

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.120 
anymore let's say there's also some in
here<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:26.150> comes<00:04:26.450> down<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.720> how<00:04:27.650> often<00:04:27.860> they're

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
here it comes down to how often they're

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.670 
here it comes down to how often they're
going<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.490> hit<00:04:28.669> each<00:04:28.850> head<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.510> if<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:30.530> have

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
going to hit each head it if you have

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.380 
going to hit each head it if you have
one<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.130> like<00:04:31.580> if<00:04:31.700> there's<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.910> lot<00:04:32.120> over<00:04:32.330> here

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
one that like if there's a lot over here

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.659 
one that like if there's a lot over here
then<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.140> probability<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.680> this<00:04:33.860> being<00:04:34.100> hit

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
then the probability of this being hit

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.719 
then the probability of this being hit
by<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.880> potassium<00:04:35.630> ion<00:04:36.080> is<00:04:36.620> highly<00:04:37.220> likely<00:04:37.340> and

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
by a potassium ion is highly likely and

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.940 
by a potassium ion is highly likely and
it<00:04:38.120> will<00:04:38.210> follow<00:04:38.419> down<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.840> trail<00:04:39.110> or<00:04:39.860> if

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
it will follow down the trail or if

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.230 
it will follow down the trail or if
there's<00:04:40.100> aren't<00:04:40.310> too<00:04:40.430> where<00:04:40.790> if<00:04:40.940> there<00:04:41.120> aren't

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
there's aren't too where if there aren't

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.020 
there's aren't too where if there aren't
too<00:04:41.419> many<00:04:41.450> over<00:04:41.810> here<00:04:42.640> they'll<00:04:43.640> just<00:04:43.820> come

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
too many over here they'll just come

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.030 
too many over here they'll just come
over<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.330> diffuse<00:04:44.930> away<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.680> chances<00:04:46.010> of

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
over and diffuse away and the chances of

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.770 
over and diffuse away and the chances of
them<00:04:46.280> coming<00:04:46.490> back<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:46.880> hitting<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.300> is<00:04:47.419> low

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
them coming back and hitting it is low

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.870 
them coming back and hitting it is low
so<00:04:48.110> that's<00:04:48.260> a<00:04:48.380> concentration<00:04:49.010> gradient<00:04:49.160> basis

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
so that's a concentration gradient basis

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.670 
so that's a concentration gradient basis
but<00:04:50.419> I<00:04:50.479> just<00:04:50.750> I'm<00:04:50.900> not<00:04:50.930> going<00:04:51.290> to<00:04:51.350> go<00:04:51.440> too<00:04:51.500> much

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
but I just I'm not going to go too much

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.440 
but I just I'm not going to go too much
into<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.130> actual<00:04:52.490> concentration<00:04:52.880> gradient

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
into the actual concentration gradient

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.480 
into the actual concentration gradient
basis<00:04:53.810> I'm<00:04:53.930> just<00:04:54.080> going<00:04:54.260> in<00:04:54.380> why<00:04:54.919> does<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.310> work

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
basis I'm just going in why does it work

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.060 
basis I'm just going in why does it work
for<00:04:55.729> potassium<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:56.930> not<00:04:57.080> sodium<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.740> it's

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
for potassium and not sodium and it's

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.640 
for potassium and not sodium and it's
all<00:04:58.310> about<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:59.180> water<00:04:59.510> that<00:05:00.140> is<00:05:00.290> actually

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
all about the water that is actually

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.969 
all about the water that is actually
around<00:05:00.860> each<00:05:01.130> eye<00:05:01.370> eye<00:05:01.789> on<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.800> just<00:05:03.800> want<00:05:03.919> to

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
around each eye eye on I just want to

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:04.420 
around each eye eye on I just want to
make<00:05:04.039> that<00:05:04.190> clear

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
make that clear

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.779 
make that clear
even<00:05:05.120> though<00:05:05.410> sodium<00:05:06.410> is<00:05:06.560> smaller<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.250> it

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
even though sodium is smaller and it

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:08.980 
even though sodium is smaller and it
would<00:05:07.880> seem<00:05:08.150> like<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.419> could<00:05:08.539> fit<00:05:08.750> right<00:05:08.960> here

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
would seem like it could fit right here

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.650 
would seem like it could fit right here
so<00:05:09.650> if<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:09.830> were<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.250> draw<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.700> I<00:05:13.479> think<00:05:14.479> that's

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
so if I were to draw it I think that's

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.010 
so if I were to draw it I think that's
nuts<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:16.460> if<00:05:16.520> I<00:05:16.640> still<00:05:16.850> draw<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.690> can't

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
nuts so if I still draw it it can't

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.050 
nuts so if I still draw it it can't
interact<00:05:18.289> with<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.010> with<00:05:19.610> all<00:05:19.789> the<00:05:19.910> water

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
interact with the and with all the water

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.570 
interact with the and with all the water
or<00:05:20.330> with<00:05:20.690> any<00:05:21.410> of<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.650> oxygens<00:05:22.100> attached<00:05:22.370> to

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
or with any of the oxygens attached to

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.880 
or with any of the oxygens attached to
the<00:05:22.700> wall<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:23.690> can<00:05:23.870> only<00:05:23.930> interact<00:05:24.260> with<00:05:24.410> maybe

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
the wall it can only interact with maybe

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.490 
the wall it can only interact with maybe
one<00:05:25.370> at<00:05:25.789> the<00:05:26.240> most<00:05:26.419> and<00:05:26.599> that's<00:05:27.050> not<00:05:27.200> enough<00:05:27.440> to

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
one at the most and that's not enough to

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.200 
one at the most and that's not enough to
the<00:05:28.390> counter<00:05:29.390> it's<00:05:29.539> positive<00:05:30.110> charge

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
the counter it's positive charge

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.110 
the counter it's positive charge
remember<00:05:31.630> oxygen<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.200> electronegative<00:05:33.120> so

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
remember oxygen is electronegative so

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.710 
remember oxygen is electronegative so
these<00:05:34.240> are<00:05:34.390> negative<00:05:36.270> but<00:05:37.270> they<00:05:37.360> have<00:05:37.450> to<00:05:37.570> be

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
these are negative but they have to be

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.230 
these are negative but they have to be
close<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:38.080> each<00:05:38.140> other<00:05:38.460> for<00:05:39.460> them<00:05:39.640> to<00:05:39.880> cancel

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
close to each other for them to cancel

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.910 
close to each other for them to cancel
each<00:05:40.330> other's<00:05:40.600> charges<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:41.650> these<00:05:41.770> are

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
each other's charges and these are

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.330 
each other's charges and these are
slightly<00:05:42.400> negative<00:05:43.980> can't<00:05:44.980> remember<00:05:45.190> the

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
slightly negative can't remember the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.650 
slightly negative can't remember the
symbol<00:05:45.550> slightly<00:05:46.060> negative<00:05:46.450> they're<00:05:46.570> not

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
symbol slightly negative they're not

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.050

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
actually fully negative they're slightly

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.110 
actually fully negative they're slightly

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
negative where's this it's a positive

charge<00:05:52.600> this<00:05:53.020> is<00:05:53.170> a<00:05:53.200> positive<00:05:53.440> charge<00:05:53.770> and

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
charge this is a positive charge and

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.560 
charge this is a positive charge and
this<00:05:54.100> is<00:05:54.220> a<00:05:54.310> positive<00:05:54.670> that's<00:05:55.120> why<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.360> need

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
this is a positive that's why you need

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.860 
this is a positive that's why you need
four<00:05:55.930> oxygens<00:05:56.830> for<00:05:57.460> our<00:05:57.610> simplified<00:05:58.060> case<00:05:58.300> to

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
four oxygens for our simplified case to

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.280 
four oxygens for our simplified case to
count<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.440> balance<00:05:59.950> out<00:06:00.100> this<00:06:00.250> fully<00:06:00.910> charge

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
count to balance out this fully charge

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.800 
count to balance out this fully charge
positive<00:06:02.290> ion<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:04.210> let's<00:06:04.390> pretend<00:06:04.570> let's

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
positive ion and let's pretend let's

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.420 
positive ion and let's pretend let's
first<00:06:05.200> say<00:06:05.320> some<00:06:05.680> reason<00:06:05.890> about<00:06:06.070> we<00:06:06.340> could

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
first say some reason about we could

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.990 
first say some reason about we could
even<00:06:06.640> get<00:06:06.790> water<00:06:07.000> into<00:06:07.240> this<00:06:08.700> we<00:06:09.700> still

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
even get water into this we still

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.490 
even get water into this we still
probably<00:06:10.300> could<00:06:10.600> not<00:06:10.720> get<00:06:10.990> four<00:06:11.590> oxygen

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
probably could not get four oxygen

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.530 
probably could not get four oxygen
oxygen<00:06:14.500> atoms<00:06:15.220> touching<00:06:15.610> this<00:06:15.880> so<00:06:16.150> let's<00:06:16.360> just

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
oxygen atoms touching this so let's just

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.510 
oxygen atoms touching this so let's just
try<00:06:16.870> it<00:06:16.900> see<00:06:17.260> what<00:06:17.380> happens<00:06:17.410> so<00:06:18.930> we'll<00:06:19.930> draw

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
try it see what happens so we'll draw

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.310 
try it see what happens so we'll draw
maybe<00:06:21.520> one<00:06:21.730> right<00:06:21.850> there<00:06:22.060> can't<00:06:22.900> fit<00:06:23.140> there

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
maybe one right there can't fit there

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.090 
maybe one right there can't fit there
that's<00:06:23.500> too<00:06:23.680> tight<00:06:23.920> and<00:06:24.390> maybe<00:06:25.830> right<00:06:26.830> there

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
that's too tight and maybe right there

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.410 
that's too tight and maybe right there
but<00:06:27.310> the<00:06:27.370> action<00:06:27.670> does<00:06:27.820> want<00:06:28.000> to<00:06:28.030> be<00:06:28.090> next<00:06:28.270> to

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
but the action does want to be next to

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.770 
but the action does want to be next to
those<00:06:28.600> so<00:06:28.870> at<00:06:29.770> our<00:06:29.830> most<00:06:30.700> we<00:06:30.940> maybe<00:06:31.150> get<00:06:31.360> three

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
those so at our most we maybe get three

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.530 
those so at our most we maybe get three
but<00:06:32.140> it<00:06:32.260> has<00:06:32.440> to<00:06:32.620> be<00:06:32.740> it<00:06:33.310> has<00:06:33.340> to<00:06:33.520> have<00:06:33.700> four<00:06:34.030> to

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
but it has to be it has to have four to

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.250 
but it has to be it has to have four to
be<00:06:34.660> fully<00:06:35.040> to<00:06:36.040> be<00:06:36.490> neutralized<00:06:37.060> or<00:06:37.870> else<00:06:37.990> the

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
be fully to be neutralized or else the

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.230 
be fully to be neutralized or else the
positive<00:06:38.650> charge<00:06:38.830> is<00:06:38.950> just<00:06:39.100> again<00:06:39.460> too<00:06:39.910> strong

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
positive charge is just again too strong

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.870 
positive charge is just again too strong
and<00:06:40.540> it<00:06:41.170> doesn't<00:06:41.590> want<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:41.860> it<00:06:42.430> doesn't<00:06:42.670> want

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
and it doesn't want to it doesn't want

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.210 
and it doesn't want to it doesn't want
to<00:06:42.940> be<00:06:43.060> just<00:06:43.330> positive<00:06:43.720> it<00:06:43.780> was<00:06:43.900> to<00:06:44.020> be

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
to be just positive it was to be

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.030 
to be just positive it was to be
neutralized<00:06:45.220> with<00:06:46.120> a<00:06:46.390> water<00:06:47.230> layer<00:06:47.530> around<00:06:47.740> it

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
neutralized with a water layer around it

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.950 
neutralized with a water layer around it
that<00:06:48.250> helps<00:06:49.030> take<00:06:49.390> away<00:06:49.630> some<00:06:49.840> of<00:06:49.870> that

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
that helps take away some of that

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.530 
that helps take away some of that
positive<00:06:50.470> charge<00:06:50.680> and<00:06:51.060> that's<00:06:52.060> more<00:06:52.330> of<00:06:52.420> just

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
positive charge and that's more of just

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.750 
positive charge and that's more of just
understanding<00:06:53.230> how<00:06:53.530> ions<00:06:54.130> separated<00:06:54.400> in

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
understanding how ions separated in

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.860 
understanding how ions separated in
water<00:06:55.800> so<00:06:57.300> so<00:06:58.300> that's<00:06:59.080> why<00:06:59.820> sodium<00:07:00.820> can't<00:07:01.750> go

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
water so so that's why sodium can't go

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.170 
water so so that's why sodium can't go
through<00:07:02.110> but<00:07:02.530> a<00:07:02.560> bigger<00:07:02.860> ion<00:07:03.370> like<00:07:03.520> potassium

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
through but a bigger ion like potassium

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.220 
through but a bigger ion like potassium
can<00:07:04.480> and<00:07:05.400> remember<00:07:06.400> potassium<00:07:07.090> fits<00:07:07.300> very

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.230 
can and remember potassium fits very

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:14.410 
can and remember potassium fits very
well<00:07:08.490> in<00:07:09.490> this

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.050 

very<00:07:15.140> well<00:07:15.410> where<00:07:15.830> it<00:07:15.890> interacts<00:07:16.310> with<00:07:16.820> all

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
very well where it interacts with all

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.530 
very well where it interacts with all
the<00:07:17.510> oxygens<00:07:17.990> and<00:07:18.520> just<00:07:19.520> to<00:07:19.580> be<00:07:19.700> clear<00:07:19.730> you<00:07:20.390> can

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.540 
the oxygens and just to be clear you can

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.080 
the oxygens and just to be clear you can
only<00:07:20.690> have<00:07:20.960> two<00:07:21.250> potassium<00:07:22.250> ions<00:07:22.580> in<00:07:22.760> this

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090 
only have two potassium ions in this

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.120 
only have two potassium ions in this
channel<00:07:23.360> at<00:07:23.570> a<00:07:23.660> time<00:07:23.870> you<00:07:24.500> can't<00:07:24.740> have<00:07:24.920> one

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.130 
channel at a time you can't have one

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.010 
channel at a time you can't have one
right<00:07:25.280> there<00:07:25.520> because<00:07:26.330> now<00:07:26.480> you<00:07:26.840> no<00:07:26.990> longer

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
right there because now you no longer

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.170 
right there because now you no longer
have<00:07:27.500> four<00:07:28.750> oxygen<00:07:29.750> atoms<00:07:29.870> for<00:07:30.230> every<00:07:30.290> I<00:07:30.530> on

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
have four oxygen atoms for every I on

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.300 
have four oxygen atoms for every I on
these<00:07:32.180> this<00:07:32.690> one<00:07:32.930> and<00:07:33.170> this<00:07:33.830> one<00:07:34.070> are<00:07:34.100> now

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.310 
these this one and this one are now

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.700 
these this one and this one are now
sharing<00:07:34.670> so<00:07:35.360> and<00:07:35.920> that<00:07:36.920> just<00:07:37.130> doesn't<00:07:37.430> happen

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
sharing so and that just doesn't happen

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.000 
sharing so and that just doesn't happen
so<00:07:39.710> that<00:07:39.890> is<00:07:40.130> a<00:07:40.400> potassium<00:07:41.030> channel<00:07:41.500> and<00:07:42.500> it's

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.010 
so that is a potassium channel and it's

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.190 
so that is a potassium channel and it's
basic<00:07:43.550> the<00:07:43.820> only<00:07:44.060> thing<00:07:44.240> I<00:07:44.330> would<00:07:44.450> add<00:07:44.660> is<00:07:44.870> that

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:45.200 
basic the only thing I would add is that

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.720 
basic the only thing I would add is that
there<00:07:45.530> are<00:07:46.210> flight<00:07:47.210> negative<00:07:47.690> charges<00:07:48.020> on<00:07:48.730> the

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:49.730 
there are flight negative charges on the

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.590 
there are flight negative charges on the
edges<00:07:51.160> just<00:07:52.160> slightly<00:07:52.460> neat<00:07:52.760> like<00:07:52.970> the<00:07:53.300> edges

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:53.600 
edges just slightly neat like the edges

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.150 
edges just slightly neat like the edges
are<00:07:53.720> usually<00:07:54.020> slightly<00:07:54.260> negatively<00:07:54.830> charged

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.160 
are usually slightly negatively charged

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.680 
are usually slightly negatively charged
and<00:07:55.840> that's<00:07:56.840> to<00:07:57.050> try<00:07:57.290> to<00:07:57.350> get<00:07:57.530> these<00:07:58.190> potassium

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:58.690 
and that's to try to get these potassium

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.930 
and that's to try to get these potassium
ions<00:07:59.690> close<00:08:00.170> to<00:08:00.410> it<00:08:00.530> so<00:08:01.040> that<00:08:01.220> the<00:08:01.340> chances<00:08:01.820> of

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:01.940 
ions close to it so that the chances of

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.030 
ions close to it so that the chances of
them<00:08:02.060> actually<00:08:02.420> hitting<00:08:02.830> increases<00:08:03.830> a<00:08:03.860> lot

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.040 
them actually hitting increases a lot

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.380 
them actually hitting increases a lot
more<00:08:04.220> so<00:08:04.370> if<00:08:04.430> you<00:08:04.580> have<00:08:04.730> a<00:08:04.760> little<00:08:05.090> negative

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:05.390 
more so if you have a little negative

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.120 
more so if you have a little negative
charge<00:08:05.600> the<00:08:06.020> passing<00:08:06.410> must<00:08:06.560> be<00:08:06.710> next<00:08:07.010> that

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.130 
charge the passing must be next that

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.480 
charge the passing must be next that
negative<00:08:07.550> charge<00:08:07.580> so<00:08:09.070> that's<00:08:10.070> something

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:10.490 
negative charge so that's something

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.130 
negative charge so that's something
that's<00:08:10.670> kind<00:08:10.790> of<00:08:10.910> neat<00:08:11.060> and<00:08:11.150> that's<00:08:11.930> pretty

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:12.140 
that's kind of neat and that's pretty

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.070 
that's kind of neat and that's pretty
much<00:08:12.260> all<00:08:12.560> for<00:08:12.590> this<00:08:12.890> video
