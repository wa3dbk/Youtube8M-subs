Decay eyeshadow primer potion and this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.180 
Decay eyeshadow primer potion and this
is<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.030> anti-aging<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:34.079> even<00:00:34.920> though<00:00:35.040> I'm

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
is the anti-aging one even though I'm

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.119

I thought that that was actually a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
I thought that that was actually a
pretty<00:00:39.480> good<00:00:39.660> price<00:00:39.899> considering<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.070> is

pretty good price considering what it is

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.240 
pretty good price considering what it is
and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.300> don't<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:43.050> any<00:00:43.559> good<00:00:44.100> i

the<00:02:28.590> same<00:02:28.770> product<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.460> that's<00:02:30.060> kind<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.420> why

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
the same product so that's kind of why

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.060 
the same product so that's kind of why
I'm<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:30.930> excited<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.470> try<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.740> one<00:02:31.890> out

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.100 
I'm really excited to try this one out
so<00:02:32.520> next<00:02:33.150> from<00:02:33.300> Nicks<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.690> ended<00:02:33.870> up<00:02:33.930> getting

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
so next from Nicks I ended up getting

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.810 
so next from Nicks I ended up getting
one<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.410> their<00:02:34.590> matte<00:02:34.800> lipsticks<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.580> think

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
one of their matte lipsticks and I think

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.150 
one of their matte lipsticks and I think
that<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> packaging<00:02:36.570> on<00:02:36.960> these<00:02:37.530> lipsticks<00:02:37.890> is

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
that the packaging on these lipsticks is

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.310 
that the packaging on these lipsticks is
so<00:02:38.460> damn<00:02:38.730> cute<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.540> got<00:02:39.690> mine<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> color

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
so damn cute and I got mine in the color

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.340 
so damn cute and I got mine in the color
pale<00:02:40.680> pink<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:41.460> wearing<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.910> today<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.810> I

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
pale pink and I'm wearing it today and I

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.540 
pale pink and I'm wearing it today and I
don't<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:43.740> know<00:02:43.920> how<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.100> feel<00:02:44.280> about<00:02:44.340> it

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
don't really know how I feel about it

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.340 
don't really know how I feel about it
like<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.970> definitely<00:02:45.360> like<00:02:45.510> bright<00:02:45.900> lipsticks

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
like I definitely like bright lipsticks

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.380 
like I definitely like bright lipsticks
but<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.590> don't<00:02:46.800> really<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.070> Barbado<00:02:48.000> pink

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
but I don't really like Barbado pink

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.110 
but I don't really like Barbado pink
lipsticks<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.710> kind<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.130> undecided<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:50.940> it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
lipsticks so I'm kind of undecided on it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.330 
lipsticks so I'm kind of undecided on it
right<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.960> will<00:02:52.230> say<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.770> sometimes<00:02:53.010> when

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
right now I will say that sometimes when

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.040 
right now I will say that sometimes when
I'm<00:02:53.370> applying<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.480> lipstick<00:02:54.870> mic

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
I'm applying this the lipstick mic

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.330 
I'm applying this the lipstick mic
starts<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.470> go<00:02:55.590> down<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.800> guess<00:02:56.130> because<00:02:56.250> a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
starts to go down I guess because a

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.220

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
bio silk silk therapy I think that this

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.699 
bio silk silk therapy I think that this
is<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.209> some<00:04:06.450> sort<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.840> serum<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.560> put

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
is just some sort of serum that you put

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.140 
is just some sort of serum that you put
on<00:04:07.800> your<00:04:07.980> hair<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.489> says<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:08.970> can

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
on your hair and it says that you can

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.530 
on your hair and it says that you can
put<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.420> on<00:04:09.510> wet<00:04:10.200> or<00:04:10.470> dry<00:04:10.650> hair<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.250> think

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
put it on wet or dry hair and I think

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.850 
put it on wet or dry hair and I think
it's<00:04:11.719> just<00:04:11.900> supposed<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.290> make<00:04:12.439> your<00:04:12.650> hair

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860
