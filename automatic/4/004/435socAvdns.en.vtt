 dual certification if the student ends 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.720
 here in the design course and there 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.610
 then it passes a selection of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.579
 portfolios our portfolios are 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.310

 strategic 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.100
 But why do we want to train 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.840

 if for example a company 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.490
 if an unprepared student to work 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.319
