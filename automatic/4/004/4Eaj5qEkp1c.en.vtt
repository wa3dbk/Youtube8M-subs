but in primary portrait tablet mode I

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.540 
but in primary portrait tablet mode I
believe<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.690> very<00:00:36.840> annoying<00:00:37.559> here's

what<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> mean<00:00:39.649> here<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> unit<00:00:41.399> in

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you sweat as you can see how your hand

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.330 
you sweat as you can see how your hand

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
tablet mode now this issue can be

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.210 
tablet mode now this issue can be
mitigated<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.360> couple<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> ways<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:23.040> first

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
mitigated a couple of ways the first

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550 
mitigated a couple of ways the first
workaround<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.030> simply<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.869> use<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.259> unit

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
workaround is simply not to use the unit

not a big deal secondly you could use

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.990 

but<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.900> problem<00:02:36.380> with<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.920> then<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.550> it

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
but the problem with that then is it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.470 
but the problem with that then is it
leads<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.690> second<00:02:39.110> problem<00:02:40.240> which<00:02:41.240> are

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
leads to the second problem which are

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.820 
leads to the second problem which are
the<00:02:41.960> display<00:02:42.950> viewing<00:02:43.340> angles<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.830> my

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
the display viewing angles and my

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.460 
the display viewing angles and my

quality in part 2 of the review the tour
I<00:04:55.300> had<00:04:57.430> shown<00:05:00.190> these<00:05:01.190> felt<00:05:02.180> pads<00:05:02.509> that<00:05:02.780> I've

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
I had shown these felt pads that I've

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.719 
I had shown these felt pads that I've
put<00:05:03.699> at<00:05:04.699> the<00:05:04.729> back<00:05:05.060> corners<00:05:05.600> of<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:05.960> device

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729

put at the back corners of the device
without<00:05:07.729> these<00:05:08.060> pads<00:05:09.160> just<00:05:10.160> about<00:05:10.310> any

cause that annoying shifting of the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.719 
cause that annoying shifting of the
screen<00:05:19.270> so<00:05:20.270> basically<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.870> screen<00:05:21.169> would<00:05:21.380> pop

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
screen so basically the screen would pop

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.840 
screen so basically the screen would pop
down<00:05:22.729> as<00:05:23.120> you<00:05:23.270> can<00:05:23.419> see<00:05:23.660> like<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:25.220> pad<00:05:25.460> how<00:05:25.789> the

down as you can see like the pad how the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.390 
down as you can see like the pad how the
pad<00:05:26.120> prevents<00:05:26.539> the<00:05:27.260> screen<00:05:27.590> from<00:05:27.830> flexing

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
pad prevents the screen from flexing

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.189 
pad prevents the screen from flexing
down<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.620> that<00:05:30.620> happened<00:05:31.340> on<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.850> other<00:05:32.720> side

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
down and that happened on the other side

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.850 
down and that happened on the other side
as<00:05:33.500> well<00:05:33.710> and<00:05:34.690> those<00:05:35.690> pads<00:05:36.080> pretty<00:05:36.650> much

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
as well and those pads pretty much

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.730 
as well and those pads pretty much
eliminate<00:05:37.430> that<00:05:37.699> problem<00:05:38.110> um<00:05:41.410> however<00:05:42.410> my

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
eliminate that problem um however my

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.969 
eliminate that problem um however my

screen<00:05:58.789> I<00:05:59.120> think<00:05:59.330> you<00:05:59.449> can<00:05:59.630> see<00:05:59.960> that<00:06:00.320> pretty

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
screen I think you can see that pretty

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.810 
screen I think you can see that pretty
clearly<00:06:01.940> how<00:06:02.380> not<00:06:03.380> a<00:06:03.409> lot<00:06:03.650> of<00:06:03.680> pressure<00:06:04.099> on<00:06:04.520> the

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
clearly how not a lot of pressure on the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.629 
clearly how not a lot of pressure on the
edge<00:06:04.940> will<00:06:05.150> cause<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.599> screen<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:06.639> deflects

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
edge will cause the screen to deflects

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.460 
edge will cause the screen to deflects
laterally<00:06:09.669> well<00:06:10.669> that's<00:06:10.880> not<00:06:11.120> really<00:06:11.470> an

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
laterally well that's not really an

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.370 
laterally well that's not really an
annoying<00:06:13.159> problem<00:06:13.760> when<00:06:14.150> you're<00:06:14.360> holding<00:06:15.260> the

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
annoying problem when you're holding the

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:23.260 
annoying problem when you're holding the
tablet<00:06:16.240> like<00:06:17.240> on<00:06:17.419> the<00:06:17.510> desk

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.870 

it's<00:06:23.870> still<00:06:24.200> pretty<00:06:24.830> comfortable<00:06:25.460> to<00:06:25.700> write

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
it's still pretty comfortable to write

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:41.180 
it's still pretty comfortable to write
with<00:06:28.840> even<00:06:29.840> holding<00:06:30.080> it<00:06:30.230> up<00:06:30.350> like<00:06:30.770> this

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:48.740 

so<00:06:42.420> um<00:06:44.670> hopefully<00:06:45.670> HP<00:06:46.360> can<00:06:46.630> get<00:06:46.810> at<00:06:47.320> least<00:06:47.350> the

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
so um hopefully HP can get at least the

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.360 
so um hopefully HP can get at least the

this<00:06:54.700> a<00:06:54.760> little<00:06:55.030> bit<00:06:55.300> better<00:06:55.560> since<00:06:56.560> the<00:06:56.920> TX

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
this a little bit better since the TX

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.080 
this a little bit better since the TX
2100<00:06:59.710> that<00:07:00.010> my<00:07:00.160> sister-in-law<00:07:00.610> had<00:07:00.820> like<00:07:01.060> I

said didn't seem to have a problem so

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.090 
said didn't seem to have a problem so
this<00:07:04.390> is<00:07:04.540> an<00:07:04.630> early<00:07:04.810> production<00:07:05.530> unit<00:07:06.010> I

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
this is an early production unit I

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.670 
this is an early production unit I
ordered<00:07:06.520> it<00:07:06.610> on<00:07:06.730> November<00:07:07.390> 29<00:07:07.810> just<00:07:08.230> as<00:07:08.380> these

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680

these<00:07:18.130> are<00:07:18.190> my<00:07:18.400> primary<00:07:18.940> gripes<00:07:19.480> with<00:07:19.780> the

these are my primary gripes with the

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.490 
these are my primary gripes with the
unit<00:07:21.120> these<00:07:22.120> aren't<00:07:22.360> showstoppers<00:07:23.110> for<00:07:23.320> me

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
unit these aren't showstoppers for me

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.530 
unit these aren't showstoppers for me
but<00:07:23.770> without<00:07:24.100> these<00:07:24.340> flaws<00:07:24.640> i<00:07:24.850> think<00:07:25.060> the<00:07:25.180> tix

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.540 
but without these flaws i think the tix
