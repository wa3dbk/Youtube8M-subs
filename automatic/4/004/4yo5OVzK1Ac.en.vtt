00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
tasty here and today I'm going to do a

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.280 
tasty here and today I'm going to do a
full<00:00:10.740> unboxing<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.639> BM<00:00:12.030> 700<00:00:12.750> microphone

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
full unboxing of the BM 700 microphone

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.169 
full unboxing of the BM 700 microphone
so<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.070> almost<00:00:14.219> like<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> real<00:00:14.730> unboxing

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
so this is almost like a real unboxing

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.609 
so this is almost like a real unboxing
since<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.599> already<00:00:15.780> unboxed<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.470> just

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
since I have already unboxed and just

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.109 
since I have already unboxed and just
let<00:00:16.710> me<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:16.800> put<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> contents<00:00:17.670> back<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
let me just put the contents back in the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.359 
let me just put the contents back in the
box<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.109> terms<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> box<00:00:19.710> itself<00:00:20.070> it's

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
box so in terms of the box itself it's

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.800 
box so in terms of the box itself it's
not<00:00:20.430> really<00:00:20.789> exciting<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.390> comes<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
not really exciting just comes in a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.439 
not really exciting just comes in a
plain<00:00:22.109> brown<00:00:22.380> box<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:23.130> no<00:00:23.359> images<00:00:24.359> or

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
plain brown box with no images or

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.269 
plain brown box with no images or
information<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.050> sides<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.099> I'll<00:00:26.160> go

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
information on the sides but I'll go

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.650 
information on the sides but I'll go
ahead<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.580> start<00:00:26.730> with<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> unboxing<00:00:27.090> anyway

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
ahead and start with the unboxing anyway

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.070 
ahead and start with the unboxing anyway
so<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> very<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:29.070> thing<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.369> get<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.480> XLR

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so the very first thing you get is a XLR

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.250 
so the very first thing you get is a XLR

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
of this microphone it does sound a bit

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.310 
of this microphone it does sound a bit
misleading<00:00:35.670> MacLean<00:00:36.239> says<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.200> a

condenser microphone and usually
condenser<00:00:39.899> microphones<00:00:40.320> require<00:00:40.410> phantom

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
condenser microphones require phantom

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.010 
condenser microphones require phantom

power base requires no phantom power

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.900 
power base requires no phantom power
whatsoever<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.800> simply<00:00:44.129> plug<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
whatsoever you just simply plug it the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.220 
whatsoever you just simply plug it the
extra<00:00:45.180> line<00:00:45.360> into<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.570> microphone<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.140> then

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
extra line into the microphone and then

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
extra line into the microphone and then
you<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.440> simply<00:00:46.710> plug<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.039> 3.5<00:00:47.670> millimeter

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you just simply plug the 3.5 millimeter

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.840 
you just simply plug the 3.5 millimeter
jack<00:00:48.149> into<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.230> PC<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.800> laptop<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.730> it's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
jack into your PC or laptop so it's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
jack into your PC or laptop so it's
pretty<00:00:50.969> much<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.210> plug<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> play<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.070> the

pretty much just plug and play so the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.069 
pretty much just plug and play so the

next thing you get in the Box is a shock

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
next thing you get in the Box is a shock
mount<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.590> will<00:00:56.280> simply<00:00:56.520> score<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
mount which will simply score on a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.139 
mount which will simply score on a
microphone<00:00:57.480> boom<00:00:57.899> pole<00:00:58.289> or<00:00:58.559> tripod<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.489> this

microphone boom pole or tripod and this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
microphone boom pole or tripod and this
simply<00:01:00.539> stops<00:01:00.840> any<00:01:01.050> ground<00:01:01.320> nor<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> any

course<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> microphone<00:01:32.310> itself

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
course you get the microphone itself

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.480 
course you get the microphone itself
which<00:01:33.030> has<00:01:33.360> got<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.720> koala<00:01:34.079> weight<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
which has got a koala weight to it

so it's just pretty much plain as you as
I've<00:01:44.250> mentioned<00:01:44.369> before<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.850> looks<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
I've mentioned before it looks like the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.469 
I've mentioned before it looks like the
isk<00:01:45.930> BM<00:01:46.619> 700<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.909> pretty<00:01:48.030> much<00:01:48.149> what

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
isk BM 700 and that's pretty much what

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.670 
isk BM 700 and that's pretty much what
you<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> box

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you get in the box

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.260 
you get in the box
as<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.970> will<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.030> doing<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
as you can see so I will be doing a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.359 
as you can see so I will be doing a
microphone<00:01:54.780> test<00:01:55.140> or<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> test<00:01:55.649> review<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.159> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
showed in my previous videos I use quite

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.680 
showed in my previous videos I use quite
a<00:02:06.750> range<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.320> microphones<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.729> dynamic

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a range of microphones I use a dynamic

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.240 
a range of microphones I use a dynamic
microphone<00:02:09.869> which<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.379> quite<00:02:10.560> inexpensive<00:02:11.220> I

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
microphone which is quite inexpensive I

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
microphone which is quite inexpensive I
also<00:02:11.400> use

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
also use

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.960 
also use
the<00:02:12.960> Plantronics<00:02:13.560> gaming<00:02:13.890> headset<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.580> also
