00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.210
 hello welcome saun like in this video 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.200
 I'm going to teach you two tips very 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.690
 basic to give the shepherd to the horse 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.520
 as you see it is very simple apparently 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.990
 it does not have any complications but I think 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.910
 that there are two details that have to be 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.500
 a little important the first the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.029
 horses usually are never 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.590
 in a quiet place grazing always go 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.300
 to look to find the best herb that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.369
 want with the nose they will go looking for 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.890
 therefore without combing forward 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.029
 hands agree to avoid us 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.649
 step on the rope we always have to 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.960
 be aware that the rope is not 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.760
 in the ground, it is worth staying on the ground 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.530
 horse could step on it could 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.170
 scare if we would escape would be a 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.969
 problem if the rope using the legs 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.220
 we could not control the horse like this 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.380
 you will be ok , therefore, this is 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.120
 what we have to avoid so for 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.910
 have a horse always be attentive 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.290
 of having a little dot of tension that never 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.540
 be on the floor because you see the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.700
 horse slowly go ahead 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.010
 hands ok and I could step on the rope and 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.899
 get scared 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.820
 another detail that I think is important 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.080
 that this we would use it always not 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.570
 only when we pass but when 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.960
 we have the horse caught we never have 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.100
 that catch the rope rolled up like this never 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 we have to make a rope when 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.410
 we have a horse at the other end 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.870
 the horses in animals that get scared 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.550
 easily if you pass a motorcycle around here 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.680
 behind someone and throwing a firecracker what 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.570
 that the horse could be scared and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.400
 do a very strong pull if we have the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.330
 rope rolled up fingers can we 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.330
 get to the toes 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.310
 therefore always the free rope of 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.960
 horses have to go we can take it 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.730
 But if any one sees the horse, 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.350
 we can hold on to letting go of the rope like this 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.110
 that nothing happens what does not have to 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.790
 happen is that the horse we have 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.620
 hooked him and he goes running 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.000
 I remember that never has to happen 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.290
 good as I said I was 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.270
 moving that is quite important 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.500
 always when we see the horse sane 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.570
 when we are taking horseback from the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.650
 block at any time I what 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.729
 I wanted to do in this video because 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.570
 really at this moment it 's a moment 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.570
 where we are relaxed 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.799
 do not pay attention to the horse having 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.570
 fuck the rope in this way and from 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.520
 hit without realizing on horseback 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.369
 start running and give us a tug where 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.500
 it can really hurt us a lot 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.209
 I always recommend almost always look 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.299
 to do it once we have the horse 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.640
 of state let it go for a while stretch 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.680
 the neck that relax that eat a little 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.019
 and that will also greatly benefit the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.250
 relationship of horse breeds the horse 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.050
 will appreciate after a 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.480
 a job done with the right 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.770
 exercise of having worked to have 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.250
 done what we wanted in this 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.930
 case give him a good rest time 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.040
 undo and eat fresh grass like 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.170
 we have here 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.700
 so nothing here this video of 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.959
 today we have made other similar videos 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.540
 which I hope they are also not 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.459
 anything useful do you know 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.170
 comments us if we can and what 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.610
 we see what we will discuss, we will respect it 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.550
 like 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.980
 in sharing it, follow us in our 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.330
 channel as dotcom and nothing any 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.370
 thing that we really hope that what

 videos we've made and nothing any 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.800
 thing you know where we are for 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.800
 approximate
