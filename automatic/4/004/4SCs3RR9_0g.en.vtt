00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
production of the vehicle do you think

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.510 
production of the vehicle do you think
funny<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.320> gave<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.860> too<00:02:18.010> quickly

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
funny I gave up on it too quickly

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.190 
funny I gave up on it too quickly
yeah<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.060> instant<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.660> they<00:02:19.780> got<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.050> right

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
yeah the instant that they got it right

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.840 
yeah the instant that they got it right
was<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> instant<00:02:20.950> they<00:02:21.100> trashed<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.790> if

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
was the instant they trashed it and if

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.340 
was the instant they trashed it and if
they'd<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.120> given<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.390> six<00:02:22.660> months<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:23.140> maybe

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
they'd have given it six months or maybe

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.930 
they'd have given it six months or maybe
even<00:02:23.470> one<00:02:23.739> more<00:02:23.950> model<00:02:24.310> year<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.520> think<00:02:24.850> they

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
even one more model year I think they

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.340 
even one more model year I think they
would<00:02:25.030> have<00:02:25.090> seen<00:02:25.300> sales<00:02:25.570> pick<00:02:25.900> up<00:02:26.080> and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
would have seen sales pick up and

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.970 
would have seen sales pick up and
appreciably<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:28.230> once<00:02:29.230> embarrassed<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.950> admit

well<00:03:32.930> about<00:03:33.319> eight<00:03:33.469> months<00:03:33.650> ago<00:03:33.859> we<00:03:34.159> started

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
well about eight months ago we started

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.209 
well about eight months ago we started
to<00:03:34.700> put<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.150> 3.8<00:03:35.989> supercharged<00:03:36.620> engine<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.099> it

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:37.219 
to put a 3.8 supercharged engine in it

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.479 
to put a 3.8 supercharged engine in it
out<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.790> 94<00:03:38.239> Bonneville<00:03:38.749> and<00:03:39.260> had<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.680> bored

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
out of a 94 Bonneville and had it bored

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.489 
out of a 94 Bonneville and had it bored
out<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.969> has<00:03:41.060> been<00:03:41.299> ported<00:03:41.689> and<00:03:41.749> polished<00:03:41.870> and

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:51.469 
motor now is around 300 but we're in the

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.800 
motor now is around 300 but we're in the
middle<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.739> putting<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.129> NOS<00:03:52.579> kit<00:03:52.879> in<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.120> nitrous

oxide<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.439> that<00:03:54.530> should<00:03:54.709> take<00:03:54.859> it<00:03:55.010> up<00:03:55.099> to

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
oxide and that should take it up to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.539 
oxide and that should take it up to
close<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.609> 400<00:03:56.030> horsepower<00:03:56.980> your<00:03:57.980> thoughts<00:03:58.310> on

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
close to 400 horsepower your thoughts on

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.589 
close to 400 horsepower your thoughts on
this<00:03:58.700> car<00:03:58.939> I<00:03:58.969> mean<00:03:59.120> we're<00:03:59.269> here<00:03:59.419> with<00:03:59.569> a

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
this car I mean we're here with a

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.089 
this car I mean we're here with a
gentleman<00:03:59.989> who<00:04:00.079> makes<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.650> living<00:04:00.799> at

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
gentleman who makes a living at

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.789 
gentleman who makes a living at
customizing<00:04:01.999> them<00:04:02.150> but<00:04:02.469> what<00:04:03.469> went<00:04:03.620> wrong

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
customizing them but what went wrong

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.550 
customizing them but what went wrong
with<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.129> Fiero<00:04:04.459> uh<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:05.750> think<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.200> problem<00:04:06.469> was

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
with it Fiero uh I think the problem was

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.020 
with it Fiero uh I think the problem was
they<00:04:06.709> never<00:04:06.829> put<00:04:07.099> enough<00:04:07.129> horsepower<00:04:07.609> in<00:04:07.879> them

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
they never put enough horsepower in them

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.659 
they never put enough horsepower in them
they<00:04:08.959> were<00:04:09.019> good<00:04:09.620> at<00:04:09.769> handling<00:04:10.159> and<00:04:10.459> they<00:04:10.549> had

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
they were good at handling and they had

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.429 
they were good at handling and they had
the<00:04:10.790> looks<00:04:11.030> but<00:04:11.329> they<00:04:11.810> just<00:04:12.019> didn't<00:04:12.260> have<00:04:12.290> the

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
the looks but they just didn't have the

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.069 
the looks but they just didn't have the
performance<00:04:13.010> even<00:04:13.909> with<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> 2.8<00:04:14.719> it<00:04:14.930> was

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
performance even with the 2.8 it was

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.319 
performance even with the 2.8 it was
only<00:04:15.349> putting<00:04:15.650> out<00:04:15.799> 140<00:04:16.400> horsepower<00:04:16.759> it<00:04:17.150> just

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
only putting out 140 horsepower it just

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.420 
only putting out 140 horsepower it just
wasn't<00:04:17.630> enough<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.989> keep<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.289> guys<00:04:18.500> who<00:04:19.220> liked

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
wasn't enough to keep the guys who liked

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.089 
wasn't enough to keep the guys who liked
that<00:04:19.549> kind<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.849> a<00:04:19.940> car<00:04:20.150> happy<00:04:20.539> in<00:04:21.079> 1984<00:04:21.889> when

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
that kind of a car happy in 1984 when

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.850 
that kind of a car happy in 1984 when
the<00:04:22.130> first<00:04:22.400> production<00:04:22.580> year<00:04:22.940> came<00:04:23.150> out<00:04:23.860> their

the first production year came out their

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.830 
the first production year came out their

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
harness junction wasn't that area so it

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.760 
harness junction wasn't that area so it
was<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.610> exhaust<00:04:34.880> manifold<00:04:35.389> what<00:04:36.289> occurred

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
was the exhaust manifold what occurred

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.010 
was the exhaust manifold what occurred
most<00:04:37.070> times<00:04:37.340> was<00:04:37.610> oiled<00:04:38.570> leaked<00:04:38.750> out<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:38.900> the

splash all over the wiring harness and

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.499 
splash all over the wiring harness and
it<00:04:43.070> was<00:04:43.159> the<00:04:43.370> wiring<00:04:43.669> hers<00:04:43.759> would<00:04:44.150> start<00:04:44.419> to

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
it was the wiring hers would start to

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.080 
it was the wiring hers would start to
burn<00:04:45.190> what<00:04:46.190> they<00:04:46.310> did<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.610> cure<00:04:46.789> that<00:04:46.940> problem

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
burn what they did to cure that problem

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.020 
burn what they did to cure that problem
is<00:04:47.449> they<00:04:47.599> covered<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.349> entire<00:04:48.949> manifold<00:04:49.639> but

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
is they covered the entire manifold but

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.060 
is they covered the entire manifold but
a<00:04:50.090> heat<00:04:50.270> shield<00:04:50.449> and<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:51.650> was<00:04:51.770> one<00:04:51.919> of<00:04:51.949> the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
a heat shield and that was one of the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.790 
a heat shield and that was one of the
recalls<00:04:52.370> they<00:04:52.490> had<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:53.389> navy<00:04:53.900> between<00:04:54.440> 84<00:04:54.740> and

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
recalls they had a navy between 84 and

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.279 
recalls they had a navy between 84 and
85<00:04:56.380> so<00:04:57.380> everybody<00:04:57.889> agrees<00:04:58.280> by<00:04:58.699> 1988<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.870> Fiero

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
85 so everybody agrees by 1988 the Fiero

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.560 
85 so everybody agrees by 1988 the Fiero
was<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.560> terrific<00:05:01.070> car<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.940> question<00:05:02.449> though

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
was a terrific car the question though

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.629 
was a terrific car the question though
still<00:05:02.900> remains<00:05:03.259> why<00:05:03.919> did<00:05:04.130> General<00:05:04.430> Motors

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
still remains why did General Motors

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.120 
still remains why did General Motors
pull<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.360> plug

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
pull the plug

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.980 
pull the plug
they<00:05:07.430> were<00:05:07.520> so<00:05:07.729> good<00:05:07.909> they<00:05:07.970> pulls<00:05:08.780> the

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
they were so good they pulls the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.439 
they were so good they pulls the
competition<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.860> Corvette<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.880> at<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.240> price

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
competition to Corvette and at the price

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:12.760 
competition to Corvette and at the price
they<00:05:11.630> were<00:05:11.720> selling<00:05:12.080> them<00:05:12.229> each<00:05:12.349> the<00:05:12.530> top

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
they were selling them each the top

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.050 
they were selling them each the top
price<00:05:13.099> was<00:05:13.340> about<00:05:13.780> $25,000<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:15.740> was<00:05:16.060> almost

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
price was about $25,000 it was almost

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.899 
price was about $25,000 it was almost
half<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.389> price<00:05:17.599> of<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.840> Corvette<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:18.909> that's

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
half the price of a Corvette and that's

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.999 
half the price of a Corvette and that's
my<00:05:20.150> opinion<00:05:20.449> why<00:05:20.930> they<00:05:21.139> stopped<00:05:21.440> making<00:05:21.860> them
