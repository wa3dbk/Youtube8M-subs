00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.620
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.970
 as you are and welcome is to the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.559
 youtube channel tai shan to goltv 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.510
 I am a sergio, you can find me in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.580
 twitter for roba is navas 10 in this 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.260
 video we are going to make a cydia tweet 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.450
 or rather an application that is called 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.740
 battery life a super china application 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.970
 who recommended me yesterday evening 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.860
 after the live show that we made 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.480
 Artzain's friend and friend Alberto 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.739
 It's good to tell you that this 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.540
 application is available in the 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.340
 mobile.com repository that comes by 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.009
 defect in cydia and it's completely 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.810
 free and works with ios 6 and ios 7 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.460
 let's go to the application is this 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.780
 incognito orange that you see here from but 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.640
 in life and note that it is an application 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 very simple but that really gives us 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.929
 lots of information and super useful for 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 keep your battery in good condition 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.519
 whether on an ipad or an iphone a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.899
 iPad whatever it is not to notice that here 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.339
 let's see a little bit the percentage 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.260
 first of the load that we have 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.300
 now I'll notice what the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.010
 milliamperios at the end then that I've 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.929
 consumed and the total milliamperes that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 I have interesting things tell me the 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.989
 maximum capacity you already know that the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.879
 watching the batteries have a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.920
 determined longevity have a life 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.170
 useful not in such a way that when 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 we have the new battery 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.650
 on the iphone 5 that is the one that I have 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 because it has an autonomy 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.720
 but it's time to 1,430 with the use is 2000 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 jumper and now they go down and according 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.220
 are going down we are losing quality of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.280
 battery in this case my battery is at 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.660
 90 98 percent health after a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.400
 year and peak using it I think it's 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.930
 pretty good and see what things 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.820
 quite important we will also see 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.000
 the charge cycles set that me to me 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.890
 iPhone 5 I have done 379 charging cycles 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.510
 this we see here here fix guys and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.560
 good girls the truth is that it is a 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.850
 load cycle I would also like 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.430
 put yourself a little in position in 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 background what imagine a thing a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.830
 load cycle is not every time 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.780
 you put to load the device 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.910
 a cycle of charges when you 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.130
 complete one hundred percent of the load 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.800
 I explain to you if you today come by 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.570
 the night with your team at 50% 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.270
 you load you leave it all night 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.280
 you have charged 50% if per day 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.440
 next you do the same thing lasts all 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.970
 day and night you reach 50% and 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.790
 when you go to bed you put it to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.399
 load and load another 50% we have 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.649
 completed 50 percent plus 50 for 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.390
 one hundred hundred percent of agreement of this 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.520
 way we have completed a circle 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.080
 that is, the sum of all the faces 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.380
 what are we doing every time we load 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.840
 to the device when 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.580
 is 100 then we have completed a 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.780
 load cycle this is a cycle of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.180
 agreement here we're going to see this fact that 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.370
 it's quite interesting not also things 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.110
 important let's see the temperature 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.700
 of the battery that is something that seems like 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.260
 no but it really is very important 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.480
 because if the temperature is not the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.520
 the battery is not going to perform well 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.410
 If it is very hot the battery goes to 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.820
 yield much less is to say is going to 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.650
 spend the battery before and it will not 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.819
 working properly is important 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.890
 we do not have the exact temperature not 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.299
 good rogues that here also one thing 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.189
 What I like a lot is that I'm going to 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.689
 say the charger that I am 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.299
 using to charge my device 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.709
 how many milian pérez is now going to 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.389
 provide and this is what I most 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.920
 like this application because I 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.840
 I recommend to all of you many times 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.329
 you ask me what you are charging 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.310
 teams with the official charger that's 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.200
 the best because you are always going to load 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.090
 for example the iphone you are going to load 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.189
 with a charger that is 1 amp and what 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.169
 you are going to load that to 1000 miriam pérez 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.269
 not that it's an amp at the end not if 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.980
 load with the computer surely then 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.260
 will charge less depends on the computer not 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.299
 what you do with a usb hub or with another 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.560
 charger that have fewer amps is going 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.329
 to load what happens is that it is going to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.099
 marley load slower if ye 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.139
 You load the iphone at the end with a 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.239
 charger that is external that is not the 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.269
 you are going to load it safely with 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.579
 more or less load according if the load 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.500
 is lower it will load slower if the 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.659
 Load is higher will load faster 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.549
 the officer repeated that it is one ampere 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.799
 if you load it with a charger of 2 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.560
 amps will be charged faster and the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.090
 load speed influences that so 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.159
 unless the battery is more or less healthy 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.240
 because if you can not download it if every 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.040
 day you load it with a load 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.990
 different you do not go alternating between two 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.730
 loaders for example then this is 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.650
 very important me to start for 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.900
 do the demonstration let's connect to 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.300
 charge my iphone 5 according 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.250
 we connect the connector we turn on this 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.720
 external battery that I have around here for 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.310
 load it and notice that it is already 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.950
 loading you notice what you are telling me 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.920
 that the maximum current of the charger is 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.630
 of 2400 miriam pérez now and one thing 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.060
 super important is that you notice that 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.010
 below it tells me the load at this moment 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.700
 the load that is loading is 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.770
 loading 758,000 jumper is now this not 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.480
 is the amp that in the end offered by the 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.700
 official charger but it's pretty close 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.200
 which is why I'm worth it and I trust 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.060
 to charge it with this with this battery 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.980
 externally not in any case if I 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.420
 I disconnect the charger to note that here 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.090
 is going to tell me that the current load 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.650
 current is decrement I do not know obviously 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.300
 for the good use rogues that there 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.950
 changed to notice that the 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.540
 indicator in red is telling me that 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.240
 me right now tal and koné with the use of 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.640
 the pulling'm consuming 164 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.350
 milliamperios of good agreement is a data 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.120
 quite interesting to know what 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.890
 you are consuming on the one hand if you are 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.390
 playing a video game you already know that 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.280
 the team works 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.780
 and will spend more battery and you are 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.160
 loading with a charger that is not the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.750
 official then you can have a 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.790
 guidance if it is advisable or not 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.620
 load it if it gets closer or closer to that 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.870
 amp offered by the official charger 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.220
 in the iphone of agreements guys good the 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.390
 truth is that this is simply a 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.220
 application that gives us a lot of information 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.020
 of our battery that if we know how to read 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.270
 the with the tips that I explained 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.310
 I think you're going to have a very good battery 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.870
 healthy and that will last a very long time 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.950
 At least I hope so many 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.690
 thanks for the attention if you liked 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.490
 the information video you can support us 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.140
 with a like and nothing that we see in 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.710
 a next video can heal with point 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.710
