00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.340
 we will see the transparency of this 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.000
 camouflage and for me it's really 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.860
 magnificent 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.090

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.960

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.390
 gift so here and there he will go to 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.070
 beth the betis frankly it's my 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.660
 third is the third because 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.230
 finally if I do not count the calm at 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.330
 chameleon 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.030
 it's stupid boots when you do not want 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.970
 that youtube kill us bypass them there 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.430
 need nothing so bits what is a very 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.880
 nice flash book so unfortunately 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.300
 do not have the cards the cards of 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.060
 visit 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.730
 besides, the most important business card 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.830
 used that I saw on every 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 players this is the debt business card 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.370
 which is beautiful is you have a 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.400
 jaguar panther I do not know what 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.720
 who is in the rain and frankly 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
 this map is in motion it is 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.840
 magnificent 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.840
 after you have of course the 115 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.530
 militarized with the original origins what 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.950
 is very beautiful mess 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.810
 there he passed no word that a moment 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.790
 of death so there too the author of visit 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.420
 is not so bad with fingers 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.820
 skeletons that affect aces but 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.960
 without it no more seriously 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.390
 is not is not that good 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.280
 when you last year after where no 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.500
 missing amelio the one I have a small 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.270
 trick to show you how to do it 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.800
 change color so not colors 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.560
 that you want but randomly 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.470
 some burns he will try to get himself 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.860
 to kill good is always a little 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.420
 long so with the cam at the chameleon lo 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.520
 so there is green color canton 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.080
 death it can be of another color 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.770
 you do not worry it's 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.290
 totally random and to change it 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.040
 of color there I'm waiting for him to 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.110
 present a little bit here and for the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.580
 change color it will have everything 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.650
 just close this you are not on 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.260
 a new class is simply 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.940
 there he changed so as the admits do 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.070
 class you take another class 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.960
 like this was the n 94 and as I 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.000
 I'm not dead yet and the camo and 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.190
 already planned to advance a little bit for 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.830
 the next time you die luca 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.940
 words of your humble change of color 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.739
 so there you just have to do that and 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.520
 you will see that just particularly 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.980
