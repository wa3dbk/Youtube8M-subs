here to deter you from changing the
battery<00:01:22.340> yourself<00:01:22.870> why<00:01:23.870> they<00:01:24.080> don't<00:01:24.229> want

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350

battery yourself why they don't want
people<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.620> change<00:01:24.740> your<00:01:24.920> battery<00:01:25.040> I'm

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
people to change your battery I'm

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.540 
people to change your battery I'm
guessing<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.240> financial<00:01:26.510> reason<00:01:27.550> other

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
guessing it's a financial reason other

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.210 
guessing it's a financial reason other
than<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.000> can't<00:01:29.360> think<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.860> why<00:01:30.860> they

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
than that I can't think of why they

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.200 
than that I can't think of why they
don't<00:01:31.340> want<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.550> to<00:01:31.610> chain<00:01:31.760> your<00:01:31.820> own<00:01:31.910> battery

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
don't want you to chain your own battery

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.469 
don't want you to chain your own battery
so<00:01:33.110> I'm<00:01:34.100> assuming<00:01:34.400> once<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.030> remove<00:01:35.330> this

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
so I'm assuming once you remove this

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.290 
so I'm assuming once you remove this
battery<00:01:35.869> you<00:01:36.320> have<00:01:36.710> voided<00:01:37.580> your<00:01:37.610> warranty<00:01:38.090> so

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
battery you have voided your warranty so

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.260 
battery you have voided your warranty so
caution<00:01:39.229> if<00:01:39.440> you<00:01:39.500> are<00:01:40.490> just<00:01:40.610> experimenting

caution if you are just experimenting

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.820 
caution if you are just experimenting
you<00:01:41.330> probably<00:01:41.570> don't<00:01:41.750> want<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:41.960> just<00:01:42.080> remove

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
you probably don't want to just remove

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.080 
you probably don't want to just remove
the<00:01:42.979> sticker<00:01:43.220> in<00:01:43.369> case<00:01:43.520> something<00:01:43.790> happens<00:01:44.060> to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090

lightly lift up the sticker like so and
it<00:02:05.479> comes<00:02:05.660> up<00:02:05.810> pretty<00:02:06.229> easily<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.280> actually

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
it comes up pretty easily and actually

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.170 
it comes up pretty easily and actually
sticks<00:02:07.880> back<00:02:08.060> down<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:09.170> reality<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:10.340> Mac

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180

just kind of lightly pull the cord out
and<00:02:56.019> it's<00:02:57.019> unplugged<00:02:57.430> then<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.640> use<00:02:58.760> this

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
and it's unplugged then you can use this

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.530 
and it's unplugged then you can use this
other<00:02:59.030> tab<00:02:59.299> here<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.780> lift<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:01.209> pull<00:03:02.209> out<00:03:02.299> and

the<00:03:02.870> batteries<00:03:03.170> out<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.739> what<00:03:03.829> the<00:03:03.920> battery

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
the batteries out so what the battery

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.129 
the batteries out so what the battery
looks<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:04.489> it's<00:03:04.849> pretty<00:03:05.000> thin<00:03:05.359> it's

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
looks like it's pretty thin it's

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.399 
looks like it's pretty thin it's
actually<00:03:06.439> kind<00:03:06.829> of<00:03:06.920> light<00:03:07.219> for<00:03:07.670> being

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
actually kind of light for being

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.649 
actually kind of light for being
supposed<00:03:09.409> of<00:03:09.530> eight<00:03:09.709> hour<00:03:09.859> battery<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.730> there

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
supposed of eight hour battery and there

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.119 
supposed of eight hour battery and there
you<00:03:11.750> have<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.079> this<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.769> actually<00:03:12.889> the

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
you have it this is actually the

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.399 
you have it this is actually the
trackpad<00:03:13.400> on<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.419> other<00:03:14.569> side<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.959> class<00:03:15.139> one

this<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.709> how<00:03:15.889> you<00:03:15.950> get<00:03:16.189> to<00:03:16.510> want<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.599> adjust

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
this is how you get to want to adjust

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.000 
this is how you get to want to adjust
the<00:03:19.579> click<00:03:20.150> sound<00:03:20.419> which<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.319> another<00:03:21.650> video<00:03:21.950> I

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
the click sound which is another video I

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.030 
the click sound which is another video I
can<00:03:22.159> make<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.450> give<00:03:24.349> it<00:03:24.470> within<00:03:24.739> two<00:03:24.889> months

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
can make so I give it within two months

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.080 
can make so I give it within two months
and<00:03:25.220> you'll<00:03:25.340> be<00:03:25.400> able<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.579> buy<00:03:25.700> these<00:03:25.760> online

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
and you'll be able to buy these online

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.140 
and you'll be able to buy these online
and<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:28.280> probably<00:03:28.430> don't<00:03:28.700> need<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.849> replace

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
and you probably don't need to replace

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.789 
and you probably don't need to replace
your<00:03:29.209> battery<00:03:29.599> with<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.230> next<00:03:30.560> two<00:03:30.650> months

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
your battery with a next two months

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.539 
your battery with a next two months
hopefully<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.930> yet<00:03:33.799> potentially<00:03:34.159> you<00:03:34.220> carry

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
hopefully but yet potentially you carry

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.069 
hopefully but yet potentially you carry
some<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.760> these<00:03:34.819> around<00:03:34.970> with<00:03:35.329> you<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.689> swap

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
some of these around with you and swap

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.780 
some of these around with you and swap
them<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.439> field<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:37.250> would<00:03:37.400> probably<00:03:37.609> take

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
them in the field it would probably take

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.149 
them in the field it would probably take
about<00:03:38.060> five<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.230> ten<00:03:39.409> minutes<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.709> swap<00:03:39.950> out<00:03:40.129> a

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
about five to ten minutes to swap out a

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.670 
about five to ten minutes to swap out a
battery<00:03:40.519> which<00:03:40.699> isn't<00:03:40.940> too<00:03:41.389> bad<00:03:42.049> if<00:03:42.379> you

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
battery which isn't too bad if you

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.939 
battery which isn't too bad if you
really<00:03:42.979> need<00:03:43.159> to<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.720> I'm<00:03:45.530> going<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.739> put<00:03:45.859> it

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
really need to so I'm going to put it

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.009 
really need to so I'm going to put it
back<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.269> these<00:03:47.269> have<00:03:47.449> to<00:03:47.510> go<00:03:47.569> onto<00:03:47.810> these

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
back in these have to go onto these

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.819 
back in these have to go onto these
little<00:03:48.229> slots<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.099> you<00:03:49.159> just<00:03:49.400> push<00:03:49.819> it<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.829> set

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
little slots so you just push it in set

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.610 
little slots so you just push it in set
it<00:03:51.859> back<00:03:52.010> down<00:03:53.139> this<00:03:54.139> is<00:03:54.290> probably<00:03:54.500> the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
it back down this is probably the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.259 
it back down this is probably the
hardest<00:03:54.739> part<00:03:54.979> of<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.340> process<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:55.879> plugging

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
hardest part of the process is plugging

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:08.810 
hardest part of the process is plugging
this<00:03:56.389> little<00:03:57.459> clip<00:03:58.459> in

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.400 

maybe<00:04:09.820> easier<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.630> do<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.020> without<00:04:11.170> the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
maybe easier to do it without the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.720 
maybe easier to do it without the
battery<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:13.120> with<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.570> little<00:04:13.720> more<00:04:13.840> light

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
battery in and with a little more light

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.360 
battery in and with a little more light
once<00:04:15.730> you<00:04:15.850> get<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.150> in<00:04:16.269> now<00:04:17.100> just<00:04:18.100> make<00:04:18.250> sure

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
once you get it in now just make sure

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.070 
once you get it in now just make sure
it's<00:04:18.519> snug<00:04:18.640> so<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.209> doesn't<00:04:19.510> pop<00:04:19.690> out<00:04:19.870> when

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
it's snug so it doesn't pop out when

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.320 
it's snug so it doesn't pop out when
you're<00:04:20.230> using<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.880> then<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.120> can<00:04:22.240> go

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
you're using it and then you can go

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.970 
you're using it and then you can go
ahead<00:04:22.420> and<00:04:22.600> seal<00:04:22.810> back<00:04:23.020> down<00:04:23.200> your<00:04:23.440> warranty

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
ahead and seal back down your warranty

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.210 
ahead and seal back down your warranty
sticker<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.660> actually<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.870> think<00:04:26.770> they'd<00:04:27.100> be

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
sticker and actually I think they'd be

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.160 
sticker and actually I think they'd be
hard-pressed<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.880> tell<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.020> was

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
hard-pressed to tell that this was

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.130 
hard-pressed to tell that this was
opened<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:31.800> go<00:04:32.800> ahead<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.040> replace<00:04:33.190> your

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
opened so go ahead and replace your

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:59.560 
opened so go ahead and replace your
funky<00:04:35.140> screws

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.060 

so<00:05:00.570> this<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:00.990> probably<00:05:01.260> easier<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:01.800> do<00:05:01.950> with

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
so this is probably easier to do with

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.270
