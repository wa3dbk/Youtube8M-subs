movement<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.650> good<00:01:38.070> that's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.460> great

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
movement that's a good that's a great

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.819 
movement that's a good that's a great
way<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> look<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.079> rotate<00:01:40.680> around

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
way to look at it so if I rotate around

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.679 
way to look at it so if I rotate around
let's<00:01:41.220> say<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.790> complex<00:01:42.270> model

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
let's say I have a really complex model

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.740 
let's say I have a really complex model
in<00:01:42.810> my<00:01:42.960> scene<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.590> Wow<00:01:44.369> yeah<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.420> got

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
in my scene like this Wow yeah you got

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.300 
in my scene like this Wow yeah you got
to<00:01:45.780> be<00:01:45.899> impressed<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.350> modeling<00:01:46.829> skills<00:01:47.070> now

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
to be impressed with modeling skills now

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.210 
to be impressed with modeling skills now
and<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.880> decide<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.619> this<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:49.979> such<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and I decide that this is like such a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.160 
and I decide that this is like such a
great<00:01:50.460> view<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.270> cube<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.899> by<00:01:52.020> accident

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
great view of this cube but by accident

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.260 
great view of this cube but by accident
I<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> jumped<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:53.640> viewport<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.090> little

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
I kind of jumped my viewport a little

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.020 
I kind of jumped my viewport a little
bit<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.770> can<00:01:55.770> choose<00:01:55.950> previous<00:01:56.490> view<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
bit I can choose previous view and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
bit I can choose previous view and
that'll<00:01:57.570> take<00:01:57.750> me<00:01:57.840> back<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.409> keep<00:01:58.619> on

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that'll take me back I can keep on

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.030 
that'll take me back I can keep on
hitting<00:01:59.340> previous<00:01:59.820> view<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.710> at<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.829> point

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
hitting previous view and at this point

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.109 
hitting previous view and at this point
I've<00:02:02.189> gone<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> way<00:02:02.579> back<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> new

good<00:03:05.370> mile<00:03:05.669> and<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.909> half<00:03:05.939> away<00:03:06.239> now<00:03:06.629> we<00:03:06.870> don't

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
good mile and a half away now we don't

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.390 
good mile and a half away now we don't
want<00:03:07.169> to<00:03:07.230> fly<00:03:07.500> all<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.769> way<00:03:07.799> out<00:03:07.889> there<00:03:08.010> we're

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
want to fly all the way out there we're

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.830 
want to fly all the way out there we're
working<00:03:08.760> over<00:03:08.969> here<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.269> we<00:03:09.389> want<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.629> see

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
working over here but we want to see

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.809 
working over here but we want to see
where<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.169> object<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.709> we<00:03:11.189> can<00:03:11.340> choose<00:03:11.489> look

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
where this object is we can choose look

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.490 
where this object is we can choose look
at<00:03:11.969> selection<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.629> it'll<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:12.870> rotate<00:03:13.349> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
at selection and it'll just rotate the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.869 
at selection and it'll just rotate the
camera<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:13.889> that<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.189> aiming<00:03:14.579> right<00:03:14.819> at

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
camera so that it's aiming right at

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.520 
camera so that it's aiming right at
whatever<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.569> we<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:15.900> selected<00:03:16.109> very

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
whatever it is we have selected very

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.550 
whatever it is we have selected very
nice<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:17.729> choose<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.030> frame<00:03:18.569> all<00:03:18.959> which

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
nice we can choose a frame all which

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.170 
nice we can choose a frame all which
probably<00:03:20.310> helped<00:03:20.579> them<00:03:20.729> make<00:03:20.849> about<00:03:21.120> three

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
probably helped them make about three

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.420 
probably helped them make about three
other<00:03:21.510> objects<00:03:21.959> yet<00:03:22.169> help<00:03:22.500> if<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.739> had<00:03:22.919> a<00:03:22.949> few

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
other objects yet help if I had a few

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.740 
other objects yet help if I had a few
more<00:03:23.549> objects<00:03:23.909> and<00:03:24.000> I'll<00:03:24.090> space<00:03:24.389> them<00:03:24.569> out<00:03:24.629> to

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
more objects and I'll space them out to

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.800 
more objects and I'll space them out to
prove<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.989> point<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:26.310> three<00:03:27.030> objects<00:03:27.540> with<00:03:27.780> a

storing<00:04:37.380> various<00:04:37.950> camera<00:04:38.340> locations<00:04:38.910> that

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
storing various camera locations that

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.870 
storing various camera locations that
you<00:04:39.180> create<00:04:39.540> yourself<00:04:39.660> or<00:04:40.130> utilizing<00:04:41.130> default

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
you create yourself or utilizing default

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.790 
you create yourself or utilizing default
ones<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.270> come<00:04:42.510> with<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> new<00:04:43.020> scene<00:04:43.290> but

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
ones that come with a new scene but

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.710 
ones that come with a new scene but
again<00:04:44.010> we've<00:04:44.220> got<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.460> lesson<00:04:44.880> all<00:04:45.120> about<00:04:45.540> that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
again we've got a lesson all about that

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.120 
again we've got a lesson all about that
later<00:04:45.870> on<00:04:45.930> we<00:04:46.080> start<00:04:46.260> talking<00:04:46.410> about<00:04:46.620> workflow

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
later on we start talking about workflow

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.310 
later on we start talking about workflow
in<00:04:47.370> project<00:04:47.880> too<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.300> believe<00:04:48.480> absolutely

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
in project too I believe absolutely

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.170 
in project too I believe absolutely
underneath<00:04:49.920> this<00:04:50.070> we<00:04:50.280> have<00:04:50.370> camera<00:04:50.790> settings

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
underneath this we have camera settings

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.420 
underneath this we have camera settings
which<00:04:51.360> is<00:04:51.510> a<00:04:51.540> variety<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.350> kind<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:52.860> well

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
which is a variety of kind of well

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.730 
which is a variety of kind of well
switch<00:04:53.970> on/off<00:04:54.180> options<00:04:54.960> for<00:04:55.200> your<00:04:55.290> cameras

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
switch on/off options for your cameras

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.560 
switch on/off options for your cameras
to<00:04:55.860> help<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:56.130> with<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.280> variety<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:57.120> things<00:04:57.390> a

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
to help you with a variety of things a

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.330 
to help you with a variety of things a
lot<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:57.810> these<00:04:57.900> will<00:04:58.140> be<00:04:58.260> discussed<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.920> little

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
lot of these will be discussed a little

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.640 
lot of these will be discussed a little
bit<00:04:59.430> later<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.670> such<00:05:00.450> as<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.780> resolution<00:05:01.440> gate

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
bit later on such as the resolution gate

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.410 
bit later on such as the resolution gate
which<00:05:01.830> shows<00:05:02.040> you<00:05:02.220> exactly<00:05:02.340> what<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.120> going<00:05:03.180> to

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
which shows you exactly what is going to

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.480 
which shows you exactly what is going to
be<00:05:03.510> placed<00:05:03.810> inside<00:05:04.110> your<00:05:04.440> render<00:05:04.890> so<00:05:05.310> that

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
be placed inside your render so that

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.250 
be placed inside your render so that
nothing<00:05:05.760> is<00:05:05.880> left<00:05:06.000> out<00:05:06.240> we'll<00:05:06.990> go<00:05:07.080> ahead<00:05:07.170> and

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
nothing is left out we'll go ahead and

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.840 
nothing is left out we'll go ahead and
switch<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.710> for<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.040> time<00:05:08.190> being<00:05:08.460> back<00:05:08.700> to

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
switch that for the time being back to

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.280 
switch that for the time being back to
no<00:05:09.030> gate<00:05:09.240> because<00:05:09.480> we<00:05:09.690> are<00:05:09.780> going<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:09.960> focus<00:05:10.110> on

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
no gate because we are going to focus on

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.660 
no gate because we are going to focus on
that<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.470> little<00:05:10.680> further<00:05:10.920> down<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.220> road<00:05:11.370> if

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
that a little further down the road if

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.850 
that a little further down the road if
for<00:05:12.240> some<00:05:12.300> reason<00:05:12.480> you<00:05:12.870> need<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.230> attribute

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
for some reason you need the attribute

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.400 
for some reason you need the attribute
editor<00:05:14.010> for<00:05:14.580> your<00:05:14.730> camera<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.690> can<00:05:15.900> click

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
here we have the camera tools which I

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.980 
here we have the camera tools which I
have<00:05:37.380> already<00:05:37.410> discussed<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.810> image

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
have already discussed and the image

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
plane option which is going to be very

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.660 
plane option which is going to be very
very<00:05:42.750> useful<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:43.530> little<00:05:43.920> bit<00:05:44.070> later<00:05:44.280> but<00:05:44.520> for

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
very useful a little bit later but for
