00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.020
 after the last training prior to 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.700
 lap of the supercopa and minutes before 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.440
 to set course for the city of Barcelona 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.840
 aitor karanka analyzed thus between 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.000
 Local media party with 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.950
 first title at stake if we 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.230
 we make the party that we did the other 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.529
 day in the supercopa to come here 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.519
 we are focused on the party 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:28.869
 we know that we are not a title with a 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:32.069
 result that because it forces us into a 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.069
 beginning to win 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.710
 we really want that after the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.860
 party the other day 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 the people were with more desire from behind 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.270
 this title that this team has to 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.270
 going out to win from the beginning and 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.700
 At the end of the game we will try to give 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.950
 good level like the other day and what 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.870
 what is seen in the field are reflected in the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.060
 marker for the other day was that 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.920
 the height of season that we were with 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.800
 the time we had had of 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.140
 work is to that way of playing the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.550
 ley do neno videos respect if yes it is going to 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.440
 there are changes and yes you are going to change 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.470
 he also knows that we transmit to the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.910
 template is what you see the bernabÃ©u the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.030
 Sunday for 90 minutes I do not believe 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.729
 that everyone that the party left 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.700
 above all the Madridistas happy of the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.580
 team game and physical deployment 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.229
 and delivery the players and it's the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.660
 message that we give to the players that yes 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.369
 someone knows apps and you here do not 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:39.000
 I believe that everyone knows the class 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:41.880
 as a boy that is what happens that he 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.360
 very intensely matches and is 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.950
 Of course it's good for us to have 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.610
 players like that I think it 's 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.340
 important in that character and that way 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.070
 to see the matches we had already planned 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
 that when the European sub-19 headquarters 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.970
 that is incorporated to train with us 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.740
 and what we talked about the other day is not 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.140
 a player who has one more year of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.600
 experience that already knows the forms or 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.920
 our working methods and that 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.320
 We have a lot of confidence in the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.360
 man i think fabio this season 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.310
 especially this preseason on 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.830
 all the first matches in the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.660
 angels to the player's samples that 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.680
 it is not and above all good 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.690
 matches in play in positions 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.030
 different to the game in the game band of 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.190
 side midfield game inside me 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.290
 I think it's a game that comes to contribute 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.070
 much of how quality for the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.070
 versatility that you have
