00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
do that and I know that there's

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.700 
do that and I know that there's
definitely<00:01:59.640> some<00:02:00.240> good<00:02:01.020> quality<00:02:01.469> players

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
definitely some good quality players

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.410 
definitely some good quality players
include<00:02:02.070> quality<00:02:02.310> teams<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.729> those<00:02:02.969> divisions

include quality teams in those divisions
and<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:04.290> played<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.430> guys<00:02:05.610> who<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.570> come<00:02:06.689> up

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and I played with guys who have come up

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.160 
and I played with guys who have come up
through

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
through

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.100 
through
Division<00:02:08.860> two<00:02:09.009> or<00:02:09.310> NAIA<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:10.899> gone<00:02:11.050> to

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
Division two or NAIA that have gone to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.740 
Division two or NAIA that have gone to
MLS<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.770> played<00:02:12.459> professionally<00:02:13.090> think<00:02:13.390> that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
MLS and played professionally think that

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.960 
MLS and played professionally think that
the<00:02:13.900> level<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.260> talent<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.770> huge<00:02:15.040> there<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.489> need

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
the level of talent is huge there I need

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.460 
the level of talent is huge there I need
an<00:02:16.060> Argentine<00:02:16.510> national<00:02:16.540> team<00:02:17.050> player<00:02:17.230> also

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
an Argentine national team player also

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.290 
an Argentine national team player also
playing<00:02:17.800> Division<00:02:18.040> two<00:02:18.280> soccer<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.090> think

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
playing Division two soccer and I think

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300 
playing Division two soccer and I think
of<00:02:19.390> New<00:02:19.540> York<00:02:19.780> when<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.500> at<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.860> time<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.040> was

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
of New York when I at the time I was

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.699 
of New York when I at the time I was
playing<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.730> saw<00:02:22.000> Donna<00:02:22.209> Adam<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.140> can't<00:02:23.590> tell

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
playing and saw Donna Adam I can't tell

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.530 
playing and saw Donna Adam I can't tell
the<00:02:23.770> name<00:02:23.920> but<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> overall<00:02:25.180> level<00:02:25.390> of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
the name but the overall level of

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.729 
the name but the overall level of
division<00:02:25.900> 1<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:27.160> think<00:02:28.120> at<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:29.110> top<00:02:29.319> club<00:02:29.530> like

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
division 1 I think at a top club like

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.740 
division 1 I think at a top club like
UCL<00:02:30.130> i<00:02:30.190> think<00:02:30.400> there's<00:02:30.550> about<00:02:30.610> 10<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.120> 20<00:02:31.300> top

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
UCL i think there's about 10 to 20 top

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.590 
UCL i think there's about 10 to 20 top
top<00:02:32.080> clubs<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.190> think<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.880> think<00:02:34.450> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
top clubs and I think you I think the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.770 
top clubs and I think you I think the
level<00:02:35.069> would<00:02:36.069> be<00:02:36.130> comparable<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.970> good

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.720 

second<00:02:40.780> team<00:02:40.959> from<00:02:41.760> Bayern<00:02:42.760> or<00:02:43.180> from<00:02:43.930> a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
second team from Bayern or from a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.100 
second team from Bayern or from a
photogram<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.880> have<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.030> lot<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.239> talented

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
photogram you have a lot of talented

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.520 
photogram you have a lot of talented
kids<00:02:47.380> from<00:02:47.650> around<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:48.010> area<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.660> most<00:02:50.290> of

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
kids from around the area and most of

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.930 
kids from around the area and most of
them<00:02:50.620> will<00:02:50.769> end<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:51.040> going<00:02:51.069> professional<00:02:51.549> I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
them will end up going professional I

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.920 
them will end up going professional I
think<00:02:53.100> from<00:02:54.100> my<00:02:54.310> 11<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.330> starting<00:02:55.630> eleven<00:02:55.900> on

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
think from my 11 the starting eleven on

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.990 
think from my 11 the starting eleven on
my<00:02:56.080> team<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.380> think<00:02:56.530> eight<00:02:56.890> or<00:02:56.920> nine<00:02:57.220> went<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:57.880> to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
my team I think eight or nine went on to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.080 
my team I think eight or nine went on to
play<00:02:58.090> in<00:02:58.180> MLS<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:59.410> think<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.459> style<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.850> play

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
play in MLS I think the style of play

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.660 
play in MLS I think the style of play
that's<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.569> huge<00:03:01.810> difference<00:03:01.989> because<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
that's a huge difference because the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.400 
that's a huge difference because the
game's<00:03:03.880> 90<00:03:04.180> minutes<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.720> have<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.930> same<00:03:05.080> path

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
game's 90 minutes you have the same path

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.890 
game's 90 minutes you have the same path
time<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.799> 45<00:03:06.760> minutes<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.269> substitutions

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
time of 45 minutes but the substitutions

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.020 
time of 45 minutes but the substitutions
are<00:03:08.019> different<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:09.040> level<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.489> play<00:03:09.760> is

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
are different and the level of play is

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.830 
are different and the level of play is
much<00:03:10.750> more<00:03:10.989> intense<00:03:11.319> it's<00:03:11.620> almost<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.840> free

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
much more intense it's almost a free

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.470 
much more intense it's almost a free
substitution<00:03:14.709> rule<00:03:14.890> which<00:03:15.790> affects<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.269> game

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
substitution rule which affects the game

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.710 
substitution rule which affects the game
a<00:03:16.780> big<00:03:17.500> way<00:03:17.739> because<00:03:18.370> you're<00:03:18.790> able<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.239> really

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
a big way because you're able to really

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.009 
a big way because you're able to really
put<00:03:20.440> guys<00:03:20.590> on<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.829> field<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.310> sprint<00:03:22.239> at<00:03:22.450> a

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
put guys on the field that sprint at a

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.530 
put guys on the field that sprint at a
high<00:03:23.230> level<00:03:23.260> for<00:03:24.190> 20<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.670> 30<00:03:24.850> minutes<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.480> then

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
high level for 20 to 30 minutes and then

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.330 
high level for 20 to 30 minutes and then
they're<00:03:26.079> subbed<00:03:26.290> out<00:03:26.410> for<00:03:26.709> some<00:03:26.859> rest<00:03:27.100> and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
they're subbed out for some rest and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.830 
they're subbed out for some rest and
they<00:03:27.430> come<00:03:27.609> back<00:03:27.760> on<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:27.970> second<00:03:28.420> half<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.780> do

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
they come back on the second half and do

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.710 
they come back on the second half and do
the<00:03:28.989> same<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:30.579> there's<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.910> lot<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.120> tactical

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
the same so there's a lot of tactical

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.710 
the same so there's a lot of tactical
substitutions<00:03:32.470> it's<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.239> lot<00:03:34.239> more<00:03:34.299> intense

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
substitutions it's a lot more intense

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.990 
substitutions it's a lot more intense
it's<00:03:35.079> everyone's<00:03:35.859> giving<00:03:36.010> gas<00:03:36.370> hundred

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
it's everyone's giving gas hundred

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.569 
it's everyone's giving gas hundred
percent<00:03:37.390> tackling<00:03:38.109> fighting<00:03:38.650> for<00:03:39.160> 90<00:03:39.400> minutes

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
percent tackling fighting for 90 minutes

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.310 
percent tackling fighting for 90 minutes
I<00:03:39.850> think<00:03:40.150> that's<00:03:40.329> that's<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.049> big<00:03:41.200> difference

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
I think that's that's a big difference

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.990 
I think that's that's a big difference
and<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:41.769> hard<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.010> compare<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.459> level

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
and it's hard to compare the level

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.849 
and it's hard to compare the level
because<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> game<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:44.530> much<00:03:44.709> different

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
because the game is so much different

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.880 
because the game is so much different
which<00:03:45.609> I<00:03:45.700> played<00:03:45.910> with<00:03:46.030> your<00:03:46.209> Klinsmann<00:03:46.890> PDL

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
which I played with your Klinsmann PDL

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.620 
which I played with your Klinsmann PDL
and<00:03:48.359> that's<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.480> contact<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:51.299> he<00:03:52.299> has<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.420> lot

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
and that's a contact that he has a lot

even if a player's not drafted he can

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.640 
even if a player's not drafted he can
still<00:05:24.790> be<00:05:24.970> brought<00:05:25.150> into<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.390> team<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:25.900> it's<00:05:26.590> a
