the Ranger receives me the change

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.680

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
because it's already max but the stats

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.210 
because it's already max but the stats
the<00:03:51.900> luck<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.230> attack<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.650> stuff<00:03:52.860> go<00:03:53.069> up<00:03:53.129> a

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
the luck of the attack and stuff go up a

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.200 
the luck of the attack and stuff go up a
little<00:03:53.400> bit

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
little bit

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.870 
little bit
so<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.020> is<00:03:56.170> bless

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.430 

so<00:04:05.830> cameras<00:04:06.489> +<00:04:06.730> 30<00:04:07.000> attack<00:04:07.330> but<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.319> actually

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
so cameras + 30 attack but it actually

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.770 
so cameras + 30 attack but it actually
adds<00:04:08.680> quite<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.010> lot<00:04:09.160> more<00:04:09.400> because<00:04:09.550> I<00:04:09.790> have<00:04:09.970> in

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
my goal that was 15 k so that's but i'm

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.610 
my goal that was 15 k so that's but i'm
happy<00:04:20.850> with<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.180> golf<00:04:21.750> were<00:04:21.900> tight<00:04:22.079> was<00:04:22.259> 3k

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
happy with that golf were tight was 3k

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.659 
happy with that golf were tight was 3k
clean<00:04:22.919> slightly<00:04:23.910> shy<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.389> that<00:04:24.570> still<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.199> I'm

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
clean slightly shy of that still but I'm

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.060 
clean slightly shy of that still but I'm
close<00:04:26.669> enough<00:04:26.699> but<00:04:27.630> I'm<00:04:27.780> content<00:04:28.229> but<00:04:28.500> yeah<00:04:28.680> so

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
close enough but I'm content but yeah so

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.430 
close enough but I'm content but yeah so
that's<00:04:29.250> 12<00:04:29.490> nine<00:04:29.759> percent<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.270> then<00:04:31.199> twelve

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
that's 12 nine percent and then twelve

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.430 
that's 12 nine percent and then twelve
percent<00:04:31.650> attack<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:33.360> is<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.780> in<00:04:33.930> person<00:04:34.110> and

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
percent attack this is the in person and

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.620 
percent attack this is the in person and
then<00:04:34.650> thirty<00:04:34.889> percent<00:04:35.190> again<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.789> this<00:04:36.479> is

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
then thirty percent again and this is

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.080 
then thirty percent again and this is
just<00:04:36.660> twelve<00:04:37.110> percent<00:04:37.350> which<00:04:38.100> puts<00:04:38.340> me<00:04:38.430> at<00:04:38.550> 71

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
just twelve percent which puts me at 71

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.990 
just twelve percent which puts me at 71
percentile<00:04:39.600> which<00:04:40.039> is<00:04:41.039> pretty<00:04:41.310> with<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.639> hiss

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
percentile which is pretty with a hiss

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.909 
percentile which is pretty with a hiss
ideally<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:42.960> would<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.199> two<00:04:43.530> lines<00:04:43.740> of

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
ideally I would like two lines of

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.110 
ideally I would like two lines of
percent<00:04:44.190> attack<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.580> all<00:04:44.699> three<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.000> these

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
percent attack on all three of these

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.090 
percent attack on all three of these
barns<00:04:45.509> potential<00:04:45.960> but<00:04:46.259> if<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.800> have<00:04:46.949> ever

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
barns potential but if you have ever

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.070 
barns potential but if you have ever
cubes<00:04:47.460> legendary<00:04:47.940> bonus<00:04:48.240> potential<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.900> will

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
cubes legendary bonus potential you will

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.279 
cubes legendary bonus potential you will
know<00:04:49.199> why<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:49.710> just<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.639> dream<00:04:50.990> i'm<00:04:51.990> sure

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
know why that is just a dream i'm sure

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.460 
know why that is just a dream i'm sure
i'll<00:04:52.410> probably<00:04:52.650> do<00:04:52.919> it<00:04:52.949> eventually<00:04:53.100> but<00:04:53.850> i'm

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
i'll probably do it eventually but i'm

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.990 
i'll probably do it eventually but i'm
not<00:04:55.470> really<00:04:55.620> in<00:04:55.740> any<00:04:55.770> rush<00:04:56.039> for<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.430> now<00:04:56.580> i'm

there's<00:05:20.350> no<00:05:20.500> point<00:05:20.770> not<00:05:21.130> being<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.490> DB<00:05:21.850> because

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
there's no point not being a DB because

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.600 
there's no point not being a DB because
I<00:05:22.210> can't<00:05:22.509> even<00:05:22.690> use<00:05:22.870> them<00:05:23.130> so<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.160> decide<00:05:24.580> to

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
I can't even use them so I decide to

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.700 
I can't even use them so I decide to
change<00:05:24.880> back<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.539> will<00:05:26.110> be<00:05:26.169> doing<00:05:26.289> like<00:05:26.650> a

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
change back I will be doing like a

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.610 
change back I will be doing like a
comparison<00:05:27.520> or<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.270> talk<00:05:28.539> about<00:05:28.570> all<00:05:29.410> the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
comparison or I talk about all the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.860 
comparison or I talk about all the
different<00:05:29.650> types<00:05:30.070> of<00:05:30.220> Explorer<00:05:30.550> thieves<00:05:30.870> at

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
different types of Explorer thieves at

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.520 
different types of Explorer thieves at
some<00:05:32.110> point<00:05:32.320> thieves<00:05:32.740> not<00:05:33.190> thief's<00:05:34.530> probably

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
some point thieves not thief's probably
