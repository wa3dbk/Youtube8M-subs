00:03:46.160 --> 00:04:04.660 

about<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.550> would

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.720 

I<00:04:04.730> guess<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.420> was<00:04:05.840> just<00:04:06.110> trashed<00:04:06.470> in<00:04:06.800> here<00:04:07.069> we

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
I guess this was just trashed in here we

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.559 
I guess this was just trashed in here we
have<00:04:07.849> come<00:04:08.030> up<00:04:10.870> what<00:04:11.870> if<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:13.270> stick<00:04:14.270> a<00:04:14.300> hard

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
have come up what if I stick a hard

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.699 
have come up what if I stick a hard
plastic

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
plastic

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.770
