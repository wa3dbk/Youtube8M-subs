00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:02.350
 coach this video 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.169
 dedicated to building meta tags a for 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:06.500
 your site 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.689
 first a little theory 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.469
 Amit hotel attributes used both 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.819
 site design and component 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.629
 its program code 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.009
 but never placed in 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.869
 title page and contains a description 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.140
 page and all keywords 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.550
 author information command for 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.899
 search engines and so on that is 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.769
 service information and not 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.809
 interesting to site visitors but 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.230
 interesting search engines which 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.220
 use and for indexing and 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.960
 heading residue 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.600
 mind npf and what ml 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.420
 in this regard, we recommend there 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.060
 approach drawing up marks 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.010
 tags very seriously 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.620
 Now I will show you how it does it myself 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040
 after logging in, go to 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.580

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.870

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.650

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.290
 let's go section a penny and key 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.360
 the words 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.820
 and how was the page needed 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 first item heading or title 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.590
 what you write here will be 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.500
 shows the top of your browser chain

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.040

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.550
 keywords 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.890
 that is, you must specify with words by 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.500

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.900
 user search engines 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.500
 the list is separated by commas 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.880
 for example video such words 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.700
 finally last field description 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.780
 something like that 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.130
 if current text is not enough for you 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.799
