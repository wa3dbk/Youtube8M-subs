00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.330 
first time meeting in poland yes i think
is<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.110> first<00:02:01.319> time<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.830> i<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.220> not

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
is the first time and i think is not

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.130 
is the first time and i think is not
good<00:02:02.550> for<00:02:02.580> for<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.179> players<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> fans

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
good for for the players for the fans

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
good for for the players for the fans
and<00:02:04.440> full<00:02:05.069> football<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.580> general<00:02:05.700> i<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and full football in general i think is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.370 
and full football in general i think is
whether<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.810> maybe<00:02:07.550> do<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.380> next

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
whether you maybe do you think that next

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.559 
whether you maybe do you think that next
measures<00:02:10.709> will<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.130> more<00:02:11.790> important<00:02:12.269> for<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.860 
or for teens because you can take three
points<00:02:16.410> not<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.250> half<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:18.660> the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
describe opponent like a boss I think

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.350 
describe opponent like a boss I think
that<00:03:57.030> your<00:03:58.030> team<00:03:58.590> were<00:03:59.590> playing<00:04:00.190> better<00:04:01.030> today

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
that your team were playing better today

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.660 
that your team were playing better today
yes<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:01.930> think<00:04:02.049> we<00:04:02.230> were<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.410> much<00:04:03.069> better<00:04:03.340> team

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
yes I think we were a much better team

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.570 
yes I think we were a much better team
much<00:04:04.000> we<00:04:04.420> play<00:04:04.600> much<00:04:05.080> better<00:04:05.230> than<00:04:05.470> them<00:04:05.709> but

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
much we play much better than them but

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.880 
much we play much better than them but
some<00:04:06.910> sometimes<00:04:07.630> of<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.410> game<00:04:08.590> they<00:04:08.739> have

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
some sometimes of of the game they have

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.039 
some sometimes of of the game they have
their<00:04:09.160> chances<00:04:09.489> as<00:04:09.640> well<00:04:09.819> but<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.660> think<00:04:10.750> we

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
their chances as well but I think we

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.530 
their chances as well but I think we
have<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.470> check<00:04:12.160> clear<00:04:12.400> chances<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.120> score<00:04:13.239> as

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
have to check clear chances to score as

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.300 
have to check clear chances to score as

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
well my didn't score but I think was a

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.710 
well my didn't score but I think was a
good<00:04:15.519> matches<00:04:15.820> for<00:04:15.850> defendants<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.630> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
good matches for defendants for the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.750 
good matches for defendants for the
people<00:04:16.989> who<00:04:17.019> was<00:04:17.260> outside<00:04:17.519> seeing<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.609> game
