00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.660
 of the changes made from

 steven in detail that the game includes 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 an artificial intelligence without equal 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.589
 where the 22 players in the field 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.109
 they react emotionally to every action 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.780
 and they take into account short and 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.089
 long term between sandwiches and some 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 beers we had the opportunity to 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.739
 try for ourselves this new 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 game in addition to listening to the news 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.819
 of some brand partners that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.519
 attended the event this time we are 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.740
 bringing the fans for the first time a 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.410
 product 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.520
 it's a game experience based on the 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.380
 architecture of a console last 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.330
 generation of course I'm talking 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.670
 of playstation 4 as you know 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.740
 Playstation 4 has a power without 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.540
 profound precedents 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.400
 social and also has functions 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.100
 exclusive that will undoubtedly enrich 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.780
 the fifa 15 experience like never the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.670
 you had lived but really this guy 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.620
 of things that the video game is one of 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.960
 the most used video games in the world 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.700
 for the Mexicans and for the fans of 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.130
 Mexican soccer that are out because 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.030
 our matches go through 77 countries 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.920
 so I think you have to say it and that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.600
 it must be said because it has generated us 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.090
 that the game for Mexico every time 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.250
 better of course we could talk 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.979
 also with our host roberto 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.810
 Canovas who gave us more details about 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.060
 the launch work with different 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.580
 athletes sometimes it's not easy I think 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.440
 easy sometimes we have to see the product 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.910
 end where there are smiling faces and people 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.920
 cooperating but we have had 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.630
 very difficult experiences I have to 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.790
 admit that working with Javier and with his 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.170
 team has been a delight since 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.270
 we started working with them it was noticed 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.030
 the opening was noticed the provision for 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.800
 to work 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.540
 understand ideas to create to throw out 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.340
 walking cute things that was an incentive 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.830
 important to continue working with him 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.500
 a very important element that will highlight 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.750
 this season is every detail of both 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.780
 the players like the hobby inside 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.390
 of the game because the batons celebrations 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.760
 or boos will be like the real ones 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.770
 recreating the facial gestures and 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.890
 bodily of each one of the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.290
