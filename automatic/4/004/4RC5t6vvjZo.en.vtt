00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you know and like that but like I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
you know and like that but like I
think<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:17.939> helped<00:01:18.180> me<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.450> I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
think it really helped me because I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:40.340 
think it really helped me because I
taught<00:01:19.500> me<00:01:19.619> how<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> read<00:01:19.920> crowds

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.640 

that's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.980> very<00:01:42.020> important<00:01:43.020> part<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> DJing

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
that's a very important part of DJing

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.620 
that's a very important part of DJing
and<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.190> think<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.550> lost<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> lot<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.180> kids

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and I think it's lost on a lot of kids

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
and I think it's lost on a lot of kids
that<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.440> plucked<00:01:46.920> from

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that you know just get plucked from

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.500 
that you know just get plucked from
obscurity<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:47.850> end<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.120> on<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.330> main

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
obscurity and then end up on the main

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.570 
obscurity and then end up on the main
stage<00:01:48.690> of<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.870> festival<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.830> kind<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.280> lose
