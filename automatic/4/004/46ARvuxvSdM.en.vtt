00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
night which I'm kind of skeptical about

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
night which I'm kind of skeptical about
because<00:01:07.230> they<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.800> no<00:01:08.340> online<00:01:08.790> multiplayer

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
because they have no online multiplayer

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.200 
because they have no online multiplayer
but<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.710> developers<00:01:10.860> did<00:01:11.430> say<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.940> they

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
but the developers did say that they

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
but the developers did say that they
would<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.450> looking<00:01:13.170> forward<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> patching<00:01:13.980> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
would be looking forward to patching it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.550 
would be looking forward to patching it
in<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.400> future<00:01:16.190> next<00:01:17.190> thing<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.430> bought<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
in the future next thing I bought was a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.240 
in the future next thing I bought was a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
crystal case which looks pretty neat you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.300 
crystal case which looks pretty neat you
can<00:01:26.360> see<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.510> picture<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.830> there's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
can see the picture on the back there's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
can see the picture on the back there's
a<00:01:29.370> spots<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.060> game<00:01:30.270> its<00:01:30.659> spots<00:01:30.900> your

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
a spots for your game its spots your

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.100 
a spots for your game its spots your
Vita<00:01:31.409> looks<00:01:31.800> like<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.510> got<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.630> holes<00:01:33.960> for

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
Vita looks like it's got the holes for

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.600 
Vita looks like it's got the holes for
your<00:01:34.380> nub<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.830> they<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:35.100> rub<00:01:35.250> against

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
your nub so they don't rub against

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.180 
your nub so they don't rub against
anything<00:01:36.050> let's<00:01:37.050> open<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.830> see<00:01:38.040> what

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
anything let's open that up and see what

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:46.399 
anything let's open that up and see what
it's<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:41.240> alright<00:01:44.030> comes<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.409> basically

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
it's like alright comes in basically

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.100 
it's like alright comes in basically
nothing

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.810 

these<00:01:53.110> are<00:01:53.500> what<00:01:53.829> I'm<00:01:53.979> assuming<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.549> the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
these are what I'm assuming is the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.450 
these are what I'm assuming is the
custom<00:01:55.329> part<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:55.750> crystal<00:01:56.140> case<00:01:56.290> it<00:01:57.220> comes

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
custom part of the crystal case it comes

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.800 
custom part of the crystal case it comes
with<00:01:57.759> different<00:01:59.640> covers<00:02:00.640> for<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:01.119> like<00:02:01.270> if<00:02:01.689> you

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
with different covers for it like if you

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.620 
with different covers for it like if you
wanted<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.439> could<00:02:02.560> have<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:03.390> wipe<00:02:04.390> out

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
wanted to you could have a wipe out

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.699 
wanted to you could have a wipe out
front<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.229> back<00:02:05.439> cover<00:02:05.830> for<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:07.530> right<00:02:08.530> now

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
front and back cover for it right now

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.130 
front and back cover for it right now
it's<00:02:09.009> comes<00:02:09.729> with<00:02:10.119> little<00:02:10.539> deviants<00:02:10.959> in<00:02:11.050> the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
it's comes with little deviants in the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.390 
it's comes with little deviants in the
front<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.620> then<00:02:12.489> on<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.670> back<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.069> just

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
front and then on the back so you just

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.540 
front and then on the back so you just
replace<00:02:15.730> those<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.540> then<00:02:16.690> a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
replace those of that and then a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.130 
replace those of that and then a
PlayStation<00:02:18.550> Vita<00:02:18.790> one<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:19.390> there<00:02:19.780> seems<00:02:19.989> to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
with me and there looks like there's one

to eight slots for Vita games and two

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.250 
to eight slots for Vita games and two
slots<00:03:02.859> for<00:03:03.100> your<00:03:03.299> network<00:03:04.299> cards<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.019> then<00:03:05.079> up

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
slots for your network cards and then up

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.050 
slots for your network cards and then up
there<00:03:05.440> they<00:03:05.620> have<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.980> like<00:03:06.549> I<00:03:06.700> said<00:03:06.760> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
there they have the like I said the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.420 
there they have the like I said the
spots<00:03:07.299> for<00:03:07.480> your<00:03:07.600> nub<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.019> they<00:03:08.109> don't<00:03:08.430> get

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
spots for your nub so they don't get

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.800 
spots for your nub so they don't get
bent<00:03:09.700> out<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.000> shape<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.600> everything<00:03:11.549> pop

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.250 

that<00:03:16.810> off<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:18.160> have<00:03:18.340> your<00:03:19.260> little

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
that off and you have your little

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.380 
that off and you have your little
deviants<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:20.980> then<00:03:21.100> it's<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.640> glass<00:03:22.120> case

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
deviants and then it's just a glass case

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.000 
deviants and then it's just a glass case
so<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.660> guess<00:03:22.840> if<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.079> really<00:03:23.260> wanted<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.620> you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
so I guess if you really wanted to you

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.270 
so I guess if you really wanted to you
could<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:24.790> have<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.120> be<00:03:25.410> solid<00:03:26.410> black<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:27.190> you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
could just have it be solid black if you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.430 
could just have it be solid black if you
put<00:03:27.489> that<00:03:27.640> k<00:03:27.940> /<00:03:28.090> back<00:03:28.269> in<00:03:30.660> but<00:03:31.660> for<00:03:31.900> now<00:03:32.019> until<00:03:32.410> I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
put that k / back in but for now until I

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.340 
put that k / back in but for now until I
print<00:03:32.829> out<00:03:32.980> my<00:03:33.970> own<00:03:34.239> I'm<00:03:34.540> just<00:03:34.720> gonna<00:03:34.840> leave<00:03:35.079> it

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
print out my own I'm just gonna leave it

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.780 
print out my own I'm just gonna leave it
with<00:03:36.810> little<00:03:37.810> deviants<00:03:38.650> which<00:03:41.609> yeah<00:03:42.609> that's

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
with little deviants which yeah that's

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.059 
with little deviants which yeah that's
right

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
right

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.949 
right
looks<00:03:44.700> like<00:03:44.879> it<00:03:44.999> could<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.209> an<00:03:45.420> interesting

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
looks like it could be an interesting

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.289 
looks like it could be an interesting
game<00:03:46.650> easy<00:03:47.129> enough<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.519> pull<00:03:47.790> back<00:03:47.969> and<00:03:48.150> they

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
game easy enough to pull back and they

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.319 
game easy enough to pull back and they
pop<00:03:48.510> out<00:03:48.689> pretty<00:03:48.959> easily<00:03:49.170> just<00:03:49.499> have<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:50.329> my

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
which does have to make me worry a

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.809 
which does have to make me worry a
little<00:04:10.379> bit<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.739> after<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> while<00:04:11.129> to<00:04:11.519> kind<00:04:11.669> of

little bit that after a while to kind of
bent<00:04:12.000> out<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.180> shape<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:12.719> wouldn't<00:04:12.930> exactly

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
bent out of shape it wouldn't exactly

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.240 
bent out of shape it wouldn't exactly
hold<00:04:14.069> in<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:14.519> there<00:04:14.669> are<00:04:15.410> little<00:04:16.410> tiny<00:04:16.829> knobs

that eclipse on to know something else

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.900 
that eclipse on to know something else
in<00:04:22.949> there<00:04:24.289> this<00:04:25.289> looks<00:04:25.530> like<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.919> instruction

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
in there this looks like the instruction

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.710 
in there this looks like the instruction
manual<00:04:29.630> what<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.900> do<00:04:31.020> what<00:04:31.229> not<00:04:31.289> to<00:04:31.470> do<00:04:31.740> and

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
manual what to do what not to do and

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.379 
manual what to do what not to do and
that's<00:04:33.720> interesting<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.470> has<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:35.389> two-year

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
that's interesting it has a two-year

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.170 
that's interesting it has a two-year
limited<00:04:36.870> warranty<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.560> that's<00:04:37.880> it's<00:04:38.880> actually

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
limited warranty so that's it's actually

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.890 
limited warranty so that's it's actually
nice<00:04:39.330> for<00:04:39.599> case<00:04:39.780> especially<00:04:40.620> if<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.900> somehow

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
nice for case especially if it somehow

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.589 
nice for case especially if it somehow
breaks<00:04:43.349> it's<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:43.889> nice<00:04:44.190> it's<00:04:44.639> definitely<00:04:45.030> solid

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
breaks it's a nice it's definitely solid

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.490 
breaks it's a nice it's definitely solid
but<00:04:46.289> it's<00:04:46.410> just<00:04:46.590> plastic<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.220> might<00:04:47.460> if<00:04:47.729> you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
but it's just plastic so might if you

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.399 
but it's just plastic so might if you
insides<00:04:49.500> rubberized<00:04:50.039> but<00:04:50.659> if<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.960> plastic

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
insides rubberized but if the plastic

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.520 
insides rubberized but if the plastic
itself<00:04:52.680> might<00:04:52.949> crack<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:54.289> send<00:04:55.289> it<00:04:55.380> back<00:04:55.470> and

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
itself might crack and send it back and

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.689 
itself might crack and send it back and
it's<00:04:55.770> getting<00:04:55.889> new<00:04:56.009> one<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.220> have<00:04:56.310> two<00:04:56.460> years

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
it's getting new one you have two years

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.480 
it's getting new one you have two years
so<00:04:56.849> that's<00:04:56.940> pretty<00:04:57.180> nice<00:04:57.389> and<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:59.130> final

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
so that's pretty nice and the final

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.730 
so that's pretty nice and the final
thing<00:04:59.909> I<00:05:00.180> bought<00:05:00.389> it<00:05:00.780> was<00:05:00.960> actually<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.530> last

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
thing I bought it was actually the last

other<00:05:50.520> things<00:05:50.820> to<00:05:51.120> compare<00:05:51.840> sizes<00:05:52.580> here's<00:05:53.580> my

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
other things to compare sizes here's my

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.410

exactly<00:06:17.980> the<00:06:18.880> video<00:06:19.150> card<00:06:19.360> is<00:06:19.540> just<00:06:19.600> more

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
exactly the video card is just more

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.140 
exactly the video card is just more
square<00:06:20.950> this<00:06:21.190> one<00:06:21.400> kind<00:06:21.610> of<00:06:21.700> cuts<00:06:21.880> in<00:06:22.030> on<00:06:22.090> the

square this one kind of cuts in on the

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.650 
square this one kind of cuts in on the
side<00:06:22.420> the<00:06:22.660> video<00:06:22.870> card<00:06:23.080> is<00:06:23.110> completely<00:06:23.590> square

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
side the video card is completely square

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.310 
side the video card is completely square
but<00:06:25.660> the<00:06:25.780> backs<00:06:26.020> are<00:06:26.350> a<00:06:26.800> little<00:06:27.190> different<00:06:28.320> all

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
but the backs are a little different all

tailoring<00:06:31.420> memory<00:06:31.720> cards<00:06:32.140> and<00:06:32.580> compared<00:06:33.580> to<00:06:33.760> a

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
tailoring memory cards and compared to a

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.670 
tailoring memory cards and compared to a
penny<00:06:34.120> it<00:06:34.390> is<00:06:36.960> if<00:06:37.960> you<00:06:38.110> draw<00:06:38.260> a<00:06:38.290> square<00:06:38.500> on<00:06:38.620> the

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
penny it is if you draw a square on the

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.260 
penny it is if you draw a square on the
penny<00:06:38.890> it's<00:06:39.070> a<00:06:39.190> square<00:06:39.630> so<00:06:40.630> it<00:06:40.720> is<00:06:40.810> about<00:06:42.270> the

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
penny it's a square so it is about the

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.830 
penny it's a square so it is about the
size<00:06:43.480> of<00:06:43.900> a<00:06:44.140> penny<00:06:44.380> so<00:06:44.920> hopefully<00:06:45.460> I<00:06:45.840> don't

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
size of a penny so hopefully I don't

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.420 
size of a penny so hopefully I don't
lose<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.050> again<00:06:47.320> like<00:06:47.650> I<00:06:47.740> just<00:06:47.950> dropped<00:06:48.160> on<00:06:48.340> the

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
lose it again like I just dropped on the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.250 
lose it again like I just dropped on the
floor<00:06:48.460> it's<00:06:48.850> going<00:06:49.000> to<00:06:49.060> go<00:06:49.150> right<00:06:49.300> in<00:06:49.510> my<00:06:50.050> case

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
floor it's going to go right in my case

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.100
