fascinating now cutting things at an

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.810 
fascinating now cutting things at an
airfield<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.619> you'll<00:00:19.770> have<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.100> excuse<00:00:20.520> the

airfield so you'll have to excuse the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.070 
airfield so you'll have to excuse the
width<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.210> background<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:21.810> sorry

but<00:00:22.289> we're<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> take<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> look<00:00:23.189> at<00:00:23.310> this

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
but we're going to take a look at this

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.810 
but we're going to take a look at this
a<00:00:23.779> CCX<00:00:27.740> this<00:00:28.740> particular<00:00:29.070> car<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:29.699> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
a CCX this particular car then is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490 
a CCX this particular car then is
right-hand-drive<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.019> theory<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.470> should

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
right-hand-drive so in theory it should

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
right-hand-drive so in theory it should
be<00:00:31.740> pretty<00:00:31.890> easy<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.579> me<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.850> that's<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.149> I'm

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.360 
be pretty easy for me as that's what I'm
used<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.630> we're<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> take<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.829> over<00:00:35.219> now

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
