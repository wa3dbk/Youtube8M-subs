00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.519 
hello guys in this video we'll be
talking<00:00:05.549> about<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.569> different<00:00:06.839> reactions<00:00:07.170> of

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
talking about the different reactions of

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.700 
talking about the different reactions of
the<00:00:07.680> sidechick<00:00:08.040> acid<00:00:08.400> cycle<00:00:09.019> now<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.080> can<00:00:10.500> see

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
the sidechick acid cycle now we can see

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.860 
the sidechick acid cycle now we can see
here<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.340> complex<00:00:11.790> process<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.240> cyclic<00:00:12.599> acid
