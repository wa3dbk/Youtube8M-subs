one of the strengths of the Brighton

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.490 
one of the strengths of the Brighton
course<00:00:09.550> is<00:00:09.940> the<00:00:10.360> model<00:00:10.719> that<00:00:10.750> we<00:00:11.139> use<00:00:11.320> the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
course is the model that we use the

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.790 
course is the model that we use the
practice<00:00:11.680> placement<00:00:12.430> we<00:00:13.360> rather<00:00:14.230> than<00:00:14.530> having

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
practice placement we rather than having

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.100 
practice placement we rather than having
students<00:00:15.220> out<00:00:15.309> on<00:00:15.340> block<00:00:15.640> placement<00:00:16.270> we<00:00:16.599> send

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
students out on block placement we send

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.620 
students out on block placement we send
them<00:00:17.230> out<00:00:17.320> on<00:00:17.470> placement<00:00:17.619> each<00:00:18.220> week<00:00:18.520> and<00:00:19.300> what

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
them out on placement each week and what

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.630 
them out on placement each week and what
that<00:00:19.810> does<00:00:20.020> is<00:00:20.290> it<00:00:20.410> enables<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.919> student<00:00:21.340> both

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
that does is it enables the student both

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.390 
that does is it enables the student both

nature<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.619> course<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.790> across<00:00:34.300> the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
nature of the course is that across the

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.389 
nature of the course is that across the
three<00:00:34.660> years<00:00:34.899> we<00:00:35.739> ask<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.040> students<00:00:36.309> to

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
three years we ask the students to

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.650 
three years we ask the students to
become<00:00:36.520> more<00:00:36.850> independent<00:00:37.150> in<00:00:37.510> their

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
become more independent in their

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.990 
become more independent in their
learning<00:00:37.810> so<00:00:38.560> in<00:00:38.710> year<00:00:38.860> one<00:00:39.070> all<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.880> modules

the sisters support outside there's a

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.780 
the sisters support outside there's a
virtual<00:00:44.680> learning<00:00:44.920> environment<00:00:45.520> where<00:00:45.610> they

about<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.590> corpse<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.250> would<00:02:01.490> say<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.940> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
about the corpse I would say is the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.530 
about the corpse I would say is the
arrangement<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.140> lectures<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.190> practice<00:02:04.940> we

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
arrangement of lectures and practice we

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.350 
arrangement of lectures and practice we
do<00:02:05.780> lectures<00:02:06.050> each<00:02:06.410> week<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.490> we<00:02:08.030> do<00:02:08.150> practice

to talk to someone in the classroom
you've<00:03:26.480> got<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.690> do<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.380> by<00:03:27.560> actually<00:03:28.100> doing<00:03:28.340> it

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
you've got to do it by actually doing it

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.699 
you've got to do it by actually doing it
out<00:03:28.880> at<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.150> general<00:03:29.510> public<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.470> think

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
out at the general public and I think

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.840 
out at the general public and I think
it's<00:03:30.830> probably<00:03:30.920> one<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.340> most<00:03:31.459> important

it's probably one of the most important

a<00:03:36.560> week<00:03:36.770> is<00:03:37.100> really<00:03:37.489> good<00:03:38.170> experience<00:03:39.170> in

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
a week is really good experience in

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
I come and see what the facilities

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.700 
I come and see what the facilities
because<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:51.630> campus<00:03:52.020> that<00:03:52.170> we're<00:03:52.290> on<00:03:52.440> and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
because the campus that we're on and

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.680 
because the campus that we're on and
particularly<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.550> simulated<00:03:54.210> flat<00:03:54.540> are

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
particularly the simulated flat are

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.660 
particularly the simulated flat are
really<00:03:54.930> good<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.260> see<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.680> not<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.460> lot<00:03:56.610> of

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
other units have them so if you see

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.700 
other units have them so if you see
yourself<00:04:00.630> as<00:04:01.050> somebody<00:04:01.290> who<00:04:01.740> is<00:04:02.400> inspired<00:04:02.910> to
