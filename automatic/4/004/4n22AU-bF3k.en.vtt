00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.530
 yes what is going on there again and have 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.830
 of it the bares pull and we give 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.359
 today again pvp tips against teams and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.789
 yes, in the background, by the way 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.140
 nice gimmick 15 kills in seven 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.359
 minutes so horner he is right 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.880
 gone and you have to say for one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.490
 24 hsg round he actually has the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 Most kills are made we show 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.960
 celebrate with the first tip and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.790
 Although how to pretend against teams , well 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.800
 usually jump into the water with it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.660
 to get away from them and then 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.460
 with arrow and bow just find one 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.559
 So we have only special ones 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
 Things are sometimes when the items are off 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.280
 one does not have one and thus one 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.960
 point into the water and then you can 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.719
 Most sissi wegklatschen because the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 most have not part and bow or 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.129
 can not handle it so not 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.690
 can handle and with you of course 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.609
 also in the advantage if you swim from it 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.770
 want or something and yes that was it 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.140
 actually with the first one there we come 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.640
 the second tip is best if he 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.700
 have a lighter with you that you know about it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.560
 then run with the lighter the ground 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 The opponents are almost on fire themselves 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.830
 then maybe rhine and the burn 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.240
 then take it with you and see 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.250
 maybe off or I have the chance 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.659
 that you are the Germans we can 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.159
 namely then with their first time 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.420
 weakened and can not do so well 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.340
 not only so good to beat 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.740
 waves and so gets a recoil from the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 fire and so lighter is really 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.650
 an important tip in pvp situations 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.150
 just burn your opponents 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.100
 it is much easier that way 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 winning procedure and is important 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.250
 do not go immediately if the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.750
 burn the lose therefore currently 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.210
 Always live so guess them 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.579
 burned out and so and then on it 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.409
 know his tip number three to away 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.420
 and somebody might find himself 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.340
 so I could like that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.350
 Most of them are gone as long as I have 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.860
 one more lake then if i have the team also 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.840
 down 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.640
 then the team goes it's on it 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.170
 the hut a few times and then go 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.030
 me and the team around klaus stony away 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.450
 because they do not have much heart 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.649
 to have 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.180
 and so it's easier and yes man 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.160
 is actually relatively often a 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.440
 opponents have to be said 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.510
 then we come to the 4 this is the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.250
 juno tactics if you like the branches 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.600
 Of course, after looking up to the some 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.850
 he has a little weaker armor 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.470
 You can give it to one or two children 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.180
 further away is just turn 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.970
 um and attacks the against after full 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 I knew I tried to kill him right away 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.360
 yes maybe you'll press that 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.650
 others against 23 hearts down but 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.300
 I still have the chance to run away 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.010
 and you may still be able to do so in others 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.090
 Escape or rain there again 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.340
 and even clap 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.020
 So just make jolo tactics with me 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.910
 choose weaker opponents and the 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.470
 gossip and then try 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.700
 run away before the second one comes or 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.340
 perhaps you can both be dead 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.530
 The next clocks he claps 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.020
 his politics is just that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.210
 run away from jump'n'run parcours 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.220
 there is for example a recorded park 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.750
 lily pads where he run over it 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.160
 if you have good jump'n'run skills 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.510
 Of course you always can 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
 try to run away like that 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.270
 most fall down then 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.030
 water or something like that then maybe 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.070
 still with arrow and bow the clap 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.060
 and yes , that's actually politics 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.040
 So then we come to the sixth tip 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.870
 Just place it if you're not doing it 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 they on the ground it can not be 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.540
 that the opponents a bit through it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.890
 first time be harmed or too much 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.540
 then they have fear and then show yes 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.010
 I stop or at least win 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.660
 time that the greeks just keep going 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.730
 fall back once have the chance 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.380
 to stop to stimulate shortly before 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.000
 Keep it running and you might have 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.930
 then the chance ends the one 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.390
 or to clap others 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.760
 Sun and now typed number 7 if you 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.500
 only with half the hunger had and 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.750
 a cake was there then sat first 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.820
 then one and not earlier if you are 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.500
 you only lack a hunger source because 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.180
 then you can take the whole cake away 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.130
 the opponents eat through the teams 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.170
 I do not pursue you kids do not eat 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.910
 and have to stop to get back in 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.660
 to eat steak and so and then you can 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.160
 faster people run away 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.810
 then we get to number eight 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.760
 if for example a building at 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.810
 Children are just trying for that 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.430
 to walk around building maybe 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.500
 the opponents would have been up and thinking 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.060
 The one thinks fast now the 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.920
 away from the wants to shorten in the way then 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.120
 have you separated the opponents and then 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.680
 Maybe you have the chance to do that 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.840
 one against alone meets that he the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.220
 can clap and yes really one 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.050
 important tip the opponents try 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.250
 mostly a sinti of my followers 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.780
 to shorten away 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.900
 rheine runs and the direction of the other 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.370
 the and with it 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.139
 the possibility that I the area 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.900
 Run and there are only one against 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.240
 opponent must fight and so tip number 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.970
 9 you can with the cake so if the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.100
 race with you have blocked with doors 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.720
 that is when the jury run directly 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.310
 running and about it a blog is then 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.139
 cake can not sit there then 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.419
 by jumping and you can then do it 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.220
 just clap and better still at 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.930
 an iron door with only one button 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.000
 then it does not come anymore 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.009
 Out in the reason there are a few spots 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.570
 on the whole maps and is actually 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.220
 a really good tactic has one at 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.990
 and even used me 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.680
 times gone purely so I say so have 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.780
 do not go in 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.010
 if you stay in step I go 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.280
 one gossips the way right bittere 1 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.699
 then we succeed to tap or 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.320
 10 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.760
 if he cobweb for example here 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.260
 you can have with the cobwebs 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.180
 also block important ways or 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.949
 maybe even lock up the opponents 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.210
 The interest in it then gets stuck 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.580
 might be able to team up with others 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.470
 clap off and later on 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.690
 to the cobweb and yes 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.849
 really right tip cobweb are 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.010
 always meaningful is also optimally stressed 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.800
 Just use the doors 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.849
 glue door with two tips and then 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.070
 they do not come so fast anymore 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.990
 purely and yes I would say that was it 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.490
 again from the pvp tips against teams 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.630
 Water could do the best if 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.130
 you drove the episode again and again 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.780
 syringe all directions lay button on 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.440
 and we say it from our side 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.440
 Until next time
