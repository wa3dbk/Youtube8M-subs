00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
play series and now we can tell ships to

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.160 
play series and now we can tell ships to
go<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.160> certain<00:01:42.790> sectors<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.420> wait<00:01:43.660> hold

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
so you can follow around ships but I

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.750 
so you can follow around ships but I
also<00:01:53.020> believe<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.890> auto<00:01:54.160> pilot<00:01:54.430> to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760

losing<00:02:21.320> your<00:02:21.440> shields<00:02:21.920> very<00:02:22.220> rapidly<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:23.000> think

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
losing your shields very rapidly I think

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.050 
losing your shields very rapidly I think
this<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> much<00:02:24.320> better<00:02:24.920> approach<00:02:25.580> than<00:02:25.910> what

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
this is a much better approach than what

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.949 
this is a much better approach than what
they<00:02:26.180> had<00:02:26.390> before<00:02:28.270> personally<00:02:29.270> I'm<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> huge

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
the skunk a jump drive and I would like

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.850

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
to see some official version of that in

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.040 
to see some official version of that in
the<00:02:37.010> game<00:02:37.250> but<00:02:37.850> this<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.270> still<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> step<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:38.959> a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the game but this is still a step in a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:53.199 
the game but this is still a step in a
good<00:02:39.230> direction<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:52.130> no<00:02:52.459> longer<00:02:52.760> need<00:02:53.180> to

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
good direction you no longer need to

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.170 
good direction you no longer need to
dock<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.870> stations<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.890> complete<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.580> lot<00:02:55.970> of

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
dock to stations to complete a lot of

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.280 
dock to stations to complete a lot of
tasks<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.530> now<00:02:57.860> hire<00:02:58.370> crew<00:02:58.910> from<00:02:59.660> inside

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
of a communications menu and they'll fly

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.479

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
over and dock to your ship and get

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.400 
over and dock to your ship and get
aboard<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.850> skunk<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.510> later<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.380> can

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
aboard the skunk and later you can

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.620 
aboard the skunk and later you can
actually<00:03:06.770> put<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:07.250> person<00:03:07.640> aboard<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:08.120> ship

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
actually put that person aboard a ship

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.430 
actually put that person aboard a ship
or<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.900> station<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:14.600> things<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.019> upgrading

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
or a station for things like upgrading

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.949 
or a station for things like upgrading
your<00:03:15.830> ship's<00:03:16.160> weapons<00:03:16.430> systems<00:03:17.060> or<00:03:17.330> shields<00:03:17.870> I

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
your ship's weapons systems or shields I

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.500 
your ship's weapons systems or shields I
believe<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.620> still<00:03:18.680> have<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.400> dock<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.060> that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
believe you still have to dock and that

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.530 
believe you still have to dock and that
makes<00:03:20.810> sense

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.020 

this<00:03:28.540> may<00:03:28.780> not<00:03:28.959> be<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.170> new<00:03:29.500> feature<00:03:29.769> for<00:03:30.030> 2.0

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
this may not be a new feature for 2.0

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.900 
this may not be a new feature for 2.0
but<00:03:31.599> I<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:32.230> noticed<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.800> so<00:03:33.099> you<00:03:33.670> can

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
but I just noticed it so you can

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.449 
but I just noticed it so you can
actually<00:03:34.150> change<00:03:34.720> your<00:03:34.959> center<00:03:35.830> console<00:03:36.220> HUD

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
actually change your center console HUD

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.729 
actually change your center console HUD
to<00:03:36.670> show<00:03:36.940> up<00:03:37.060> on<00:03:37.180> your<00:03:37.330> main<00:03:37.569> screen<00:03:37.870> instead

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
to show up on your main screen instead

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.009 
to show up on your main screen instead
of<00:03:38.860> looking<00:03:39.220> over<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:40.300> kind<00:03:40.569> of<00:03:40.660> like<00:03:40.840> this

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
of looking over and I kind of like this

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.960 
of looking over and I kind of like this
but<00:03:41.290> in<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.620> patch<00:03:41.830> notes<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.400> was<00:03:42.519> mentioned

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
but in the patch notes it was mentioned

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.789 
but in the patch notes it was mentioned
that<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.209> can<00:03:43.330> have<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> full-screen<00:03:44.379> HUD<00:03:46.799> the

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
that you can have a full-screen HUD the

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.400 
that you can have a full-screen HUD the
MFD<00:03:48.370> panel<00:03:48.790> in<00:03:48.879> 2.0<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.660> much<00:03:50.140> better

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
MFD panel in 2.0 is much better

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.460 
MFD panel in 2.0 is much better

of<00:05:30.300> these<00:05:30.570> new<00:05:30.840> cockpits<00:05:31.380> on<00:05:31.560> your<00:05:31.770> skunk<00:05:32.300> this

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
of these new cockpits on your skunk this

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.900 
of these new cockpits on your skunk this
was<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.810> great<00:05:34.380> move<00:05:34.620> by<00:05:34.890> Egosoft<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:35.820> i'm

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
was a great move by Egosoft and i'm

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.940 
was a great move by Egosoft and i'm
really<00:05:36.210> happy<00:05:36.510> that<00:05:36.750> i<00:05:36.960> can<00:05:37.020> swap<00:05:37.500> out<00:05:37.740> the

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
really happy that i can swap out the

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.320 
really happy that i can swap out the
different<00:05:38.280> cockpits<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:38.910> just<00:05:39.120> try

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
different cockpits and just try

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.750 
different cockpits and just try
different<00:05:39.390> things<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:40.350> I<00:05:40.919> especially<00:05:41.220> like<00:05:41.730> I

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
different things and I especially like I

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.060 
different things and I especially like I
said<00:05:42.030> earlier<00:05:42.419> like<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:43.140> mercenary<00:05:43.590> cockpit

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
said earlier like the mercenary cockpit

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.380 
said earlier like the mercenary cockpit
and<00:05:44.160> I'll<00:05:44.250> probably<00:05:44.430> be<00:05:44.760> using<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:45.180> one

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
and I'll probably be using that one

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.320 
and I'll probably be using that one
quite<00:05:46.110> a<00:05:46.169> bit<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:47.550> pricing<00:05:48.000> for<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.210> new

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
quite a bit the pricing for the new

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.719 
quite a bit the pricing for the new
cockpit<00:05:48.840> is<00:05:49.080> pretty<00:05:49.710> cheap<00:05:50.010> actually<00:05:50.340> like

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
cockpit is pretty cheap actually like

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.260 
cockpit is pretty cheap actually like
5060<00:05:51.419> thousand<00:05:52.110> which<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.620> guess<00:05:52.830> is<00:05:53.010> fine<00:05:53.310> but

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
5060 thousand which I guess is fine but

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.640 
5060 thousand which I guess is fine but
I<00:05:54.300> just<00:05:54.570> like<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:54.930> fact<00:05:55.169> that<00:05:55.260> you<00:05:55.380> have<00:05:55.530> the

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
I just like the fact that you have the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.190 
I just like the fact that you have the
option<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:56.340> just<00:05:56.550> change<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.510> cockpits<00:05:58.020> at

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
option to just change the cockpits at

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.990 
option to just change the cockpits at
will<00:05:58.500> good<00:05:59.130> job<00:05:59.520> Egosoft

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.370 

so<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:06.090> know<00:06:06.300> that<00:06:06.479> thing<00:06:06.660> I'm<00:06:06.870> always<00:06:07.020> doing

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
so you know that thing I'm always doing

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.050 
so you know that thing I'm always doing
an<00:06:07.500> X<00:06:07.650> rebirth<00:06:07.860> where<00:06:08.280> I'm<00:06:08.370> always<00:06:08.610> running

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
an X rebirth where I'm always running

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.150 
an X rebirth where I'm always running
into<00:06:09.180> ships<00:06:09.540> and<00:06:09.750> stations<00:06:09.930> well<00:06:10.650> now<00:06:10.860> it<00:06:11.010> has

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
into ships and stations well now it has

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.219 
into ships and stations well now it has
consequences<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.180> your<00:06:12.330> shields<00:06:12.750> will<00:06:12.990> get

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
consequences and your shields will get

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.000 
consequences and your shields will get
damaged<00:06:13.710> as<00:06:14.360> if<00:06:15.360> X<00:06:15.660> rebirth<00:06:15.900> didn't<00:06:16.530> look<00:06:16.740> good

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
damaged as if X rebirth didn't look good

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.340 
damaged as if X rebirth didn't look good
enough<00:06:17.370> it<00:06:17.640> got<00:06:17.760> a<00:06:17.789> few<00:06:18.300> upgrades<00:06:18.539> in<00:06:19.110> the

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
enough it got a few upgrades in the

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.890 
enough it got a few upgrades in the
graphics<00:06:19.860> department<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.669> it's<00:06:21.419> still

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
graphics department and it's still

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.659 
graphics department and it's still
running<00:06:22.169> pretty<00:06:22.530> good<00:06:22.650> but<00:06:23.039> there<00:06:23.250> are<00:06:23.400> some

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
running pretty good but there are some

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.640 
running pretty good but there are some
areas<00:06:23.700> where<00:06:24.240> I<00:06:24.300> have<00:06:24.419> just<00:06:24.870> a<00:06:25.020> little<00:06:25.050> bit<00:06:25.350> but

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
areas where I have just a little bit but

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.460 
areas where I have just a little bit but
it's<00:06:25.830> significantly<00:06:26.820> better<00:06:27.450> than<00:06:27.900> what<00:06:28.440> it

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
it's significantly better than what it

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.860 
it's significantly better than what it
was<00:06:28.560> when<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.070> game<00:06:29.220> first<00:06:29.520> launched<00:06:30.030> the

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
was when the game first launched the

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.900 
was when the game first launched the
universe<00:06:31.289> now<00:06:31.530> an<00:06:31.800> X<00:06:32.039> rebirth<00:06:32.400> feels

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
universe now an X rebirth feels

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.810 
universe now an X rebirth feels
significantly<00:06:33.590> more<00:06:34.590> threatening<00:06:35.370> the

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
significantly more threatening the

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.360 
significantly more threatening the
rebalance<00:06:36.479> feels<00:06:36.780> good<00:06:37.229> it's<00:06:37.620> more<00:06:38.100> dangerous

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
rebalance feels good it's more dangerous

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.580 
rebalance feels good it's more dangerous
you<00:06:38.880> can't<00:06:39.120> just<00:06:39.330> go<00:06:39.510> in<00:06:39.660> there<00:06:39.690> and<00:06:40.020> just<00:06:40.080> win

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
you can't just go in there and just win

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.500 
you can't just go in there and just win
every<00:06:40.979> battle<00:06:41.010> and<00:06:41.550> feel<00:06:41.789> like<00:06:41.940> you're<00:06:42.150> skunks

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
every battle and feel like you're skunks

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.890 
every battle and feel like you're skunks
super<00:06:42.840> o<00:06:42.870> P<00:06:43.460> capital<00:06:44.460> ships<00:06:44.729> now<00:06:44.940> have<00:06:45.210> escorts

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
super o P capital ships now have escorts

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.250 
super o P capital ships now have escorts
and<00:06:46.080> they<00:06:46.350> will<00:06:46.710> mess<00:06:47.280> you<00:06:47.610> up<00:06:47.640> and<00:06:48.240> it's<00:06:48.930> it's

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
and they will mess you up and it's it's

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.469 
and they will mess you up and it's it's
good<00:06:49.500> so<00:06:49.710> it<00:06:49.919> feels<00:06:50.160> closer<00:06:50.880> to<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.210> older

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
good so it feels closer to the older

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.779 
good so it feels closer to the older
games<00:06:51.750> where<00:06:52.110> you<00:06:52.560> know<00:06:52.620> right<00:06:52.860> now<00:06:53.070> in<00:06:53.400> my

buildings like a station with no
defenses<00:06:58.440> it's<00:06:58.710> like<00:06:58.919> I<00:06:59.100> don't<00:06:59.220> have<00:06:59.430> a<00:06:59.550> care

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
the 2.0 update for X rebirth is really

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.480 
the 2.0 update for X rebirth is really
on<00:07:13.790> point<00:07:14.300> and<00:07:14.660> it<00:07:15.140> significantly<00:07:15.890> changes

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
on point and it significantly changes

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.430 
on point and it significantly changes
the<00:07:16.640> way<00:07:16.760> this<00:07:16.940> game<00:07:17.150> feels<00:07:17.480> and<00:07:17.810> plays<00:07:17.960> and

the way this game feels and plays and

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.680 
the way this game feels and plays and
it's<00:07:18.680> a<00:07:18.770> step<00:07:19.010> in<00:07:19.160> a<00:07:19.250> great<00:07:19.280> direction<00:07:19.690> anyways

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
it's a step in a great direction anyways

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.880
