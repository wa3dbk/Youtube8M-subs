00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.020 
pretty dope i'm stoked man took a long
time<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:38.160> reason<00:05:38.310> why<00:05:38.400> i<00:05:38.430> took<00:05:38.490> so<00:05:38.669> long<00:05:38.790> to

time the reason why i took so long to
come<00:05:39.240> through<00:05:39.570> is<00:05:39.720> because<00:05:40.160> they<00:05:41.160> never

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
come through is because they never

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.620 
come through is because they never
called<00:05:41.550> me<00:05:41.669> for<00:05:41.820> my<00:05:41.880> confirmation<00:05:42.150> on<00:05:42.510> the
