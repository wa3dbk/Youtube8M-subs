00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 just the end of the two you want 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:18.300
 change here, which is the worst thing that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.970
 You have to know what it is. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 two deaths as the name already says is 2 is one 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.519
 continued to fall and it is important that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.840
 you see one before saw two because that is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 my shoulder is talking but it's because 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.600
 I really knew a lot, maybe I 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.219
 I think you can meet 2 - only him 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 but you 're going to miss a lot 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.660
 interesting you see before a year 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.190
 before watching them both if you were 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.129
 venture straight come 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.360
 Maybe you're kind of lost there and this. 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.010
 we are still in the first problem of the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.219
 film that is what the comparison with the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.340
 movie one and movie one it is very 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:05.460
 which is greater than 2 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:08.430
 not that the 2 gets to be bad but the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.860
 more or less more the tone of the points 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 The movie's two high is is the intel itself 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.140
 nec in 50 in the movie a protagonist 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.390
 clearly what it is that is 2 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.439
 the movie's opportunity ends up 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.619
 divided between what is and the hit girl and 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.750
 even the difference of acting is free 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.560
 of the hit girl who wants to 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 the girl who does the girl band acting and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.040
 then it gets to be a bit more 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.040
 dragged and then the dramatic arc of that 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.450
 strange hit girl ends up being much more 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.119
 interesting that the arch itself 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.890
 dramatic dodo that is also a point 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.060
 stayed a little while in got to stay 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.579
 should be able to buy your first 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.200
 the entire film soundtrack 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.540
 first movie to mix in a 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.770
 scene of extreme violence with a trail 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.810
 cheerful pop sound 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.579
 This contrast is a joke. 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.840
 that making a movie one was very 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.250
 interesting is that you end up losing one 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.420
 little and always put one or two 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.880
 Christmas carols 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.370
 in the most violent action scenes but 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.530
 but it does not 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.810
 pedro henriques had a movie over and over 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.490
 also ended up lacking some of the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.740
 current time to make the transition 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.830
 between the scenes of comedy and scenes of 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.540
 action on top of drama 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.430
 this transition was not well done there 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.010
 and what was a thing that in the first 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.230
 film was also made the way it came 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.920
 remarkably time you were in town and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.960
 had that was stuck in the chair 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.940
 he is following the two most 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.190
 I already noticed a lot of mine there. 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.720
 preference is also the aspect of 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.460
 number of characters that have 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.560
 represented a number of people 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.910
 very large and just that we do not 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.070
 matters a lot with these characters who 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.730
 are presented can not happen 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.130
 with them 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.770
 according to live or die for me so much 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.870
 Do it for me, it will indicate if 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.880
 caring less only that which 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.590
 the hit girl and neither because they are 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.690
 developed at the end but were only 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.280
 developed in the film one and we get 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.650
 worried about them but the others 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.680
 characters appear in the movie 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.940
 kevin's character is very good but 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.520
 is also well produced no character 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.850
 introduced in the film is all that 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.060
 also top to be very fan of the movie one 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.640
 I was a little disappointed by this and 2 did not 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.320
 it got to be bad and the eucatur ended me 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.870
 I finished the movie with the intention of note 6 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.570
 for the film but being fair to believe 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.450
 exactly the movie can win a set 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.209
 of program note 7 but who saw who sees 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.489
 the film is a problem but I went out with a 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.330
 with that little taste that could have 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.709
 been better 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.090
 That's it folks, despite the regrets. 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.390
 still recommends that the film be seen 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.250
 in the movies who want and like 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.380
 video games help something 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.570
 God goes there favorite gone sign up for the 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.040
 channel that kind of thing important to 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.070
 people help a lot in vogue at the time you 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.570
 I do not usually go that morality gate and I know 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.630
 I 'm the one who wants to know around. 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.070
 this movie that did not come to be bad right? 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.830
 but neither did I touch it 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.170
 I was hoping there is the expectation that the 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.000
 created is the demon of expectation 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.380
 but still the movie is not bad but 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.060
 Bad people, you can see. 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.069
 Calm down, I got a little 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.840
 disappointed but not bad 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.730
 both only then that there just end up 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.730
 What is 2? 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.229
 goiania go 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.110
 I want it bad had not
