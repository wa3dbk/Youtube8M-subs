00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello my name is fatal and i am 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.810
 at samsung for the display area 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.519
 responsible as you can see we are standing here 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.679
 currently on the ifa in the display area 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.870
 and also there will be this year 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.639
 brought some highlights and one 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 Great emphasis is current for us 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 on the topic that many of the area 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.789
 know the tv 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.580
 behind me you can see our tackles 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.990
 monitors we have the first force 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.060
 monitor this year at the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 gamescom presented what we see here 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.500
 is a monitor on the ifa 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.940
 actually premiere freer maybe 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.180
 Just a short time to the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 which I like a crafting so much 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.140
 here you see the vault clearly 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.820
 recognizable and this advertising is the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.329
 vaulting of the human eye after 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.190
 recommended 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.710
 that means especially if it is very very long 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 I have a very pleasant one on that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.570
 experiences little exhausting my eye 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.039
 besides, we are getting straight through the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.870
 clouds also a bit 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.899
 spatial effect in the matter purely 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.930
 although there is no 3d monitor we have here 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.199
 a spatial representation what you here 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 right behind me she is the sc 7 190 c 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.590
 that will probably start at the beginning of the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.630
 next year, our two- stroke engine 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.560
 offer 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:23.470
 34 25 21 9 format and has a weko hd + 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.570
 resolution so 3440 x 1,440 the monitor 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.830
 certainly for gamer too 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.140
 to be interesting 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.150
 He comes as our hd monitor with hire 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.610
 just mode that always ensures that 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.330
 very clear that crisp sharp picture 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.340
 hair 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.400
 even if, for example, my game is straight 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.340
 it is dark or it is very foggy 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.050
 the speaker is integrated and 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.020
 is from the connections here 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.740
 actually everything you can on it 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.060
 displayport hdmi and four usb ports 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.630
 Unfortunately , the current version can still be accessed 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.960
 do not say anything but we calculate from the beginning 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.520
 Seen as much as five in 2015 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.990
 Monitors from Samsung on the ifa 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.980
 tecwatch is certainly not some more 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.090
 offer more exciting insights 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.090
 and I wish you much fun with it
