 document that will be released to you 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.560
 which must take into account are

 the category and value of the annuity 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 land register on which the calculation is based 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.890
 of the thesis now that I got the

 measure and I know the cadastral values 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.310
 what calculation should I make his 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.880
 dwelling belongs to the category a2 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.280
 and a cadastral income of one thousand euros 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.640
 also you own a garage 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.869
 that belongs to the category you are with 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.729
 a cadastral income of 90 euros must 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.960
 multiply these values by the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.159
 revaluation coefficient equal to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.079
 1.05 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.170
 it is a value defined by the 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:14.359
 national legislation and then multiply 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.579
 for 160 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:19.489
 this is the multiplier to be applied 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.200
 to homes and appliances for 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.569
 other types of properties 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.230

 available on the site of the municipality 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.200
 in this way he will obtain the tax base 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:36.560
 which in his case is 168 thousand euros per 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.639
 the house is 15 thousand and 120 euros per 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.680
 the garage to calculate the phases must 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.440
 finally multiply the tax base 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.810
 for 1.25 per thousand 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.350
 this and she set the quota established by 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.760
 common of pordenone for 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.930

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.890
 of the tax due for the home 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.220

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.560
 for the full year 2014 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.400
 at this point it will have to subdivide 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.300
 the total amount in two equal installments 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.580
 Round up the deposit and the balance if the

 cadastral income of his home is 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:25.660
 less than or equal to 800 euros will have to 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.580
 deduct 25 euros from the amount obtained 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.590
 what are the deadlines and how is it? 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.080
