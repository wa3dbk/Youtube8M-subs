the pen and a piece of paper and we're
going<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.030> make<00:01:23.270> three<00:01:24.009> widths<00:01:25.009> of<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:26.750> larger

coin<00:01:27.490> starting<00:01:28.490> from<00:01:28.759> one<00:01:29.240> end<00:01:29.479> there's<00:01:29.899> one

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
coin starting from one end there's one

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.340 
coin starting from one end there's one
two<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:33.550> one<00:01:34.550> makes<00:01:34.819> three<00:01:35.179> turn<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.140> paper

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
two and one makes three turn the paper

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.770 
two and one makes three turn the paper
around<00:01:36.580> this<00:01:37.580> time<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.030> start<00:01:38.330> from<00:01:38.569> the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
around this time you start from the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.180 
around this time you start from the
other<00:01:39.140> side<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.000> those<00:01:41.679> marks<00:01:42.679> will<00:01:42.950> line

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
other side so that those marks will line

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.330 
other side so that those marks will line
up<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.880> we<00:01:44.000> can<00:01:44.179> draw<00:01:44.450> them<00:01:44.659> with<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:44.899> ruler

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
up and we can draw them with a ruler

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.020 
up and we can draw them with a ruler
there's<00:01:46.340> one<00:01:46.630> there's<00:01:47.630> two<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:50.409> three<00:01:51.909> so<00:01:52.909> we

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
there's one there's two and three so we

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.940 
there's one there's two and three so we
finished<00:01:53.330> with<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.479> coin<00:01:53.750> for<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.049> while<00:01:54.229> take

the<00:01:55.190> ruler<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.140> rule<00:01:57.140> three<00:01:57.530> lines<00:01:57.770> across

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the ruler and rule three lines across

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.300 
the ruler and rule three lines across
the<00:01:58.909> paper<00:02:00.489> there's<00:02:01.489> one<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.979> other<00:02:04.129> two

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.860 

making<00:02:07.310> three<00:02:07.580> lines<00:02:07.849> all<00:02:08.690> together<00:02:10.870> fairly

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
making three lines all together fairly

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.110 
making three lines all together fairly
simple<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.410> far<00:02:14.349> okay<00:02:15.349> there<00:02:15.560> they<00:02:15.709> are<00:02:16.120> take

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
the same coin again and this time we're

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the same coin again and this time we're
going<00:02:19.069> across<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.849> paper<00:02:20.090> six<00:02:21.020> times<00:02:21.319> one<00:02:24.819> two

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:36.330 

three<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.540> another<00:02:32.020> three<00:02:34.050> high<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.620> one

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
three and another three high and one

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.200 
three and another three high and one
makes<00:02:36.580> six

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
makes six

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.210 
makes six
once<00:02:38.020> again<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.470> turn<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.860> paper<00:02:39.070> around

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
once again you turn the paper around

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.320 
once again you turn the paper around
start<00:02:40.090> from<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.510> other<00:02:40.780> side<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:42.150> once<00:02:43.150> again

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
start from the other side and once again

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.580 
start from the other side and once again
you<00:02:43.660> mark<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.020> six<00:02:44.290> times<00:02:45.150> each<00:02:46.530> with<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
you mark it six times each with the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.950 
you mark it six times each with the
width<00:02:47.770> of<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> coin<00:02:48.250> there<00:02:48.910> we<00:02:49.120> go<00:02:49.300> I've

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
width of the coin there we go I've

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.610 
width of the coin there we go I've
hurried<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.680> bit<00:02:50.830> for<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:53.110> once

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
hurried that up a bit for you and once

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.210 
hurried that up a bit for you and once
again<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.940> line<00:02:55.150> up<00:02:55.180> those<00:02:55.600> marks<00:02:56.730> by<00:02:57.730> drawing

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
again we line up those marks by drawing

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.360 
again we line up those marks by drawing
lines<00:03:00.220> across<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.880> paper<00:03:01.710> there<00:03:02.710> we<00:03:02.980> go

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
lines across the paper there we go

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.610 
lines across the paper there we go
and<00:03:04.300> one<00:03:04.780> more<00:03:05.820> that's<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:07.060> next<00:03:08.050> we<00:03:08.290> take<00:03:08.470> the

and one more that's it next we take the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.190 
and one more that's it next we take the
scissors<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.060> we're<00:03:10.660> going<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.870> get<00:03:11.020> rid<00:03:11.170> of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.740 
scissors and we're going to get rid of
the<00:03:11.380> pieces<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.770> we<00:03:12.010> don't<00:03:12.220> want<00:03:12.550> that<00:03:13.390> blank

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
the pieces that we don't want that blank

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.880 
the pieces that we don't want that blank
piece<00:03:14.020> we<00:03:14.650> don't<00:03:14.890> want<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:17.320> we'll<00:03:17.560> trim

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
piece we don't want that so we'll trim

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.920 
piece we don't want that so we'll trim
that<00:03:18.010> off<00:03:19.110> like<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.850> we've<00:03:22.180> got<00:03:22.360> one<00:03:22.660> two

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
that off like so and we've got one two

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.770 
that off like so and we've got one two
three<00:03:22.960> four<00:03:23.710> five<00:03:24.250> six<00:03:24.820> seven

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
three four five six seven

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.460 
three four five six seven
we<00:03:26.620> don't<00:03:26.830> want<00:03:27.070> seven<00:03:27.400> we<00:03:27.550> only<00:03:27.700> want<00:03:27.970> six<00:03:28.470> so

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
we don't want seven we only want six so

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.440 
we don't want seven we only want six so
we'll<00:03:29.710> cut<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.220> column<00:03:31.150> off<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.270> now

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
we'll cut that column off so that now

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.680 
we'll cut that column off so that now
we've<00:03:34.660> got<00:03:35.430> three<00:03:36.430> squares<00:03:36.820> by<00:03:37.090> six<00:03:37.390> squares

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
we've got three squares by six squares

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.180 
we've got three squares by six squares
one<00:03:37.900> two<00:03:38.260> three<00:03:38.680> four<00:03:39.489> five<00:03:39.910> six<00:03:41.190> we're

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
one two three four five six we're

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.280 
one two three four five six we're
cutting<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.580> in<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.820> middle<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:43.600> we<00:03:43.900> will

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
cutting it in the middle so that we will

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.880 
cutting it in the middle so that we will
end<00:03:44.470> up<00:03:44.650> with<00:03:44.680> two<00:03:45.160> pieces<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.580> paper<00:03:46.890> exactly

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
end up with two pieces of paper exactly

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.720 
end up with two pieces of paper exactly
the<00:03:48.130> same<00:03:48.340> size<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.890> there<00:03:51.160> they<00:03:51.280> are

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
the same size and there they are

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.310 
the same size and there they are
now<00:03:52.690> those<00:03:52.870> lines<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.380> we<00:03:53.500> drew<00:03:55.350> we<00:03:57.989> we<00:03:58.989> fold

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
now those lines that we drew we we fold

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.699 
now those lines that we drew we we fold
along<00:03:59.950> those<00:04:00.340> lines<00:04:01.920> fold<00:04:02.920> this<00:04:03.160> one<00:04:03.340> as<00:04:03.489> well

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
along those lines fold this one as well

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.820 
along those lines fold this one as well
in<00:04:05.709> fact<00:04:05.920> every<00:04:06.280> line<00:04:06.459> that's<00:04:06.670> on<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.030> paper

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
in fact every line that's on the paper

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.479 
in fact every line that's on the paper
is<00:04:08.830> where<00:04:09.130> we<00:04:09.310> fold<00:04:09.610> it<00:04:10.800> finishing<00:04:12.570> with<00:04:13.570> a

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
is where we fold it finishing with a

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.920 
is where we fold it finishing with a
package<00:04:15.489> one<00:04:16.359> square<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:18.280> size<00:04:18.930> there's

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
package one square in size there's

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.420 
package one square in size there's
actually<00:04:20.260> nine<00:04:20.470> squares<00:04:20.919> on<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.220> piece<00:04:21.400> of

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
actually nine squares on the piece of

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.670 
actually nine squares on the piece of
paper<00:04:21.609> we<00:04:22.300> got<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.540> right<00:04:22.720> down<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.169> one<00:04:23.350> square

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
paper we got it right down to one square

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.000 
paper we got it right down to one square
there<00:04:24.640> yeah<00:04:25.290> same<00:04:26.290> with<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.590> other<00:04:26.740> one<00:04:26.980> I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
there yeah same with the other one I

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.580 
there yeah same with the other one I
won't<00:04:27.340> waste<00:04:27.550> time<00:04:27.910> with<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.390> I'll<00:04:28.600> click

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
won't waste time with that I'll click

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.300 
won't waste time with that I'll click
the<00:04:30.390> video<00:04:31.390> forward<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.870> little<00:04:32.020> bit<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.710> we've

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
the video forward a little bit and we've

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.680 
the video forward a little bit and we've
done<00:04:33.460> exactly<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.910> same<00:04:34.150> with<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.450> so

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
done exactly the same with that so

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.550 
done exactly the same with that so
there's<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.080> two

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
there's the two

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.310 
there's the two
little<00:04:37.220> packages<00:04:37.670> exactly<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.390> same<00:04:38.630> we'll

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
little packages exactly the same we'll

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.040 
little packages exactly the same we'll
open<00:04:39.500> them<00:04:39.740> up<00:04:40.240> just<00:04:41.240> like<00:04:41.390> this<00:04:43.930> open<00:04:44.930> up<00:04:44.990> the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
open them up just like this open up the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.360 
open them up just like this open up the
other<00:04:45.230> one<00:04:45.440> as<00:04:45.560> well<00:04:46.270> maybe<00:04:47.270> out<00:04:48.220> turn<00:04:49.220> them

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
other one as well maybe out turn them

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.190 
other one as well maybe out turn them
over<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:50.420> we<00:04:50.510> got<00:04:50.660> to<00:04:50.750> glue<00:04:50.870> them<00:04:51.050> together

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
over and we got to glue them together

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.860 
over and we got to glue them together
but<00:04:51.950> only<00:04:52.490> one<00:04:52.880> square<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.570> is<00:04:53.750> the

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
but only one square and that is the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.630 
but only one square and that is the
middle<00:04:54.110> square<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:54.770> put<00:04:54.950> some<00:04:55.130> glue<00:04:55.280> on<00:04:55.370> the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
middle square and put some glue on the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.810 
middle square and put some glue on the
middle<00:04:55.940> square<00:04:56.890> not<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:58.040> other<00:04:58.160> squares<00:04:58.580> just

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
middle square not the other squares just

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.410 
middle square not the other squares just
the<00:04:59.030> middle<00:04:59.270> put<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.990> glue<00:05:00.170> aside<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:01.420> pop

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
the middle put the glue aside and pop

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.550 
the middle put the glue aside and pop
the<00:05:02.720> two<00:05:02.960> together<00:05:03.440> squeeze<00:05:04.310> them<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:05.560> at

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
the two together squeeze them and at

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.590 
the two together squeeze them and at
this<00:05:06.830> stage<00:05:06.890> we<00:05:07.490> have<00:05:07.640> to<00:05:07.670> just<00:05:07.940> wait<00:05:08.210> until

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
this stage we have to just wait until

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.970 
this stage we have to just wait until
the<00:05:09.020> glue<00:05:09.260> sets<00:05:10.930> so<00:05:11.930> we'll<00:05:12.170> leave<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:12.500> there

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
the glue sets so we'll leave it there

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.680 
the glue sets so we'll leave it there
and<00:05:13.190> we'll<00:05:13.460> come<00:05:13.670> back<00:05:13.700> in<00:05:14.330> just<00:05:14.390> a<00:05:14.660> little

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
and we'll come back in just a little

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.310 
and we'll come back in just a little
while<00:05:16.330> around<00:05:17.330> about<00:05:17.510> 10<00:05:17.810> minutes<00:05:18.020> or<00:05:18.290> so

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
while around about 10 minutes or so

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.660 
while around about 10 minutes or so
should<00:05:18.710> do<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.160> trick

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
should do the trick

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.390 
should do the trick
we're<00:05:19.940> back<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.630> glue<00:05:20.810> has<00:05:20.960> dried<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.680> now

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
we're back the glue has dried and now

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.210 
we're back the glue has dried and now
we're<00:05:22.670> ready<00:05:22.820> to<00:05:23.680> get<00:05:24.680> ready<00:05:24.860> for<00:05:25.010> the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
we're ready to get ready for the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.340
