00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
water and one source of lava so let's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.080 
water and one source of lava so let's
just<00:00:19.320> start<00:00:19.500> off<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.279> lava<00:00:20.550> bucket

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
just start off with that one lava bucket

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.359 
just start off with that one lava bucket
and<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.990> water<00:00:22.230> bucket<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.769> lap<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> bucket

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and one water bucket in one lap a bucket

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.220 
and one water bucket in one lap a bucket
and<00:00:23.490> you'll<00:00:24.090> probably<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.480> given<00:00:24.720> cobblestone

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and you'll probably be given cobblestone

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.720 
and you'll probably be given cobblestone
which<00:00:25.439> obviously<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.010> could<00:00:26.160> use<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.550> just

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.510 
building this with any block long as
it's<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.820> wood<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.570> flammable

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
source like that so the blocks should be

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.590 
source like that so the blocks should be
above<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:20.340> I'm<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> want<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
water source so basically you're copying

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.870 
water source so basically you're copying
what<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> did<00:01:36.450> down<00:01:36.630> below<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.950> above<00:01:38.400> but

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
just on a single layer and while I now

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
just on a single layer and while I now
only<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> want<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.100> place<00:01:44.340> the

only what I want you to do is place the
lava<00:01:44.670> source<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:45.119> there

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.180 

then<00:01:49.220> BAM<00:01:49.970> we<00:01:50.960> have<00:01:51.140> our<00:01:51.290> four<00:01:51.560> ways<00:01:51.770> stone

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
then BAM we have our four ways stone
