00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.369
 ah 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.390
 i 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.380
 regards, we continue with the course of 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.720
 rhythm guitar guitar in a trip 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.480
 this time we are going to see a pattern 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.970
 rhythmic for the 6 x 8 time signature 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.590
 in the shared six by eight we have 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.810
 six-point eighth note we have six 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.310
 time 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.310
 one two three gloves 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.659
 346 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.710
 at a very usual rhythm is 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:16.790
 accentuate the 1 and the 4 is to say as if 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:19.770
 let's divide the compass into 2 of 3 1 2 3 4 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.700
 3 6 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.810
 from there we can subdivide each 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.880
 one of the pulses in sixteenths a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.119
 very usual rhythm 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.460
 quaver in one in two three 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.730
 sixteenths 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.580
 4 corset again 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.580
 5 and 6 in fijaros sixteenths 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.380
 sheen and eighth notes in 12 3 4 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.579
 two 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.670
 when I 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.960
 2. 3 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.299
 one 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:08.270
 do not 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.270
 but we also do that 1 and that 4 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.150
 when 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.930
 i 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.500
 plus 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.550
 i 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 for me 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.060
 speed 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.030
 Very usual very nice this rhythm 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.760
 to work it with the following chords 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.340
 I propose the following chords a 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.010
 chord of fame 7 that we are going to place of 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.080
 the following way 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.680
 we put a do 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.260
 we take fingers 3 and 2 to the next 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.600
 string game is to say 3 what 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.520
 we take from the end of the fifth string to 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.900
 the fourth 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.549
 and 2 of the fourth to the third 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.290
 this is a major triad chord of funk 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.290
 with a seventh major with fear 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.290
 we are going to work with this format 7 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.550
 major point 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.460
 after a sun 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.460
 and a king 24 who becomes 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:34.590
 Take seven all the air 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:39.989
 only on air but with his fifth here 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:43.340
 and in those four we see that fourth here 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.340
 he adorned himself on the king 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.900
 we resolve between may 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.670
 let's go there slowly remember eighth note 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.340
 12,000 eighth notes two sixteenths eighth note 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.189
 two semi-eighth notes two sixteenths and 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.700
 we make the 1 and the 4 we go very 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.700
 slowly 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.780
 do not 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.820
 and we go back to the bread 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.500
 we change to sun 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.360
 in its 4 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.349
 We do not usually 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.349
 you see very simple 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.870
 24 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.360
 knock 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.920
 we change to sun 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.610
 34 that solves 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.020
 of course you can do any type 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.940
 of variations in eighth notes and 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.920
 sixteenths or blacks you could do 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.360
 all black 123 and 6 but this is very 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.120
 habitual 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.939
 eighth eighth note 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.120
 sixteenths and we do 1 and 4 we go 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.120
 there 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.380
 two 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.050
 i 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.050
 what we are going to do 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.420
 we can accelerate this more 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.949
 as always work it slowly for 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.139
 internalize the concept of 6 by 8 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:49.400
 we also have 6 points we must count 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:52.220
 6 1 2 3 4 and 6 1 2 3 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.250
 do not work slowly internalized the 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.169
 pace and you can speed up little to 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.910
 little but understanding what you are 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.350
 doing 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.880
 this has been a usual rhythm in the 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.880
 6 x 8 compass
