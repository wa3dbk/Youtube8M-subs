this<00:02:06.149> side<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.860> stop<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
this side so I'm going to stop this and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.219 
this side so I'm going to stop this and
then<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> turn<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.959> plane<00:02:10.200> around

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
then I'm going to turn the plane around

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.999 
then I'm going to turn the plane around
and<00:02:10.649> show

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
and show

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.100 
and show
the<00:02:11.129> other<00:02:11.280> side<00:02:13.189> so<00:02:14.189> this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.909> other<00:02:15.780> side

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the other side so this is the other side

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.140 
the other side so this is the other side
of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.470> plane<00:02:16.709> all<00:02:17.040> mashed<00:02:17.730> off<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:19.909> you<00:02:20.909> see

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
of the plane all mashed off and you see

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.600 
of the plane all mashed off and you see
where<00:02:21.360> I've<00:02:21.450> cut<00:02:21.750> out<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.200> automotive<00:02:23.129> stuff

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
where I've cut out the automotive stuff

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.240 
where I've cut out the automotive stuff
to<00:02:23.760> put<00:02:23.939> a<00:02:23.970> nice<00:02:24.150> clean<00:02:24.540> line<00:02:24.840> through<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.530> I'm

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
to put a nice clean line through and I'm

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.399 
to put a nice clean line through and I'm
really<00:02:26.549> careful<00:02:26.909> about<00:02:27.209> overspray<00:02:28.110> I've

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
really careful about overspray I've

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.289 
really careful about overspray I've
learned<00:02:28.769> over<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.250> years<00:02:29.489> from<00:02:29.879> shooting

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
learned over the years from shooting

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.990 
learned over the years from shooting
dope<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:33.030> shooting<00:02:34.430> liquid<00:02:35.430> dope<00:02:35.700> not

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
dope and like shooting liquid dope not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.930 
dope and like shooting liquid dope not
dope<00:02:36.420> dope<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:37.079> anyway<00:02:37.579> from<00:02:38.579> shooting

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
dope dope but anyway from shooting

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.210 
dope dope but anyway from shooting
doping<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.810> shooting<00:02:40.260> primers<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.010> stuff

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
doping and shooting primers and stuff

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.490 
doping and shooting primers and stuff
like<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.609> it's<00:02:41.760> amazing<00:02:42.299> how<00:02:42.450> overspray<00:02:43.230> can

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
like that it's amazing how overspray can

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.740 
like that it's amazing how overspray can
find<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.040> smallest<00:02:45.030> little<00:02:45.450> crack<00:02:45.720> and

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
find the smallest little crack and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.750 
find the smallest little crack and
crevice<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:46.769> I'm<00:02:46.920> pretty<00:02:47.129> careful<00:02:47.700> about

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
crevice so now I'm pretty careful about

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.849 
crevice so now I'm pretty careful about
how<00:02:48.120> I'm<00:02:48.269> cilium<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:49.019> I'm<00:02:49.200> using<00:02:49.409> a<00:02:49.620> low

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
how I'm cilium because I'm using a low

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.229 
how I'm cilium because I'm using a low
tack<00:02:51.799> teeth<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:53.129> doesn't<00:02:53.519> want<00:02:53.639> to<00:02:53.760> stick<00:02:54.000> too

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
tack teeth it doesn't want to stick too

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.750 
tack teeth it doesn't want to stick too
well<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.690> itself<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.560> taped<00:02:55.889> up<00:02:56.129> yesterday

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
well to itself this I taped up yesterday

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.720 
well to itself this I taped up yesterday
and<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:58.170> already<00:02:58.620> starting<00:02:59.159> to<00:02:59.190> lift<00:02:59.519> this

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
and it's already starting to lift this

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.990 
and it's already starting to lift this
is<00:02:59.909> a<00:02:59.940> pattern<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.510> I'm<00:03:00.780> putting<00:03:01.049> on<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
is a pattern that I'm putting on the the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.899 
is a pattern that I'm putting on the the
starburst<00:03:03.540> pattern<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.170> top<00:03:04.639> I've<00:03:05.639> still

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
starburst pattern on the top I've still

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.210 
starburst pattern on the top I've still
got<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> few<00:03:06.440> numbers<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.680> stuff<00:03:07.889> that<00:03:07.950> I'm

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
got a few numbers and stuff that I'm

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.940 
got a few numbers and stuff that I'm
gonna<00:03:08.400> make<00:03:08.670> up<00:03:08.909> masks<00:03:09.569> for<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.409> but<00:03:10.829> I'm

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
gonna make up masks for this and but I'm

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.740 
gonna make up masks for this and but I'm
gonna<00:03:11.129> wait<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:11.609> all<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.790> most<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.659> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
gonna wait and get all that most of the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.610 
gonna wait and get all that most of the
red<00:03:13.470> painting<00:03:13.829> done<00:03:14.459> first<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.120> then<00:03:16.049> on<00:03:16.319> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
red painting done first and then on the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.970 
red painting done first and then on the
bottom<00:03:17.069> just<00:03:17.930> going<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.989> pick<00:03:19.199> this<00:03:19.349> up<00:03:19.410> here

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
bottom just going to pick this up here

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.720 
bottom just going to pick this up here
I'm<00:03:20.639> gonna<00:03:20.970> do<00:03:21.470> straight<00:03:22.470> broad<00:03:22.799> stripes<00:03:23.370> on

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
I'm gonna do straight broad stripes on

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.599 
I'm gonna do straight broad stripes on
the<00:03:24.120> wings<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.889> you<00:03:25.889> can<00:03:26.069> see<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.489> the

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
the wings and you can see on the

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.289 
the wings and you can see on the
fuselage<00:03:27.180> how<00:03:27.480> I've<00:03:27.660> taped<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.230> off<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:30.090> I'm

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
fuselage how I've taped that off so I'm

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.150 
fuselage how I've taped that off so I'm
pretty<00:03:30.480> careful<00:03:30.810> about<00:03:31.199> that<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.530> still<00:03:31.980> have

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
pretty careful about that I still have

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.619 
pretty careful about that I still have
this<00:03:32.370> side<00:03:32.669> so<00:03:32.940> I'm<00:03:33.120> gonna<00:03:33.239> get<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.599> other

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
this side so I'm gonna get the other

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.309 
this side so I'm gonna get the other
side<00:03:34.079> taped<00:03:34.470> off<00:03:35.239> hopefully<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:36.690> afternoon

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
side taped off hopefully this afternoon

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.849 
side taped off hopefully this afternoon

and into this evening and I hope tonight
to<00:03:41.190> get<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.810> painting<00:03:43.379> done<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:44.669> can

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
to get the the painting done so I can

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.020 
to get the the painting done so I can
take<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.419> tape<00:03:45.629> off<00:03:46.250> tomorrow<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.639> let's<00:03:47.790> just

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
take the tape off tomorrow so let's just

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.670 
take the tape off tomorrow so let's just
kind<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.389> this<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.540> not<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.989> only<00:03:49.260> way<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.440> do

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
kind of this is not the only way to do

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.770 
kind of this is not the only way to do
it<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:50.010> don't<00:03:50.639> think<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.329> just<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.569> way<00:03:51.750> I

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
it I don't think this is just the way I

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.610 
it I don't think this is just the way I
do<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:54.720> know<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.139> lot<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.319> work

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
do it and you know it's a lot of work

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.119 
do it and you know it's a lot of work
but<00:03:56.449> hopefully<00:03:57.449> it'll<00:03:57.959> be<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.139> nice<00:03:58.680> finished

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
but hopefully it'll be a nice finished

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.129 
but hopefully it'll be a nice finished
product<00:03:59.400> once<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.970> get<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.299> whole<00:04:00.449> thing<00:04:00.810> shot

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
product once I get the whole thing shot

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.800 
product once I get the whole thing shot
with<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.620> colors<00:04:02.030> I'm<00:04:03.030> going<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.239> let<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.510> dry

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
with the colors I'm going to let it dry

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.490 
with the colors I'm going to let it dry
up<00:04:03.840> for<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.349> month<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.040> then<00:04:05.609> I'll<00:04:05.819> probably

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
up for a month and then I'll probably

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.360 
up for a month and then I'll probably
light<00:04:07.500> sand<00:04:07.949> it<00:04:08.159> with<00:04:08.310> 400<00:04:08.970> or<00:04:09.120> 600<00:04:10.220> just<00:04:11.220> to

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
light sand it with 400 or 600 just to

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.860

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
going to clear coat it with lustre coat

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.960 
going to clear coat it with lustre coat
and<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:16.560> fuel<00:04:16.829> proof<00:04:17.130> everything<00:04:17.549> I'm<00:04:17.669> running

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
and to fuel proof everything I'm running

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.159 
and to fuel proof everything I'm running
a<00:04:18.060> sato<00:04:18.359> 180<00:04:19.760> with

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
a sato 180 with

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.800 
a sato 180 with
ignition<00:04:21.620> for<00:04:22.610> power<00:04:22.819> should<00:04:23.270> be<00:04:23.330> okay<00:04:23.749> so

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
ignition for power should be okay so

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.510 
ignition for power should be okay so
it's<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.349> nice<00:04:24.499> plane<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:24.949> I<00:04:25.009> just<00:04:25.189> thought<00:04:25.340> I'd

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
it's a nice plane so I just thought I'd

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.629 
it's a nice plane so I just thought I'd
share<00:04:25.789> this<00:04:25.969> experience<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:27.009> you<00:04:28.009> can<00:04:28.249> get<00:04:28.520> an

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
share this experience and you can get an

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.550 
share this experience and you can get an
idea<00:04:28.999> of<00:04:29.060> what<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:29.449> about<00:04:29.719> my<00:04:29.990> camera<00:04:30.289> broke

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
idea of what it's about my camera broke

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.529 
idea of what it's about my camera broke
so<00:04:30.979> I<00:04:31.219> haven't<00:04:31.400> got<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.639> new<00:04:31.819> one<00:04:31.999> I<00:04:32.029> can't<00:04:32.360> just

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
so I haven't got a new one I can't just

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.029 
so I haven't got a new one I can't just
do<00:04:32.659> a<00:04:32.689> bunch<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.080> short<00:04:33.349> pictures<00:04:33.800> so<00:04:34.009> I

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
do a bunch of short pictures so I

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.810 
do a bunch of short pictures so I
thought<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.400> video<00:04:35.330> would<00:04:35.569> work
