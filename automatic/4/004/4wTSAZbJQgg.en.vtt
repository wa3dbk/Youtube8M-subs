00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.409
 Hello 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.580
 This is the story of the Kotas trade investigation team. 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.440
 Personal consumption continues to be sluggish, and in Japan, department stores 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.990
 want 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.940
 The sales are falling without knowing the floor. 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.880
 The anticipation of selling cheaply has long lost its power. 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.160
 Various evolutions are becoming more and more common in consumers 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.470
 It is the present of consumer market which becomes difficult 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.470
 However, with 30 days of marketing techniques 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.390
 Successful in blocking consumer's desire to hide 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.780
 There are also a few products that have emerged as hit products. 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.080
 Let's see. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.980
 Panasonic and the dryer make Nokia 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.000
 The series 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 It sells for 1 million to 16,000 yen. 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.539
 Given the average price of tri-outs of 3000 yen 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.670
 It's a great price. 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.619
 Despite this expensive price, 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.700
 It is increasing 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 I think the secret to the success of the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.899
 Diarra has given us new values. 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.350
 Now, one and two can have their effects, 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.990
 It's glowing. 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.430
 The next step was to inform consumers of their utility 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.299
 When you sell high-quality cosmetics, you are interested in providing samples. 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.900
 Install a dedicated back space for women. 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.860
 It is time to use freely 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.869
 In order to gain such expertise, 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.640
 We made it possible only in specialized stores, not in general viewpoints. 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.820
 And it is popular with the consumers 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.039
 Reflecting on product improvement is also an important turning point 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.509
 That's it. 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.659
 You can also change your child's sales 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:14.799
 There is 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.409
 7. The water was pronounced Dae Young Packing Sales. 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.150
 Years of Chocolate 2004 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.530
 Double your price and make your daughters bigger 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.209
 We can make sales lower 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.890
 There is already a bar code attached for low sales 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.419
 It was impossible. 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.749
 After changing to individual packaging, 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:41.019
 I also have a way to sell it in a way that I can keep it up to date. 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.489
 Traditional plate chocolates come in price ranges that were difficult to come by 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.779
 After digging 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.679
 In July, 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:52.559
 It has been booming enough to double in five years. 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.600
 Of course, once every two weeks, the product is released 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.290
 The decision to make a decision like a consumer 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.290
 It played a big role. 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.429
 Dongguk-won also does not wait for mobile customers 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:07.559
 The philosophy of visiting 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.329
 It is a product that pushes one step further. 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.200
 Collecting information about where your phone is located 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.969
 It's a product we sell. 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.259
 For example, if a customer identifies a location as a golf course 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.729
 You can prepare for the life you can do in golf equipment. 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:26.289
 The insurance product information is sent to the customer's mobile phone. 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.149
 Will 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:30.410
 Of course, in conjunction with the mobile phone bill payment system 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.410
 Insurance products can be purchased immediately 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.019
 The insurance period is short and the price is not burdensome. 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.019
 It is gaining popularity in the field of travel and leisure. 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.629
 Stimulate demand in stages based on real-time customer information 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.379
 The marketing strategy that leads directly to product purchase is novelty 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.799
 Finally, by restricting consumer behavior, 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.479
 Introduce the flesh to increase value 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.889
 If you win the online prizes in Japan, there is almost no publicity. 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.400
 Without 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.910
 Membership Time 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.750
 At the time of purchase decision, it is about 10-15 degrees compared with usual online store 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.729
 I have one rule. 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.439
 The day I feel like I will leave the plowing field in Korea with this inconvenience 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.439
 Rather, this exclusive policy stimulates consumer sentiment 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.090
 This year, sales will only increase. We are looking forward to 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.799
 On the other hand, the delight of the online shopping peripheral. black 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.869
 An exceptional policy that sells only one product a day 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.469
 I appeal. 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.290
 The price discount rate is high 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.069
 Sellers have a surprising effect on inventory handling 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.470
 Future wine special exhibition dot com 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.760
 We are going to expand to the exhibition of luxury brand name dot com 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.590
 On the downturn in the consumer market 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.620
 Common to all developed markets used for consumption patterns 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.849
 This is what is happening. 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.569
 Niche with products and marketing that piques consumers and markets 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.569
 I have to go back to work. 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.860
 More than this, Japan is secret to the product that helps the recession. 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.830
 I told you about 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.620
 Thank you
