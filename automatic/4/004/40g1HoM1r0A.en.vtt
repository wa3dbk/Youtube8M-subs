and I'm doing a series of lessons on

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.180 
and I'm doing a series of lessons on
machine<00:00:12.299> knitting<00:00:12.510> and<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.350> is<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.680> second

machine knitting and this is the second

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.160 
machine knitting and this is the second
lesson<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.880> group<00:00:15.059> about<00:00:15.330> how<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.599> master

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
lesson in a group about how to master

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.820 
lesson in a group about how to master
your<00:00:16.410> knitting<00:00:17.160> machines<00:00:17.520> garter<00:00:18.180> bar<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
your knitting machines garter bar and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.710 
your knitting machines garter bar and
the<00:00:19.830> garter<00:00:20.189> bar<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.730> very<00:00:21.060> helpful<00:00:21.360> when

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the garter bar is very helpful when

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.350 
the garter bar is very helpful when
you're<00:00:21.869> decreasing<00:00:22.259> now<00:00:23.099> very<00:00:23.489> often<00:00:23.849> when

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
you're decreasing now very often when

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.030 
you're decreasing now very often when
we're<00:00:24.509> doing<00:00:24.660> were<00:00:25.110> knitting<00:00:25.500> we'll<00:00:25.710> give<00:00:25.890> an

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
we're doing were knitting we'll give an

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.630 
we're doing were knitting we'll give an
instruction<00:00:26.700> like<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.329> which<00:00:28.200> says

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
instruction like this which says

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
instruction like this which says
decrease<00:00:29.640> six<00:00:30.000> stitches<00:00:30.360> evenly<00:00:30.750> across<00:00:31.290> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
decrease six stitches evenly across the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.450 
decrease six stitches evenly across the
row<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.880> I've<00:00:33.030> got<00:00:33.270> three<00:00:33.540> stitches<00:00:33.989> now<00:00:34.470> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
row and I've got three stitches now so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.360 
row and I've got three stitches now so
my<00:00:35.640> question<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.300> where<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.690> those<00:00:36.840> six

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
my question is where do those six

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.290 
my question is where do those six
decreases<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:39.530> now<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> first<00:00:41.040> step<00:00:41.490> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
decreases go now the first step to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
decreases go now the first step to
figuring<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.870> how<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> math<00:00:43.530> works<00:00:43.860> with

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
figuring out how the math works with

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.550 
figuring out how the math works with
that<00:00:44.400> is<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.390> add<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> number<00:00:46.290> of

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
that is to add one to the number of

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.820 
that is to add one to the number of
decreases<00:00:47.310> that<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.580> need<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.090> make<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> need

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
decreases that I need to make so I need

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.330 
decreases that I need to make so I need
to<00:00:50.310> make<00:00:50.490> six<00:00:51.060> decreases<00:00:51.900> add<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.770> mean

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to make six decreases add one I mean

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.600 
to make six decreases add one I mean
seven<00:00:54.060> groups<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.780> stitches<00:00:55.380> I<00:00:55.590> don't<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.430> my

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
seven groups of stitches I don't want my

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.200 
seven groups of stitches I don't want my
decreases<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.370> end<00:00:59.700> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
decreases to be on the very very end of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.210 
decreases to be on the very very end of
the<00:01:00.329> row<00:01:00.540> I<00:01:00.810> want<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> end<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> row<00:01:01.829> kept

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
the row I want the end of the row kept

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.850 
the row I want the end of the row kept
even<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.910> seaming<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> keep<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
even for seaming so to keep the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.560 
even for seaming so to keep the
decreases<00:01:05.399> from<00:01:05.579> being<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> end

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
decreases from being on the end

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
decreases from being on the end
I<00:01:06.659> need<00:01:06.869> seven<00:01:07.229> groups<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
I need seven groups so that the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.140 
I need seven groups so that the
decreases<00:01:09.420> will<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.409> between<00:01:10.770> those<00:01:11.640> seven

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
decreases will be in between those seven

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.320 
decreases will be in between those seven
groups<00:01:12.530> then<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.800> take<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.580> thirty<00:01:14.909> stitches

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
groups then I take the thirty stitches

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.370 
groups then I take the thirty stitches
and<00:01:15.810> I'm<00:01:16.440> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> divide<00:01:17.190> if<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.570> 30<00:01:19.050> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and I'm going to divide if I take 30 and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
and I'm going to divide if I take 30 and
divide<00:01:19.650> by<00:01:19.860> seven<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
divide by seven then I can see I can

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
divide by seven then I can see I can
have<00:01:22.170> seven<00:01:22.500> groups<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.070> four<00:01:23.310> stitches<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
have seven groups of four stitches and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.330 
have seven groups of four stitches and
I'm<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.570> two<00:01:24.870> left<00:01:25.110> over<00:01:25.380> because

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I'm going to have two left over because

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.469 
I'm going to have two left over because
4<00:01:26.640> times<00:01:26.970> 7<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:27.720> 28<00:01:28.190> so<00:01:29.190> I'm<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
4 times 7 is 28 so I'm going to have a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.080 
4 times 7 is 28 so I'm going to have a
remainder<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.140> two<00:01:31.470> two<00:01:31.890> stitches<00:01:32.400> left<00:01:32.430> over

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
remainder of two two stitches left over

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.070 
remainder of two two stitches left over
so<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.409> seven<00:01:35.100> groups<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:36.869> would

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
so here are my seven groups that would

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.170 
so here are my seven groups that would
be<00:01:37.260> where<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.530> decreases<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:39.000> in

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
be where the decreases are they go in

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.010 
be where the decreases are they go in
between<00:01:39.330> them

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
between them

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.109 
between them
but<00:01:40.470> I'm<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.040> an<00:01:41.159> extra<00:01:41.580> stitch<00:01:41.850> on

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
but I'm going to have an extra stitch on

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.630 
but I'm going to have an extra stitch on
the<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.479> ends<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.320> means<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.250> end

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the two ends so that means this end

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.120 
the two ends so that means this end
group<00:01:45.000> will<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.330> group<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.810> five<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.560> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
group will be a group of five and this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.270 
group will be a group of five and this
end<00:01:47.460> group<00:01:47.729> will<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.330> group<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.869> five<00:01:49.280> now

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
end group will be a group of five now

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.300 
end group will be a group of five now
I'll<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> decreases<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
I'll just do the decreases right on the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.210 
I'll just do the decreases right on the
knitting<00:01:53.640> machine<00:01:54.090> before<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.530> any<00:01:56.010> moving

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
knitting machine before I do any moving

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.359 
knitting machine before I do any moving
around<00:01:56.580> with<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> garter<00:01:57.119> bar<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.260> I'm<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
around with a garter bar so I'm going to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.109 
around with a garter bar so I'm going to
decrease<00:02:00.080> I've<00:02:01.080> got<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> group<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.799> five<00:02:02.090> then<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
decrease I've got a group of five then a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.359 
decrease I've got a group of five then a
group<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.570> four<00:02:03.920> four<00:02:04.920> four<00:02:05.820> four<00:02:06.720> four<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
group of five at the other end and you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.089 
group of five at the other end and you
can<00:02:11.159> see<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.549> that<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.909> one<00:02:12.180> two<00:02:12.659> three<00:02:13.230> four

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
can see that that is one two three four

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.720 
can see that that is one two three four
five<00:02:14.579> six<00:02:15.029> decreases<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.169> needed

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
five six decreases that I needed

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.640 
five six decreases that I needed
-<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.450> I'm<00:02:17.629> just<00:02:17.660> going<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.170> move<00:02:18.349> each<00:02:18.590> of

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
- and I'm just going to move each of

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.430 
- and I'm just going to move each of
these<00:02:19.060> onto<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> needle<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.720> right<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.260> it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
these onto the needle to the right of it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800 
these onto the needle to the right of it
doesn't<00:02:22.129> matter<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.459> could<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.700> right<00:02:22.940> or<00:02:23.300> left

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
doesn't matter it could be right or left

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.920 
doesn't matter it could be right or left
so<00:02:24.709> I'm<00:02:24.800> actually<00:02:25.040> doing<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.760> decreases<00:02:26.360> with

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
so I'm actually doing the decreases with

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:35.550 
so I'm actually doing the decreases with
a<00:02:26.959> transfer<00:02:27.560> tool<00:02:33.910> now<00:02:34.910> if<00:02:35.000> you're<00:02:35.150> decreasing

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
a transfer tool now if you're decreasing

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.490 
a transfer tool now if you're decreasing
evenly<00:02:36.560> across<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.340> row<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.930> end<00:02:39.170> up<00:02:39.319> with

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
evenly across the row you end up with

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.100 
evenly across the row you end up with
these<00:02:39.590> little<00:02:39.650> hold<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:41.480> certainly<00:02:41.930> don't

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
these little hold we certainly don't

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.050 
these little hold we certainly don't
want<00:02:42.230> holes<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.920> besides<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.730> knitting

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
want holes and besides the knitting

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.449 
want holes and besides the knitting
machine<00:02:44.170> will<00:02:45.170> lay<00:02:45.380> yarn<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.069> empty

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
machine will lay yarn in this empty

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.000 
machine will lay yarn in this empty
needle<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.030> then<00:02:47.480> your<00:02:47.629> decreases<00:02:48.260> gone<00:02:48.530> so

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
needle and then your decreases gone so

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.190 
needle and then your decreases gone so
that's<00:02:49.459> not<00:02:49.700> at<00:02:49.849> all<00:02:49.970> what<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.780> mind

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
that's not at all what you have in mind

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.759 
that's not at all what you have in mind
what<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:51.950> actually<00:02:52.190> need<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.880> do<00:02:53.590> since<00:02:54.590> we

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
what you actually need to do since we

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.319 
what you actually need to do since we
are<00:02:54.920> tied<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.549> these<00:02:55.670> needles

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
are tied to these needles

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.809 
are tied to these needles
we<00:02:56.450> don't<00:02:56.660> have<00:02:56.870> sticks<00:02:57.829> for<00:02:58.190> needles<00:02:58.549> like<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
we don't have sticks for needles like a

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.300 
we don't have sticks for needles like a
hand<00:02:59.209> knitter<00:02:59.450> we<00:03:00.049> need<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.410> move<00:03:00.650> all<00:03:01.069> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
hand knitter we need to move all the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.979 
hand knitter we need to move all the
stitches<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.049> there<00:03:03.260> are<00:03:03.470> no<00:03:04.220> holes

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
stitches in so that there are no holes

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.870 
stitches in so that there are no holes
well<00:03:05.989> if<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.380> were<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.680> move<00:03:06.860> all<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.430> stitches

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
well if I were to move all the stitches

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.270 
well if I were to move all the stitches
in<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.360> I've<00:03:08.599> done<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:08.930> before<00:03:09.170> with<00:03:09.980> one<00:03:10.190> of

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
in and I've done it before with one of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.130 
in and I've done it before with one of
these<00:03:10.370> transfer<00:03:10.940> tools<00:03:11.180> then<00:03:11.750> I'd<00:03:11.900> have<00:03:12.079> to

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
these transfer tools then I'd have to

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.020 
these transfer tools then I'd have to
move<00:03:12.440> these<00:03:12.620> over<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.160> move<00:03:13.340> these<00:03:13.489> over<00:03:13.640> and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
move these over and move these over and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.420 
move these over and move these over and
just<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.840> would<00:03:14.989> constantly<00:03:15.620> be<00:03:15.829> moving<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.250> few

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
just I would constantly be moving a few

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.550 
just I would constantly be moving a few
stitches<00:03:16.700> over<00:03:17.180> or<00:03:17.480> maybe<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.989> would<00:03:18.110> take<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
stitches over or maybe I would take the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.319 
stitches over or maybe I would take the
whole<00:03:18.680> business<00:03:18.890> off<00:03:19.310> on<00:03:19.489> waste<00:03:19.730> yarn<00:03:19.910> and

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
whole business off on waste yarn and

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.370 
whole business off on waste yarn and
then<00:03:20.780> pick<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.170> back<00:03:21.350> on<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.760> Garter<00:03:23.150> bar

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
then pick it back on but the Garter bar

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.379 
then pick it back on but the Garter bar
provides<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.620> wonderful<00:03:24.889> shortcut<00:03:25.790> for

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
provides a wonderful shortcut for

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.210 
provides a wonderful shortcut for
getting<00:03:26.690> all<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:27.019> these<00:03:27.139> stitches<00:03:27.410> moved<00:03:27.950> in

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
getting all of these stitches moved in

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.210 
getting all of these stitches moved in
so<00:03:29.120> let's<00:03:30.049> start<00:03:30.290> by<00:03:30.410> bringing<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.799> needles

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
so let's start by bringing the needles

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.050 
so let's start by bringing the needles
out<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:32.500> cord<00:03:33.500> I'm<00:03:34.340> going<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.760> put<00:03:34.940> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
out and cord I'm going to put the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.819 
out and cord I'm going to put the
stopper<00:03:35.569> on<00:03:35.750> now<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:35.989> explained<00:03:36.410> in<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.680> first

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
stopper on now I explained in the first

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.849 
stopper on now I explained in the first
lesson<00:03:37.160> how<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.060> adjust<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.600> stopper<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.680> that

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
lesson how to adjust the stopper so that

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.789 
lesson how to adjust the stopper so that
it<00:03:39.950> fits<00:03:40.220> your<00:03:40.459> machine<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.959> reason<00:03:42.680> these

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
it fits your machine the reason these

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.319 
it fits your machine the reason these
come<00:03:43.100> with<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.310> screws<00:03:43.760> on<00:03:43.970> them<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.299> that

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
come with the screws on them is that

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.780 
come with the screws on them is that
they<00:03:44.600> don't<00:03:44.750> fit<00:03:45.019> every<00:03:45.350> machine<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.579> have

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
they don't fit every machine so you have

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.479 
they don't fit every machine so you have
to<00:03:46.970> adjust<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.450> once<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.410> stopper<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.250> the

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
to adjust it once the stopper is on the

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.550 
to adjust it once the stopper is on the
needles<00:03:49.819> cannot<00:03:50.209> move<00:03:50.389> left<00:03:50.720> or<00:03:50.959> right

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
needles cannot move left or right

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.069 
needles cannot move left or right
they<00:03:52.069> are<00:03:52.190> quite<00:03:52.489> rigid<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.180> they<00:03:53.630> can't<00:03:53.870> move

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
they are quite rigid and they can't move

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.280 
they are quite rigid and they can't move
forward<00:03:54.590> or<00:03:54.739> back<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.340> or<00:03:55.459> out<00:03:55.609> they<00:03:55.850> are

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
forward or back in or out they are

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.569 
forward or back in or out they are
they're<00:03:57.290> stuck<00:03:57.650> right<00:03:58.069> there

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
they're stuck right there

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.440 
they're stuck right there
so<00:03:59.090> I'll<00:03:59.389> just<00:03:59.599> slide<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.079> Knitting<00:04:00.380> back

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
so I'll just slide the Knitting back

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.309 
so I'll just slide the Knitting back
which<00:04:02.450> opens<00:04:03.049> the<00:04:03.260> latches<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:04.750> I'm<00:04:05.750> going<00:04:06.139> to

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
which opens the latches and I'm going to

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.509 
which opens the latches and I'm going to
use<00:04:06.500> life's

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
use life's

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.270 
use life's

some of the needles have two stitches on
them<00:04:34.070> because<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.400> decreases<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:36.020> that's<00:04:36.290> no

one's on lift up move over so I continue
across<00:05:45.200> the<00:05:46.130> needles<00:05:47.050> filling<00:05:48.050> in<00:05:50.590> the

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
across the needles filling in the

stitches and when I get to an empty spot

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.740 
stitches and when I get to an empty spot
I<00:05:55.160> have<00:05:55.460> to<00:05:55.610> move<00:05:55.790> over<00:05:56.290> so<00:05:57.290> that<00:05:57.320> I<00:05:57.530> can<00:05:58.720> put<00:05:59.720> a

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
holes and the Knitting has become

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.530 
holes and the Knitting has become
narrower<00:06:05.870> by<00:06:06.680> decreasing<00:06:07.340> evenly<00:06:07.910> across<00:06:08.030> the

room there are plenty of situations in
knitting<00:06:11.540> where<00:06:12.230> it's<00:06:12.380> much<00:06:12.560> more<00:06:12.740> attractive

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
knitting where it's much more attractive

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.330 
knitting where it's much more attractive
to<00:06:13.460> increase<00:06:14.030> or<00:06:14.210> decrease<00:06:14.330> evenly<00:06:15.320> and<00:06:15.770> very

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
to increase or decrease evenly and very

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.360 
to increase or decrease evenly and very
often<00:06:16.700> you<00:06:17.180> see<00:06:17.510> this<00:06:18.230> instruction<00:06:19.100> to

you get to the top of the
and<00:06:36.050> the<00:06:37.210> admitting<00:06:38.210> is<00:06:38.390> needs<00:06:39.080> to<00:06:39.200> be

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
and the admitting is needs to be

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.310 
and the admitting is needs to be
narrower<00:06:39.770> all<00:06:40.160> over<00:06:40.970> so<00:06:41.720> that<00:06:41.870> it<00:06:41.960> will<00:06:42.110> fit

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
narrower all over so that it will fit

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.710 
narrower all over so that it will fit
the<00:06:42.470> head<00:06:42.760> okay<00:06:43.760> I<00:06:43.820> just<00:06:44.060> pushed<00:06:44.300> that<00:06:44.480> back

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
the head okay I just pushed that back

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.500 
the head okay I just pushed that back
and<00:06:45.020> I<00:06:45.080> proceeded<00:06:45.500> with<00:06:45.710> the<00:06:45.860> mini<00:06:46.100> so<00:06:46.940> I<00:06:47.300> will

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
and I proceeded with the mini so I will

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.680 
and I proceeded with the mini so I will
do<00:06:47.690> that<00:06:48.190> what<00:06:49.190> I<00:06:49.220> want<00:06:49.550> to<00:06:49.730> do<00:06:49.910> is<00:06:50.240> knit<00:06:50.540> a<00:06:50.600> few

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
do that what I want to do is knit a few

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.200 
do that what I want to do is knit a few
rows<00:06:50.900> take<00:06:51.680> it<00:06:51.860> off<00:06:52.010> and<00:06:52.520> get<00:06:52.730> it<00:06:52.820> in<00:06:52.910> front<00:06:53.120> of

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
rows take it off and get it in front of

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.480 
rows take it off and get it in front of
the<00:06:53.300> camera<00:06:53.750> so<00:06:54.290> that<00:06:54.320> you<00:06:54.470> can<00:06:54.740> see<00:06:55.040> how<00:06:55.310> that

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
the camera so that you can see how that

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:10.150 
the camera so that you can see how that
looks<00:06:55.730> on<00:06:55.910> the<00:06:56.060> knit<00:06:56.270> side<00:07:08.620> okay<00:07:09.620> I'm<00:07:09.920> just

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
looks on the knit side okay I'm just

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.830 
looks on the knit side okay I'm just
going<00:07:10.400> to<00:07:10.490> clip<00:07:10.730> the<00:07:10.940> yarn<00:07:11.150> and<00:07:11.390> drop<00:07:11.570> it<00:07:11.720> off

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
going to clip the yarn and drop it off

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:32.900 
going to clip the yarn and drop it off
the<00:07:12.050> machine

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:32.910 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.220 

here<00:07:33.540> is<00:07:33.840> a<00:07:33.990> decrease<00:07:34.500> right<00:07:34.950> here<00:07:35.430> the<00:07:36.330> the

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230 
here is a decrease right here the the

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.250 
here is a decrease right here the the
row<00:07:37.560> of<00:07:37.590> stitch<00:07:38.490> moves<00:07:39.120> up<00:07:39.330> like<00:07:39.600> that<00:07:39.870> and

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.260 
row of stitch moves up like that and

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.350 
row of stitch moves up like that and
here<00:07:41.040> is<00:07:41.160> one<00:07:41.370> that<00:07:41.520> just<00:07:41.760> vanishes

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 
here is one that just vanishes

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.600 
here is one that just vanishes
underneath<00:07:42.840> another<00:07:43.230> one<00:07:43.500> to<00:07:44.190> see<00:07:44.400> what<00:07:44.580> a

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:44.610 
underneath another one to see what a

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.530 
underneath another one to see what a
nice<00:07:45.440> tidy<00:07:46.440> looking<00:07:46.920> decrease<00:07:47.730> that<00:07:48.030> forms

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.540 
nice tidy looking decrease that forms

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.960 
nice tidy looking decrease that forms
you<00:07:49.110> can<00:07:49.140> I<00:07:49.620> think<00:07:49.950> at<00:07:50.070> this<00:07:50.190> angle<00:07:50.430> you<00:07:50.760> can

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:50.970 
you can I think at this angle you can

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.070 
you can I think at this angle you can
see<00:07:51.000> them<00:07:51.390> very<00:07:51.420> well

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 
see them very well

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.400 
see them very well
coming<00:07:53.070> on<00:07:53.220> across<00:07:53.610> so<00:07:54.330> that<00:07:54.360> is<00:07:54.690> how<00:07:54.900> to<00:07:54.960> use

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:55.410 
coming on across so that is how to use

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.150 
coming on across so that is how to use
the<00:07:55.770> garter<00:07:56.550> bar<00:07:56.760> to<00:07:57.510> do<00:07:57.720> decreases<00:07:58.530> all<00:07:58.740> the

00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.160 
the garter bar to do decreases all the

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:10.490 
the garter bar to do decreases all the
way<00:07:59.310> across<00:07:59.610> a<00:08:00.060> row<00:08:00.690> of<00:08:00.750> knitting

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500
