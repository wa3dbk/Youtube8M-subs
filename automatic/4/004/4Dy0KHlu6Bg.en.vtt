00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.419 
concept doing the time lapses you said a
quick<00:00:07.529> look<00:00:07.680> at<00:00:07.770> grid<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.069> can<00:00:08.189> see<00:00:08.309> they've

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
quick look at grid you can see they've

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.190 
quick look at grid you can see they've
got<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.700> laws<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.059> almost<00:00:09.420> identical<00:00:09.929> images

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
got the laws of almost identical images

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.419 
got the laws of almost identical images
are<00:00:10.500> basically<00:00:10.769> taken<00:00:11.219> every<00:00:12.000> five<00:00:12.179> seconds

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
are basically taken every five seconds

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.430 
are basically taken every five seconds
jump<00:00:14.429> down<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> bottom<00:00:15.049> and<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.199> can<00:00:16.260> see

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it's trying to produce full-size files

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.889 
it's trying to produce full-size files
at<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> rate<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> 24<00:00:59.640> second<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.629> honest

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
at a rate of 24 second and to be honest

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.110 
at a rate of 24 second and to be honest
that<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> lot<00:01:02.789> especially

a full screen size which is bigger than

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
a full screen size which is bigger than
HD<00:01:05.489> size<00:01:06.320> now<00:01:07.320> looking<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:09.080> down

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
HD size now looking here and I have down

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that's here you can see the duration so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
that's here you can see the duration so
we<00:01:14.040> see<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.340> slide<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> 516<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.020> it's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
we see it was slide one a 516 and it's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
we see it was slide one a 516 and it's
23<00:01:16.710> seconds<00:01:17.130> long<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.880> useful<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.240> if

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
23 seconds long this is useful for if

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
look at that and I'm just going to go

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.390 
look at that and I'm just going to go
into<00:02:36.300> finder<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.440> have<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.950> open<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
into finder and I have this open in the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.290 
into finder and I have this open in the
background<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.450> our<00:02:40.020> five<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.350> called<00:02:40.530> LR<00:02:40.950> one

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
background so our five is called LR one

00:02:41.300 --> 00:03:03.620
