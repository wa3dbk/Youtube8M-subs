00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.490
 hello to you Markart and today 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.390
 we will be the second part of the best cards in 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.600
 minecraft and today I chose for this 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.060
 the release of the cap series and the dust I left 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.630
 I think this series is much familiar to almost 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.930
 that to everyone who is watching me now and I 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.270
 I chose the card of this series when under 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.640
 called spellbound caves it's probably 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.300
 one of the most famous cards from this 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.680
 series and in my opinion this is the best 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.800
 map from this series 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.820
 although I went through other cards and anime 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.550
 everyone liked me too 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.310
 but I think this is the best 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.280
 beautiful hardest and so on and 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.380
 that but for those who are not familiar with 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.739
 This series of cards will tell you what's the point 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.530
 of these cards for winning this card 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.390
 no need to go somewhere until the end i'm talking about 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.520
 You can walk on the idea just in any 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.400
 okay but our main goal will be 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.390
 just collect all kinds of wool which 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.549
 is on this card 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.370
 Well basically it's all just such 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.460
 wool colors and for them there is actually 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.740
 on the map for each victory monument here 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.140
 on this you just put wool when u 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.070
 you completely the moment you are filled you 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.750
 you win but in general everything is clear 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.350
 the card is just full of all kinds 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.049
 caves and grottoes locks the corridors and 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.510
 Of course everywhere there is a bunch just 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.200
 all sorts of enemy mobs that you 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.960
 will interfere 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.210
 move on and collect all new 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.790
 and new types of wool that's why i 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.150
 I consider this series of cards the most hardcore 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.000
 card series and especially this card 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.040
 on it at the end you just start already 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.350
 panic don't understand what to do because 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.979
 that all your belongings have long been burned in 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.960
 lava you are constantly under fire 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.940
 ha of feet of different 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.910
 all kinds of place of and archers on you 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.190
 just crowds go zombies and creeper 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.140
 when you find the next wool you with 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.930
 enthusiasm start to continue 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.540
 continue to look for the next six because 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.520
 that there is already some kind of promotion and 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.530
 you understand that all this is not in vain 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.930
 sometimes to move you further 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.100
 will have to dig into the ground and just 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.400
 dig somewhere ass blooded like 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.220
 would be there in the same way so to say 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.019
 take cover from the fire of enemies because 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.900
 just openly if you go then you 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.209
 immediately killed and of course on this one 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.820
 map besides crowds of zombies and skeletons 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.340
 creeper and other all kinds of enemy 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.860
 mobs you can find wonderful 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.600
 traps are exactly those traps that you 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.900
 perhaps even never seen before 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.120
 that is, they were very interesting 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.430
 invented by the author himself for example me 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.650
 very pleased with such a trap that there 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.780
 just go to the corridor 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.540
 the corridor seems to see just in the corridor 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.280
 the chest you come to the chest and from that 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.049
 just fall through the floor and it's not easy 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.510
 some there are to his wife's plate and 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.500
 there is no corridor at all 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.510
 not 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.269
 nothing like that at all just 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.150
 nothing just nothing at all here well 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.120
 Of course, for those who understand 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.750
 Redstone it probably will not be 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.880
 the riddle 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.370
 Well, those who still do not understand 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.079
 redstone maybe it will intrigue well 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.180
 what the fish and everything said about this 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.670
 cards so I advise everyone who is still in it 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.340
 I have not played such probably enough 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.280
 a lot but it's amazing enough 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.530
 because the card is just awesome this one 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.900
 of my favorite cards too, like their type 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.660
 Sampson generally advise everything in her 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.970
 play necessarily just passing it 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.640
 it will take you a lot probably not 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.130
 less than ten hours 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.570
 cards is very large and maybe not even 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.910
 the size of the apple card itself is simple and and 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.040
 difficulties meaning you are constantly being 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.840
 stop from the heaps of zombies and 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.910
 return you will have to return 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.500
 where you died but all this is all 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.549
 understandable, but in general, and put everything 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.709
 huskies 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.470
 sign subscribe and don't forget
