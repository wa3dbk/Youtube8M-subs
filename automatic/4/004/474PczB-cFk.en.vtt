00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.639
 and so three and a half hours a long way 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.400
 yes even plus an hour on the road and we 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.560
 practically already in camp every year but in 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 different places this festival takes place and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.340
 every time the organizers find 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.130
 beautiful place in the center 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.289
 settled now still hunting 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.660

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.840
 conical tent made of poles 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.960
 estimates are common with skins of bison or deer 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 models are just dense matter 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.010
 painted by local craftsmen 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.239
 there is a fire inside such a structure 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.890
 in which you can keep on 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.329
 throughout the day and not be afraid 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 suffocate from the smoke 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.829
 we were one of the first therefore 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.920
 quickly found places for tents 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.210
 beautiful view but as it turned out to sleep on 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.320
 the slope is not the best idea that hard 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.600
 crawling every hour 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 while somehow sorting out the floor accurate 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.119
 wisdom went to explore the territory 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.979
 a small one flowed through the camp 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.530
 rivulet therefore in several places 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.350
 through it was to bridge the gap in the form of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.000
 flimsy but picturesque and as it turned out 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.000
