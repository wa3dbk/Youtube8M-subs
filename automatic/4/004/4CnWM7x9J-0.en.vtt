00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:03.130
 Takinomori Seiki 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.130
 The liquid has been renewed 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.520
 ex + 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.520
 Had one voice 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.819
 It is called a machine that cuts a lot 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.309
 It is against that 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.309
 High precision opportunities 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.579
 Essenbant in a typical difference 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.919
 Generally, it is processed a lot as that part processing recently 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.919
 I want to expand sales 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.510
 You are a robot 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.200
 If you are up before 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.590
 I'm thinking of making it change to human beings 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.590
 I'll ease the bad things that humans have done 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.880
 I thought about that 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.640
 bea there 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.570
 Though it is a pallet changer 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.440
 Usually the best 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.600
 Creative power with one word 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.820
 This time the robot 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 Draw out separately 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.410
 Still he will 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.270
 The protection is complete 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.270
 Before and after the next drawer open and want to eat 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.190
 There is no registration here. 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.940
 So here is 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.970
 Such my own 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.240
 Conventional Best 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.290
 Self-propelled robots are once powered 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.440
 I think so at this time 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.480
 Move on its own 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.070
 I made it move by the impression of the robot 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.260
 By this 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.020
 In terms of cost 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.300
 Probably compared with the conventional system 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.650
 Soon after Thailand 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.650
 I wonder if I can build it 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.070
 how bateman is a robot 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.370
 Do you use a lot efficiently? 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.240
 about it 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.030
 First as the name of eco-friendly 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.410
 Articulated robot 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.410
 Kawajiri Prosecution 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 I think that the price is going to go 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.080
 Do you complain to the mayor 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.900
 I do not know if it will be Eniwa 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
 Clearly the post 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.189
 As if it is a mail system
