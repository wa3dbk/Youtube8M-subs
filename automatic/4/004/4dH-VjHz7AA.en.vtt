00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.040 
use this turret i use the turrets on
this<00:00:37.500> map<00:00:37.680> more<00:00:38.399> often<00:00:38.730> than<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.719> if

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
this map more often than not because if

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
this map more often than not because if
you<00:00:40.260> figure<00:00:40.620> out<00:00:40.770> where<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> spawns<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.879> for

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you figure out where the spawns are for

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.510 
you figure out where the spawns are for
the<00:00:42.120> enemies<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.750> either<00:00:42.870> use<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.800> turret

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the enemies you can either use a turret

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.250 
the enemies you can either use a turret
there's<00:00:44.820> three<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> them<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.510> map<00:00:45.719> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
there's three of them on this map you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
there's three of them on this map you
can<00:00:46.410> use<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.800> them<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.850> kills<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
can use one of them to to get kills and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.910 
can use one of them to to get kills and
so<00:00:48.870> i'll<00:00:48.989> show<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.200> guys<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.410> i<00:00:49.620> use<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so i'll show you guys that i use it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160 
so i'll show you guys that i use it
pretty<00:00:50.010> effectively<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.840> end<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:51.930> getting

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
pretty effectively and end up getting

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.479 
pretty effectively and end up getting
quite<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> few<00:00:52.530> kills<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> turret<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
quite a few kills with the turret and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.459 
quite a few kills with the turret and
making<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.059> happen<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
making this happen so you just have to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.750 
making this happen so you just have to
kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.710> predict<00:00:55.949> where<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.129> enemies<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
kind of predict where the enemies at and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.459 
kind of predict where the enemies at and
it's<00:00:56.940> kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> crazy<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.899> end<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.260> getting

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's kind of crazy that I end up getting

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.020 
it's kind of crazy that I end up getting
this<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.829> TDM<00:00:59.160> I've<00:00:59.309> done<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> couple<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.910> them

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this in TDM I've done a couple of them

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.290 
this in TDM I've done a couple of them
in<00:01:00.120> TDM<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> seems<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:02.300> actually

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
in TDM now it seems like and I actually

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.750 
in TDM now it seems like and I actually
got<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.530> row<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> got

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
got to these in a row like when I got

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.969
