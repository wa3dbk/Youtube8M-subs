 quickly and that's not a little note 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.390
 normal so formal nor could I 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 be news because the truth is not me 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.869
 gave a minute of time to talk 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.910
 about all these things but from the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.580
 weekend that watch me not that it's a 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.019
 very reliable source I repeat it again 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.219
 just left to say that September of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.750
 10 to spend announcing your new iphone 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.559
 that which is the one that everyone has 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.510
 called iphone s 5 that then have 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 a lot of rumor came out and I wanted to talk about 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.020
 you of what is happening I think 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 that one of the most important is going to be 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.270
 that iphone I know it's the other that they're going to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.579
 be pulling out say the rumors that it's going to 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.039
 be a much cheaper version now 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.070
 what is known until now is that almost 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.989
 is already confirmed now we do not know what 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.000
 price but there have been many 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 photos that look very real and even 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.540
 the colors came out like in front of 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.360
 you some pictures will come out 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.000
 white green pink pink I do not know what color 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.190
 you have a blue light blue and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.350
 also like a yellow then those 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.870
 are the official colors that can 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 launch that cheaper line if you can 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.250
 say so completely plastic the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.590
 back then it 's interesting 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.380
 see if it's going to be a coming reality 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 is going to be the ipad 5 good is already 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.330
 confirmed also by what's vision that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.400
 it will be in the same way as the mini 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.700
 ipad on a previous beach I am 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.200
 talking about the screens and that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.270
 it looked a lot like what the mine was and 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.920
 worse, you and I confirmed it in the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.040
 most times that wall street no longer 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.290
 which is like a source of information or 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.450
 be they are reporters and they have magazine and 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.100
 they also have their diary every time 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.869
 they say something really is done 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.090
 reality especially for the company 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.729
 little by little like they have something for 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.130
 there they know something and the last thing is going to be 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.500
 what's the iphone is this is the official 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.890
 that they are going to launch that that if you know and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.890
 that part if what is going to be is what 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.960
 it is already the tactile footprint is almost 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.790
 practically confirmed now 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.370
 operate this button will have now 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.870
 three parts let's start as with where 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.400
 we touch ourselves it's going to be plastic 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.470
 which is normally going to look plastic 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.050
 but under that there's going to be a layer of 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.720
 aluminum and below that of what it is to 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.090
 edge then have those layers for 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.550
 can read our fingerprint to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.800
 that this works because it really is not 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.810
 both to enter the cell phone but already 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.820
 the cell phone to the new iphone what is going to 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.100
 bring will be to be able to pay with 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.780
 credit card then before giving 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.000
 that credit card transaction 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.610
 you will be able to put your fingerprint for 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.010
 confirm that you are you then that's going to 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.870
 work here in the USA still not be 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.790
 sees a lot of future in Latin America but 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.410
 that's why it's going to bring that good option 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.120
 people that has been a little bit of the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.280
