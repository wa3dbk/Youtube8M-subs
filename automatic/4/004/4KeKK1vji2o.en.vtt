00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello willis to start the week with 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.720
 a mega parkour fame but and because it is 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.130
 fail 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.230
 [Music] 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.150
 well this is what it 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.900
 is that he does the parkour and follows 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.800
 the head against chords 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.859
 okay 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.829
 the case is pretty well done but I 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.570
 I wanted to play I did not want to see this anyway 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.390
 let's see what we have here glass 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.920
 break nothing because you do not always see 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.440
 also these games because I have 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.449
 caught the trick is worth what always 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.500
 you have to try to help him with a 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:44.370
 tap with with the wheel 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 there's all busted and this seems like 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.730
 is with a little bit more penalty 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.730
 trying to look at what busted 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.760
 the dead child is or is not dead 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.370
 is that it looked plasta and we discarded it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.269
 had tried to destroy it with the helmet 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 but good 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.210
 now it's difficult maybe not so much 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.370
 OK 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.140
 and this one stays here blocked that we're going 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.180
 towards the top through these 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.330
 perfect we have a small amount of the level 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.820
 2 leaves here wind to try not 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.730
 click, it's ok but we continue 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.540
 alive even if I miss an arm there is 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:33.240
 we do not have it we have it well 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.130

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.180

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.630
 that is, it has pierced my head and it happened to me 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.100
 long 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.100
 finally come let's go back 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.860
 [Music] 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.860
 well, nothing has clicked on me again 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.269

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.519
 we have over I am very very bad 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.360
 partner seriously I can not believe that 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.830
 I'm costing so much there is one 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.340
 come and if I'm doing like that a little bit 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.340
 the sardine 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.180
 this what happens if I make the sardine 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.900
 Look, look, look, look here and here 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.730
 I jumped and jumped and they just 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.670
 shatter seriously how can it be so 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.980
 complicated a map I know what happens to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.790
 the people who made the maps are 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.400
 week nothing hears no that is clear 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.680
 that the week starts very badly but 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.120
 What a bad sight, I'm left here with desire 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.610
 to make another impossible to see if he is 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.890
 it happened it's worth it we have it perfect and 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:14.519
 half click if not exploded 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.290
 It's worth it's worth, and there it is, it's there 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.070
 is the first guy agreed but that 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.070
 how many skewers 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.970
 people are very buzzed 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.640
 I'm going to chest against the mine 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.300
 victory 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.970
 I do not know how noses it has been victory 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.640
 because none other than touches my skin 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.950
 in victory but in the end it's worth first 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.930
 love second victory in him 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.310
 in short mother lies in everything we have 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.310
 played with everyone call ya 6 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.050
 what the fuck 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.050
 we have death 11 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.549
 but ready because it falls everything was at 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.280
 well way or something like that 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.360
 there 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.950
 we go there but you are wrong and I do not 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.620
 I can believe that you do not move, do not you 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.209
 move 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.769
 and this I do not understand what happened 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.449
 but it's victory and look with that 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.510
 I'm glad because today we are raising the 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:24.970
 ribbon that we had started very badly 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.920
 to see the final and the final jump I suppose 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.100
 that will have to let go of this already 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.100
 he has released 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.080
 let's keep trying to see if 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.360
 went even further Venga Venga Venga 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.850
 come my friend come not this time has gone 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.280
 fatal have stayed on one back nor 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.280
 even he had time to see that it was him 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.430
 ok let's go like that let's go like that a somersault 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.320
 caught whose cattle has come up 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.520
 the last one I do not know which one was I think that 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.040
 It has been because it hooks me with my feet 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.760
 to the bicycle and has taken more strength 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:02.920
 let's go ultimate rock swing to see if 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.010
 It is true that it is definitive and how it is 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.010
 something 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.860
 ok no no no no no this is wrong because 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.130
 he does not let me leave he was hooked 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.410
 vÃ©lez and now perfect go jump just 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.470
 to finally defend everything had to follow 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.960
 the instructions are worth there we throw ourselves 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.430
 we bounce a bit but we continue 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.680
 It is slowly that the instructions 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.680
 they were wrong put first zy up and 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.310
 was not to catch him up and then give him 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.470
 the zeta 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.030
 anda mira has remained an arm I do not know 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.070
 or why it was said he has stayed there 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.890
 but good and I hope you are comfortable 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.030
 Well, look and there is a foot 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.890
 because not because they have put that 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.810
 character to play if it is for 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.980
 paraguay makes a road suite I think 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.409
 this is the worst I could have put 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:51.499
 it's not worth we continue here 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:54.459
 I go here up to the top 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:56.419
 there we have it if we finish before playing 

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:57.739
 come on we hold on here is that on 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.959
 it is staying like the head and the 

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:02.569
 arms hooked on all sides to the 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:04.099
 perfect has gone too much speed me 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.330
 There could be another plane, but I did not 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:10.159
 I can believe seriously how to see come 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.529
 it can not be it can not be that it has 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:16.499
 remained this without falling but why 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.489
 no no no no no no no no i do not explain 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.829
 but because he is stuck 

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:21.899
 you understand it because I do not come 

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:25.079
 but if I should think a thousand 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:27.719
 tons here live that is pricking 

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:32.239
 the ass million times there we have it 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:35.399
 do not come not not from here I do not go out anymore 

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:37.889
 but because there is there is 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:39.779
 I presented myself to puntito to fall not me 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.419
 I can believe it I will surely take 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:45.299
 less if I had not put back to 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:50.629
 start the map but I have to achieve 

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:53.039
 I have to do it, come on, let's go 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:56.219
 I also pass this because it is 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:57.359
 getting very nervous and watch me come back 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:00.419
 to start by look does not realize 

00:06:57.359 --> 00:07:02.879
 I wanted to leave but I have restored it well 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.619
 that we see again if this time I get 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:07.949
 a little better 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:10.019
 there we fall perfect and see if I do not know 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.029
 nothing is left this time because 

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:14.279
 I played if I had a bad luck 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:16.070
 now look at my arm come back again to 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:18.740
 stay there in order 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.360
 we fall perfect acosta do vale now 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.810
 I have fallen very well because I can 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.810
 to hook
