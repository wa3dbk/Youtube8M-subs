00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.799
 hello with you technical review from 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.980
 astroscope labs 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.650
 I am Viktor Leonidov among a huge selection 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.779
 small and compact weather stations for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.329
 home use can highlight 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.480
 models with accurate measurements of parameters 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.340
 quite affordable price right now we are with 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.559
 you consider exactly this 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.119
 practical German from the company of typhus 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.119
 models where i am 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.519
 the station comes in classic for 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 tc company and strong carton 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.649
 except for the appearance of the station on the box 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.469
 all languages ​​are represented 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.749
 the basic functions of meteorological instrument kit 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.570
 station supplies include neatly 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:54.149
 packed and base unit instruction and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.920
 necessary documents radio sensor 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.289
 temperature and humidity 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.329
 as well as an external fixing kit 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.609
 sensor on the wall or another 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.940
 vertical surface of the body 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.740
 base unit and remote sensor 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.230
 made of durable plastic Syro 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.990
 black colors to run 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.240
 the station to work must first thing 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.790
 turn on thermo hydra range sensor 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.830
 whose actions are in line of sight 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.500
 power meter 100 reaches the base 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.290
 The station carries three type batteries 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.930
 hey hey a remote sensor from two 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.670
 type 3 batteries 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.520
 put the batteries consider 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.980
 more work station remote sensor 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.470
 designed for mounting it on the wall 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.350
 using a special clip that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.960
 is fixed on it by screws entering 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.000
 the sensor kit has a sealed rear 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 battery compartment 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.120
 screwed with one screw and front 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.860
 display showing measured data 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.660
 base station can be installed on 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.510
 horizontal surface using 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.370
 special stand legs as well 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.760
 can be mounted on the wall with 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.630
 holes above the battery compartment 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.330
 let's take a look at the big screen 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.110
 visually divided into four working 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.420
 region 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.640
 those upper screen area serves to 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.910
 display all information regarding 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.580
 date and time of day not week as well 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.490
 alarm function here contains 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.220
 information about timescale indicator 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.230
 clock synchronization with world standard 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.990
 time under the upper area 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.330
 there is a second section with information 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.980
 temperature and humidity measured 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.770
 inside your room 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.350
 here you can also find indicators 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.350
 upper lower asked limits 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.800
 measurements as well as indicators of their total 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.050
 signal is followed by the narrowest section 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.959
 carrying information to external work 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.959
 sensor and containing minimum indicators 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.420
 and maximum measured information is lower 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.360
 the section displays information similarly 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.760
 2 sections but measured for outdoor 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.239
 weather conditions are also displayed here 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.330
 information about current weather conditions and 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.190
 trends of their changes 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.570
 information pressure and and 100 grams and its 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.959
 changes in the last 24 hours 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.780
 humidity measurement range from 25 to 99 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.190
 percent range measurement outdoor 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.940
 temperatures range from -40 to + 65 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.330
 and internal from 0 to plus 60 degrees 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.810
 Celsius measurement accuracy 1 tenth 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.720
 degrees and one percent station fixes 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.760
 minimum and maximum values 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.920
 temperatures and humidity and pressure with 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.130
 registering their time and date 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.830
 using the min-max button you can 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.569
 view all this management data 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.810
 stations there are 5 functionally 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:58.930
 buttons 4 on the front side and a button 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.989
 backlight sleep on the top end summing up 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.879
 I want to note the results of the review immediately 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.450
 great compact design and quality 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.620
 performing the instrument washing station has 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.469
 not to overload the conductive balanced 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.269
 Vision large display to disadvantages 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:15.879
 stations can be attributed to 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.430
 Connect only one remote radio 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.070
 sensor and a slightly higher price at 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.729
 compared to similar models 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.849
 represented on the market 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.400
 however, this is quite offset by high 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.639
 measurement accuracy and excellent 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.650
 maximum removal of the remote sensor 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.330
 regarding the base unit with you was 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.110
 technical review from the laboratory 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.780
 astroscope 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.780
 see you soon in our store
