00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 Talk to me, guys, beauty bumpers here. 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.260
 all are welcome to another video 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.270
 here on the channel I know the number 5 side 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.400
 of youtube or in the middle not to do 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.050
 Light training videos but today 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.520
 I have a good legal matter in attack 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.200
 video with you have created a great 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.540
 news for jackson pollock fans 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.969
 in case the main here of my channel 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.010
 today , January 27th , microsoft 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.899
 announced that they have bought the franchise 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.160
 games ward in other words the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.159
 microsoft bought the rights to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.390
 to produce games with the name of john ward 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.800
 and the case is a large speaking 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.199
 speculation on the internet that microsoft 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.659
 had not yet renewed the rights of 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.370
 the exclusivity of the series, which could 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.129
 to lead the series is a title 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.050
 multiplatform what many think 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.409
 would be very healthy until I agree that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.089
 It would be really cool if your title is that one. 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.949
 to various platforms and everything else 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.690
 finally this microsoft exclusivity well 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.339
 who delivers the gold saying they will leave 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 even days titles the worst for xbox 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.570
 360 and for xbox bock is pretty cool 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.670
 because I really was hopeless 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.650
 that the microsoft web that they were 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.690
 to produce another title in the series by 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.940
 because he has not sold the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.460
 well did not have much repercussion from the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.840
 public is but apparently few days 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.270
 although still a plug that the microsoft 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.760
 whether they had put it on now 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.920
 move that soon the black in the studio 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.350
 game production will get dirty which is 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.390
 old but microsoft vancouver 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.130
 I honestly do not know any 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.690
 title they produced I do not know if 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.220
 produce something I needed 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.020
 Internet and I saw that they would be 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.030
 producing the exclusive title for the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.100
 Microsoft to compete with revealed I 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.320
 I do not know if this title would be half an hour 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.120
 or they are ultimately responsible for 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.010
 production next month at the door and this 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.840
 can discourage some is a new company 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.880
 but it is worth remembering that the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.280
 which was the executive producer of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.080
 three first titles in the series are 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.700
 turning now to microsoft gives 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.530
 help also will produce the ford 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 command the team new and sincerely 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.270
 This can be promising by remembering 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.069
 had a studio band producing the realm 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 they started to hit hard and left 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.599
 recovering the animal will be 15 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.280
 so maybe it's healthy for the series 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.280
 maybe it's not me I'm so worried 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.760
 I agree with the people who will stay. 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.739
 but it 's worth it in case given this chance 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.450
 at least for these guys if I wait 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.910
 that they learn the mistakes of Sunday to 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.730
 Ford was a real failure. 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.650
 I know I should be very protected. 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.260
 upgrade the first week I owe a lot 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.319
 always good is you record epic games from 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.890
 microsoft office there to flash everyone 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.709
 there 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.299
 but now it is believing in what then 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.220
 Let's see how these guys are going to produce 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.470
 I hope he does a good job and 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.079
 I'll probably be there then, I'll leave it well. 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.150
 of course leaving the smallest but maybe 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.799
 if it is not legal, if it really was 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.370
 It's kind of worth seeing what's going to be 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.950
 Cool 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.420
 I have to do what I should 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.829
 only in the future 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.989
 I try its support for a share of 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.190
 capture forms everything else but there is one 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.420
 game is not really certain then 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.560
 In the meantime I am updating the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.209
 with the news that has been 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.579
 out there is a forecast for it 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.470
 announces the game initially in e3 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.030
 this year then it looks better is to stay 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.819
 smart not viewing 100 years maybe 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.680
 not any news that went wrong with the 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.060
 dismiss time is probably knocking 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.319
 a chat with the gentlemen personal beauty 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.540
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.959
 video here with the face to cover another one 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.730
 Sometimes it 's a rare thing, but I find it 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.099
 faster producing as soon as you make the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.139
 well, anyway they 're playing but I 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.299
