 Thank you so much for liking that I have. 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.170
 fine what do you plan for your 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.809
 future both in the clash and in life 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.120
 personal is in my personal life to inform 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.510
 and as a designer, it's the college that I 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.030
 I'm basically planning 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.150
 graduate and have a normal training and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.400
 clash face the duck of the maximum level 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 Only I figured I did the calculations and I 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.650
 I figured out that plate at the maximum level and I'm going 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.049
 take three years 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.970
 is vinícius amaral asked a question that 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.170
 more than 25 million people have done 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.799
 but many people who made the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.979
 ask me how long have you played 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.820
 together with them two years and six months 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.880
 so the clash started a lot and that was 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.979
 one of the arguments started as far as 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.630
 with that the beginning has influenced 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.700
 come up today 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.680
 jo pedro guimarães da silva asked 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.229

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.060
 Just for you and I love it when we 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.929

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.319
 What is it that I'm getting what I 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.450
 I really want to teach you in 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.750
 play show the things that I do that I 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.880
 learning that I have already learned and new 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.220
 tactics and cool things 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.220
 Anyway, I want to be content 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.290

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.280
 so yes, I really like how you guys come 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.980
 talk to me 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.019
 leonardo gabriel asked a question 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.069
 sensational my side a hug for you 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.049
 and the environment question gef 16 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.299
 the biggest smudges you've ever made in 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:44.220
 clash of bon to I would say it is higher in 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.209
 court boot to start 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.549
 first hit 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.650
 the first currency was capped when the 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.700
 game released I was playing a month ago 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.480
 just the game and I got the 112 hp service 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.730
 or néné is for you to see eight then plays the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.850
 game for about two years and six 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.639
 months since September 2012 that the 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.220
 I play then when I started in September 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.880
 of 2012 can start on the same day 9 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.519
 3 to 1 symbian yesterday in October in 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.400
 birthday there that is for October 6th 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.470
 I was already 108 then in the month I 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.380
 be an eight-step process with only 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.510
 Everything crap was all level 3 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.280
 So nobody knew about the game yet. 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.190
 there were channels on youtube to show 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.310
 the strategies did not exist the maximum 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.459
 is 80 not only the prophets did not even arrive 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.840
 to 2008 was little in this margin of 2 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.440
 thousand 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.590
 there were no leagues and played isolated until 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.379
 That I got the hang of it's like six months. 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.379
 I understand how the game worked 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.290
 What to expect from the next update 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.709
 question of good oak viaduct and water 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.310
 I think I could lower the price of 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.840
 interest 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.090
 I think you're going to agree with him. 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.160
 The world is very expensive then to me 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.200
 which supports level 10 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.680
 I want to show for example 9 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.049
 10 points so much for you there that 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.799
 are occupying their world in the 7th century 289 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.180
 It is the very expensive ones that have always been and already 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.040
 found the prisoners 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.010
 they put there do not lower more 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.960
 put the walls is little I do not know 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.750
 Why did they do this but they 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.200
 placed the walls in a period of two 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.610
 months maybe 12 months for you got it 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.340
 the country from seven to eight with filling and 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.960
 29 left now after the update a 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.300
 month after that I do not know why 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.840
 They did this but now you can only 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.700
 occupy if it is from 18 to 19 9 10 and 10 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.560
 cold or ons 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.930
 so only this way you can pass 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.840
 I said I think this is a 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.130
 surface when doing this but the choice 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.660
 there is not much of it that we 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.169
 can do more than complain too much 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.000
 gentle soap the milestones of the year and made me 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.700
 a question 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.520
 I was crazy to answer the question 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.110
 that I hope you understand 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.990
 so come on, question is the following 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.040
 when will you create a clan for the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.790
 channel 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.410
 My answer is going to be that I go 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.810
 create a channel field when you have time 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.240
 because I 'm in college now 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.210
 making videos of the channel making several 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.270
 other additional things in my 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.190
 personal life and no I'm not busy 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.980
 to manage a clan 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.380
 so I think if I made a corner 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.570
 a lot of people are already very smart with me 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.220
 I would not have time to administer the 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.620
 My plan is going to do 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.620
 the clan but not now once you have a 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.930
 time maybe on vacation but no rush 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.240
 it was relaxing that when I stay I go 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.150
 to analyze a video here on the channel felipe 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.669
 Roberto does not have a tone is to ask for a 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.010
 jump in a jump you walk with 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.440
 strategy you use to push more 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.180
 like to be rude to fake 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.970
 I think the most complete strategy 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.140
 which has beards and archers with a 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.470
 curing index or perhaps rays and is a 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.930
 Last 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.570
 If you know how to use it, you'll do a lot of 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.660
 grana with lucas teixeira asked who 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.580
 lives here I live with my haiti with 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.770

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:28.229
 as well as new proposals for 10 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.819
 I already said this in other videos but 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.610
 There are several people out there. It's just 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:33.779
 you search for eg place tags 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.419
 tags on youtube 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:38.339
 and you guys find a nice tag and I commented 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.259
 here below an exit you find 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:42.360
 that I could make a bogey 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.639
 so if you sleep, sign up for the 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.520
