00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
because I my Colts with era Carthage

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.460 
because I my Colts with era Carthage
initially<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.750> very<00:01:21.900> far<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.200> either<00:01:22.320> of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
initially get very far with either of

initially get very far with either of
those<00:01:22.560> factions<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.450> think

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
those factions so I don't really think

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
those factions so I don't really think
it's<00:01:25.080> fair<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.310> rid<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.460> them<00:01:26.580> there

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it's fair to to get rid of them there

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.039 
it's fair to to get rid of them there
because<00:01:26.820> suddenly<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.570> chance<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> really

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
because suddenly get chance to really

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
because suddenly get chance to really
play<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.350> them<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.070> they're<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.880> there

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
know if you had it on your surreal but

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120 
know if you had it on your surreal but
someone<00:01:39.450> did<00:01:39.570> say<00:01:39.689> will<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.350> uploading<00:01:40.979> say

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.130 
someone did say will we be uploading say
part<00:01:41.369> 1<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.640> my<00:01:41.759> channel<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.150> part<00:01:42.479> 2<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.869> yours

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
part 1 on my channel and part 2 on yours

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410 
part 1 on my channel and part 2 on yours
and<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:43.439> part<00:01:43.649> 3<00:01:43.770> back<00:01:43.890> onto<00:01:44.040> mine<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.850> I've

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and then part 3 back onto mine but I've

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.850 
and then part 3 back onto mine but I've
never<00:01:45.570> chance<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.200> replace<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
never chance to replace that but I

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.679 
never chance to replace that but I
thought<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.159> said<00:01:47.340> sort<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.850> straight<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
thought it said sort of straight here is

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.510 
thought it said sort of straight here is
that<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.860> wouldn't<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.250> necessarily

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that that wouldn't really necessarily

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
that that wouldn't really necessarily
work<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.500> you're<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> be

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
seeing each each of our own perspectives

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
seeing each each of our own perspectives
right<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.950> sort<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.280> our<00:01:56.399> management<00:01:56.820> things

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969

have<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.760> up<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.120> probably<00:03:11.330> because<00:03:11.450> we're

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
have it up it's probably because we're

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.030 
have it up it's probably because we're
probably<00:03:11.989> preoccupied<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:12.709> other<00:03:12.890> things

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040

is it going to be how regular you know
ideally<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:26.330> know<00:03:26.450> maybe<00:03:26.660> one<00:03:26.840> or<00:03:26.900> two<00:03:26.930> parts

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
ideally you know maybe one or two parts

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.920 
ideally you know maybe one or two parts
a<00:03:27.320> week<00:03:27.500> maybe<00:03:27.799> more<00:03:28.100> but<00:03:28.310> for<00:03:28.970> now<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.750> first

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
a week maybe more but for now the first

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.030 
a week maybe more but for now the first
couple<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.290> parts<00:03:30.470> will<00:03:30.530> just<00:03:30.739> kind<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:30.920> be

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
couple of parts will just kind of be

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.550 
couple of parts will just kind of be
finding<00:03:31.489> our<00:03:31.640> funding<00:03:32.120> our<00:03:32.209> steps<00:03:32.450> finding<00:03:33.019> no

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
finding our funding our steps finding no

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.130 
finding our funding our steps finding no
out<00:03:34.239> when<00:03:35.239> each<00:03:35.390> other<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:35.660> kind<00:03:35.780> of<00:03:36.019> best

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
out when each other is kind of best

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.449 
out when each other is kind of best
available<00:03:36.410> we've<00:03:36.980> already<00:03:37.100> talked<00:03:37.370> about

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
available we've already talked about

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.830 
available we've already talked about
rough<00:03:37.790> times<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.299> seems<00:03:38.450> like<00:03:38.630> we<00:03:38.720> can

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
rough times and it seems like we can

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.620 
rough times and it seems like we can
both<00:03:39.160> kind<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.310> work<00:03:40.640> with<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.910> time<00:03:41.090> zones<00:03:41.360> I

of Carthage and unfortunately because

difference<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.370> was<00:03:52.760> unfortunate

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
difference it was unfortunate

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.030 
difference it was unfortunate
combination<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.720> was<00:03:53.840> never<00:03:53.989> going<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.260> be

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
combination that was never going to be

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.340 
combination that was never going to be
able<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.549> get<00:03:55.670> too<00:03:55.820> far<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:56.269> because<00:03:56.390> we're

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
able to get too far just because we're

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.960 
able to get too far just because we're
both<00:03:57.500> kind<00:03:57.920> of<00:03:57.980> too<00:03:58.160> busy<00:03:58.430> with<00:03:58.549> our<00:03:58.580> own<00:03:58.670> thing

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
both kind of too busy with our own thing

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.390 
both kind of too busy with our own thing
as<00:03:59.120> well<00:03:59.299> so<00:03:59.959> with<00:04:00.860> this<00:04:00.890> though<00:04:01.190> it's<00:04:01.280> going

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
as well so with this though it's going

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.030 
as well so with this though it's going
to<00:04:01.459> be<00:04:01.549> different<00:04:01.790> as<00:04:02.440> as<00:04:03.440> we<00:04:03.620> all<00:04:03.680> said<00:04:03.890> though
