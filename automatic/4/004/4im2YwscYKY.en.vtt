00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.860
 good morning today we talk about tulips and 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.730
 we do it starting from the mass 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.740
 mansion 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.240
 operation that should be done in the fall but 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.550
 even at the beginning of winter for 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.740
 allow the tulips to develop 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.960
 the root system before frosts 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.050
 the first thing to do is to 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:36.440
 prepare the seed bed where then 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:38.780
 we are going to place our tulips on 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.839
 seed bed must be distributed of the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.850
 organic substance is fine by 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.629
 universal soil but it may be fine 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.159
 also of the compost that goes later 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:55.580
 dig with not too much workmanship 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:57.680
 I now propose to mix the 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.409
 components we have distributed in 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.030
 previously to prepare a bed 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.220
 optimal for the planting of the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.560
 our jokers an important thing is 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.860
 watch the tulips see if they are 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.450
 turgid if there are no marks 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.969
 brownish on the bulb and in correspondence 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.850
 of the radical apparatus because it is this 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.890
 would compromise the success of the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.359
 your system 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.909
 now the time has come to plant i 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.280
 our bulbs you have to keep in mind that 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.390
 the bulbs should be planted at a depth 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.840
 which is twice their height 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.520
 so if the bulb and other 5 cm will have to 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.210
 be covered with a layer of earth 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.569
 at least 10 centimeters the distance between 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.319
 one v2 the other must be equal to 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:54.440
 diameter of each bulb should be set to 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.960
 dwells in groups 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.830
 of cultivars all the same to have a 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.420
 excellent result during the session is 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.810
 possible to plant the bulbs 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.040
 using special tools that 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.750
 they are used to create a hole in the ground 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.320
 where we will then go to plant i 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.820
 bulbs has the desired depth that 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.940
 it must always be double 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:26.540
 of the height of the mortgage so we cover is 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.810
 the work is over and the rodents can 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.060
 pose a threat to ours 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.750
 tulips as they tend to eat i 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.780
 bulbs and a possible defense is that of 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.090
 create barriers around ours 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.660
 bulbs using other bulbs as per 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.460
 example the resulting daffodils 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.740
 poisonous for rodents and tend to 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.630
 defend our tulips once 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.540
 when the bulbs are planted we can cover them 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.660
 with the soil we removed from 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.660
 hole 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.040
 and therefore compact the finished soil 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.530
 the putting operation again there 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.480
 the only thing left is to abundantly water the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.380
 surface that wait for the next 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.950
 spring 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.850
 this operation necessary for 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.959
 stimulate the development of the apparatus 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.459
 radical before winter with arrival 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.060
 our tulipas are in good weather 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.489
 we will have to tick we must 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.980
 guarantee them a good water supply 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.519
 therefore the earth must always be moist 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.350
 here we can see the tulips in phases 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.580
 different of growth will put 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:49.489
 therefore the leaves will develop first 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:53.200
 then the stem flowering a draft flower 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.790
 and the flower in all its splendor 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.620
 during the flowering period it will be 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.530
 need to increase the frequency of 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.630
 wetting and adding to the water that 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.299
 we will use to wet the tulips a 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:12.650
 dedicated and specific fertilizer for the 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:15.290
 bulbous we take the vial 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.120
 in this case we have filled the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.850
 our inhalation with two liters of water 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.539
 we will therefore put two notches that will be 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.539
 needed 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.240
 so let's get our tulips with 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.050
 this solution enriched with phosphorus 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.240
 potassium nitrogen that will guarantee our 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.599
 flowers one more prolonged than driving 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.599
 flowering
