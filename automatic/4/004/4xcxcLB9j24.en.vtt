 with the beautiful ones I hope you are 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.600
 very well by request I bring you another 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.670
 time the nutella cake pops video 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.840
 so I hope you like this recipe 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.840
 and I leave you with the video 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.190
 let's start by crumbling our 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.640
 cupcakes this way already 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.830
 then let's add the nutella 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.190
 you see how much nutella 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.190
 you are going to take 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.090
 with your clean hands you will mix the 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.090
 ingredients 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.479
 With the mass that we have left, we are going to do 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.479
 balls in this way 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.899
 when you have the balls ready you go 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.259
 to put on a plate and you will put them 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:32.149
 the paddle sticks then you're going to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.149
 freeze for 45 minutes 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.549
 in a microwave dish we're going to 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.990
 melt our chocolate we're going to 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.990
 use to decorate cake pops 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.320
 You can also melt the chocolate with 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.320
 bain-marie so you do not burn 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.670
 and well now you're just going to decorate 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
 very carefully so you do not get 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 break your cake pops to decorate 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.740
 You can also use coconut or nuts or whatever 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.510
 that you want and once you have this 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.179
 you're going to put them in a glass and 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:13.269
 you will freeze them for 10 minutes 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.099
 and this then with this we finish now 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.069
 you can only decorate them for a gift 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.170
 they are super super fathers to give in 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.939
 valentine so good I hope that 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.769
 like the idea, leave your comments 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.769
 and see you in the next video
