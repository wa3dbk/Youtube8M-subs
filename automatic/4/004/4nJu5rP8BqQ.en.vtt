on one second please hello yeah a little

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.640 
on one second please hello yeah a little
bit<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.130> hard<00:04:46.340> time<00:04:46.810> so<00:04:47.810> yeah<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.440> know<00:04:48.530> what

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
bit a hard time so yeah you know what

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.290 
bit a hard time so yeah you know what
that<00:04:48.770> is<00:04:48.800> anyway<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:51.880> here's<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.090> power

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
that is anyway and here's the power

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.960 
that is anyway and here's the power
brick<00:04:53.479> itself<00:04:56.140> way<00:04:57.140> smaller<00:04:57.500> actually<00:04:57.979> then

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
brick itself way smaller actually then

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.530 
brick itself way smaller actually then
my<00:04:59.120> last<00:04:59.300> one<00:04:59.479> a<00:05:00.340> little<00:05:01.340> bit<00:05:01.430> lighter<00:05:01.580> too<00:05:03.460> and

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
my last one a little bit lighter too and

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.909 
my last one a little bit lighter too and
they<00:05:05.540> actually<00:05:05.690> improve<00:05:06.169> their<00:05:06.440> actually<00:05:06.800> you

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
they actually improve their actually you

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.180 
they actually improve their actually you
know<00:05:07.450> that's<00:05:08.450> cool<00:05:08.750> and

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.780 

let's<00:05:13.150> see<00:05:13.360> here<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:14.200> can<00:05:14.230> see<00:05:14.740> that<00:05:14.770> the

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.550 

focus<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:20.860> says<00:05:21.220> right<00:05:21.250> around<00:05:22.290> where<00:05:23.290> is<00:05:23.410> it

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
focus it says right around where is it

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.700 
focus it says right around where is it
right<00:05:23.890> there<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:25.360> says<00:05:25.390> 151<00:05:26.260> so<00:05:26.380> that<00:05:26.530> means

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
right there it says 151 so that means

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.870 
right there it says 151 so that means
this<00:05:26.830> is<00:05:26.980> a<00:05:27.010> Jasper<00:05:27.520> model<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:30.040> I<00:05:30.550> think<00:05:30.760> all

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
this is a Jasper model and I think all

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.160 
this is a Jasper model and I think all
the<00:05:31.030> new<00:05:31.180> 360<00:05:31.690> leaks<00:05:31.960> are<00:05:32.110> Jasper<00:05:32.530> so<00:05:34.170> all

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
the new 360 leaks are Jasper so all

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.060 
the new 360 leaks are Jasper so all
right<00:05:35.320> that's<00:05:35.800> everything<00:05:36.070> in<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.520> box<00:05:36.700> and

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
right that's everything in the box and

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.890 
right that's everything in the box and
now<00:05:39.070> for<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.460> system<00:05:39.940> itself<00:05:40.360> let's<00:05:40.870> see

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
now for the system itself let's see

00:05:42.900 --> 00:06:00.830 
now for the system itself let's see
let's<00:05:43.900> just<00:05:44.110> sit<00:05:54.960> here<00:05:55.960> it<00:05:56.110> is<00:05:56.910> 360<00:05:57.910> elite

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.360 

there's<00:06:01.840> the<00:06:02.050> 120<00:06:02.980> gig<00:06:03.040> hard<00:06:03.430> drive<00:06:05.370> there

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
there's the 120 gig hard drive there

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.710 
there's the 120 gig hard drive there
this<00:06:08.460> yeah<00:06:09.460> doesn't<00:06:09.790> so<00:06:09.850> this<00:06:10.180> looks<00:06:10.390> sick

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
this yeah doesn't so this looks sick

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.760 
this yeah doesn't so this looks sick
right<00:06:10.990> here<00:06:11.170> I<00:06:13.020> like<00:06:14.020> this<00:06:14.170> hard<00:06:14.410> drive<00:06:14.500> better

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
right here I like this hard drive better

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.280 
right here I like this hard drive better
because<00:06:15.040> well<00:06:15.520> obviously<00:06:15.910> as<00:06:16.120> well<00:06:16.360> 120<00:06:17.140> gig

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
because well obviously as well 120 gig

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.230 
because well obviously as well 120 gig
but<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.500> silver<00:06:18.040> just<00:06:18.790> like<00:06:18.910> the<00:06:19.090> original

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
but the silver just like the original

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.790 
but the silver just like the original
360<00:06:20.550> so<00:06:21.550> that's<00:06:21.730> cool<00:06:22.110> of<00:06:23.110> course<00:06:23.410> it's<00:06:23.650> got

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
360 so that's cool of course it's got

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
360 so that's cool of course it's got
the<00:06:24.040> hdmi<00:06:24.700> right<00:06:25.090> there<00:06:26.760> USB<00:06:27.760> port<00:06:28.150> and

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
the hdmi right there USB port and

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.600 
the hdmi right there USB port and
Ethernet<00:06:30.820> port<00:06:31.090> and<00:06:31.690> then<00:06:31.900> down<00:06:32.080> here<00:06:32.400> got<00:06:33.400> the

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
Ethernet port and then down here got the

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.840 
Ethernet port and then down here got the
power<00:06:33.880> supply<00:06:34.240> of<00:06:34.750> power<00:06:35.290> we<00:06:36.220> plug<00:06:36.520> in<00:06:36.640> the

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850 
power supply of power we plug in the

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:44.800 
power supply of power we plug in the
power<00:06:37.419> cord<00:06:39.990> okay

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810
