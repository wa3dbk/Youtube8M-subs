00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
course differently this year definitely

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410 
course differently this year definitely
I<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.170> gonna<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.890> hotter<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.240> lot

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I think it's gonna be hotter and a lot

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.870 
I think it's gonna be hotter and a lot
drier<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.159> dusty<00:01:23.610> which

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
drier so it's going to be dusty which

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.039 
drier so it's going to be dusty which
will<00:01:24.150> kind<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.290> come<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.650> play<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.960> think<00:01:27.960> I'm

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
will kind of come into play I think I'm

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.780 
will kind of come into play I think I'm
gonna<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.500> respect<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> course<00:01:29.490> even

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

see anybody taking it out early tomorrow

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.370

or<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.990> Saturday<00:01:46.350> um<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.570> Rory<00:01:49.079> was

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
or on Saturday um I think Rory was

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.080 
or on Saturday um I think Rory was
probably<00:01:49.740> gonna<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> lead<00:01:50.610> not

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
probably gonna be out in the lead not

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.490 
probably gonna be out in the lead not
because<00:01:51.509> she's<00:01:51.780> trying<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> push<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> just

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
because she's trying to push it just

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.200 
because she's trying to push it just
because<00:01:53.009> she's<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> strong<00:01:53.579> runner<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.060> she

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
because she's a strong runner and she

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.620 
because she's a strong runner and she
knows<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.570> force<00:01:54.810> really<00:01:55.170> well<00:01:55.579> I<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:57.210> some

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
knows the force really well I think some

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.080 
knows the force really well I think some
of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> newer<00:01:58.170> people<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:59.159> Emily<00:01:59.520> might<00:01:59.909> be

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
of the newer people like Emily might be

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.610 
of the newer people like Emily might be
up<00:02:00.210> there<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.780> well

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
up there as well

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.290 
up there as well
but<00:02:03.280> I'm<00:02:03.430> thinking<00:02:03.790> it's<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.120> be<00:02:04.240> a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
but I'm thinking it's going to be a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.150 
but I'm thinking it's going to be a
pretty<00:02:04.510> relaxed<00:02:05.110> start<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.740> then<00:02:05.860> things

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
pretty relaxed start and then things

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.700 
pretty relaxed start and then things
will<00:02:06.340> start<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.640> sort<00:02:07.030> out<00:02:07.260> within<00:02:08.260> the<00:02:08.470> first

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
will start to sort out within the first

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.290 
will start to sort out within the first
30<00:02:08.979> or<00:02:09.160> 40<00:02:09.430> miles<00:02:11.520> any<00:02:12.520> part<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:12.970> day<00:02:13.060> you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
30 or 40 miles any part of the day you

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.190 
30 or 40 miles any part of the day you
specifically<00:02:14.080> going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.350> take<00:02:14.500> easy<00:02:15.360> um<00:02:16.360> I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
specifically going to take easy um I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.230 
specifically going to take easy um I
think<00:02:17.590> once<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.370> temperature<00:02:18.610> comes<00:02:19.030> up

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
think once the temperature comes up

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.520 
think once the temperature comes up
above<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.950> know<00:02:21.070> 90<00:02:21.970> I'm<00:02:22.240> gonna<00:02:22.600> try<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> slow

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
above you know 90 I'm gonna try to slow

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.490 
above you know 90 I'm gonna try to slow
my<00:02:23.680> face<00:02:23.890> down<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.490> keep<00:02:25.030> my<00:02:25.350> temperature<00:02:26.350> as

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
my face down and keep my temperature as

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.760 
my face down and keep my temperature as
low<00:02:26.530> as<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:28.530> hopefully<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.680> will

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
low as I can and and hopefully that will

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.130 
low as I can and and hopefully that will
pay<00:02:29.950> off<00:02:30.100> later<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.940> race<00:02:31.060> has<00:02:31.690> been<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.930> hot

to a different approach to training for
westerns<00:03:23.800> things<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.190> year<00:03:24.250> what<00:03:25.209> did<00:03:25.330> you

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
westerns things this year what did you

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.540 
westerns things this year what did you
try<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.690> focus<00:03:25.900> on<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.320> your<00:03:26.500> PM<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.070> internet

went<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.790> training<00:03:28.770> um<00:03:29.770> I<00:03:30.610> think<00:03:30.730> quality<00:03:31.630> and

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
went to training um I think quality and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.880 
went to training um I think quality and
quantity<00:03:32.230> which<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:33.150> hard<00:03:34.150> balance<00:03:34.890> getting

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
quantity which is a hard balance getting

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.940 
quantity which is a hard balance getting
in<00:03:36.070> as<00:03:36.220> much<00:03:36.370> uphill<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:36.970> downhill<00:03:37.150> and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
in as much uphill and downhill and

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.250 
in as much uphill and downhill and
mileage<00:03:38.950> which<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.000> kind<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.450> gamble<00:03:40.900> when

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
mileage which is kind of a gamble when

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.370 
mileage which is kind of a gamble when
you're<00:03:41.410> coming<00:03:41.709> from<00:03:41.860> off<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.280> couch<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:43.380> think
