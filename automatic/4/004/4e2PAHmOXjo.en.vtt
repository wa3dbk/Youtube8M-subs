00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.930
 to present some ideas using 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.640
 poetry music and a lot of things flowing 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.589
 in the head that flows in the mind we go 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.289
 Doing so can not be limited to 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.289
 your mind is a universe to be explored 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.420
 I'll start with an idea and the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.230
 thinking of a great thinker who has already 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.419
 gone 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.720

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.470
 but I want 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:08.130

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.130
