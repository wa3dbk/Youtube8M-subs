00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
the way around they're just kind of even

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.720 
the way around they're just kind of even
though<00:03:36.709> that's<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.010> month<00:03:37.250> are<00:03:37.340> pretty<00:03:37.519> like

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
though that's the month are pretty like

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
as well they will just kind of go into

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.240 
as well they will just kind of go into
one<00:03:40.220> big<00:03:40.549> curl<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.269> but<00:03:42.230> for<00:03:42.590> like<00:03:42.769> gypsy

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
one big curl and but for like gypsy

one big curl and but for like gypsy
styles<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:43.640> think<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:43.910> hairs<00:03:44.090> quite<00:03:44.390> big<00:03:44.780> and

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
styles I think the hairs quite big and

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.940 
styles I think the hairs quite big and
blowing<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:47.200> I'm<00:03:48.200> going<00:03:48.440> for<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.650> curly

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
blowing and I'm going for the curly

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.070 
blowing and I'm going for the curly
style<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:50.000> I'm<00:03:50.090> actually<00:03:50.239> gonna<00:03:50.480> go<00:03:50.750> like

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
style and so I'm actually gonna go like

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.620 
style and so I'm actually gonna go like
alternates<00:03:51.769> I'll<00:03:51.950> do<00:03:52.220> away<00:03:53.060> from<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.299> face

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
alternates I'll do away from the face

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.120 
alternates I'll do away from the face
and<00:03:54.080> then<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.190> next<00:03:55.400> curl<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:56.930> do<00:03:57.080> or<00:03:57.709> do

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
and then the next curl that I do or do

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:20.930 
and then the next curl that I do or do
towards<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.730> face

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.900 

so<00:04:21.940> this<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.150> what<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.390> looks<00:04:22.600> like<00:04:23.040> now<00:04:26.910> come

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
so this is what it looks like now come

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.490 
so this is what it looks like now come
so<00:04:28.300> far<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.740> what<00:04:30.730> I<00:04:30.790> do<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.000> just<00:04:31.390> put<00:04:32.290> them<00:04:32.410> up

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
so far and what I do I just put them up

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.170 
so far and what I do I just put them up
in<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.740> hair<00:04:32.950> tie<00:04:33.280> while<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:33.580> bring<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.940> next

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
in a hair tie while I bring the next

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.880 
in a hair tie while I bring the next
layer<00:04:34.390> down<00:04:36.900> I'm<00:04:37.900> gonna<00:04:38.050> find<00:04:38.290> it<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.560> easiest

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
layer down I'm gonna find it the easiest

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.750 
layer down I'm gonna find it the easiest
way<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.130> kind<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.670> keep<00:04:39.850> them<00:04:40.060> right<00:04:40.180> away<00:04:40.360> and

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
way to kind of keep them right away and

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.490 
way to kind of keep them right away and
I<00:04:42.760> used<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.120> clip<00:04:43.330> for<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.630> antics<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.170> hair<00:04:44.380> is

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
I used a clip for the antics and hair is

00:04:44.500 --> 00:05:48.800 
I used a clip for the antics and hair is
a<00:04:44.530> bit<00:04:45.300> thinner<00:04:46.300> easier<00:04:47.200> to

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.920 

so<00:05:49.670> that's<00:05:53.210> so<00:05:54.210> that's<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.540> look<00:05:54.630> at<00:05:54.840> the

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
so that's so that's the look at the

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.510 
so that's so that's the look at the
moment<00:05:55.350> which<00:05:55.590> we<00:05:55.740> kind<00:05:55.920> of<00:05:56.010> actually<00:05:56.370> have

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
moment which we kind of actually have

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.370 
moment which we kind of actually have
backs<00:05:56.760> is<00:05:56.940> rather<00:05:57.090> cute<00:05:57.419> but<00:05:57.930> I'm<00:05:58.050> gonna<00:05:58.169> make

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
backs is rather cute but I'm gonna make

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.590 
backs is rather cute but I'm gonna make
them<00:05:58.530> all<00:05:58.680> much<00:05:59.190> bigger<00:05:59.730> and<00:06:00.030> more<00:06:00.180> kind<00:06:00.450> of
