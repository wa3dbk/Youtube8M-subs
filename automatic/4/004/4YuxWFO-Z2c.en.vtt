00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.490
 london anp martin short obviously i just got sick 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.529
 and actually went to make an evaluation but I don't think it's normal 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.109
 first i made five times a total of 9 0 from niels 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.689
 at present there was 49 cents each 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.969
 and lastly, technical details do not only come out against sns people 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.700
 can combine with 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.990
 the municipality can combine ownership made with construction needed late 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.450
 that made it very cheap against this post 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.190
 I can experiment to make the toilet owner and do it briefly 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.580
 traditionally bad 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.690
 if it fails on rare resources towering 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.949
 82 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.910
 two bottles of cleansing milk were better than expected 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.240
 I had smashed them 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.000
 the raging storms 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.660
 and then I thought 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.010
 oh well of course we are not short of anything these stories need 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.949
 and his mother 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.800
 taiwan and vietnam has moved away iphones that is now gone too 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.540
 and like a bus last week, a man and a woman went to get there 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.640
 That makes this list is met 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.820
 can manage from in these were a 39 board 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.000
 also a famous her breasts picked up 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.260
 in the market it was even schillemans present in the neighborhood 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.230
 just like the science of the past closes I have done everything that is not fun 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.900
 found 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.940
 I have a very big interest is a big blow and I think so 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.250
 and when i go to my dad i find it just hard to fit that 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.230
 now with in my room 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.980
 she works like a forgotten sometimes to oslo 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.110
 so I have this line of standard in May 2008 that I get when they get it 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.100
 a very experienced wagamama brega 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.289
 always do 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.169
 have the brush job and that those very large seagulls fidea municipal like 

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.780
 for instance 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.780
 the PVV also voted 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.949
 and this questionnaire 56 cents 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.569
 look at new eastern rabbit got from my work 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.020
 but led my retina welfare policy when I took over after the takeover 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.369
 stick to it 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.199
 we are going to go anyway 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.079
 for the health 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.999
 because since his eighteenth day on 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.079
 in the time it says it is going to be made very quickly 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.859
 and here I have welja and a new package of measures for banks 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.049
 but because they go soon I better keep one on the set that it then 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.920
 because now what I just so little I found out that not thinking about it 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.109
 then he was not 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.370
 So sometimes avoid and have one more to put 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.159
 well i was here from chemistry pack situation in spaces to the world of you already 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.159
 I know I have a very short time ago 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.199
 m 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.630
 more than the fat pens hanuman every year 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.749
 nec on its own 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:03.370
 not sit in front of the singer and want to use the sea and the perfect one 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.589
 points are at the corner look then works 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.589
 and that adorns him was sweden now has 90 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:14.279
 I also took little effort but I really hate it 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:16.529
 now also possible that people 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.900
 and if i also against warp records to what they lensink about me curious about 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.359
 it is really very difficult to clean 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.389
 well I really need very good end of the year lens the west of the country falls 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.689
 in addition to them then already a whole night in the readers the opportunity 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.079
 that reports the company is today itself I really hate 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.789
 but I have cost this 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.789
 for this 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.229
 this is basically loose ethics 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.249
 in i have two and mischa balanced voices 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.909
 It is intended that you first color 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.399
 applies that this index is dry during this time and that you are then working on one leg 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.489
 but this does not necessarily have to shine in the school 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.579
 elm 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.900
 Marie is able to read Kolder in the back so this is theirs 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.900
 life led the court again with the midday hour even though the boss 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.519
 well i have none 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.519
 mike mussel bowling alley she is well this is it 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:18.540
 mikulic nea eyes cleansing oil well you know it as the soft death of the already 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.819
 well sat also had to form soft lips 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:24.550
 I'm not going this way every day every day, not every day 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.620
 available 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.789
 I think I try these measures if it is one of these 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.330
 I laugh a lot and this time I had to take a little or a week 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.330
 not 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.069
 but then I thought yes said that this was not at all in 2009 on this 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.759
 and i did i get a little scary done 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.920
 it was the fire was really cool 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.729
 Are 400 characters 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.150
 and I sometimes keep an eye on 2 0 but now I still have a bit 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.259
 will have even more information 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.240
 room 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.460
 but still right and went solo and host and others online 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.620
 fourth pigment first 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.699
 the idea but then I want to take less than that 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.389
 he is nicole richie in itself but something like that was bothering me with my observer and his 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.169
 home 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.469
 If we are not Saban B they think of it and take it with you 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.169
 and it's not all a 40 either 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.099
 if all layers included 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.330
 these are daan 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.219
 us on the map 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.009
 after this plague, the most beautiful 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.309
 and i had to read this latin with only pigments then 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:36.580
 can be useful 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.779
 for the pain 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.249
 was using the application 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.139
 to be a muslim then i was most real over at the time of their 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.830
 Big mistakes might be very bad 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.789
 and the pigments otis I don't use them a few times about noise 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.380
 I think a lot of patchwork is not really doing very well, it really is 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.659
 very beautiful 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.580
 they would like to watch 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.330
 if i use this it usually goes better 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.060
 and this to 39 cents and so I get you six last year and I'm curious if this 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.210
 really 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.620
 according to insiders there is a bit of the vote behind his name 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.869
 means sponsors but I am not entirely sure 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:21.520
 so this time is going to try 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.879
 with the solar energy is ridiculous 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.080
 for what i wanted to get the hcl really promises a big show 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.860
 but for me to gain exit is really very small subplots I am pretty proud 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.369
 By myself 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:36.189
 analysts look until next time
