00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 how about friends welcome to www rules 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.819
 countable point hereje my name is of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.620
 Kanawa beginning and on this occasion 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.679
 I want commented I want to share with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.790
 you some issues linked to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.240
 record of transactions in the books 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.439
 accountants and also commenting on some 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.890
 aspects linked to the use of books 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.890
 electronic 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.860
 the following happens 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.560
 a recurring question 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.800
 Participants in our workshops 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.300
 electronic books is related to 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.450
 the way to correct 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.470
 a record or missed after having 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.310
 made the sale in a purchase or the book 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.060
 daily or in the book 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.400
 what is the established procedure of 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.230
 according to the regulations 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.660
 on the management of electronic books 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.160
 we have to specify a 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.830
 initial thing happens as they happen in the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.600
 physical books as it happens in a 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.920
 manual accounting in an accounting 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.160
 computerized annotation that we 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.780
 we perform in a record only 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.500
 does it only once 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.290
 what has happened to many people 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.630
 as you have been seeing the issue of use 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.170
 of an e-book program 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.759
 they have assumed that he is a pete and of all 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.229
 cases that is a tax declaration 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.229
 that is a big mistake 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.640
 the pl is an element that allows us to 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.880
 we send the accounting books the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.620
 foot information nothing 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.360
 but 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.490
 can only be used once 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.770
 per period and that's 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.880
 established in the regulations of books 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.989
 then it is not possible to talk about a 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.810
 rectification of an accounting book 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.390
 electronic or a substitute for a 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.880
 book with such electronic by not being treated 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.319
 of tax returns that is the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.940
 first aspect that you have to have in 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.520
 account 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.250
 That's where the doubt comes from, but if it's 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.080
 that I have sent an electronic book with 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.080
 a wrong record as I'm going to 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.610
 correct if you tell me that I can not send 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.550
 two or three months 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.850
 it is true for this you must 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.670
 consider in the use of 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.440
 a column that probably the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.660
 accounting software with which you 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.600
 work already come predetermined to 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.980
 time to issue the respective file 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.360
 txt 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.690
 I mean the use of the column status 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.480
 of operation 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.090
 are the key codes that we have to 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.310
 having inside needs the operation the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.280
 first is code 9 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.349
 the code 9 is key and is present 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.470
 in all books or records 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:16.700
 electronic documents that the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.710
 Resolution 379 2013 is one and that 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.140
 refers to the following 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.940
 I use code 9 if it sends 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.970
 an electronic book with some 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.280
 wrong information in a past period 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.290
 and that I want to correct example I have 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.680
 sent 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.380
 electronic record of the month d 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.550
 July 2013 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.100
 and today in January 2014 I realize 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.660
 of the error that there was 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:56.600
 that purchase was probably for 500 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.130
 soles record and I discover that the invoice 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.050
 is 5 thousand soles 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.050
 obviously I am going to correct it now 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.440
 and what I 'm going to do is at the moment 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:14.819
 prepare my January shopping record 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.519
 I'm going to that transaction but beware 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.820
 the period with which I am going to enter 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.259
 in that record does not make money 2014 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.699
 but it's going to be July 2003 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.889
 only indicating the information 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.530
 corrected and at the end the state of 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.660
 operation that we are going to consider is the 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.520
 number 9 in such a way that we 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.610
 we inform to add we are correcting 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.340
 a record of July 2000 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.490
 this concept seems interesting to me 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.129
 and it takes a bit the logic that we 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.800
 the counters we apply when doing 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.460
 our famous trim seats in 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.629
 the daily book at the end of the year 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.060
 logically that with the entry of 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.189
 emergency in electronic books that 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.060
 concept has been has been transferred to 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:05.590
 them through the use of code 9 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.919
 of that forgotten code 9 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.990
 forces to consider for example a 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.880
 adjustment in a purchase record or in a 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.590
 Sales record 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.809
 then it is important to keep in mind 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.719
 that procedure 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:22.729
 there is also another special code inside 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.000
 of this operation that is exclusive 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.250
 of the sales record 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.680
 I mean code 8 code 8 is 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.640
 omitted to record information by 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:40.840
 example I'm in the hypothetical month 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.000
 October 2013 and it turns out that 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.090
 record sales in May 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.270
 2013 omit to register a sale and what 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.760
 send you take I want to correct what is 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.730
 what I do I will place the period 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.860
 tributary may of 2013 may place 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.880
 information that I omitted only with the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.790
 code 8 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.400
 in such a way that I will allow myself 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.960
 affirm to the city ​​that I am 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.249
 send me information that there was 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.619
 included previous 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:13.349
 obviously the use of code eight and 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:15.509
 nine as you will realize if it is 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:18.089
 that these electronic records are 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:21.449
 linked to the use of a declaration 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:23.459
 tributary, obviously, if I move 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.459
 book balances I have to do the 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:28.589
 respective declaration and 

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:30.160
 respective rectifications to the 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:33.010
 declarations forgiveness 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.950
 with the tax effect existed not 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.930
 high so you have to see a topic for 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.400
 example of approval by the 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.440
 city ​​etc etc 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.630
 then it is important that we 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.540
 account these concepts for an adequate 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.560
 management of electronic books 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.509
 probably us as accountants 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.789
 we see it directly in the txt file 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:55.250
 but surely in the accounting software 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.720
 that you use are already included 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.420
 options 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:02.970
 or then as the operation state 8 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.970
 and 9 thank you very much for your attention
