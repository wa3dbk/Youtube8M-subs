months ago the Tao got released so let's

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.620 
months ago the Tao got released so let's
get<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.120> started

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
get this started

get this started
so<00:00:16.289> first<00:00:16.529> let's<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> pre<00:00:17.640> evolution<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
so first let's do a pre evolution of

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.830 
so first let's do a pre evolution of
doduo

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
doduo

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.109

promise you this is the one one it's

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.650 
promise you this is the one one it's
gonna<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:22.740> stupid<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.539> know<00:00:24.630> I

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
gonna be really stupid but you know I

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.599 
gonna be really stupid but you know I
gotta<00:00:24.900> made<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.380> makes<00:00:25.590> sense<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.220> doduo

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
gotta made it makes sense you know doduo

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.450 
gotta made it makes sense you know doduo
has<00:00:26.880> two<00:00:27.090> heads<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.689> doh<00:00:28.470> trio<00:00:28.769> has<00:00:29.130> three

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
has two heads and doh trio has three

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.380 
has two heads and doh trio has three
heads<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.230> it's<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.349> weird<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.850> have<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.910> pre

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
heads so it's not weird to have a pre

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.620 
heads so it's not weird to have a pre
evolution<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> dodo<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.469> only<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.860> head

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
evolution of dodo to have only one head

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.869 
evolution of dodo to have only one head
it's<00:00:36.680> you<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.770> what<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> bit<00:00:38.430> stupid

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it's you know what it is a bit stupid

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.299 
it's you know what it is a bit stupid
for<00:00:39.210> them<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.920> have

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
for them to do this but you know I have

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.459 
for them to do this but you know I have
it<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> gut<00:00:41.879> feeling<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.270> might<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it I have a gut feeling they might the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.400 
it I have a gut feeling they might the
cheetah<00:00:43.680> type<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:45.390> know<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.899> not<00:00:46.020> flying

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
cheetah type you know it's not flying

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.520 
cheetah type you know it's not flying
because<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.190> assume<00:00:47.520> doduo<00:00:47.910> maybe<00:00:48.320> flies<00:00:49.320> with

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
because I assume doduo maybe flies with

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.490 
because I assume doduo maybe flies with
it<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:50.520> two<00:00:50.700> heads<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.440> know

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it it's two heads but because you know

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
it it's two heads but because you know
this<00:00:52.739> little<00:00:52.949> guy<00:00:53.100> doesn't<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.910> two

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
this little guy doesn't really have two

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.220 
this little guy doesn't really have two
heads<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.829> he<00:00:56.430> can't<00:00:56.640> really<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.879> flying

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
heads I know he can't really be flying

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
heads I know he can't really be flying
and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.410> gotta<00:00:58.920> say<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> love<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> art<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.210> know

kind of clever so let's go to the next
one<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.049> promise<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> guys<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> only

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
one I promise you guys that's the only

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.969 
one I promise you guys that's the only
one<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.490> stupid<00:01:20.780> all<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
one I was stupid all right this one is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.760 
one I was stupid all right this one is
evolution<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.759> Diglett<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.750> similar<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
evolution of Diglett it's similar as the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.880 
evolution of Diglett it's similar as the
doduo<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.520> pre<00:01:26.759> evolution<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.810> Diglett<00:01:28.590> just

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
doduo is pre evolution that Diglett just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.850 
doduo is pre evolution that Diglett just
randomly<00:01:29.250> goes<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.790> dig<00:01:30.210> trio<00:01:30.680> now<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
randomly goes to dig trio now that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.039 
randomly goes to dig trio now that
doesn't<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.159> make<00:01:32.280> sense<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.640> me<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
doesn't really make sense to me so I I

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.410 
doesn't really make sense to me so I I
looked<00:01:34.979> around<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.490> saw<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:36.030> artist

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
looked around and I saw this one artist

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.469 
looked around and I saw this one artist
and<00:01:36.600> he<00:01:36.659> made<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.130> evolution<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.310> Diglett<00:01:38.729> into

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and he made a evolution of Diglett into

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.280 
and he made a evolution of Diglett into
this<00:01:40.170> guy<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:41.070> now<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:43.170> know

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
this guy that you see here now you know

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.530 
this guy that you see here now you know
it's<00:01:43.680> very<00:01:43.890> simple<00:01:44.189> yes<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.850> head<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.360> 1

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
it's very simple yes to head you know 1

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.440 
it's very simple yes to head you know 1
2<00:01:45.689> 3<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.079> makes<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.290> lot<00:01:46.380> more<00:01:46.439> sense<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.450> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
2 3 it makes a lot more sense and the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.260 
2 3 it makes a lot more sense and the
change<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.960> type<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.119> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
change of type now this one you know it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.630 
change of type now this one you know it
kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> makes<00:01:51.750> sense<00:01:51.899> ground<00:01:52.409> dark<00:01:52.829> because

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
kind of makes sense ground dark because

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
kind of makes sense ground dark because
uh<00:01:53.670> maybe<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> midlife<00:01:55.020> crisis<00:01:55.560> maybe<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.189> know

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
uh maybe a midlife crisis maybe you know

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.300 
uh maybe a midlife crisis maybe you know
it<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.549> mid<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.090> evolution<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.810> maybe

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
it is mid of the evolution so maybe

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.740 
it is mid of the evolution so maybe
Diggle<00:01:59.310> has<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> midlife<00:01:59.820> crisis<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.540> part

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
Diggle has a midlife crisis in this part

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.050 
Diggle has a midlife crisis in this part
so<00:02:00.780> maybe<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> dark<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> maybe<00:02:02.640> gets<00:02:02.939> out

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so maybe it's a dark and maybe gets out

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.399 
so maybe it's a dark and maybe gets out
of<00:02:03.090> dark<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:03.780> he<00:02:04.020> gets<00:02:04.200> out<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
of dark because he gets out of the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.289 
of dark because he gets out of the
midlife<00:02:04.710> crisis<00:02:05.159> that's<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:06.000> thing<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> can

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
midlife crisis that's one thing I can

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.960 
midlife crisis that's one thing I can
think<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.659> maybe<00:02:06.899> he<00:02:07.799> also<00:02:07.950> drew<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.789> bit

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
think of maybe he also drew it a bit

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.619 
think of maybe he also drew it a bit
darker<00:02:09.420> than<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> other<00:02:10.459> Pokemon<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.000> would

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
darker than the other Pokemon so I would

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.910 
darker than the other Pokemon so I would
assume<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.020> maybe<00:02:13.110> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
assume that maybe that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.670 
assume that maybe that
maybe<00:02:14.580> caused<00:02:14.880> him<00:02:15.120> making<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.600> dark<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.200> very

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
maybe caused him making a dark but very

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.890 
maybe caused him making a dark but very

alright so let's go to this one this one
is<00:02:33.960> going<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.790> floatzel<00:02:35.870> evolution<00:02:37.010> now

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
is going to be a floatzel evolution now

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.360 
is going to be a floatzel evolution now
from<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> start<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.380> understand<00:02:41.220> how

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
from the start you just understand how

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.740 
from the start you just understand how
amazing<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.660> idea<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.490> as<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:45.300> see<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
amazing this this idea is as you see the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.770 
amazing this this idea is as you see the
head<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.140> more<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.650> diving<00:02:46.980> suit<00:02:47.450> than<00:02:48.450> an

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
head is more of a diving suit than an

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.380 
head is more of a diving suit than an
actual<00:02:49.080> Fox<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.459> makes<00:02:50.670> sense<00:02:50.850> float<00:02:51.209> so

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
actual Fox but it makes sense float so

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.229 
actual Fox but it makes sense float so
you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.690> maybe<00:02:51.900> next<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:53.239> diving

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
you know maybe next to be a a diving

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.410 
you know maybe next to be a a diving
pokemon<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:56.280> change<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.610> type<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.150> makes

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
pokemon and the change of type it makes

I'll put it here but look at their hair
it's<00:04:13.950> very<00:04:14.190> similar<00:04:14.610> don't<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:15.120> think<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.480> mean

really look at it and you know this guy

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.150 
really look at it and you know this guy
G<00:04:20.040> might<00:04:20.459> have<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.640> point<00:04:20.910> here<00:04:21.830> maybe<00:04:22.830> there's

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
G might have a point here maybe there's

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.040 
G might have a point here maybe there's
a<00:04:23.250> like<00:04:23.490> maybe<00:04:23.640> a<00:04:23.789> fusion<00:04:24.270> thing<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.720> happens

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
a like maybe a fusion thing that happens

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.630 
a like maybe a fusion thing that happens
with<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.320> electric<00:04:25.650> pokemon<00:04:26.039> and<00:04:26.250> nine<00:04:26.430> tails

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
with the electric pokemon and nine tails

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.370 
with the electric pokemon and nine tails
maybe<00:04:26.970> that's

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
maybe that's

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.200 
maybe that's
our<00:04:27.590> talk<00:04:27.800> is<00:04:27.980> but<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.670> know<00:04:28.820> nut<00:04:29.030> pokémon

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
our talk is but you know nut pokémon

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.210 
our talk is but you know nut pokémon
that<00:04:29.600> probably<00:04:29.840> won't<00:04:29.990> happen<00:04:30.200> but<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:31.130> know

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
that probably won't happen but you know

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.130 
that probably won't happen but you know
I<00:04:31.520> did<00:04:32.150> like<00:04:32.360> how<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.570> artist<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.050> know

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
I did like how the artist you know

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.250 
I did like how the artist you know
thought<00:04:33.590> out<00:04:33.740> of<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:33.920> box<00:04:34.130> for<00:04:34.280> this<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:35.260> it

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
thought out of the box for this and it

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.390 
thought out of the box for this and it
makes<00:04:36.470> sense<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.950> change<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.220> type

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
makes sense that the change of type

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.010 
makes sense that the change of type
would<00:04:37.580> be<00:04:37.610> electric<00:04:38.210> we<00:04:38.450> have<00:04:38.570> not<00:04:38.780> seen<00:04:38.990> a

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
would be electric we have not seen a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.810 
would be electric we have not seen a
fire<00:04:39.260> electric<00:04:39.740> at<00:04:39.950> least<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.220> don't<00:04:40.400> remember

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
fire electric at least I don't remember

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.400 
fire electric at least I don't remember
one<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.510> there<00:04:42.380> does<00:04:42.590> make<00:04:42.770> sense<00:04:43.010> so<00:04:44.410> gotta

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
one and there does make sense so gotta

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.990 
one and there does make sense so gotta
say<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.800> art<00:04:45.920> was<00:04:46.070> fantastic

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
say the art was fantastic

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.760 
say the art was fantastic
you<00:04:47.120> know<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.630> drawing<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:48.050> Naruto<00:04:48.380> really

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
you know the drawing of Naruto really

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.550 
you know the drawing of Naruto really
shows<00:04:50.230> how<00:04:51.230> good<00:04:51.440> this<00:04:51.590> artists<00:04:52.100> can<00:04:52.670> be<00:04:52.940> and

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
shows how good this artists can be and

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.690 
shows how good this artists can be and
the<00:04:54.560> name<00:04:54.890> of<00:04:55.250> this<00:04:55.460> Pokemon<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.420> believe<00:04:56.990> is

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
the name of this Pokemon I believe is

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.580

know the artist really didn't get into
what<00:05:52.280> he<00:05:52.580> did<00:05:52.940> to<00:05:53.780> make<00:05:53.930> this<00:05:54.140> thing<00:05:54.380> look<00:05:54.740> like

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
what he did to make this thing look like

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.410 
what he did to make this thing look like
it's<00:05:55.190> alive<00:05:55.460> because<00:05:55.850> right<00:05:56.120> now<00:05:56.240> it<00:05:56.390> just

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
it's alive because right now it just

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.410 
it's alive because right now it just
looks<00:05:56.870> like<00:05:56.930> a<00:05:57.020> plain<00:05:57.170> old<00:05:57.290> rock<00:05:57.620> but<00:05:58.070> I<00:05:58.420> can

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
looks like a plain old rock but I can

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.120 
looks like a plain old rock but I can
see<00:05:59.660> where<00:05:59.870> this<00:06:00.020> is<00:06:00.170> coming<00:06:00.350> from<00:06:00.500> though<00:06:00.800> cuz

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
see where this is coming from though cuz

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.340 
see where this is coming from though cuz
you<00:06:01.910> can<00:06:02.090> picture<00:06:02.330> that<00:06:02.510> rock<00:06:02.840> of<00:06:03.020> all<00:06:03.170> being

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
you can picture that rock of all being

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.350 
you can picture that rock of all being
into<00:06:03.500> onyx<00:06:03.890> you<00:06:04.100> know<00:06:04.310> it's<00:06:04.460> it's<00:06:04.670> very<00:06:04.790> that

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
into onyx you know it's it's very that

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.840 
into onyx you know it's it's very that
our<00:06:05.690> work<00:06:06.170> is<00:06:06.350> superb<00:06:06.890> on<00:06:07.220> this<00:06:07.400> fact<00:06:07.670> that

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
our work is superb on this fact that

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.300 
our work is superb on this fact that
actually<00:06:08.300> makes<00:06:08.900> it<00:06:08.960> seem<00:06:09.260> like<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.830> rock<00:06:10.070> is

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
actually makes it seem like the rock is

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.420 
actually makes it seem like the rock is
actually<00:06:10.460> transferring<00:06:11.270> into<00:06:11.600> Onix

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
actually transferring into Onix

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.240 
actually transferring into Onix
the<00:06:13.430> change<00:06:13.640> of<00:06:13.760> type<00:06:14.080> it's<00:06:15.080> not<00:06:15.470> a<00:06:15.770> really<00:06:16.220> a

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
the change of type it's not a really a

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.350 
the change of type it's not a really a
change<00:06:16.520> of<00:06:16.610> type<00:06:16.760> it<00:06:16.910> just<00:06:17.030> doesn't<00:06:17.240> have

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
change of type it just doesn't have

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.900 
change of type it just doesn't have
ground<00:06:17.920> but<00:06:18.920> it<00:06:19.100> would<00:06:19.250> make<00:06:19.400> sense<00:06:19.580> not<00:06:19.880> in

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
ground but it would make sense not in

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.050 
ground but it would make sense not in
the<00:06:20.240> ground<00:06:20.540> it's<00:06:20.900> just<00:06:21.140> a<00:06:21.290> rock<00:06:21.560> so<00:06:22.280> it<00:06:22.940> would

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
the ground it's just a rock so it would

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.610 
the ground it's just a rock so it would
make<00:06:23.240> sense<00:06:23.390> that<00:06:23.510> the<00:06:23.690> only<00:06:23.720> type<00:06:24.140> it<00:06:24.260> is<00:06:24.380> is

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
make sense that the only type it is is

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.110 
make sense that the only type it is is
Brock<00:06:25.300> so<00:06:26.300> once<00:06:27.290> again<00:06:27.490> artwork<00:06:28.490> is<00:06:28.640> superb

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
Brock so once again artwork is superb

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.360 
Brock so once again artwork is superb
here<00:06:29.510> you<00:06:29.930> know<00:06:30.020> I<00:06:30.050> really<00:06:30.560> goes<00:06:30.740> into<00:06:31.130> what

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
here you know I really goes into what

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.280 
here you know I really goes into what
Onix<00:06:31.880> might<00:06:32.060> look<00:06:32.180> like<00:06:32.240> as<00:06:32.510> a<00:06:32.540> pre<00:06:32.780> evolution

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
Onix might look like as a pre evolution

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.680 
Onix might look like as a pre evolution
so<00:06:34.330> applaud<00:06:35.330> the<00:06:35.900> person<00:06:36.200> for<00:06:36.350> that<00:06:36.500> and<00:06:37.690> you

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
so applaud the person for that and you

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.990 
so applaud the person for that and you
know<00:06:38.810> the<00:06:39.229> name<00:06:39.530> that<00:06:39.890> he<00:06:40.010> put<00:06:40.310> you<00:06:40.550> know

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
know the name that he put you know

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.140 
know the name that he put you know
a little<00:06:41.240> bit<00:06:41.330> on<00:06:41.390> edges<00:06:41.780> is<00:06:41.960> rockex<00:06:43.150> which

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
a little bit on edges is rockex which

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.360 
a little bit on edges is rockex which
I'm<00:06:44.360> guessing<00:06:44.600> is<00:06:45.110> similar<00:06:45.770> to<00:06:45.890> onyx<00:06:46.250> and

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
I'm guessing is similar to onyx and

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.720 
I'm guessing is similar to onyx and
steelix<00:06:46.850> have<00:06:47.120> that<00:06:47.300> IX<00:06:47.810> in<00:06:48.020> there<00:06:48.230> and<00:06:48.730> have

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
steelix have that IX in there and have

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.420 
steelix have that IX in there and have
the<00:06:49.850> rockex<00:06:50.270> because<00:06:50.600> it<00:06:50.810> is<00:06:51.020> you<00:06:51.890> know<00:06:52.010> I<00:06:52.040> I

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
the rockex because it is you know I I

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.010 
the rockex because it is you know I I
know<00:06:52.700> it's<00:06:52.820> not<00:06:53.120> supposed<00:06:53.270> to<00:06:53.510> be<00:06:53.660> a<00:06:53.690> rock<00:06:53.870> but

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
know it's not supposed to be a rock but

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.930 
know it's not supposed to be a rock but
it<00:06:54.110> does<00:06:54.290> have<00:06:54.890> its<00:06:55.100> similarities<00:06:55.670> to<00:06:55.910> a

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
it does have its similarities to a

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.090 
it does have its similarities to a
regular<00:06:56.480> old<00:06:56.690> rock<00:06:56.990> so<00:06:57.740> it's<00:06:57.890> a<00:06:57.950> very

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
regular old rock so it's a very

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.470 
regular old rock so it's a very
interesting<00:06:58.250> name<00:06:58.790> I<00:06:59.060> don't<00:06:59.210> know<00:06:59.330> if<00:06:59.450> people
