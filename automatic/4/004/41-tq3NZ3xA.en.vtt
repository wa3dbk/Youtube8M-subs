00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.450
 so we are warm again 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.120
 Welcome here on our customer channel 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.460
 of which pretend 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.110
 today in this video, it's about your am 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.660
 frequently asked questions 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.369
 I have the last videos to me 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.529
 picked out and looked there what you for 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.700
 has been saying and have equal it 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.230
 Maybe it just makes sense 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.560
 in a video to answer it 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.239
 other fans or youtube want people 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.380
 watching the videos as well 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.380
 have fun 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.770
 okay we start with the first question 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.110
 and this question comes among other things 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.020
 by annabell mausi live greeting at the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.850
 ask and indeed she asks and also completely 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.940
 many others of you how old place to 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.530
 great so line is currently ten years 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 old and paulis find at leni werk 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.620
 the age at all to me with the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.359
 I'm getting fitter by the day 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.210
 somehow the feeling and welcome 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.560
 we have leni with seniors and women 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.860
 With three, the next question comes 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.720
 among others from Maxim Augustin believe 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.210
 that it is right and two of the asked 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.550
 which breed lay and break and it is 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.530
 really so that the two are no breed 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.300
 are the hybrid dogs and that 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.710
 really a coincidence that you keep it up 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.530
 look alike many ask us too 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.670
 sometimes both are siblings or 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.500
 somehow mother and son or something in 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.660
 the art but it was really coincidence 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.070
 come just from the same 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.120
 shelter and it can not be 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.490
 that they are somehow related to each other 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.780
 are 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.820
 yes and we believe that maybe he 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.420
 because it's a bit pekinese with it 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.630
 is maybe a bit sharp or something in 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.460
 the direction and both could be his 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.330
 Etching is in there because that's really 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.630
 these have tasted red and of 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.659
 The bike tour is just a form 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.520
 really the good is very short and the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.289
 But we know how to be born that way 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.820
 not yesterday we have on the way 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.740
 met man who has also missions 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.060
 and also spain and he had told us 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.140
 he always says when asked 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.040
 strack rami and that means that 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.959
 I also found ditch hybrid 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:23.239
 with totally cool idea if and indeed 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:28.430
 someone asks where the next question comes from 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:30.620
 from nlp and that also videos active 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.019
 balls on command and he asked 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.670
 on the labrador are also suitable for 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.100
 Of course, the labrador are also for 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.350
 every dog ​​can be used 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.200
 of course, there is the choice to teach 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.850
 race the type of faster 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.010
 I am frustrated and faster 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.959
 and others without them are just essential 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.430
 relaxed as our leni there you have to 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.079
 a little bit more than a baby, though 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.090
 from the ground there are none 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.459
 Limitations Every dog ​​can choose 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.079
 So learn by command 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.079
 video and train hard 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.540
 my luck and many are 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.460
 others of you have asked me or 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.170
 asked if we do not even have a video 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.030
 can throw to throw so the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.250
 biologically appropriate feeding at 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.980
 dogs because we have both our dogs year 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.950
 wait a little bit longer now 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.360
 but I just want you a good one 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.530
 provide video and that's why we have it 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.900
 not done yet because we are there 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.160
 not the pros are and you have to 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.540
 Maybe you do not do things that way 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.040
 good can also give times and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.780
 That's why we are looking for 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.480
 looking for a partner already have 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.820
 contacts are made and the plan is that 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.590
 we have a video with a real one 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.870
 expert lead over the throws around you 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.490
 then give really helpful tips 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.430
 We can do that at the beginning and a little bit 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.350
 and so on, so have another 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.390
 patience that is in planning and 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.280
 will not be turned on very soon 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.100
 can 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.320
 super biscuit 08 know today as we at 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.020
 our customers the bright and clawed 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.200
 nursing operates the question came already 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.760
 from some others of you and honest 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.230
 said it could be a video to make 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.870
 because we do not have any cases and 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.240
 none so really operated 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.770
 not a care anyway because we just 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.250
 are traveling a lot and are the little ones 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.940
 Use by yourself and take care of it 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.610
 we just have a brush and june 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.440
 are regularly fought and this 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.030
 line to the floor in front how did the 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.470
 mosel between the toes 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.120
 how do we cut in between with the 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.640
 especially because now in the sand 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.020
 and even in winter when snow lies 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.020
 glued and then it can not 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.670
 to walk properly 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.640
 Do not go showering 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.710
 a case has been fully protected 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.210
 will be with warm water in the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.220
 Bath briefly rinsed 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.050
 but we do not use it for that 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.220
 extra bonus on Lake Constance 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.289
 really just warm water and 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.060
 otherwise left-handed already had one 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.039
 advise other ways and recommend it 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.379
 is also a good hair cure or just that 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.270
 Coconut oil now in the summer against the ticks 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.759
 which also helps made quite completely 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.349
 good and makes super soft fur and 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.080
 otherwise I'm sorry, there is no 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:10.580
 great care and any 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:14.060

 super soft fur and I see too 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.229
 quite healthy 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.749
 to the question come from molly mogli and 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.819
 Although she wants to know if we also 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:38.529
 100 videos in the garden can rotate and 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.710
 to show what you have in the garden everything 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:43.689
 Yes, we could totally take care of it 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.099
 unfortunately only to action and with turn 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.169
 no garden yet his now balcony 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.120

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.949
 beautiful green carpet or just 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.289
