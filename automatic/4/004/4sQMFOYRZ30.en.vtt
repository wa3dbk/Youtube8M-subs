piece in the back there and you can hold
it<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> table<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.140> watch

it on the table like that and watch
movies<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.640> lay<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> table

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
movies or you can lay it down on a table

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.380 
movies or you can lay it down on a table
like<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> type<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> keep

like this and have it on a type and keep

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.499 
like this and have it on a type and keep
or<00:01:36.570> an<00:01:36.630> angle<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.590> mean<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.100> said<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.360> one

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
or an angle and I mean that said the one

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.179 
or an angle and I mean that said the one
thing<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.350> Griffin<00:01:40.619> case<00:01:40.650> is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
thing I like about the Griffin case is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.819 
thing I like about the Griffin case is
how<00:01:42.119> thin<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> most

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
how thin it is it's not the most

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
how thin it is it's not the most
sturdiest<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.270> top

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
sturdiest when you put it on that top

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
sturdiest when you put it on that top
angle<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.500> watching<00:01:46.829> movies<00:01:46.970> but<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> very

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
angle for watching movies but it is very

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.940 
angle for watching movies but it is very

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.039 
might end up just cutting that but we'll
leave<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.030> there<00:03:46.150> for<00:03:46.209> now<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:46.840> case<00:03:46.900> I

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
leave it in there for now just in case I

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.229 
leave it in there for now just in case I
don't<00:03:47.109> like<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.320> case<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:48.430> is<00:03:48.609> a<00:03:48.640> bit<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.030> tight

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
don't like a case it is a bit of a tight

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.210 
don't like a case it is a bit of a tight
fit<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:49.690> we<00:03:50.019> like<00:03:50.200> tight<00:03:50.410> fit<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.859> don't<00:03:51.100> want

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
fit but we like tight fit I don't want

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.670 
fit but we like tight fit I don't want
it<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.370> be<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.609> much<00:03:51.700> thicker<00:03:51.940> now<00:03:52.150> do<00:03:52.209> we<00:03:52.680> it

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
it to be that much thicker now do we it

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.400 
it to be that much thicker now do we it
looks<00:03:53.890> like<00:03:57.540> okay<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.780> looks<00:03:58.810> like<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.230> way

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
looks like okay so it looks like the way

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.580 
looks like okay so it looks like the way
we<00:03:59.440> keep<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.299> snug<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:01.660> mean<00:04:01.900> besides

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
we keep it snug in the I mean besides

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.099 
we keep it snug in the I mean besides
the<00:04:02.829> fact<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:03.220> tight<00:04:04.019> there's<00:04:05.019> a

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
the fact that it's tight there's a

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.440 
the fact that it's tight there's a
little<00:04:05.350> flap<00:04:05.709> on<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.190> side<00:04:06.519> here<00:04:06.850> which<00:04:07.000> looks

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
little flap on the side here which looks

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.690 
little flap on the side here which looks
at<00:04:07.870> which<00:04:08.049> folds<00:04:08.470> underneath<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.950> ipad<00:04:09.370> and

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
at which folds underneath the ipad and

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.789 
at which folds underneath the ipad and
there's<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.940> bit<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.120> velcro<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:11.470> attaches

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
there's a bit of velcro that it attaches

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.620 
there's a bit of velcro that it attaches
to<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.930> kind<00:04:14.049> of<00:04:14.170> just<00:04:14.319> sticks<00:04:14.709> in<00:04:14.890> there

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
to and it kind of just sticks in there

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.420 
to and it kind of just sticks in there
and<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.410> don't<00:04:16.590> know<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.800> I<00:04:16.860> like<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.160> idea<00:04:17.280> of

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
and I don't know if I like the idea of

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.100 
and I don't know if I like the idea of
velcro<00:04:17.790> because<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.330> know<00:04:18.420> velcro<00:04:18.810> after

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
velcro because you know velcro after

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.590 
velcro because you know velcro after
time<00:04:19.380> well<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:20.310> guess<00:04:20.790> if<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.000> put<00:04:21.030> your<00:04:21.209> iPad

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
time well I guess if you put your iPad

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.910 
time well I guess if you put your iPad
in<00:04:21.750> here<00:04:21.900> you're<00:04:22.050> not<00:04:22.170> really<00:04:22.290> going<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.530> open

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
in here you're not really going to open

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.650 
in here you're not really going to open
it<00:04:23.040> in<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.670> out<00:04:23.790> in<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.120> out<00:04:24.180> but<00:04:24.330> for<00:04:24.480> someone

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
it in and out in and out but for someone

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.850 
it in and out in and out but for someone
like<00:04:24.780> me<00:04:25.020> they<00:04:25.140> might<00:04:25.290> try<00:04:25.350> many<00:04:25.800> different

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
like me they might try many different

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.060 
like me they might try many different
cases<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.580> might<00:04:27.270> wear<00:04:27.420> that<00:04:27.600> velcro<00:04:27.840> out<00:04:28.170> over

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
cases I might wear that velcro out over

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.890 
cases I might wear that velcro out over
time<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:29.580> I'm<00:04:29.670> not<00:04:29.820> sure<00:04:29.880> how<00:04:30.420> was<00:04:30.630> going<00:04:30.840> to

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
time so I'm not sure how was going to

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.300 
time so I'm not sure how was going to
hold<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.170> up<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.410> like<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.710> fact<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:31.980> Griffin

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
hold it up I like the fact that Griffin

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.760 
hold it up I like the fact that Griffin
cases<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:33.720> know<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:33.990> little<00:04:34.110> bit<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.440> flap

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
cases you know this little bit of flap

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.590 
cases you know this little bit of flap
here<00:04:35.100> kind<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.640> just<00:04:35.700> sits<00:04:36.030> underneath<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
here kind of just sits underneath the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.880 
here kind of just sits underneath the
ipad<00:04:37.020> ipad<00:04:37.830> keeps<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.610> there<00:04:38.850> firm<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:40.650> other

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
ipad ipad keeps it there firm this other

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.220 
ipad ipad keeps it there firm this other
part<00:04:41.190> holds<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.550> ipad<00:04:41.820> in<00:04:42.000> there<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.390> i<00:04:42.660> don't

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
part holds the ipad in there so i don't

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.530 
part holds the ipad in there so i don't
know<00:04:43.290> it's<00:04:43.380> pretty<00:04:43.500> solid<00:04:43.770> case<00:04:44.420> not<00:04:45.420> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
know it's pretty solid case not the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.850 
know it's pretty solid case not the
greatest<00:04:45.750> with<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.140> with<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.320> stands

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
greatest with the with the stands

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.170 
greatest with the with the stands
obviously<00:04:47.250> because<00:04:47.400> it's<00:04:47.520> not<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.820> thick<00:04:48.030> so

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
obviously because it's not that thick so

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.910 
obviously because it's not that thick so
obviously<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.630> know<00:04:48.750> you're<00:04:48.870> not<00:04:49.260> gonna<00:04:49.380> now

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
obviously you know you're not gonna now

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.740 
obviously you know you're not gonna now
going<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.130> be<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.310> stable<00:04:50.760> but<00:04:51.150> this<00:04:51.360> seems<00:04:51.600> i

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
going to be that stable but this seems i

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.060 
going to be that stable but this seems i
could<00:04:51.870> be<00:04:51.960> stable<00:04:52.320> enough<00:04:52.410> even<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:52.920> an

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
could be stable enough even on an

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.420 
could be stable enough even on an
unlevel<00:04:53.520> surface<00:04:53.880> like<00:04:54.030> one<00:04:54.180> up<00:04:54.300> dead<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.800> i

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
unlevel surface like one up dead and i

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.730 
unlevel surface like one up dead and i
gotta<00:04:56.610> say<00:04:56.790> it<00:04:56.850> feels<00:04:56.910> really<00:04:57.120> sturdy

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
gotta say it feels really sturdy

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.710 
gotta say it feels really sturdy
obviously<00:04:58.740> stick<00:04:59.040> but<00:04:59.310> let's<00:04:59.940> just<00:05:00.120> give<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:00.570> a

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
obviously stick but let's just give it a

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.760 
obviously stick but let's just give it a
try<00:05:01.100> never<00:05:02.100> can<00:05:02.280> see<00:05:02.490> from<00:05:02.730> the<00:05:02.910> first<00:05:03.330> angle

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
try never can see from the first angle

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.260 
try never can see from the first angle
where's<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.920> second<00:05:05.250> angle<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.760> then

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
where's the second angle and then

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.270 
where's the second angle and then
there's<00:05:06.420> a<00:05:06.480> third<00:05:06.720> angle<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.260> hob<00:05:08.070> viously

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
there's a third angle and hob viously

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.640 
there's a third angle and hob viously
this<00:05:08.490> obviously<00:05:09.090> this<00:05:09.240> would<00:05:09.390> be<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.810> ideal

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
this obviously this would be the ideal

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.350 
this obviously this would be the ideal
angle<00:05:11.340> right<00:05:11.490> here<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:13.650> looks<00:05:13.890> like<00:05:13.950> if<00:05:14.130> i<00:05:14.360> push

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
angle right here it looks like if i push

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.660 
angle right here it looks like if i push
on<00:05:15.510> it<00:05:15.660> lightly<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:16.080> just<00:05:16.380> goes<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:16.830> so<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.250> mean

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
on it lightly it just goes in so I mean

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.570 
on it lightly it just goes in so I mean
the<00:05:17.760> rivet<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.750> kind<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.560> know<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.950> don't

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
the rivet this kind of you know I don't

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.710 
the rivet this kind of you know I don't
know<00:05:20.700> what<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:20.850> want<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.210> call<00:05:21.300> it<00:05:21.360> but<00:05:21.600> this

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
know what you want to call it but this

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.270 
know what you want to call it but this
little<00:05:21.870> area<00:05:22.110> here<00:05:22.350> is<00:05:23.220> not<00:05:23.700> that<00:05:23.880> thick<00:05:24.980> so<00:05:25.980> I

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
little area here is not that thick so I

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.400 
little area here is not that thick so I
mean<00:05:26.460> it's<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:26.970> think<00:05:27.540> it'll<00:05:27.720> stay<00:05:27.960> level<00:05:28.320> on

the surface won't go anywhere but if you
push<00:05:30.480> it<00:05:30.690> or<00:05:30.870> it<00:05:31.290> looks<00:05:31.500> like<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:31.770> just<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:32.360> mean

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360
