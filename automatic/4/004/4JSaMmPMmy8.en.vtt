goes<00:02:30.860> out<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.100> lot<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.150> put<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.110> generous<00:02:33.440> amount

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
goes out a lot so put a generous amount

so that I would be able to apply the oil

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.960 
so that I would be able to apply the oil
hair<00:02:39.170> mask<00:02:39.440> all<00:02:39.739> over<00:02:40.130> my<00:02:40.280> scalp<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:40.730> I'm<00:02:40.850> gonna

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
go right ahead and do that all over my

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.570 
go right ahead and do that all over my
head<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.650> then<00:02:48.650> I'm<00:02:48.739> going<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.010> be<00:02:49.160> doing<00:02:49.430> a

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
head and then I'm going to be doing a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.729 
head and then I'm going to be doing a
three-minute<00:02:50.270> scalp<00:02:50.660> massage<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.350> my<00:02:51.470> head

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
three-minute scalp massage in my head

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.009 
three-minute scalp massage in my head
and<00:02:52.160> that's<00:02:52.489> just<00:02:52.940> simply<00:02:53.180> going<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.660> increase

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
and that's just simply going to increase

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.720 
and that's just simply going to increase
the<00:02:54.140> circulation<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.890> blood<00:02:55.010> flow<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:55.459> my

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the circulation of the blood flow on my

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.640 
the circulation of the blood flow on my
scalp<00:02:56.030> thus<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.170> will<00:02:57.320> encourage<00:02:57.709> hair<00:02:58.250> growth

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
scalp thus it will encourage hair growth

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.780 
scalp thus it will encourage hair growth
and<00:03:00.650> that's<00:03:00.800> really<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.040> will<00:03:01.220> be<00:03:01.310> calling<00:03:01.640> my

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
and that's really I will be calling my

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.900 
and that's really I will be calling my
hair<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.830> oils<00:03:04.220> from<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.459> top<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.790> my
