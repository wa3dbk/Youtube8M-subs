vegetable garden from scratch that i

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.270 
vegetable garden from scratch that i
started<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.450> it's<00:00:13.900> also<00:00:14.080> a<00:00:14.230> part<00:00:14.530> of<00:00:14.650> the<00:00:14.860> ten

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
started and it's also a part of the ten

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.860 
started and it's also a part of the ten
by<00:00:15.430> ten<00:00:15.640> project<00:00:16.150> now<00:00:16.750> the<00:00:17.230> actual<00:00:17.470> garden<00:00:17.950> bed

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:18.870 
by ten project now the actual garden bed

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.529 
by ten project now the actual garden bed
if<00:00:19.870> you<00:00:20.500> can<00:00:20.620> get<00:00:20.740> a<00:00:20.800> proper<00:00:21.070> kind<00:00:21.280> of<00:00:21.539> depth

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
if you can get a proper kind of depth

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.720 
if you can get a proper kind of depth
perception<00:00:23.260> of<00:00:23.350> it<00:00:23.500> actually<00:00:24.280> is<00:00:24.369> on<00:00:24.460> a<00:00:24.490> bit<00:00:24.640> of

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
perception of it actually is on a bit of

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.100 
perception of it actually is on a bit of
an<00:00:24.820> angle<00:00:24.970> so<00:00:25.270> it's<00:00:25.510> a<00:00:25.600> little<00:00:25.720> bit<00:00:25.840> higher

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
an angle so it's a little bit higher

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.990 
an angle so it's a little bit higher
here<00:00:26.440> and<00:00:26.560> it<00:00:26.619> actually<00:00:26.830> pads<00:00:27.220> down<00:00:27.550> towards

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
here and it actually pads down towards

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.300 
here and it actually pads down towards
the<00:00:28.090> end<00:00:28.330> now<00:00:28.990> I<00:00:29.320> didn't<00:00:29.680> want<00:00:29.830> to<00:00:29.890> have<00:00:30.010> a<00:00:30.039> lot

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
the end now I didn't want to have a lot

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.029 
the end now I didn't want to have a lot
of<00:00:30.340> runoff<00:00:30.670> with<00:00:31.539> water<00:00:32.199> and<00:00:32.499> all<00:00:32.739> that<00:00:32.859> kind

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
of runoff with water and all that kind

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.619 
of runoff with water and all that kind
of<00:00:33.100> stuff<00:00:33.159> so<00:00:33.399> I<00:00:33.429> was<00:00:33.550> hoping<00:00:33.699> to<00:00:34.030> level<00:00:34.269> it<00:00:34.480> out

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
of stuff so I was hoping to level it out

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.979 
of stuff so I was hoping to level it out
and<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:35.559> garden<00:00:35.859> itself<00:00:36.100> was<00:00:36.339> really<00:00:36.989> perfect

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
and the garden itself was really perfect

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.719 
and the garden itself was really perfect
for<00:00:38.319> growing<00:00:38.589> stuff<00:00:39.010> so<00:00:39.159> I<00:00:39.219> really<00:00:39.489> want<00:00:39.519> to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729 
for growing stuff so I really want to

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.540 
for growing stuff so I really want to
have<00:00:39.850> something<00:00:40.089> here<00:00:40.539> so<00:00:41.409> I<00:00:41.440> thought<00:00:41.679> best

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
have something here so I thought best

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.819 
have something here so I thought best
bet<00:00:42.789> is<00:00:42.940> to<00:00:42.969> try<00:00:43.089> and<00:00:43.269> adapt<00:00:43.600> now<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.530> willow

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
bet is to try and adapt now the willow

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.790 
bet is to try and adapt now the willow
tree<00:00:44.859> I<00:00:45.339> actually<00:00:45.550> cut<00:00:45.879> down<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.149> willow<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
tree I actually cut down a willow and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.879 
tree I actually cut down a willow and
now<00:00:48.039> what<00:00:48.309> I've<00:00:48.429> done<00:00:48.609> I've<00:00:49.269> put<00:00:49.739> similar<00:00:50.739> to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:50.889 
now what I've done I've put similar to

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:53.430 
now what I've done I've put similar to
the<00:00:51.039> fence<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.699> we<00:00:51.819> built<00:00:52.059> oh<00:00:52.299> god<00:00:52.989> ages<00:00:53.409> ago

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
the fence that we built oh god ages ago

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.410 
the fence that we built oh god ages ago
now<00:00:53.769> that<00:00:53.799> mean<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.489> fence<00:00:54.729> craft<00:00:55.059> video

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
now that mean the fence craft video

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.899 
now that mean the fence craft video
actually<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.469> have<00:00:56.649> got<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.159> stop<00:00:57.429> it<00:00:57.639> gets<00:00:57.789> on

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
actually you have got to stop it gets on

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.869 
actually you have got to stop it gets on
each<00:00:58.059> side<00:00:58.530> along<00:00:59.530> here<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.010> haven't

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
each side along here and haven't

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.239 
each side along here and haven't
finished<00:01:01.179> in<00:01:01.420> there<00:01:01.659> and<00:01:01.959> I've<00:01:02.829> just<00:01:02.859> been

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
finished in there and I've just been

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:09.660 
finished in there and I've just been
I'll<00:01:03.549> get<00:01:03.699> up<00:01:03.760> closer<00:01:05.670> building<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:06.789> up<00:01:07.469> so<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
I'll get up closer building it up so the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.370 
I'll get up closer building it up so the
ground<00:01:09.939> level<00:01:10.149> really<00:01:10.600> at<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:11.020> end<00:01:11.229> only

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
ground level really at this end only

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.840 
ground level really at this end only
needs<00:01:11.649> to<00:01:11.829> come<00:01:12.009> up<00:01:12.039> about<00:01:13.649> 300<00:01:14.649> mil<00:01:14.860> 400<00:01:15.670> mil

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
needs to come up about 300 mil 400 mil

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.440 
needs to come up about 300 mil 400 mil
max<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:17.140> I've<00:01:18.130> just<00:01:18.189> been<00:01:18.490> building<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.299> in

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
max so I've just been building that in

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.359 
max so I've just been building that in
and<00:01:19.630> packing<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.140> down<00:01:20.200> walking<00:01:20.740> on<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.130> as<00:01:21.250> I

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
and packing it down walking on it as I

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.240 
and packing it down walking on it as I
go<00:01:21.399> along<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.909> kind<00:01:22.030> of<00:01:22.149> pack<00:01:22.359> it<00:01:22.509> down<00:01:22.539> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
go along to kind of pack it down and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.120 
go along to kind of pack it down and
also<00:01:24.250> now<00:01:25.090> what<00:01:25.509> I<00:01:25.719> should<00:01:26.049> take<00:01:26.200> first<00:01:26.469> so<00:01:27.039> I'm

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
also now what I should take first so I'm

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.560 
also now what I should take first so I'm
going<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.399> build<00:01:27.609> that<00:01:27.759> up<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.149> soil<00:01:28.420> is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
going to build that up so the soil is

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.230 
going to build that up so the soil is
going<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.810> be<00:01:28.899> up<00:01:29.020> another<00:01:29.649> say<00:01:30.100> 300<00:01:30.670> mil<00:01:30.850> along

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
going to be up another say 300 mil along

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.959 
going to be up another say 300 mil along
here<00:01:31.509> now<00:01:32.380> go<00:01:32.649> back<00:01:32.829> in<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.070> second<00:01:33.369> or<00:01:33.490> kind<00:01:33.939> of

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
here now go back in a second or kind of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
also done so obviously because the wood

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.740 
also done so obviously because the wood
I<00:01:37.929> don't<00:01:38.380> want<00:01:38.530> it<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.619> just<00:01:38.740> kind<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.429> know

pile<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.170> there<00:01:50.380> I've<00:01:51.159> actually<00:01:51.369> just

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
pile of it there I've actually just

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.910 
pile of it there I've actually just
piled<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.119> up<00:01:52.240> along<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.689> edges<00:01:52.869> here<00:01:53.499> on

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
piled that up along the edges here on

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.340 
piled that up along the edges here on
the<00:01:54.280> other<00:01:54.310> side<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.909> I've<00:01:55.719> started<00:01:55.929> putting

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
the other side and I've started putting

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.230 
the other side and I've started putting
it<00:01:56.469> in<00:01:56.740> amongst<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.189> cracks<00:01:57.460> now<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.060> dries

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
it in amongst the cracks now that dries

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.969 
it in amongst the cracks now that dries
out<00:01:58.450> really<00:01:58.810> quite<00:01:59.049> hard<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.619> it<00:01:59.710> will<00:01:59.799> really

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
out really quite hard and it will really

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.160 
out really quite hard and it will really
like<00:02:00.939> prevent<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.509> water<00:02:01.659> from<00:02:01.840> running

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
like prevent the water from running

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.870 
like prevent the water from running
through<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:02.859> that<00:02:02.890> should<00:02:03.159> be<00:02:03.189> a<00:02:03.280> good<00:02:03.460> barrier

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
through so that should be a good barrier

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.630 
through so that should be a good barrier
and<00:02:04.509> over<00:02:04.929> time<00:02:05.079> that<00:02:05.319> will<00:02:05.439> pack<00:02:05.619> down<00:02:05.979> so<00:02:06.609> I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
and over time that will pack down so I

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.580 
and over time that will pack down so I
should<00:02:06.880> be<00:02:06.909> able<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.270> just<00:02:07.420> build<00:02:07.689> this<00:02:07.899> up

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
should be able to just build this up

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.009 
should be able to just build this up
should<00:02:09.190> have<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.550> prod<00:02:09.789> it's<00:02:10.450> really<00:02:10.690> just<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
should have to prod it's really just a

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.390 
should have to prod it's really just a
case<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.260> kind<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:13.500> going<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:14.739> doing<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.190> bit<00:02:15.370> by

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
case of kind of going on doing it bit by

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.610 
case of kind of going on doing it bit by
bit<00:02:15.550> filling<00:02:16.269> in<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.510> gaps<00:02:16.720> packing<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.470> in

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
bit filling in the gaps packing it in

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.640 
bit filling in the gaps packing it in
squashing<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.160> down<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.900> do<00:02:20.349> create

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
squashing it down and you do create

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.089 
squashing it down and you do create
really<00:02:21.190> quite<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.599> good<00:02:22.599> barrier<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.470> also<00:02:23.890> I

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
really quite a good barrier and also I

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.589 
really quite a good barrier and also I
think<00:02:24.190> aesthetically<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.150> looks<00:02:25.299> quite<00:02:25.569> good

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
think aesthetically it looks quite good

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.920 
think aesthetically it looks quite good
too<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:27.519> kind<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.849> suits<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.269> garden<00:02:28.660> rather

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
too it kind of suits the garden rather

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.070 
too it kind of suits the garden rather
than<00:02:29.110> getting<00:02:29.319> in<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.590> sleepers<00:02:30.099> or<00:02:30.280> iron<00:02:30.610> or

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
than getting in a sleepers or iron or

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.900 
than getting in a sleepers or iron or
pavers<00:02:32.080> or<00:02:32.349> whatever<00:02:32.799> you<00:02:33.610> can<00:02:33.730> actually

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
pavers or whatever you can actually

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.350 
pavers or whatever you can actually
because<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.599> had<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> cut<00:02:34.959> down<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.260> tree

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
because I had to cut down that tree

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.150 
because I had to cut down that tree
utilize<00:02:37.360> what<00:02:37.540> you've<00:02:37.660> got<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.379> let<00:02:38.920> me<00:02:39.010> just

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
utilize what you've got so let me just

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.240 
utilize what you've got so let me just
go<00:02:39.310> back<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.580> bit<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.410> far<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.950> obviously

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
go back a bit so so far it's obviously

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.059 
go back a bit so so far it's obviously
not<00:02:45.310> finished<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:45.819> so<00:02:46.000> far<00:02:46.150> that's<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:47.069> you

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
not finished but so far that's you you

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.650 
not finished but so far that's you you
can<00:02:48.190> see<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.459> lay<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.760> land<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.269> little<00:02:49.390> bit

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
can see the lay of the land a little bit

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.930 
can see the lay of the land a little bit
here<00:02:49.959> where<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.099> kind<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.910> a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
here where it just kind of it is a

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.430 
here where it just kind of it is a
little<00:02:52.120> bit<00:02:52.269> higher<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.810> pans<00:02:53.079> then<00:02:53.379> I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
little bit higher and it pans then I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.140 
little bit higher and it pans then I
don't<00:02:53.799> want<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.010> let<00:02:54.160> water<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.910> kind<00:02:55.090> of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
don't want to let water to just kind of

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.809 
don't want to let water to just kind of
run<00:02:55.420> off<00:02:55.599> when<00:02:55.870> I'm<00:02:55.959> watering<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.470> garden<00:02:56.819> so

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
run off when I'm watering the garden so

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.240 
run off when I'm watering the garden so
I<00:02:58.209> wanted<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.690> kind<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.019> level<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.440> out<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.129> i'll

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
I wanted to kind of level it out so i'll

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.800 
I wanted to kind of level it out so i'll
come<00:03:00.459> up<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.670> little<00:03:00.910> bit<00:03:01.000> on<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.269> side<00:03:01.540> and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
come up a little bit on this side and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.619 
come up a little bit on this side and
then<00:03:02.200> we'll<00:03:02.410> just<00:03:02.590> raise<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.129> about<00:03:03.310> oh<00:03:03.629> say

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
then we'll just raise it to about oh say

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.350 
then we'll just raise it to about oh say
there<00:03:05.010> if<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.220> makes<00:03:06.430> sense<00:03:06.610> with<00:03:06.849> my<00:03:07.000> finger

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
there if that makes sense with my finger

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.990 
there if that makes sense with my finger
pointing<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.170> we'll<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.160> I'll<00:03:09.400> just<00:03:09.670> level

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
pointing and we'll just I'll just level

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.940 
pointing and we'll just I'll just level
it<00:03:10.090> out<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.480> little<00:03:10.660> bit<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.410> can<00:03:11.470> retain<00:03:11.890> a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
it out a little bit so I can retain a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.530 
it out a little bit so I can retain a
lot<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.400> moisture<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.850> lot<00:03:13.090> better<00:03:13.269> in<00:03:13.450> this

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
lot of the moisture a lot better in this

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.660 
lot of the moisture a lot better in this
garden<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.660> that's<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:18.250> guy<00:03:18.400> is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
garden so that's it and the guy is

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.979 
garden so that's it and the guy is
actually<00:03:18.850> going<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.239> keep<00:03:19.389> going<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:19.900> I'm

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
actually going to keep going so I'm

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.390 
actually going to keep going so I'm
going<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.260> actually<00:03:20.350> pan<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:20.980> right<00:03:21.190> out<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
going to actually pan it right out to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.900 
going to actually pan it right out to
the<00:03:21.549> edges<00:03:21.790> as<00:03:22.120> part<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:22.930> 10<00:03:23.260> by<00:03:23.410> 10

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
the edges as part of that 10 by 10

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.089 
the edges as part of that 10 by 10
project<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.060> I've<00:03:25.150> kind<00:03:25.389> of<00:03:25.480> taken<00:03:25.859> on<00:03:26.859> I

same<00:03:34.840> thing<00:03:34.900> here<00:03:35.380> with<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.769> log<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:37.150> I'm

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
same thing here with this log so I'm

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.000 
same thing here with this log so I'm
just<00:03:37.419> going<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.630> build<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.049> little<00:03:38.349> log<00:03:38.530> that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
just going to build that little log that

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.449 
just going to build that little log that
bit<00:03:39.280> up<00:03:39.609> in<00:03:39.790> there<00:03:40.319> just<00:03:41.319> slightly<00:03:41.739> higher<00:03:42.190> on

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
bit up in there just slightly higher on

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.250 
bit up in there just slightly higher on
this<00:03:42.609> side<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.239> log<00:03:43.419> side<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:44.019> so<00:03:44.139> it's<00:03:44.230> a

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
this side on the log side just so it's a

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.800 
this side on the log side just so it's a
bit<00:03:44.410> more<00:03:44.530> level<00:03:44.859> and<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:46.150> part<00:03:46.510> there

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
bit more level and that in part there

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.039 
bit more level and that in part there
that<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.079> can<00:03:47.260> see<00:03:47.470> that's<00:03:48.010> actually<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:49.049> end

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
that you can see that's actually the end

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.550 
that you can see that's actually the end
result<00:03:50.560> nearly<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:52.450> garden<00:03:53.109> bed<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.500> I

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
result nearly of the garden bed that I

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.080 
result nearly of the garden bed that I
started<00:03:54.069> in<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.280> upper<00:03:54.489> video<00:03:54.760> where<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:54.970> was

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
started in that upper video where I was

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.670 
started in that upper video where I was
actually<00:03:55.569> kind<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.900> going<00:03:56.169> through<00:03:56.200> digging

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
actually kind of going through digging

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.960 
actually kind of going through digging
out<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.829> grass<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.459> stuff<00:03:57.639> like<00:03:57.819> that

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
out the grass and stuff like that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.840 
out the grass and stuff like that
that's<00:03:59.330> how<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.480> came<00:03:59.600> out<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.860> 12<00:04:01.130> code<00:04:01.430> I've

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
that's how it came out so 12 code I've

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.730 
that's how it came out so 12 code I've
rounded<00:04:02.210> it<00:04:02.570> off<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.720> little<00:04:02.840> bit<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:03.680> because

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
rounded it off a little bit just because

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.800 
rounded it off a little bit just because
I<00:04:03.950> wanted<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:06.850> niceness<00:04:07.850> do<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.480> guess<00:04:08.660> you

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
I wanted to niceness do it I guess you

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.160 
I wanted to niceness do it I guess you
just<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.260> it<00:04:10.300> organic<00:04:11.300> feature<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:11.990> not

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
just like it organic feature to it not

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.170 
just like it organic feature to it not
all<00:04:12.380> just<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.920> know<00:04:13.010> blocks<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.550> squares<00:04:13.910> and

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
all just you know blocks and squares and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.930 
all just you know blocks and squares and
stuff<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:15.500> raised<00:04:15.680> garden<00:04:15.920> bed<00:04:16.280> what<00:04:16.790> have

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
stuff the raised garden bed what have

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.240 
stuff the raised garden bed what have
you<00:04:17.030> are<00:04:17.120> all<00:04:17.209> square<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:17.930> block<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.470> the

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
you are all square and block so the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.770 
you are all square and block so the
ground<00:04:19.670> ones<00:04:19.940> can<00:04:20.150> be<00:04:20.239> something<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.630> little

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
ground ones can be something a little

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.480 
ground ones can be something a little
bit<00:04:20.959> nicer<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.190> that's<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.550> so<00:04:23.950> from<00:04:24.950> here<00:04:25.160> I

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
bit nicer so that's it so from here I

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.600 
bit nicer so that's it so from here I
built<00:04:25.940> built<00:04:26.900> this<00:04:27.020> side<00:04:27.320> up<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.740> we'll<00:04:28.460> see

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
built built this side up and we'll see

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.470 
built built this side up and we'll see
here<00:04:28.760> we<00:04:28.850> go<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:30.860> that's<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.730> so<00:04:31.910> far<00:04:31.940> with<00:04:32.330> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
here we go but that's it so far with the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.770 
here we go but that's it so far with the
fence<00:04:32.690> or<00:04:33.760> very<00:04:34.760> offense<00:04:35.210> whatever<00:04:35.600> you<00:04:35.660> want

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
fence or very offense whatever you want

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.010 
fence or very offense whatever you want
to<00:04:35.840> call<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.200> guess<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:38.150> as<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.630> pack<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:38.990> down

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
to call it I guess so as I pack it down

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.460 
to call it I guess so as I pack it down
from<00:04:39.440> there<00:04:40.240> it'll<00:04:41.240> just<00:04:41.420> compact<00:04:41.870> nice<00:04:42.230> and

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
from there it'll just compact nice and

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.690 
from there it'll just compact nice and
tight<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.890> then<00:04:42.980> I'll<00:04:43.100> be<00:04:43.190> able<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.430> build<00:04:43.520> it

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
tight and then I'll be able to build it

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.490 
tight and then I'll be able to build it
up<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:44.000> then<00:04:44.120> hopefully<00:04:44.960> be<00:04:45.080> able<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.320> start

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
up and then hopefully be able to start

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.290 
up and then hopefully be able to start
growing<00:04:46.270> cool<00:04:47.270> all<00:04:48.170> right<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.760> guess<00:04:49.820> what<00:04:50.270> i

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
growing cool all right so I guess what i

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.330 
growing cool all right so I guess what i
want<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.630> put<00:04:50.750> across<00:04:50.870> is<00:04:51.230> just<00:04:51.470> show<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:52.100> what

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
want to put across is just show you what

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.180 
want to put across is just show you what
I've<00:04:52.430> done<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:52.940> again<00:04:53.930> like<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.530> always<00:04:54.770> kind

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
I've done and again like I always kind

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.860 
I've done and again like I always kind
of<00:04:55.220> bang<00:04:55.430> on<00:04:55.580> about<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:56.060> just<00:04:56.210> using<00:04:56.480> stuff

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
of bang on about is just using stuff

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.240 
of bang on about is just using stuff
that<00:04:57.050> you've<00:04:57.140> actually<00:04:57.320> got<00:04:57.650> in<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.830> garden

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
that you've actually got in the garden

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.010 
that you've actually got in the garden
rather<00:04:58.490> than<00:04:58.669> buying<00:04:58.940> stuff<00:04:59.330> automatically

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
rather than buying stuff automatically

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.330 
rather than buying stuff automatically
like<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.560> could<00:05:00.740> have<00:05:00.830> just<00:05:01.010> gone<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.280> bought

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
like I could have just gone and bought

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.010 
like I could have just gone and bought
some<00:05:01.460> sleepers<00:05:02.060> put<00:05:02.300> them<00:05:02.390> in<00:05:02.510> and<00:05:02.630> being<00:05:02.750> done

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
some sleepers put them in and being done

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.159 
some sleepers put them in and being done
with<00:05:03.200> it<00:05:03.350> but<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:05.390> know<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:05.840> might<00:05:05.990> as<00:05:06.050> well
