the home support research project was an

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.499 
the home support research project was an
attempt<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.230> understand<00:00:10.889> if<00:00:11.219> children<00:00:11.639> could

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
attempt to understand if children could

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.289 
attempt to understand if children could
improve<00:00:13.019> their<00:00:13.290> academic<00:00:13.469> outcomes<00:00:14.309> even<00:00:15.150> if

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
improve their academic outcomes even if

children's performance in this project
is<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.399> started<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.000> baseline<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.660> English

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
is we started with a baseline in English

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
is we started with a baseline in English
and<00:00:37.079> maths<00:00:37.260> where<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.190> tested<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.760> their

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and maths where we tested them on their

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.200 
and maths where we tested them on their
grade<00:00:39.329> appropriate<00:00:40.040> content<00:00:41.040> when<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.790> tested

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
grade appropriate content when we tested

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850

them<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> end<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> project<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.829> looked

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
them at the end of the project we looked

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.760 
them at the end of the project we looked
at<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.910> same<00:00:45.180> work<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> beginning<00:00:45.840> but

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
at the same work in the beginning but

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
at the same work in the beginning but
also<00:00:46.950> by<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.280> time<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.850> had<00:00:47.879> moved<00:00:48.180> into<00:00:48.450> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
also by that time they had moved into a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.779 
also by that time they had moved into a
new<00:00:48.809> grade<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.010> wanted<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.579> whether

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
new grade so we wanted to know whether

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.189 
new grade so we wanted to know whether
they<00:00:51.030> were<00:00:51.090> going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> perform<00:00:51.690> better<00:00:51.899> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
they were going to perform better in

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
they were going to perform better in
their<00:00:52.350> new<00:00:52.559> grade<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.520> fact<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:53.910> did<00:00:53.969> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
their new grade and in fact they did in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.380 
their new grade and in fact they did in
almost<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.870> cases<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:56.180> exciting<00:00:57.180> thing

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
almost all cases the exciting thing

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.720 
almost all cases the exciting thing
about<00:00:57.480> nipe<00:00:57.840> ad<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> has<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.070> lot<00:00:59.609> of
