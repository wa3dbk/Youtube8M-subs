 called mars 419 moto casco helmet 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.239
 skull 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:50.019
 Marsy 's office is located in 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.730
 Hong Kong but the helmet itself is obvious 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.839
 factory china 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.659
 Available in many different colors. 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:02.449
 the most standard black is still 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:03.949
 green red blue white yellow helmet 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.950
 made of some kind of composite 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.460
 fiberglass type material here 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.970
 structure should be clearly visible 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.170
 quite dense weaving of fibers 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:20.590
 poured with some plastic or resin 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.380
 the helmet seems quite durable 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.600
 dot certified 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.170
 standard is known as one of the most 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.050
 available 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:37.760
 but still something just complicated form 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:40.580
 helmet and expensive material from which 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.710
 made the price and determine who can 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.159
 wear in two ways either like this 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.880
 masked forward or masked back and 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:57.130
 use with this visor bubble with 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:04.180
 habits are pretty hard to fasten 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.180
 tightly fastened but tightly held 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:19.340
 inside the helmet has a full damping 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:21.569
 foam layer and some hint at 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.950
 lining with ventilation but itself 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:29.540
 lining with unfortunately not removable 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.410
 double ring clasp 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.840
 the only flaw of the helmet we 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.650
 counted 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.450
 the fact that this plastic is darkened 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.510
 eye sockets fastened by just one bolt 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.720
 so with time that exploitation 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.239
 probably can rattle well and except 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.310
 moreover he dangles a little 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:02.220
 therefore turns on the edges of the sockets 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.110
 here it is scratched and of course there is the same 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.130
 plastic 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.640
 transparent so in the dark 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.880
 We answer you will not wear a mask forward but 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.190
 Generally we liked the helmet. 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.190
 pretty good quality thing and 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:25.860
 let's say great gift for those 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:28.310
 who goes went uterus casco good 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.690
 a present to a real biker in black leather 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.500
 who likes to amaze others and 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.500
 attract attention
