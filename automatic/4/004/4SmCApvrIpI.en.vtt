00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
pretty neat look at that we got sort of

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.090 
pretty neat look at that we got sort of
a<00:01:41.979> pattern<00:01:42.190> here<00:01:42.580> it's<00:01:42.700> almost<00:01:42.940> reticulated

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a pattern here it's almost reticulated
