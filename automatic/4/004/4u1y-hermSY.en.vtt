comparison guide in this video i want to
talk<00:00:05.940> about<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.299> Protoss<00:00:06.690> race<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.200> their

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
talk about the Protoss race and their

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.930 
talk about the Protoss race and their
build<00:00:07.680> mechanics<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.160> set<00:00:08.429> them<00:00:08.580> apart<00:00:08.610> from

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
build mechanics that set them apart from

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.480 
build mechanics that set them apart from
the<00:00:09.150> other<00:00:09.269> two<00:00:09.480> races<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:09.900> starcraft<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the other two races in starcraft the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.770 
the other two races in starcraft the
first<00:00:11.700> thing<00:00:11.849> i<00:00:11.910> want<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.120> talk<00:00:12.240> about<00:00:12.300> is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
first thing i want to talk about is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.320 
first thing i want to talk about is
their<00:00:13.200> style<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.099> building<00:00:14.280> unlike<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.120> other

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
their style of building unlike the other

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.090 
their style of building unlike the other
two<00:00:15.389> races<00:00:15.900> Protoss<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> only<00:00:16.770> race<00:00:17.070> that

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
two races Protoss is the only race that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.429 
two races Protoss is the only race that
can<00:00:17.430> actually<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:18.150> can<00:00:18.300> use<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.840> one

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
can actually you can use one you one

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.560 
can actually you can use one you one
worker<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.580> construct<00:00:21.000> your<00:00:21.090> entire<00:00:21.330> base

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
worker to construct your entire base

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.259 
worker to construct your entire base
which<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.140> nice<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:23.220> basic<00:00:23.670> building

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
which is really nice the basic building

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
which is really nice the basic building
you<00:00:24.539> need<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.750> build<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.289> off<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.680> your

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
you need to build first off is your

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.710 
you need to build first off is your
supply<00:00:26.340> supply<00:00:27.000> building<00:00:27.269> which<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.539> going

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
supply supply building which is going

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.060 
supply supply building which is going
increase<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.109> supply<00:00:28.470> count<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.980> can

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
increase your supply count so you can

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.420 
increase your supply count so you can
build<00:00:29.160> more<00:00:29.369> units<00:00:29.760> that's<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.630> pilot<00:00:30.990> and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
build more units that's your pilot and

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.750 
build more units that's your pilot and
unlike<00:00:32.430> other<00:00:33.590> unlike<00:00:34.590> others<00:00:34.829> hi<00:00:35.219> unit<00:00:35.550> or

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
buildings from other two races pylons
rxr<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.520> important<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.090> Protoss

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
rxr really important for a Protoss

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
rxr really important for a Protoss
player<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.890> pylon<00:00:41.280> sets<00:00:41.520> off<00:00:41.670> this

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
player because the pylon sets off this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.209 
player because the pylon sets off this
field<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:42.899> right<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:44.010> power

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
field as you see right here the power

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
field as you see right here the power
field<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:45.180> buildings<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.750> only<00:00:45.960> be

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
field and your buildings can only be

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
field and your buildings can only be
placed<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.800> power<00:00:47.070> field<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.969> every<00:00:48.270> time

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
placed in this power field so every time

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
placed in this power field so every time
you<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> build<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> building<00:00:49.440> aside<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you want to build a building aside the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
you want to build a building aside the
pylon<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> has<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.030> within<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.600> power

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
pylon it has to be within this power

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.770 
pylon it has to be within this power
field<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.770> powered<00:00:53.250> powered<00:00:54.120> by<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> pylon

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
field that's powered powered by a pylon

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.450 
field that's powered powered by a pylon
so<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.440> example<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so for example if I want to go to a a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.170 
so for example if I want to go to a a
gateway<00:00:57.859> it<00:00:58.859> has<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.640> power<00:00:59.910> field

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
gateway it has to be in this power field

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.490 
gateway it has to be in this power field
as<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.870> great<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.289> try<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
as you can see it's great if I try to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.869 
as you can see it's great if I try to
build<00:01:01.649> outside<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.219> power<00:01:02.460> field<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
build outside this power field it's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
build outside this power field it's
going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.149> red<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.780> allow<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.199> go

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
going to be red and just allow me to go

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.980 
going to be red and just allow me to go
there<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> build<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.990> inside

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
there so I have to build this inside

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.560 
there so I have to build this inside
this<00:01:07.110> pile<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.180> build

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this pile on as you can see I can build

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.560 
this pile on as you can see I can build
possible<00:01:10.170> though

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
possible though

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.980 
possible though
with<00:01:12.440> just<00:01:12.740> one<00:01:12.830> with<00:01:13.790> just<00:01:13.940> one<00:01:14.120> pro<00:01:14.360> which

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
with just one with just one pro which

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.110 
with just one with just one pro which
you<00:01:15.170> can't<00:01:15.380> do<00:01:15.500> any<00:01:15.740> other<00:01:15.830> ways<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.790> like<00:01:17.000> I

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
you can't do any other ways so like I

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.440 
you can't do any other ways so like I
said<00:01:17.180> only<00:01:17.570> one

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
said only one

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.529 
said only one
to<00:01:18.780> construct<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.259> entire<00:01:19.560> base<00:01:20.509> which<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
to construct your entire base which is

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.420 
to construct your entire base which is
right

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
right

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.900 
right
the<00:01:23.910> next<00:01:24.150> big<00:01:24.330> thing<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.910> Protoss

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
the next big thing on with the Protoss

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
the next big thing on with the Protoss
race<00:01:27.660> is<00:01:28.430> chrono<00:01:29.430> boost<00:01:29.700> your<00:01:30.240> Nexus<00:01:30.660> has<00:01:30.780> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
race is chrono boost your Nexus has this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
race is chrono boost your Nexus has this
ability<00:01:31.170> card<00:01:31.500> chrono<00:01:31.710> boost<00:01:31.980> which<00:01:32.160> is<00:01:32.340> going

lot faster boost up your economy and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.359 
lot faster boost up your economy and
then<00:01:46.290> later<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.010> need<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.160> couple

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
then later on if you need a couple

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.070 
then later on if you need a couple
upgrades<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.390> try<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.690> produce<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
upgrades or if you try and produce a

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.960 
upgrades or if you try and produce a
couple<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.410> units<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.310> quickly<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.880> get

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
couple of units really quickly to get

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.770 
couple of units really quickly to get
out<00:01:51.060> timing<00:01:51.360> push<00:01:51.690> such<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.140> Colossus<00:01:53.130> or

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
out timing push such as Colossus or

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.570 
out timing push such as Colossus or
immortals<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.830> was<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.190> with<00:01:56.430> an

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
immortals so if I was to go with an

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.210 
immortals so if I was to go with an
upgrade<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:56.970> can<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.390> use<00:01:58.380> Colonel<00:01:58.740> goose<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220

because<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.950> ability<00:03:23.250> warp<00:03:23.490> units<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:23.880> a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
because the ability warp units in a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.560 
because the ability warp units in a
battle<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.420> really<00:03:24.930> crucial<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.580> very<00:03:26.580> one<00:03:27.150> we

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
battle is really crucial and very one we

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.270 
battle is really crucial and very one we
should<00:03:27.960> help<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.470> game<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.070> as<00:03:29.190> you

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
should help you in this game so as you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.460 
should help you in this game so as you
see<00:03:29.490> here<00:03:29.700> I've<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> pylon<00:03:30.600> next<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.350> my

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
see here I've like a pylon next to my

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.890 
see here I've like a pylon next to my
opponent<00:03:31.830> space<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.580> i<00:03:32.610> select<00:03:33.210> w<00:03:33.660> which<00:03:33.780> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
opponent space so i select w which is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.450 
opponent space so i select w which is
the<00:03:34.020> hot<00:03:34.170> key<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.410> select<00:03:34.590> all<00:03:34.860> my<00:03:35.010> warp<00:03:35.220> gates

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
the hot key to select all my warp gates

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.380 
the hot key to select all my warp gates
and<00:03:36.240> then<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.540> could<00:03:36.600> just<00:03:36.870> warp<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.440> units

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
and then I could just warp in units

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.510 
and then I could just warp in units
wherever<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> powerful<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:41.190> don't<00:03:41.340> want<00:03:41.460> to

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
wherever in a powerful you don't want to

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.680 
wherever in a powerful you don't want to
do<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.610> like<00:03:41.910> my

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.740 

that<00:03:45.840> right<00:03:46.020> next<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.590> you

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
that right next to you

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.110 
that right next to you
well<00:03:48.110> as<00:03:48.350> us<00:03:48.620> he<00:03:48.800> can<00:03:49.040> warp<00:03:49.250> in<00:03:49.400> units<00:03:49.790> right

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
well as us he can warp in units right

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.510 
well as us he can warp in units right
there<00:03:50.360> which<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.570> really<00:03:50.990> nice<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.040> can<00:03:52.250> do

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
there which is really nice so I can do

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.400 
there which is really nice so I can do
it<00:03:52.610> anywhere<00:03:52.910> but<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.540> can't<00:03:53.780> do<00:03:53.900> offside

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
it anywhere but you can't do offside

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.110 
it anywhere but you can't do offside
power<00:03:54.620> field<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.280> can<00:03:55.400> warp<00:03:55.550> in<00:03:55.700> nemeth's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
power field so you can warp in nemeth's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.570 
power field so you can warp in nemeth's
anywhere<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.720> our<00:03:56.960> heels<00:03:57.230> but<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.370> can't

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
anywhere on our heels but that you can't

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.920 
anywhere on our heels but that you can't
do<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.820> off<00:03:58.970> off<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.330> power<00:03:59.720> field<00:04:00.400> so<00:04:01.930> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
do it off off the power field so the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.110 
do it off off the power field so the
next<00:04:03.170> big<00:04:03.350> thing<00:04:03.380> with<00:04:03.770> the<00:04:03.920> Protoss<00:04:04.280> units<00:04:04.670> or

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
next big thing with the Protoss units or

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.530 
next big thing with the Protoss units or
Protoss<00:04:05.990> race<00:04:06.200> is<00:04:06.410> other<00:04:06.920> units<00:04:07.430> any<00:04:08.209> of<00:04:08.390> their

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
Protoss race is other units any of their

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.060 
Protoss race is other units any of their
buildings<00:04:08.900> they<00:04:09.020> have<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.200> shield<00:04:09.560> shield

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
buildings they have a shield shield

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.350 
buildings they have a shield shield
technology<00:04:10.310> which<00:04:10.760> basically<00:04:11.060> they<00:04:11.330> have

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
technology which basically they have

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.470 
technology which basically they have
lower<00:04:11.690> H<00:04:11.900> key<00:04:12.200> but<00:04:12.980> we're<00:04:13.280> not<00:04:13.400> normal<00:04:14.060> unit

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
lower H key but we're not normal unit

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.930 
lower H key but we're not normal unit
but<00:04:14.959> they<00:04:15.110> also<00:04:15.290> have<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.560> shield<00:04:15.890> so<00:04:16.760> as<00:04:16.880> you

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
but they also have a shield so as you

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.500 
but they also have a shield so as you
can<00:04:17.090> see<00:04:17.269> here<00:04:18.640> tae<00:04:19.640> Joos<00:04:19.880> heavy<00:04:20.150> they<00:04:20.359> should

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
can see here tae Joos heavy they should

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.849 
can see here tae Joos heavy they should
be<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.690> atmosphere<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.350> shield<00:04:21.680> where

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
be the atmosphere and the shield where

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.010 
be the atmosphere and the shield where
something<00:04:21.890> goes

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.850 

I<00:04:29.530> grab<00:04:30.160> this<00:04:30.310> uniform<00:04:30.850> back<00:04:31.030> while<00:04:31.270> he<00:04:31.300> has<00:04:31.860> 00

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
I grab this uniform back while he has 00

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.650 
I grab this uniform back while he has 00
vinny<00:04:33.160> shield<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.820> he's<00:04:33.910> already<00:04:34.090> lost<00:04:34.240> labas

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
vinny shield and he's already lost labas

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.140 
vinny shield and he's already lost labas
HP<00:04:35.259> if<00:04:35.949> you<00:04:36.100> see<00:04:36.310> as<00:04:36.400> shooters<00:04:36.820> already

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
HP if you see as shooters already

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.460 
HP if you see as shooters already
regenerating<00:04:37.509> just<00:04:37.990> from<00:04:38.139> being<00:04:38.289> outside

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
regenerating just from being outside

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.580 
regenerating just from being outside
combat<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.780> over<00:04:40.780> time<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.199> shields<00:04:41.470> can

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
combat so over time and shields can

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.980 
combat so over time and shields can
regenerate<00:04:41.860> from<00:04:42.580> 0<00:04:43.000> up<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.300> 88<00:04:43.570> so<00:04:43.810> he

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
regenerate from 0 up to 88 so he

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.800 
regenerate from 0 up to 88 so he
basically<00:04:44.139> now<00:04:44.530> has<00:04:44.770> double<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.460> HP<00:04:45.910> or<00:04:46.120> the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
basically now has double the HP or the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.180 
basically now has double the HP or the
amount<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.080> health<00:04:47.289> once<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.740> shield<00:04:47.919> failure

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
amount of health once the shield failure

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.340 
amount of health once the shield failure
generates<00:04:48.729> and<00:04:49.000> that's<00:04:49.750> what<00:04:49.960> big<00:04:50.169> thing

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
generates and that's what big thing

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.560 
generates and that's what big thing
about<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.650> Protoss<00:04:51.009> is<00:04:51.310> their<00:04:51.820> shield<00:04:52.120> while

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
about the Protoss is their shield while

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.879 
about the Protoss is their shield while
they<00:04:52.720> have<00:04:52.840> lower<00:04:53.080> HP<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:53.680> have<00:04:53.770> the

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
they have lower HP that you have the

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.189 
they have lower HP that you have the
shield<00:04:54.190> so<00:04:54.490> after<00:04:54.820> battle<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:55.750> just<00:04:55.930> get<00:04:56.080> them

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
shield so after battle you just get them

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.080 
shield so after battle you just get them
out<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.410> battle<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:56.949> some<00:04:57.130> out<00:04:57.490> of<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.759> or

out of battle and some out of that or

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.939 
out of battle and some out of that or
she'll<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.419> regenerate<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.380> good<00:04:59.560> Protoss

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
she'll to regenerate and a good Protoss

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.350 
she'll to regenerate and a good Protoss
player<00:05:00.250> will<00:05:00.550> be<00:05:00.580> able<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.940> blink<00:05:01.150> these
