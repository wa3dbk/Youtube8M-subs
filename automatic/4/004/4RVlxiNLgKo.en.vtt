 strong smell of gasoline was already controlled 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.840

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.090
 risk of this type of this type of 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.740
 events mark the agenda here in 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.290

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.670
 what is crime prevention here in 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.189
 in apatzingán we see the images 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.720
 of this fire that was provoked as you 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.850
 said by two individuals who came to 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.250
 board a motorcycle launched the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.320
 Molotov cocktails and they fled 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.479
 There were two women inside the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.960

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.360
 they came up with some problem in the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.159
 hair due to the flames but 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.799
 fortunately nothing of consequences 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.200
 Now we see that the federal police 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.270
 is mobilizing the Mexican army 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.380

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.539

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.640

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.539

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.409

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.600
 area that can be an answer not 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.190

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.770

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.780

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.670
 that opened yesterday and every day there 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.500
 people about organized crime 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.570
 Call stores to close 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.070
 those who do not do so suffer 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.080
 consequences like what we are seeing 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.020
 now let's hope that also the authority 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.020
 put the batteries as it were and 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.420
