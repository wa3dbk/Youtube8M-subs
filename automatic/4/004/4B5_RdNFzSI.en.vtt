reduce<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.520> amount<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.790> stuff<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.030> we're

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
reduce the amount of stuff that we're

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.420 
reduce the amount of stuff that we're
creating<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.380> was<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.710> know<00:01:56.799> minimizing

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
creating so that was you know minimizing

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.490 
creating so that was you know minimizing
the<00:01:58.180> programs<00:01:58.540> that<00:01:58.659> we<00:01:58.840> have<00:01:58.869> in<00:01:59.170> creating

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
the programs that we have in creating

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.840 
the programs that we have in creating
electronic<00:01:59.829> programs<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.460> that's<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.670> same

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
electronic programs and that's the same

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.550 
electronic programs and that's the same
at<00:02:00.969> home<00:02:01.119> so<00:02:01.360> how<00:02:01.509> can<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:01.689> reduce<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.380> amount

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
at home so how can you reduce the amount

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.139 
at home so how can you reduce the amount
of<00:02:02.710> waste<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.369> you're<00:02:03.549> bringing<00:02:03.670> into<00:02:03.939> your

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
of waste that you're bringing into your

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.480 
of waste that you're bringing into your
home<00:02:04.299> throwaway<00:02:04.869> items<00:02:05.100> choosing<00:02:06.100> items<00:02:06.369> that

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
home throwaway items choosing items that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.060 
home throwaway items choosing items that
are<00:02:06.579> more<00:02:06.729> durable<00:02:07.110> looking<00:02:08.110> at<00:02:08.259> reusing<00:02:08.799> so

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
are more durable looking at reusing so

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.859 
are more durable looking at reusing so
what<00:02:09.369> opportunities<00:02:10.060> are<00:02:10.090> there<00:02:10.299> or<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.750> buy

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
what opportunities are there or to buy

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.110 
what opportunities are there or to buy
products<00:02:11.350> even<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.799> are

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
products even that are

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.780 
products even that are
it<00:02:12.150> out<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.420> reused<00:02:13.409> materials<00:02:13.590> there's<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.580> lot

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
it out of reused materials there's a lot

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.910 
it out of reused materials there's a lot
of<00:02:14.819> bedding<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.170> different<00:02:16.409> products<00:02:16.799> that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
a tip or two that I can be doing at home

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.890 
a tip or two that I can be doing at home
to<00:02:37.950> change<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.849> environment<00:02:39.329> at<00:02:39.510> home<00:02:39.750> as

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to change that environment at home as

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.289 
to change that environment at home as
well<00:02:40.019> sure<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.549> mean<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.000> look<00:02:42.120> at<00:02:42.239> your

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
well sure so I mean if you look at your

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.490 
well sure so I mean if you look at your
relationship<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:42.989> pet<00:02:43.170> there's<00:02:43.379> all

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
relationship with your pet there's all

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
types of ways to look at that footprint

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.300 
types of ways to look at that footprint
and<00:02:46.200> how<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.349> minimize<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.129> know

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and how to minimize it so you know

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.920 
and how to minimize it so you know
something<00:02:47.670> really<00:02:47.879> easy<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.329> just<00:02:48.510> picking<00:02:48.810> up

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
something really easy is just picking up

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.180 
something really easy is just picking up
after<00:02:49.200> your<00:02:49.319> pet<00:02:49.349> when<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.680> take<00:02:49.829> them<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.010> a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
after your pet when you take them for a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.550 
after your pet when you take them for a
walk<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:51.150> know<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.299> lot<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.690> people<00:02:52.049> take<00:02:52.530> it

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
walk you know a lot of people take it

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.809 
walk you know a lot of people take it
for<00:02:52.650> granted<00:02:52.799> but<00:02:53.250> if<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.519> look<00:02:53.670> at<00:02:53.760> our

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
for granted but if you look at our

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.000 
for granted but if you look at our
waterways<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.840> sad<00:02:55.049> state<00:02:55.319> now<00:02:55.620> ninety

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
waterways it's a sad state now ninety

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.470 
waterways it's a sad state now ninety
percent<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.370> our<00:02:56.459> waterways<00:02:56.790> are<00:02:56.940> polluted

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
percent of our waterways are polluted

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.360 
percent of our waterways are polluted
with<00:02:57.870> fecal<00:02:58.200> coliform<00:02:58.650> bacteria<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.220> that's

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
with fecal coliform bacteria and that's

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.099 
with fecal coliform bacteria and that's
created<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.879> pet<00:03:00.060> waste<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:00.780> if<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:00.959> do<00:03:01.079> a

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
created in pet waste so if we do a

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.630 
created in pet waste so if we do a
better<00:03:01.260> job<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.530> picking<00:03:01.859> up<00:03:02.069> after<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.370> pet<00:03:02.609> and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
better job of picking up after a pet and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.430 
better job of picking up after a pet and
making<00:03:03.000> sure<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.180> gets<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.349> right

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
making sure that gets to the right

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440 
making sure that gets to the right
disposal<00:03:04.980> bin<00:03:05.069> then<00:03:05.549> that's<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.060> know<00:03:06.180> one

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
disposal bin then that's if you know one

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.849 
disposal bin then that's if you know one
very<00:03:06.690> simple<00:03:06.930> thing<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.379> can<00:03:07.500> all<00:03:07.650> do

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
very simple thing that we can all do

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.190 
very simple thing that we can all do
maybe<00:03:08.670> they<00:03:08.819> get<00:03:08.970> back<00:03:09.120> sure<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.870> take<00:03:10.170> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
maybe they get back sure and take that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.770 
maybe they get back sure and take that
step<00:03:10.530> further<00:03:10.769> using<00:03:11.220> bags<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:12.180> biodegrade

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
step further using bags that biodegrade

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
step further using bags that biodegrade
as<00:03:12.930> well<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:13.680> many<00:03:13.859> different<00:03:14.010> things<00:03:14.159> that<00:03:14.579> we
