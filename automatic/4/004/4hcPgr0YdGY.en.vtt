out there on the market such as the HTC
One<00:00:33.239> X<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.719> let's<00:00:34.170> run<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> benchmark<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.430> see

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
One X so let's run the benchmark and see

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:56.510 
One X so let's run the benchmark and see
how<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> performs

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.280 

this<00:00:57.090> bit<00:00:57.300> isn't<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.690> exciting<00:00:57.780> i<00:00:58.200> would

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
this bit isn't very exciting i would

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.410 
this bit isn't very exciting i would
sing<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.620> song<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.190> something<00:00:59.520> but<00:00:59.700> I'm

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
got the greatest voice so we'll just

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:36.320 
got the greatest voice so we'll just
look<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.720> pictures

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.910 

and<00:01:37.230> there<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.500> go<00:01:37.530> we've<00:01:38.310> got<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.520> score<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
and there we go we've got a score of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.090 
and there we go we've got a score of
5060<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:41.550> is<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.110> well<00:01:43.110> above<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> last

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
5060 to which is a well above the last

5060 to which is a well above the last
st.<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.460> well<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.120> bit<00:01:45.330> above

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
st. not well if it's a little bit above

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.290 
st. not well if it's a little bit above
the<00:01:45.630> One<00:01:45.900> X<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> zoo's<00:01:47.640> transformer

the One X and the zoo's transformer

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.320 
the One X and the zoo's transformer
prime<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:49.410> nearly<00:01:50.160> double<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> motorola

atrix in the air the galaxy tab 10.1 and
it's<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.880> also<00:01:57.120> double<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.720> year<00:01:57.870> the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
it's you know also double the year the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.100 
it's you know also double the year the
year<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.640> Samsung<00:01:59.970> Galaxy<00:02:00.000> Nexus<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.020> it

looks like with this quad core processor

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.920 
looks like with this quad core processor
in<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.370> Samsung<00:02:05.910> have<00:02:06.210> done<00:02:06.450> an<00:02:06.570> absolutely
