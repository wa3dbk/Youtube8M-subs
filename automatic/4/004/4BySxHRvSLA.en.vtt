00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
wouldn't place them in a bag because

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.640 
wouldn't place them in a bag because
they<00:02:03.880> could<00:02:04.060> pick<00:02:04.270> out<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.479> card<00:02:04.840> on<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.260> answer

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
they could pick out a card on the answer

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.070 
they could pick out a card on the answer
side<00:02:05.860> but<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.490> have<00:02:06.880> them<00:02:07.060> placed<00:02:07.360> in<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.630> canvas

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
side but I have them placed in a canvas

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.759 
side but I have them placed in a canvas
box<00:02:08.289> all<00:02:08.739> face-up<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:11.110> they<00:02:11.319> can<00:02:11.500> just

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
box all face-up and so they can just

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.880 
box all face-up and so they can just
pick<00:02:12.010> out<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.280> card<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:13.180> work<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.629> they<00:02:14.440> solve

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
pick out a card to work on they solve

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.339 
pick out a card to work on they solve
whatever<00:02:15.129> skill<00:02:15.879> problem<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.049> card

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
whatever skill problem is on the card

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.070 
whatever skill problem is on the card
and<00:02:17.620> then<00:02:17.830> they<00:02:18.010> poke<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.489> right<00:02:18.730> answer<00:02:19.269> with

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
and then they poke the right answer with

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.289 
and then they poke the right answer with
their<00:02:20.349> poker<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.099> they<00:02:21.610> can<00:02:21.760> either<00:02:21.909> self

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
their poker and they can either self

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.089 
their poker and they can either self
check<00:02:22.569> if<00:02:22.720> they're<00:02:22.870> by<00:02:23.019> themselves<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.950> turn

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
check if they're by themselves and turn

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.190 
check if they're by themselves and turn
the<00:02:24.220> card<00:02:24.459> around<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.060> see<00:02:25.269> if<00:02:25.510> they<00:02:25.659> poke<00:02:25.959> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
the card around and see if they poke the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.009 
the card around and see if they poke the
circle<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.709> it's<00:02:26.890> marked<00:02:27.129> or<00:02:27.400> if<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.780> have

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
circle that it's marked or if I have

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.930 
circle that it's marked or if I have
them<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:29.319> other<00:02:29.830> students<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.370> always<00:02:30.580> tell

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
them with other students I always tell

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.910 
them with other students I always tell
them<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.239> have<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> partner<00:02:31.989> check<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.620> just

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
them to have a partner check this just

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.489 
them to have a partner check this just
reinforces<00:02:33.760> accountability<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:35.260> they're

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:35.499 
reinforces accountability that they're

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.010 
reinforces accountability that they're
really<00:02:35.799> doing<00:02:36.189> it

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
really doing it

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.440 
really doing it
and<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:38.130> somebody<00:02:38.580> else<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.910> checking<00:02:39.210> them

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
and that somebody else is checking them

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.970 
and that somebody else is checking them
and<00:02:39.600> not<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:39.750> themselves<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:40.650> they<00:02:40.860> can

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
and not just themselves but they can

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.640 
and not just themselves but they can
also<00:02:41.130> do<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.700> independently<00:02:42.660> by<00:02:43.020> themselves

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
also do this independently by themselves

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.090 
also do this independently by themselves
for<00:02:43.920> early<00:02:44.220> finishers<00:02:44.700> also<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.650> hope<00:02:46.890> I've
