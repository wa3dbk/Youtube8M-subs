pretty full push it down now you grow

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.349 
pretty full push it down now you grow
mint<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.979> obviously<00:01:17.280> comes<00:01:17.759> back<00:01:17.999> a<00:01:18.030> year<00:01:18.270> in

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
mint it obviously comes back a year in

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.569 
mint it obviously comes back a year in
the<00:01:18.450> summertime<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.079> it<00:01:19.499> spreads<00:01:20.130> sprouts

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
the summertime and it spreads sprouts

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.940 
the summertime and it spreads sprouts
roots<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.960> keeps<00:01:22.079> on<00:01:22.259> coming<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:22.710> year

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
roots so it keeps on coming back year

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.739 
roots so it keeps on coming back year
after<00:01:23.009> year<00:01:23.310> probably<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> best<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.539> grow<00:01:24.689> it

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
after year probably the best to grow it

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.349 
after year probably the best to grow it
in<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> container<00:01:25.609> because<00:01:26.609> it<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.939> otherwise

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
in a container because it can otherwise

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.450 
in a container because it can otherwise
take<00:01:27.630> over<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.140> garden<00:01:28.289> and<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.219> you<00:01:29.280> don't

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
have a garden you can grow it in a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.190 
have a garden you can grow it in a
winter<00:01:30.749> box

winter box

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.429 
winter box
nice<00:01:31.679> Sony's<00:01:32.130> window<00:01:32.640> box<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.259> about

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
nice Sony's window box so that's about

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.779 
nice Sony's window box so that's about
there<00:01:34.649> or<00:01:34.829> isn't<00:01:35.189> respite<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
there or isn't respite from the

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.260 
there or isn't respite from the

into<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:17.989> oil<00:04:18.020> and<00:04:18.560> then<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.340> use<00:04:19.520> the<00:04:19.669> oil

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
into the oil and then you use the oil

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.789 
into the oil and then you use the oil
now<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:20.840> has<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.260> go

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
now this has to go

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.960 
now this has to go
on<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.810> very<00:04:23.810> very<00:04:24.350> low<00:04:24.620> heat<00:04:24.919> you<00:04:25.610> know<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:25.730> can

on a very very low heat you know I can

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.900 
on a very very low heat you know I can
touch<00:04:26.180> this<00:04:26.390> pan<00:04:26.630> okay<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.669> oil

touch this pan okay and the oil
obviously<00:04:29.419> never<00:04:30.200> get<00:04:30.800> beyond<00:04:31.360> temperature

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
obviously never get beyond temperature

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.920
