00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.370
 so then everyone remembers that we have the last 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.189
 The survey showed that some of ours 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.710
 people very interesting passing with 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.150
 mods mechanisms and something else that's 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 immediately before starting it 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.310
 passage could with mods and the rest 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.960
 the projects you choose I want 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.449
 show you one mechanism in which 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.550
 called automatic half bye 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.869
 I do not know can not work out and me 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.760
 maybe not at least it's still 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.230
 snapshot 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.540
 this is done on the basis of funnels 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.059
 funnels come up with only this 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.129
 snapshots how things work 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.079
 Funnel is a tool like any 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.370
 say which loads automatically 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.170
 all of the blocks that have inventory in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.590
 another block that has inventory 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.930
 items pass through them and the thing can 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.930
 show you that the funnel is 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.780
 why everything is so here by the way you can see 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.719
 that the funnels are connected some sideways to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.610
 stove some chests how things work 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.840
 the upper part in the rock absorbs resources 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.030
 from the chest yes and actually no 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.700
 so you can not connect for what reason 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.470
 I show exactly how it turns out 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 the chests take the necessary resources that is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.540
 let's say a cobblestone from the top chest 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.580
 so all this is loaded funnels and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.850
 enters the stove necessarily to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.770
 entered the stove as a material for 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.229
 melting must be connected 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.750
 funnel top because if 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.270
 plug in from the side it will 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.280
 join stove like fuel 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.030
 hence it can be understood that these funnels 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:50.070
 sides up or show the funnels on the sides they 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.649
 immersed fuel in the stove lower funnels 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.560
 already download what you melted in 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.399
 fate so we can just load 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.350
 here fuel and a huge amount 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.840
 material and well maybe just melts 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.840
 very long that's it by the way simplified 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.149
 option option and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.819
 this half himself recently came up with how 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.530
 Only it was left 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.739
 I hit my head and I do n't know 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.109
 use already or no one on us 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:25.579
 use after the start of the release by the way 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:27.349
 here I will show the chest by the way 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.370
 showing the recipe funnel as she 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.349
 crafting 5 iron and one ordinary chest 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.310
 it turns out ready funnel as an article 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.840
 connect or 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.150
 look here i'm showing to 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.900
 connect it must be clamped 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.489
 shift and click on the other side of the crow tu 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.019
 side of the subject in which there will be all 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.109
 dump absorb here for example here 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:58.639
 Now I plugged the fuel into the stove 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:00.709
 funnel and here it is not necessary on the stove 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.870
 top click on the stove top 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.669
 you see she can see that she connected 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.900
 like that to work here 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:12.379
 absorbed stone here you lina elena what 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.819
 you do it all here you are 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.579
 you can see how I load here 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.609
 cobble yes and she in the stove all 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:25.069
 does not automatically work out okay 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:28.729
 and straining hard coal from here 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.370
 taken again need to put it on 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:34.310
 chests yes here's my own thefts i 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.949
 I will demonstrate how everything works and 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.199
 It looks like the easiest but very 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:43.909
 my wash is very happy in my opinion 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:45.650
 the same mechanism as desired by the way can 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.389
 remind that funnels are disabled 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.209
 diet if anyone is interested in 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.659
 stop can be fuel supply or 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.540
 something like that it was the easiest 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.969
 the mechanism is automatically half with you 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.150
 was x by the way by the way I will remind more 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:04.909
 what are the advantages of this funnel so that you can 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.659
 absolutely any different piles are absorbed 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.459
 put there stones bulyga sense of ore 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.789
 she will not be clogged in the stoves 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.400
 due to allegedly not material here 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:18.109
 was them and there will be no all 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.180
 everything will work fine 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.470
 perfect 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.630
 melts pretty quickly 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:29.300
 and in the meantime you can do what 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:35.350
 in general, it was, let's say , one 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.790
 from our project mechanisms leading 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.880
 I told I donate and shot the operator 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.950
 steals everyone thanks understood you all 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.950
 I liked everything so far and see you soon
