able<00:00:30.830> to<00:00:30.980> show<00:00:31.280> us<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:31.460> sort<00:00:31.789> of<00:00:31.820> rough<00:00:32.170> concept

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
able to show us a sort of rough concept

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.160 
able to show us a sort of rough concept
of<00:00:33.559> how<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:33.950> suit<00:00:34.309> might<00:00:34.579> look<00:00:35.050> what<00:00:36.050> they

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
of how the suit might look what they

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.869 
of how the suit might look what they
have<00:00:36.289> is<00:00:36.410> essentially<00:00:36.890> two<00:00:37.129> suits<00:00:37.430> which<00:00:37.699> they

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
have is essentially two suits which they

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.080 
have is essentially two suits which they
feed<00:00:38.149> compressed<00:00:38.719> air<00:00:38.989> between<00:00:39.850> so<00:00:40.850> what<00:00:41.000> we

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
feed compressed air between so what we

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.810 
feed compressed air between so what we
found<00:00:41.360> at<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.570> moment<00:00:41.960> is<00:00:42.310> we<00:00:43.310> kind<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.610> put

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
found at the moment is we kind of put

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.110 
found at the moment is we kind of put
air<00:00:44.510> in<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.720> suit<00:00:45.280> before<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:46.700> put<00:00:46.880> on<00:00:46.910> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
air in the suit before you put on the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.220 
air in the suit before you put on the
belts<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.160> kind<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.310> accessories<00:00:49.880> on<00:00:50.230> it

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
belts and kind of accessories on it

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.200 
belts and kind of accessories on it
stays<00:00:51.500> inflated<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.700> but<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.000> was<00:00:53.149> the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
stays inflated so but that was the

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.729 
stays inflated so but that was the
biggest<00:00:53.329> worry<00:00:53.690> really<00:00:53.899> is<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:54.380> when<00:00:54.649> the

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
biggest worry really is that when the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.049 
biggest worry really is that when the
belt<00:00:54.950> ceilings<00:00:55.220> on<00:00:55.370> there<00:00:55.550> they<00:00:55.700> would<00:00:55.850> just

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
belt ceilings on there they would just

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.790 
belt ceilings on there they would just
kind<00:00:56.390> of<00:00:56.450> cut<00:00:56.630> off<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.960> airflow<00:00:57.110> to<00:00:57.380> different

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
kind of cut off the airflow to different

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:08.070 
kind of cut off the airflow to different
parts<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.100> suits

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.150 

like<00:01:09.730> how<00:01:10.730> cool<00:01:10.970> do<00:01:11.240> they<00:01:11.740> break<00:01:12.740> breezy

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
like how cool do they break breezy

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.890 
like how cool do they break breezy
inside<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.850> know<00:01:14.150> it's<00:01:14.330> like<00:01:14.480> being<00:01:14.510> wrapped<00:01:14.810> in

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
inside I know it's like being wrapped in

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.280 
inside I know it's like being wrapped in
a<00:01:15.020> nice<00:01:16.270> they<00:01:17.270> haven't<00:01:17.540> started<00:01:17.750> work<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
a nice they haven't started work on the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.350 
a nice they haven't started work on the
actual<00:01:18.620> helmet<00:01:18.860> yet<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:19.460> they<00:01:19.610> sort<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.090> found

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
actual helmet yet so they sort of found

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.140 
actual helmet yet so they sort of found
this<00:01:20.510> like<00:01:20.960> Lego<00:01:21.590> type<00:01:22.190> helmet<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.910> they<00:01:23.030> had

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
this like Lego type helmet that they had

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:39.340 
this like Lego type helmet that they had
lying<00:01:23.390> around<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.810> workshop<00:01:38.110> they<00:01:39.110> had<00:01:39.260> it

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
lying around the workshop they had it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.470 
lying around the workshop they had it
hooked<00:01:39.500> up<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.830> like<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.460> remains<00:01:40.880> compressor

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
hooked up to like it remains compressor

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.930 
hooked up to like it remains compressor
when<00:01:42.350> they<00:01:42.470> showed<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:42.980> us<00:01:43.130> but<00:01:43.370> ultimately

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
when they showed it to us but ultimately

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.400 
when they showed it to us but ultimately
there<00:01:44.180> will<00:01:44.270> be<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.450> battery-powered<00:01:44.930> whine

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
there will be a battery-powered whine

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.350 
there will be a battery-powered whine
actually<00:01:45.830> dressed<00:01:46.190> into<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.300> the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
actually dressed into one of the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.180 
actually dressed into one of the
mechanisms<00:01:47.930> on<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.230> suit<00:01:50.890> really<00:01:51.890> good<00:01:52.040> there

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
mechanisms on the suit really good there

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.730 
mechanisms on the suit really good there
that<00:01:52.340> well<00:01:53.000> we<00:01:53.120> thought<00:01:53.330> we<00:01:53.630> were<00:01:53.780> hanging<00:01:54.470> on

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
that well we thought we were hanging on

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.880 
that well we thought we were hanging on
the<00:01:54.940> disguise<00:01:56.200> there's<00:01:57.200> quite<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.440> big<00:01:57.620> feature

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
the disguise there's quite a big feature

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.250 
the disguise there's quite a big feature
of<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.220> drawing<00:01:58.550> other<00:01:58.730> season<00:01:59.120> so<00:02:00.080> there's

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
obviously quite a lot of work still to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.480 
obviously quite a lot of work still to
do<00:02:02.150> they<00:02:02.510> have<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.720> dye<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.110> suits<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.100> amber

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
straps and mechanisms there's going to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.910 
straps and mechanisms there's going to
be<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.390> fan<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:09.020> rotates<00:02:09.440> on<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.709> back

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
be a fan that rotates on the back

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.740 
be a fan that rotates on the back
there's<00:02:10.220> going<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.369> be<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.550> sort<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.510> rubber

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
there's going to be a sort of rubber

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.530 
there's going to be a sort of rubber
bulb<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.440> inflates<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.280> deflates<00:02:13.340> as<00:02:14.120> max

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
bulb that inflates and deflates as max

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.199 
bulb that inflates and deflates as max
breathes<00:02:15.020> but<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.310> very<00:02:16.550> exciting<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.090> see

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
breathes but it was very exciting to see

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.790 
breathes but it was very exciting to see
what<00:02:17.420> they've<00:02:17.570> done<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:17.959> far<00:02:17.989> enough<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.560> can't

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
what they've done so far enough I can't

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.730 
what they've done so far enough I can't
wait<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.070> see<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.280> finished<00:02:19.430> thing
