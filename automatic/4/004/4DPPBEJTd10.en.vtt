off and also be able to take them with
you<00:00:52.340> before<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.489> took<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> look<00:00:54.120> at<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> SDK<00:00:54.930> we

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you before we took a look at the SDK we

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
you before we took a look at the SDK we
wondered<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.550> possible<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.120> have

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
wondered is it actually possible to have

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.869 
wondered is it actually possible to have
the<00:00:57.660> same<00:00:57.899> nice<00:00:58.170> animations<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> Apple<00:00:59.730> uses

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the same nice animations that Apple uses

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240 
the same nice animations that Apple uses
in<00:01:00.180> their<00:01:00.359> own<00:01:00.510> apps<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.469> those<00:01:01.680> wonder

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
in their own apps and all those wonder

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.460 
in their own apps and all those wonder
if<00:01:02.399> moments<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:03.120> turned<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:04.019> yes

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
if moments really turned out to be yes

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
if moments really turned out to be yes
in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> end<00:01:05.040> what's<00:01:05.549> been<00:01:05.760> great<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
in the end what's been great about the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
in the end what's been great about the
iPhone<00:01:06.810> SDK<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.950> allowed<00:01:08.250> us<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.640> take

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
iPhone SDK is that allowed us to take

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.480 
iPhone SDK is that allowed us to take
the<00:01:09.330> out-of-the-box<00:01:09.869> UI<00:01:10.320> elements<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:10.979> use

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the out-of-the-box UI elements and use

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.550 
the out-of-the-box UI elements and use
them<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.760> our<00:01:11.909> app<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.360> customize<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.409> our

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
them in our app then customize it to our

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
them in our app then customize it to our
needs<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.790> had<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> develop<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
needs if we had to develop that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.300 
needs if we had to develop that
ourselves<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.530> couldn't<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.950> created

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
ourselves we couldn't have created

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.370 
ourselves we couldn't have created
things<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> iPhone<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.659> such<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> short

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
things for the iPhone in such a short

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.010 
things for the iPhone in such a short
time<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:20.280> example<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> checkbox

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
time one example is we have a checkbox

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.200 
time one example is we have a checkbox
next<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.619> each<00:01:22.710> task<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.729> check<00:01:24.000> off

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
next to each task that you can check off

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
next to each task that you can check off
but<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.320> able<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
but we were actually able to make the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
but we were actually able to make the
terrible<00:01:26.520> area<00:01:26.820> bigger<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.780> really

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
terrible area bigger and you can really

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.649 
terrible area bigger and you can really
customize<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.369> fine<00:01:29.610> details<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.329> every

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
customize the fine details of every

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.160 
customize the fine details of every
aspect<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.530> SDK<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> best

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
aspect of this SDK you can have the best

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
aspect of this SDK you can have the best
software<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> planet<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.520> nobody<00:01:35.880> knows

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
software on the planet but nobody knows

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:36.620 
software on the planet but nobody knows
about<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
about it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.440 
about it
just<00:01:37.320> being<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> App<00:01:38.009> Store<00:01:38.130> doubled<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
just being in the App Store doubled the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.929 
just being in the App Store doubled the
amount<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:40.259> webpage<00:01:40.890> visits<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.729> each<00:01:41.909> day

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
amount of webpage visits we get each day

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.749 
amount of webpage visits we get each day
so<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> App<00:01:42.990> Store<00:01:43.290> helped<00:01:43.890> us<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.310> broaden

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so the App Store helped us to broaden

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.410 
so the App Store helped us to broaden
