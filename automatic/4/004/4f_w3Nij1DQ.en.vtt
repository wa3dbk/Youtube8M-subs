hey there this is a little guide to how
to<00:00:04.339> make<00:00:05.339> some<00:00:05.970> cheap<00:00:06.720> super<00:00:07.710> cheap<00:00:07.950> super

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
to make some cheap super cheap super

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.400 
to make some cheap super cheap super
easy<00:00:09.269> weather<00:00:10.230> proof<00:00:10.620> signs<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:12.139> here's<00:00:13.139> an

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
easy weather proof signs and here's an

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.410 
easy weather proof signs and here's an
example<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.429> finished<00:00:14.910> product<00:00:15.330> right

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
example of the finished product right

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.420 
example of the finished product right
here<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.670> completely<00:00:18.119> laminated<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
here and it's completely laminated and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.580 
here and it's completely laminated and
this<00:00:20.430> will<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.699> very<00:00:21.420> much<00:00:21.600> more<00:00:22.320> cost

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
this will be very much more cost

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.349 
this will be very much more cost
effective<00:00:23.220> than<00:00:23.910> if<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.449> were<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.869> buy<00:00:25.109> signs

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
effective than if you were to buy signs

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.720 
effective than if you were to buy signs
to<00:00:27.359> go<00:00:27.510> over<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> material<00:00:28.800> list<00:00:29.039> I'll<00:00:29.550> be

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to go over the material list I'll be

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.520 
to go over the material list I'll be
using<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:32.360> 1.5<00:00:33.360> mil<00:00:34.730> hot<00:00:36.079> hot<00:00:37.079> sealing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
using this 1.5 mil hot hot sealing

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.310 
using this 1.5 mil hot hot sealing
laminate<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.100> bought<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> roll<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.660> two<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.079> these

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
laminate I bought a roll of two of these

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.670 
laminate I bought a roll of two of these
and<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.579> made<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:42.450> two<00:00:43.050> hundred<00:00:43.079> signs

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and this is made over two hundred signs

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.459 
and this is made over two hundred signs
right<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.390> other<00:00:45.539> roll<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.289> not

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
right here and the other roll I have not

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.189 
right here and the other roll I have not
used<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:49.250> let's<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.399> started<00:00:51.199> first

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
used at all so let's get started first

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.479 
used at all so let's get started first
you'll<00:00:52.860> want<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.629> this<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.110> using<00:00:55.590> two

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you'll want to this is just using two

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.900 
you'll want to this is just using two
sheets<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> paper<00:00:57.120> right<00:00:57.719> here<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
sheets of paper right here like this I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.590 
sheets of paper right here like this I
put<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> border<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.410> it'd<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:02.600> more

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
put a border on this so it'd be more

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.320 
put a border on this so it'd be more
connected<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> laid<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.189> front<00:01:05.400> like

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
connected when it laid in front like

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.740 
connected when it laid in front like
that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
that
so<00:01:06.960> first<00:01:08.659> line<00:01:09.659> them<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:16.130> this<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.340> only

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so first line them all up this is only

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
so first line them all up this is only
you<00:01:18.180> only<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> put<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you only have to do this if you put a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
you only have to do this if you put a
border<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> feel<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> border

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
border on it but I feel like the border

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.960 
border on it but I feel like the border
makes<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> look<00:01:22.710> more<00:01:23.040> complete<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
makes it look more complete and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.039 
makes it look more complete and
professional<00:01:24.869> use<00:01:25.310> bigger<00:01:26.310> scissors<00:01:27.049> and

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
professional use bigger scissors and

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.870 
professional use bigger scissors and
just<00:01:28.650> quickly<00:01:30.200> cuts<00:01:31.200> across<00:01:34.640> pulling<00:01:35.640> this

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
just quickly cuts across pulling this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:46.249 
just quickly cuts across pulling this
corner<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:42.689> am<00:01:42.840> cutting<00:01:44.659> ten<00:01:45.659> sheets<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
corner and I am cutting ten sheets at a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.880 
corner and I am cutting ten sheets at a
time<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.979> cutting<00:01:47.840> will<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:49.530> your

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
time because cutting will be your

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.569 
time because cutting will be your
largest<00:01:50.430> time<00:01:51.270> expense<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.310> clean

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
largest time expense and then just clean

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.560 
largest time expense and then just clean
it<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.189> I'm<00:01:59.340> doing<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.479> know

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it up and I'm doing just this you know

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.749 
it up and I'm doing just this you know
just<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.350> fast<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.799> possible<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.430> could<00:02:02.610> be

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
just as fast as possible I could be

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.840 
just as fast as possible I could be
neater<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:04.290> they're<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.520> signs

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
neater but if they're going to be signs

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.699 
neater but if they're going to be signs
that<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.420> placed<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:08.720> telephone<00:02:09.720> pole<00:02:09.929> or

anything that people are driving by

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.110 
anything that people are driving by
I<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.500> little<00:02:13.890> mistakes<00:02:14.070> will<00:02:14.820> not<00:02:15.120> show<00:02:15.420> up

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120

more sloppily okay alright you'll take
these<00:02:30.570> two<00:02:31.020> right<00:02:31.260> there<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.330> it

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
these two right there I like to do it

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.880 
these two right there I like to do it
this<00:02:33.570> way<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> lay<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.320> over

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
this way I lay it over

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.800 
this way I lay it over
line<00:02:35.340> up<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.730> border<00:02:36.030> edges<00:02:36.570> like<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:38.600> put<00:02:39.600> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
line up the border edges like that put a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.250 
line up the border edges like that put a
small<00:02:40.770> piece<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.130> tape<00:02:41.550> between<00:02:41.820> them<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:43.050> hold

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
small piece of tape between them to hold

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.600 
small piece of tape between them to hold
them<00:02:43.440> together<00:02:43.590> when<00:02:44.040> you're<00:02:44.190> working<00:02:44.580> with

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
them together when you're working with

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.740 
them together when you're working with
it<00:02:47.300> just<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.890> little<00:02:49.890> bit<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.130> tape<00:02:50.310> will<00:02:50.520> work

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
it just a little bit of tape will work

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.970 
it just a little bit of tape will work
you<00:02:51.750> could<00:02:51.930> probably<00:02:52.080> use<00:02:52.350> more<00:02:52.650> than<00:02:52.830> this

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
you could probably use more than this

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.940 
you could probably use more than this
but<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:54.960> is<00:02:55.140> all<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.920> really

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
but this just to see is all you really

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.080 
but this just to see is all you really
need<00:02:56.510> all<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.990> then<00:02:58.500> you'll<00:02:58.650> put<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.850> to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
need all right then you'll put that to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.870 
need all right then you'll put that to
the<00:03:00.120> side<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:03.860> your<00:03:04.860> first<00:03:05.130> couple<00:03:05.460> times<00:03:05.640> of

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
the side and your first couple times of

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.820 
the side and your first couple times of
these<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.270> might<00:03:06.480> be<00:03:06.630> more<00:03:06.810> difficult<00:03:06.870> but

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
these it might be more difficult but

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.980 
these it might be more difficult but
once<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.130> get<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:08.580> 20<00:03:09.150> or<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:09.480> under<00:03:09.840> your

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
once you get like 20 or so under your

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.640 
once you get like 20 or so under your
belt<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:11.250> will<00:03:11.520> be<00:03:12.020> you<00:03:13.020> know<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.200> could<00:03:13.530> do

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
belt it will be you know you could do

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.720 
belt it will be you know you could do
this<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.640> could<00:03:15.030> crack<00:03:15.600> out<00:03:15.810> three<00:03:16.530> done<00:03:16.770> you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
this you could crack out three done you

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.610 
this you could crack out three done you
know<00:03:17.850> two<00:03:18.210> to<00:03:18.330> three<00:03:18.540> times<00:03:18.780> as<00:03:18.990> many<00:03:19.170> as<00:03:19.440> when

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
know two to three times as many as when

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.470 
know two to three times as many as when
you<00:03:19.710> first<00:03:19.740> start<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:21.060> don't<00:03:21.330> be

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
you first start it so don't be

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.840 
you first start it so don't be
discouraged<00:03:21.660> if<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.500> takes<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.860> bit<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.070> time<00:03:23.190> so

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
discouraged if it takes a bit of time so

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.320 
discouraged if it takes a bit of time so
what<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.090> did<00:03:24.210> was<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.840> sort<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:26.000> rolled<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.150> out

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
what I did was I sort of I rolled it out

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.030 
what I did was I sort of I rolled it out
and<00:03:27.750> flipped<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.170> back<00:03:28.290> over<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.890> it's

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and flipped it back over so it's

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.910 
and flipped it back over so it's
covering<00:03:29.340> both<00:03:29.640> sides<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.390> make<00:03:31.260> sure<00:03:31.530> there's

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
covering both sides I make sure there's

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.680 
covering both sides I make sure there's
a<00:03:32.400> good<00:03:34.280> about<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.550> quarter<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.240> half<00:03:36.450> inch

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
a good about a quarter to a half inch

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.730 
a good about a quarter to a half inch
from<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.410> edges<00:03:38.240> just<00:03:39.240> help<00:03:40.080> with<00:03:40.260> sealing

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
from the edges just help with sealing

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.530 
from the edges just help with sealing
then<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.520> take<00:03:41.760> my<00:03:41.790> razor<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.710> have<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.540> I

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
then I take my razor that I have and I

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.800 
then I take my razor that I have and I
run<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.050> along<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.530> edge<00:03:46.770> pull<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.220> taut<00:03:47.810> run

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
run it along this edge pull it taut run

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.400 
run it along this edge pull it taut run
it<00:03:48.960> along<00:03:49.080> this<00:03:49.440> edge<00:03:50.510> very<00:03:51.510> simple<00:03:52.050> very<00:03:52.260> easy

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
it along this edge very simple very easy

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.940 
it along this edge very simple very easy
you're<00:03:52.950> almost<00:03:53.070> ready<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.520> go<00:03:53.840> now<00:03:54.950> you'll

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
you're almost ready to go now you'll

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.970 
you're almost ready to go now you'll
take<00:03:56.220> your<00:03:56.370> iron<00:03:56.730> which<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.750> been<00:03:58.440> heating<00:03:58.830> up

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
take your iron which is been heating up

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.300 
take your iron which is been heating up
this<00:03:59.370> time<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.840> have<00:04:00.990> it<00:04:01.140> set<00:04:01.170> at<00:04:01.620> five<00:04:01.980> you

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
this time and I have it set at five you

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.370 
this time and I have it set at five you
want<00:04:02.520> it<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.670> little<00:04:02.820> bit<00:04:03.060> higher<00:04:03.300> then<00:04:04.140> you'd

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
want it a little bit higher then you'd

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.110 
want it a little bit higher then you'd
think<00:04:04.650> with<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.010> plastic<00:04:05.520> and<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:05.940> hit

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
think with the plastic and you just hit

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.090 
think with the plastic and you just hit
it<00:04:06.150> really<00:04:06.390> quick<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:07.200> move<00:04:07.410> from<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.740> center

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
it really quick you move from the center

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
it really quick you move from the center
out<00:04:08.630> just<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.910> really<00:04:11.910> fast<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:14.400> then

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
out just like that really fast and then

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.729 
out just like that really fast and then
you<00:04:15.270> hold<00:04:15.420> down<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.810> edges<00:04:15.960> just<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.470> bit

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
you hold down the edges just a bit

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.250 
you hold down the edges just a bit
because<00:04:17.280> when<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.450> heat<00:04:18.690> will<00:04:18.930> make<00:04:19.080> it

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
because when the the heat will make it

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.039 
because when the the heat will make it
shrivel<00:04:19.980> up<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.400> if<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.330> cool<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.870> off<00:04:22.020> a

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
shrivel up and if you cool it off a

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.369 
shrivel up and if you cool it off a
little<00:04:22.290> bit

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:24.379 
little bit

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.050 
little bit
it<00:04:25.379> will<00:04:25.530> shrivel<00:04:25.770> just<00:04:26.069> a<00:04:26.159> little<00:04:26.400> bit<00:04:26.550> less

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
it will shrivel just a little bit less

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.239 
it will shrivel just a little bit less
all<00:04:27.569> right<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.990> have<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.409> basics<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.129> it

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:29.249 
all right you have the basics of it

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:31.369 
all right you have the basics of it
right<00:04:29.430> there<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:29.909> like<00:04:30.569> to<00:04:30.629> go<00:04:31.050> around<00:04:31.169> the

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
right there I like to go around the

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:39.050 
right there I like to go around the
outsides<00:04:36.229> and<00:04:37.229> just<00:04:37.529> seal<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.830> in<00:04:38.189> and<00:04:38.430> take<00:04:39.029> a

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
outsides and just seal it in and take a

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.589 
outsides and just seal it in and take a
little<00:04:39.300> bit<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:39.719> curl<00:04:40.020> out<00:04:40.289> of<00:04:40.439> there

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
little bit of that curl out of there

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:52.909 
little bit of that curl out of there
flip<00:04:42.599> that<00:04:42.810> back<00:04:43.050> over<00:04:43.349> do<00:04:44.159> that<00:04:44.400> again<00:04:51.919> all

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
flip that back over do that again all

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.649 
flip that back over do that again all
right<00:04:53.159> you've<00:04:53.639> got<00:04:53.819> almost<00:04:54.029> a<00:04:54.360> finished

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
right you've got almost a finished

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.980 
right you've got almost a finished
product<00:04:54.900> right<00:04:55.139> there<00:04:55.669> then<00:04:56.669> I<00:04:56.879> like<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.569> you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
product right there then I like to you

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.929 
product right there then I like to you
don't<00:04:58.110> have<00:04:58.409> to<00:04:58.680> but<00:04:58.949> I<00:04:58.979> think<00:04:59.069> it<00:04:59.400> looks<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.789> lot

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
don't have to but I think it looks a lot

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.019 
don't have to but I think it looks a lot
more<00:05:00.000> professional<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:02.849> more

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:03.029 
more professional and the more

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.719 
more professional and the more
professional<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.900> look<00:05:04.349> the<00:05:05.129> less<00:05:05.310> people

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
professional you look the less people

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.510 
professional you look the less people
think<00:05:06.029> they<00:05:06.240> can<00:05:06.479> just<00:05:06.680> do<00:05:07.680> whatever<00:05:07.889> service

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
think they can just do whatever service

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.420 
think they can just do whatever service
you're<00:05:08.669> doing<00:05:08.969> by<00:05:09.120> themselves<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.830> I<00:05:13.250> cut<00:05:14.250> that

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
you're doing by themselves so I cut that

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.769 
you're doing by themselves so I cut that
up<00:05:14.669> not<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.330> best<00:05:15.569> cut<00:05:15.870> right<00:05:16.169> there<00:05:16.639> but<00:05:17.779> it

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
up not the best cut right there but it

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.779 
up not the best cut right there but it
works<00:05:18.990> just<00:05:19.259> fine<00:05:19.560> because<00:05:20.370> I'll<00:05:20.610> be

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
works just fine because I'll be

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:34.670 
works just fine because I'll be
reselling<00:05:21.419> it<00:05:21.509> one<00:05:22.409> last<00:05:22.620> time

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.989 

all<00:05:35.680> righty<00:05:37.439> you<00:05:38.439> seal<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.919> edges<00:05:39.099> one<00:05:39.729> last

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:39.999 
all righty you seal the edges one last

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.839 
all righty you seal the edges one last
time<00:05:40.300> and<00:05:40.569> it's<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.229> few<00:05:42.009> times<00:05:42.279> you<00:05:42.520> can<00:05:42.550> go

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
time and it's a few times you can go

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.629 
time and it's a few times you can go
over<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.270> center<00:05:43.689> of<00:05:43.719> it<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.770> better<00:05:45.189> because

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
over the center of it the better because

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.939 
over the center of it the better because
it'll<00:05:46.090> start<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:46.419> bubble<00:05:46.779> and<00:05:47.199> it'll<00:05:47.650> start<00:05:47.889> to

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
it'll start to bubble and it'll start to

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.899 
it'll start to bubble and it'll start to
tear<00:05:48.279> and<00:05:48.580> melt<00:05:49.080> if<00:05:50.080> you<00:05:50.319> go<00:05:50.499> over<00:05:50.830> this<00:05:51.580> area

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
tear and melt if you go over this area

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.209 
tear and melt if you go over this area
too<00:05:52.270> many<00:05:52.449> times<00:05:52.749> and<00:05:53.139> that's<00:05:53.680> all<00:05:53.919> done<00:05:56.219> it'll

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
too many times and that's all done it'll

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.070 
too many times and that's all done it'll
look<00:05:57.430> right<00:05:57.729> like<00:05:57.939> that<00:05:57.969> these<00:05:58.870> are

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
look right like that these are

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.779 
look right like that these are
completely<00:05:59.710> weatherproof<00:06:00.749> I've<00:06:01.749> had<00:06:02.080> them

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
completely weatherproof I've had them

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.939 
completely weatherproof I've had them
taped<00:06:03.789> up<00:06:04.060> on<00:06:04.270> telephone<00:06:05.229> poles<00:06:05.259> and<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.800> ones

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
taped up on telephone poles and the ones

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.959 
taped up on telephone poles and the ones
that<00:06:06.159> weren't<00:06:06.310> taken<00:06:06.669> down<00:06:07.379> lasted<00:06:08.379> for<00:06:08.969> over

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
that weren't taken down lasted for over

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.309 
that weren't taken down lasted for over
a<00:06:10.270> year<00:06:10.389> now<00:06:10.689> with<00:06:11.620> no<00:06:12.460> leaking<00:06:13.060> no<00:06:13.330> blotching

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
a year now with no leaking no blotching

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.490 
a year now with no leaking no blotching
of<00:06:14.439> the<00:06:14.529> ink<00:06:14.770> on<00:06:15.039> the<00:06:15.159> inside<00:06:15.610> and<00:06:16.500> they've

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
of the ink on the inside and they've

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.379 
of the ink on the inside and they've
just<00:06:17.889> held<00:06:18.250> up<00:06:18.400> really<00:06:18.580> well<00:06:18.819> and<00:06:19.060> they're<00:06:19.360> a

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
just held up really well and they're a

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.140 
just held up really well and they're a
super<00:06:19.930> cheap<00:06:20.139> alternative<00:06:21.029> I'll<00:06:22.029> have<00:06:22.930> some

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
super cheap alternative I'll have some

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.209 
super cheap alternative I'll have some
other<00:06:25.150> films<00:06:25.719> where<00:06:26.110> I<00:06:26.139> go<00:06:26.349> over<00:06:26.379> the<00:06:26.770> color

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219 
other films where I go over the color

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.749 
other films where I go over the color
paper<00:06:27.999> ones<00:06:28.300> and<00:06:28.689> show<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.020> results<00:06:29.379> on<00:06:29.499> that

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
paper ones and show the results on that

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.730 
paper ones and show the results on that
that<00:06:30.759> is<00:06:30.909> just<00:06:30.939> a<00:06:31.270> way<00:06:31.389> to<00:06:31.419> make<00:06:31.900> some<00:06:32.199> super

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
that is just a way to make some super

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.209 
that is just a way to make some super
cheap<00:06:33.039> signs<00:06:33.400> that<00:06:34.240> you<00:06:34.569> can<00:06:34.900> really<00:06:35.469> put<00:06:36.189> a

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
cheap signs that you can really put a

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.850 
cheap signs that you can really put a
lot<00:06:36.490> of<00:06:36.669> them<00:06:36.849> out<00:06:36.939> there<00:06:37.000> and<00:06:37.689> if<00:06:38.439> they<00:06:38.680> get

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
lot of them out there and if they get

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.679 
lot of them out there and if they get
taken<00:06:39.039> down<00:06:39.219> you<00:06:39.610> it<00:06:40.000> really<00:06:40.240> doesn't<00:06:40.629> matter

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689 
taken down you it really doesn't matter

taken down you it really doesn't matter
to<00:06:40.870> you<00:06:41.080> because<00:06:41.289> you<00:06:41.529> have<00:06:41.650> ten<00:06:41.830> more<00:06:42.009> to<00:06:42.129> put

hey<00:06:46.839> there<00:06:47.169> I<00:06:47.409> decided<00:06:48.099> after<00:06:48.430> this<00:06:48.759> video<00:06:48.969> to

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
hey there I decided after this video to

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.570 
hey there I decided after this video to
see<00:06:49.629> how<00:06:49.779> many<00:06:49.990> I<00:06:50.080> could<00:06:50.199> make<00:06:50.560> in<00:06:50.860> a<00:06:51.129> half<00:06:51.399> an

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
see how many I could make in a half an

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.230 
see how many I could make in a half an
hour<00:06:51.729> and<00:06:52.089> I<00:06:52.779> could<00:06:52.839> just<00:06:53.289> write<00:06:54.189> at<00:06:54.370> make<00:06:54.639> 11

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
hour and I could just write at make 11

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.429 
hour and I could just write at make 11
per<00:06:55.750> 30<00:06:56.199> minutes<00:06:56.649> so<00:06:57.430> I<00:06:57.819> used<00:06:58.599> to<00:06:58.719> be<00:06:58.839> if<00:06:59.259> you

00:06:59.429 --> 00:06:59.439 
per 30 minutes so I used to be if you

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:01.260 
per 30 minutes so I used to be if you
get<00:06:59.620> a<00:06:59.649> better<00:06:59.860> slightly<00:07:00.460> better<00:07:00.610> system<00:07:01.120> you

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
get a better slightly better system you

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.909 
get a better slightly better system you
could<00:07:01.419> probably<00:07:01.599> make<00:07:01.839> them<00:07:02.080> a<00:07:02.289> little<00:07:02.710> bit

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
could probably make them a little bit

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:06.869 
could probably make them a little bit
faster<00:07:03.490> but<00:07:03.849> just<00:07:04.539> use<00:07:05.259> that<00:07:05.529> as<00:07:05.860> a<00:07:05.889> time<00:07:06.550> frame

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 
faster but just use that as a time frame

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.839 
faster but just use that as a time frame
if<00:07:07.180> you<00:07:07.509> need<00:07:08.199> a<00:07:08.229> certain<00:07:08.620> amount<00:07:08.830> of<00:07:09.129> time<00:07:09.430> a

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849 
if you need a certain amount of time a

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:11.790 
if you need a certain amount of time a
certain<00:07:10.360> amount<00:07:10.539> of<00:07:10.689> signs<00:07:11.050> and<00:07:11.560> have<00:07:11.770> a

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
certain amount of signs and have a

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.579 
certain amount of signs and have a
certain<00:07:12.399> amount<00:07:12.550> of<00:07:12.729> time<00:07:13.000> till<00:07:13.589> that

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:14.589 
certain amount of time till that

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:19.439 
certain amount of time till that
deadline<00:07:16.110> 11<00:07:17.110> per<00:07:17.379> half-hour<00:07:17.830> is<00:07:18.189> is<00:07:19.060> a<00:07:19.120> pretty

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449 
deadline 11 per half-hour is is a pretty

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.559 
deadline 11 per half-hour is is a pretty
good<00:07:19.629> rate<00:07:19.810> it's<00:07:20.649> not<00:07:20.770> the<00:07:20.889> greatest<00:07:21.129> but<00:07:21.370> it's

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:21.569 
good rate it's not the greatest but it's

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:27.200 
good rate it's not the greatest but it's
a<00:07:22.569> pretty<00:07:22.839> average<00:07:23.080> rate<00:07:23.560> so<00:07:24.330> if<00:07:25.330> you<00:07:25.629> were

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
a pretty average rate so if you were

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.879 
a pretty average rate so if you were
debating<00:07:28.210> on<00:07:28.810> whether<00:07:28.990> to<00:07:29.139> do<00:07:29.439> this<00:07:29.649> on<00:07:29.860> a

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:29.889 
debating on whether to do this on a

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.399 
debating on whether to do this on a
large<00:07:30.159> scale<00:07:30.520> or<00:07:30.580> not<00:07:30.939> I<00:07:31.240> hope<00:07:31.779> that<00:07:32.139> little

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:32.409 
large scale or not I hope that little

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:36.719 
large scale or not I hope that little
extra<00:07:32.800> tidbit<00:07:33.520> helps<00:07:33.879> alright<00:07:34.449> bye
