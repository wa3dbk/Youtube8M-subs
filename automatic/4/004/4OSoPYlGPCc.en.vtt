00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
like the element of jumping a constant

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.119 
like the element of jumping a constant
jumping<00:03:16.780> then<00:03:17.319> you'll<00:03:17.500> hate<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.739> scheme

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
jumping then you'll hate the scheme

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.069 
jumping then you'll hate the scheme
simple<00:03:18.760> as<00:03:18.849> you<00:03:19.030> need<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.269> get<00:03:19.569> used<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.959> the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
simple as you need to get used to the

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.199 
simple as you need to get used to the
jumping<00:03:20.409> mechanic<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:21.400> really<00:03:21.639> put<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.000> to

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
jumping mechanic and really put that to

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.689 
jumping mechanic and really put that to
optimal<00:03:22.629> use<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.169> and<00:03:23.709> get<00:03:23.979> your<00:03:24.129> consecutive

kills<00:03:24.970> like<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:25.479> if<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:26.139> don't<00:03:26.409> then<00:03:27.220> you

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
kills like this if you don't then you

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.009 
kills like this if you don't then you
won't<00:03:27.849> like<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.239> game<00:03:28.419> you<00:03:28.569> won't<00:03:28.659> like<00:03:28.900> the

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
won't like the game you won't like the

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.539 
won't like the game you won't like the
experience<00:03:29.530> of<00:03:29.590> won't<00:03:29.799> be<00:03:29.919> as<00:03:30.010> smooth<00:03:30.310> as

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
experience of won't be as smooth as

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.280 
experience of won't be as smooth as
previous<00:03:30.909> quarter<00:03:31.150> juice<00:03:31.389> so<00:03:31.900> really<00:03:32.079> you

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
previous quarter juice so really you

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.009 
previous quarter juice so really you
have<00:03:32.349> to<00:03:32.680> get<00:03:32.859> used<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.750> that's<00:03:34.750> one<00:03:34.930> of

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
have to get used to this that's one of

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.149 
have to get used to this that's one of
the<00:03:35.109> thing<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.379> guess<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.680> could<00:03:35.739> say<00:03:35.979> it's<00:03:36.010> a

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
the thing I guess you could say it's a

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.559 
the thing I guess you could say it's a
downside<00:03:36.699> because<00:03:36.879> it's<00:03:37.180> really<00:03:37.269> one<00:03:37.540> sided

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
downside because it's really one sided

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.500 
downside because it's really one sided
to<00:03:38.229> this<00:03:38.409> game<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:39.310> they<00:03:39.459> really<00:03:39.639> risked<00:03:40.329> it

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
to this game that they really risked it

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.930 
to this game that they really risked it
but<00:03:41.139> in<00:03:41.260> my<00:03:41.349> opinion<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.979> think's<00:03:42.519> risk<00:03:42.760> well

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
but in my opinion I think's risk well

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.030 
but in my opinion I think's risk well
taken<00:03:43.389> and<00:03:43.540> honestly<00:03:43.900> as<00:03:44.229> good<00:03:44.530> as<00:03:44.650> moving<00:03:44.949> on

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
taken and honestly as good as moving on

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.680 
taken and honestly as good as moving on
for<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.310> good<00:03:45.459> of<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.699> ecology<00:03:46.209> franchise

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
for the good of the ecology franchise

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.599 
for the good of the ecology franchise

well that's just me from coming from

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:49.770 
well that's just me from coming from

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
highly innovative but you can see the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.170 
highly innovative but you can see the
approach<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:56.829> old<00:03:57.280> sledge<00:03:57.579> I<00:03:57.729> was<00:03:57.909> gone

screen<00:05:22.629> at<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:22.930> beginning<00:05:23.379> of<00:05:23.469> it<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.159> like

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
screen at the beginning of it so like

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.179 
screen at the beginning of it so like
this<00:05:24.400> animation<00:05:25.000> just<00:05:25.689> like<00:05:25.840> blood<00:05:26.439> screen

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:27.189 
this animation just like blood screen

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.730 
this animation just like blood screen
that<00:05:27.849> extremely<00:05:28.689> aggravating<00:05:29.319> because<00:05:29.409> that

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
that extremely aggravating because that

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.010 
that extremely aggravating because that
lasts<00:05:30.219> really<00:05:30.669> long<00:05:30.940> I<00:05:31.210> don't<00:05:31.270> know<00:05:31.419> about<00:05:31.509> 30

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
lasts really long I don't know about 30

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.040 
lasts really long I don't know about 30
so<00:05:32.319> 45<00:05:32.710> seconds<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:34.029> is<00:05:34.150> annoying<00:05:34.389> I<00:05:34.659> think

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
so 45 seconds that is annoying I think

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.079 
so 45 seconds that is annoying I think
you<00:05:35.169> have<00:05:35.319> to<00:05:35.349> use<00:05:36.129> a<00:05:36.159> particular<00:05:36.520> perk<00:05:36.940> to

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
you have to use a particular perk to

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.149 
you have to use a particular perk to
completely<00:05:37.629> avoid<00:05:37.750> that<00:05:38.229> there<00:05:38.830> we<00:05:39.009> go

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
completely avoid that there we go

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.350 
completely avoid that there we go
generally<00:05:39.520> speaking<00:05:39.610> this<00:05:39.969> is<00:05:40.060> a<00:05:40.089> really<00:05:40.270> good

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360
