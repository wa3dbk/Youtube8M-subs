00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
yeah go to the first level this is the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.110 
yeah go to the first level this is the
only<00:01:46.290> level<00:01:46.500> where<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> works<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.340> far<00:01:47.580> or<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
because if you go to different level of

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.620 
because if you go to different level of
glitches<00:01:49.880> as<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.150> see<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.330> now<00:01:51.390> it's
