00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.440
 in your very long career five 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 franchises six teams because I was 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 in san jose when they moved us to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.910
 houston the important thing to remember in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.940
 all the equipment that I have won 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.290
 championship in three of them and things 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.980
 They have not gone well 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.989
 data hey but first of all encounters 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.440
 how do you continue because you had a shock 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.420
 last week with with valdés you had 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 a concussion in the head and you're like 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.949
 in observation you are how are you and me 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 I feel good I'm not dizzy I do not have 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.450
 headaches the truth that was a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.879
 hit that left me 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.350
 medium no ko but but I feel good and 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.090
 I'm recovering and hopefully the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.370
 next week be ready for that 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.900
 match of May 4 against chicago a 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.670
 who is a center type and you have to 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.920
 also take advantage to invite the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.780
 people for that party comes pavel pardo 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.790
 mexicanísimo comes here to play 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.010
 against chivas I know that they have not gone 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.470
 very well moving away what happens with the team 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.270
 because it deserves much more we have a 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.500
 moment where we show to do the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.780
 things well where we have capacity 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.280
 technique we have tactical ability but 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.690
 those moments are very short we are missing 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.880
 the consistency to get the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.259
 other results we need if they have 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.450
 lost in fact three games at home 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.130
 otherwise it is not the way to open the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.660
 season but hopefully you 4 of 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.060
 May against the chicago fire and in some 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.840
 type center we are clear what 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.790
 we want to do inside the court 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.020
 I hope to be back with the team and 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.640
 let's hope we get the result that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.670
 we all want and not even mention what 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.360
 Yesterday, glued, let's not mention anything 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.190
 I asked you about that better 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.340
 I dream this sometime 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.140
 did you have any evidence like that or did you see something 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.120
 similar to what we are seeing already in 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.280
 these 6 years of sleep you read me that you have 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.979
 your been pretty close to good I was in 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.360
 the comba player combined in that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.130
 does here in the preview in the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.930
 preseason where all the teams you 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.550
 they will see and where they choose you from 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.650
 the back of the ms is something similar to 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.090
 this the dream deserves every player in 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.530
 his career has a moment where they have 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.420
 a clear opportunity and they do not have to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.440
 seize it and here these players 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.090
 now they have an opportunity where 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.610
 can stand out and we hope that the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.530
 things go well yes and also good 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.020
 the large percentage of those who come here 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.240
 I would say that 99% of those that we have 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.430
 here with chivas I know and they are latinos 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.010
 the Latin presence in the ml is and every 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.630
 It is not as old as it is 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.370
 seen how you dress and move forward because more 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.570
 you are you saw the first ones not the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.980
 Latin player is always going to be 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.420
 important in this league because 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.860
 it can be a player that marks you a 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.560
 tactical difference a difference 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.760
 technique in the way the ball treats 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.500
 good for us it's interesting that 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.810
 the players now Latinos get out of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.250
 here from here the angels of all this 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.170
 people who come working with chivas me 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.300
 of 6 and hopefully the dream of thousands 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.300
 I also leave here today Alejandro 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.980
 Well, I have to ask 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.660
 the selection of venezuela as the time 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.060

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.730
 we are fine we have done things well 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.420
 we are now leading the group of 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.940
 qualifier for the world cup there in 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.380
 South American and good is a matter of continuing 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.520
 working know all the sacrifice all 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.230
 the commitment that we have had as 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.670
 selection believe what we are doing 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.530
 and get the results that are needed 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.810
 and hopefully they can classify for the first time 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.320
 time to the world cup is the dream that 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.820
