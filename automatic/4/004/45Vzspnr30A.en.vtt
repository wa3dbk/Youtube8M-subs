think these are her fours lunar p outlet

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.380 
think these are her fours lunar p outlet
of<00:04:06.800> life<00:04:06.950> force<00:04:07.250> that's<00:04:07.760> why<00:04:07.910> i<00:04:07.940> wanted<00:04:08.210> to<00:04:08.300> say

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
of life force that's why i wanted to say

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.530 
of life force that's why i wanted to say
but<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.570> lot<00:04:08.840> because<00:04:09.320> I<00:04:09.440> want<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.620> save<00:04:09.920> room

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
but a lot because I want to save room

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.509 
but a lot because I want to save room
think<00:04:10.840> lunarglide<00:04:11.290> but<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:12.099> mean<00:04:12.310> they<00:04:12.400> look

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
think lunarglide but I mean they look

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.839 
think lunarglide but I mean they look
kind<00:04:12.849> of<00:04:12.879> similar<00:04:14.340> come<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.400> little<00:04:15.549> bits<00:04:15.760> of

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
kind of similar come in little bits of

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.170 
kind of similar come in little bits of
it<00:04:15.969> looks<00:04:16.329> similar<00:04:16.600> but<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.699> lunar<00:04:18.910> part

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
it looks similar but the the lunar part

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.909 
it looks similar but the the lunar part
is<00:04:19.389> a<00:04:19.419> little<00:04:19.600> bit<00:04:19.810> smaller<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.680> looks<00:04:20.799> like

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
is a little bit smaller it looks like

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.520 
is a little bit smaller it looks like
when<00:04:21.039> these<00:04:21.160> guys<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:22.360> then<00:04:23.139> there's<00:04:23.320> the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
when these guys and then there's the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.909 
when these guys and then there's the
lunar<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.930> think<00:04:25.930> these<00:04:25.990> are<00:04:26.050> GU<00:04:26.500> winter<00:04:26.710> glide

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
lunar I think these are GU winter glide

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.330 
lunar I think these are GU winter glide
threes<00:04:27.389> that<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.690> wife<00:04:28.840> has<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.380> mean<00:04:30.009> she<00:04:30.100> runs

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
threes that the wife has I mean she runs

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.189 
threes that the wife has I mean she runs
and<00:04:30.820> all<00:04:31.030> these<00:04:31.210> things<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.630> here<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.169> have

these dudes man well this is like sensor
overload<00:05:07.570> there's<00:05:07.990> all<00:05:08.110> these<00:05:08.199> sensors<00:05:08.590> in

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
overload there's all these sensors in

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.469 
overload there's all these sensors in
here<00:05:09.240> pretty<00:05:10.240> wicked<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:11.970> then<00:05:12.970> there's<00:05:13.330> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
dongle right down there and then deep

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.969 
dongle right down there and then deep
down<00:05:15.070> underneath<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:16.530> sea<00:05:17.530> we<00:05:17.680> can<00:05:17.800> pull<00:05:17.949> that

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
down underneath the sea we can pull that

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.320 
down underneath the sea we can pull that
back<00:05:18.220> a<00:05:18.250> little<00:05:18.400> bit<00:05:18.520> more<00:05:18.669> under<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.150> tongue

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
back a little bit more under the tongue

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.700 
back a little bit more under the tongue
area<00:05:19.599> there's<00:05:19.750> like<00:05:19.870> more<00:05:20.020> sensors<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.530> stuff

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
area there's like more sensors and stuff

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.560 
area there's like more sensors and stuff
in<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:20.889> front<00:05:21.159> so<00:05:22.000> that's<00:05:22.180> kind<00:05:22.389> of<00:05:22.419> how<00:05:22.539> it

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
in the front so that's kind of how it
