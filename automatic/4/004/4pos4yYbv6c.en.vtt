00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello youtube people today I'm going to 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:09.250
 teach how they programmed the pc so that 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.700
 go off in windows 8 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.270
 let's do is press the key 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.270
 windows 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.240
 look 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.590
 We will click on the system symbol 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.090
 and here we are going to put 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.090
 the next 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.960
 shut down as it sounds 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.340
 and let's give him 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.579
 well here is not going to come out a series of 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.579
 commands 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.100
 and now what we are going to have 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 what to put here is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.670
 no down 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.070
 slowly and now the little arrow that 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.930
 finds next to the cif and the point of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.910
 the control coma 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.910
 this letter this symbol the bar 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:39.400
 and that space again a stop back 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.400
 and we're going to put 300 space 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 three hundred or two hundred percent the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 number they want 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.800
 it's because generally people 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.790
 distributed five minutes today and it 's 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.790
 306 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:05.090
 so that 5 minutes 6 by 3 30 in 5 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.090
 minutes could be one per 6 3 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 if I put 300 or 200 we will put on 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.850

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.130

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.990

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.350
