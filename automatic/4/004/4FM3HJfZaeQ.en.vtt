fast very good response the other thing

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.200 
fast very good response the other thing
too<00:01:14.550> is<00:01:14.580> gives<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.150> extra

leverage and get that fish up unhooked
and<00:01:17.280> back<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.730> right<00:01:17.940> away<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.810> this

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and back down right away and so this

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
build a windmill them a little bit

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.719 
build a windmill them a little bit
faster<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:28.860> heavier<00:01:29.190> rod<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> other
