00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.450
 Munich - for the first time in all of you want to see you go then 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.339
 The less numbers in the theater have to go to the bathroom must be clear 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.689
 and I want to emphasize that he is a theater moment 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.099
 You do not have to go back to commercial 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.279
 July consoles have so bad things that the municipalities even want to 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.579
 Go corner 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.589
 No the rally of the console version not around the corner that has strong though 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.140
 It's not that fast either, and as I said, this is the theatrical 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.810
 It's about as accurate as Kirk Ernst 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.670
 so relatively accurate 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.810
 Indeed 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.460
 the opera is not exactly what makes you look good 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.400
 the beginning of this passage Gallas extremely fast 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.180
 so the weapons the next European Championship fast on the next stranger on each other 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.980
 works wonderfully at the Dammer Bernese we are here in this corner 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.450
 there is indirectly 2 ZPO to points at least not that far out found 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.710
 have one left and one left around the corner 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.600
 that's when you run back as patin the scanner Emerton and 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 mentally always bottleneck counted 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.600
 you can not survive the war now could not she 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.970
 left to chalk 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.920
 why should i do something 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.499
 other than what is in the faction as in the position 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.620
 Oliver was that the m60 remains tight as a best of the rest 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.380
 in my opinion, all good 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.760
 GM can always be pretty fast 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.240
 generally quite fast game 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.290
 around her since the beginning 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 then it gets a bit slow and in principle the problem is with the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.870
 whole thing it follows two snipers 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.760
 taylor-ann Schaar so talk here 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.820
 What's the matter and the comedian 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 this one shot of things and no idea about the ISR ear 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.890
 under Scheiner lays 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.270
 after that the problem comes year 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.600
 Capo Testa 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.890
 after that followed 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.160
 the crossbow under the knife 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.030
 and there is the problem of all Christmas it glorifies it both 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.180
 I want to go to the whole also he is like that, but really is really 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.859
 with modest plus were 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.699
 there it is wonderful 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.699
 but at the latest when it becomes the most exclusive about it 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.839
 Unfortunately, this post took this very good luck that is they are 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.169
 So what man is 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.519
 you can not even say okay okay I have to add clicks that way 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.519
 Well, I'll put ten thousand rock fans to smart, it's extremely lucky that you 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.369
 Clip game at State Office 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.299
 Schulte the other one can 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.689
 why not the experience that Midlake gives it was so obscure 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.689
 this thing is money off the note and it actually only has 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:42.249
 just what April flew out to meet but bets is just like that 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.749
 Judge I think I die a pretty stupid I do not know 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:46.469
 more exactly 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.709
 originally it was planned that I will be here once 1x1 Township then I do 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.419
 I took it that way too 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.820
 The only problem is that you will not finish for too long 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.169
 she has to go to bed right now 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.610
 PAION 9 percent 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.769
 That has to be done again 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.329
 on the weekend 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.069
 there was something new with the hairdressers Dahremöller seems to look which map 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.950
 Dubai has won this small selection 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.390
 We had a bit of a comment from the post office for the correctness of that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.119
 by far most of the comments I had here in my 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.879
 Video Philipp Zuper 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.599
 we may have a dangerous mushroom around a channel 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.149
 and that are 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:30.270
 that was from the picnic sextape click short 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.749
 I thought you risk your head and I hope that's right 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.859
 this is what he already has as the previous month 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.269
 he really can 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.269
 and bitching in Pomerania said it would be yes 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.769
 what's going on now 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.429
 Year somehow it has just jerked a lot 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.179
 Kerner not easy 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:54.079
 then Japan now a very very prominent with nothing to football 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.349
 but I wanted to do that so that had been done explicitly on request 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.069
 because they are cool films and there is something and that is me too 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.039
 In art with Pluto, they find themselves low in the pictures and what I do for them 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.279
 do not know her is all there is for videos because I do not have any 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.809
 Head Munich or something else 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:13.180
 in the completely superfluous 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.149
 So I think in the background good 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.909
 In the evening also a few other offers background especially for the 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:18.879
 Super 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.109
 To help the senses of the help is the ball on goal 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.109
 It does not mean that you can not track any changes 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.889
 what weekend 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.889
 The cranking value gained has fluctuated 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.889
 Stones Südbrandenburg also tells 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.229
 I think I really have it so nice with Hoffer von Fernwärme Leckelt 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:40.840
 path 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.840
 It is already relatively difficult to meet with the crossbow 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.499
 Gibsons Dirk Enke sucked what wanted to draw 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.279
 not really 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.039
 nicely affected with dab + is good luck, but the POS is 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.090
 much easier to learn than is easy 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.000
 everything is live has very much a coincidence that you can not anymore 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.050
 are mentioned 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.600
 Best Western change reality who wants to pass directly because of it 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:08.520
 in one of 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.770
 Klötzel for the better the beer is so tebbe in the "Top Gear" Zach 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.899
 So what good is first time closing
