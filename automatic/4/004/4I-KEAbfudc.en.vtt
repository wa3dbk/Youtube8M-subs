00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.800
 3 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.800
 and so it is 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.650
 yes 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.670
 go go go 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.599
 and that I knew long ago that our uncle 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.599
 have a visit 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.940
 but I never imagined it was you 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.360
 time without seeing us laugh if you were not so 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.860
 serious that it would seem to take off when 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
 I knew 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.470
 I ask you not to mention my father with 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470
 so lightness 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.929
 it's really offensive 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.080
 well do not stand there let's go 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.700
 get closer permanently enter sea things 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.810
 It's part of your nature 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.340
 and what happens is that I want to reduce 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.590
 while I have life 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.970
 I will tell you that what I most detest is 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.910
 and boredom 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.650
 for us who have life 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.920
 eternal boredom is the hardest 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.280
 do not you think 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.770
 you're certainly bored 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.770
 it does not go with me 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.540
 death feels more to you 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.730
 and take those words as a compliment 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.220
 already want to sit here 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.220
 I want us to talk more prophetic 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.100
 what happens are you taking precaution in 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.550
 this aspect 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.460
 you are identical to beatriz hiding your 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.400
 feelings so that nobody will aspire 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.360
 after all she had a miserable 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.360
 pathetic 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.260
 I do not dislike you 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.070
 as beatrix apparently did not want you anymore 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.920
 gas and your older son thinks you were not going 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.280
 to bother him to speak ill of her 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.440
 I see then that's how it was like queens of 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.040
 the relationship between my father and my uncle 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.630
 you're trying to say not to stop 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.320
 we go as if I was the cause of 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.560
 everything bad though it may be true 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.960
 that I was the cause of the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.990
 relationship between kadir and cher will be cast 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.990
 to lose 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.459
 apparently that relationship was not so 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.300
 solid because it could be destroyed by a 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.300
 woman of your ilk 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.930
 you are too awake to be a son 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.930
 from beatrix 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.980
 I like you more 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.280
 i 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.450
 your eyes are 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.450
 identical to lime 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.140
 how do you have those beautiful eyes I'm going to 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.140
 count them 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.620
 the reason why he resuscitates 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.800
 it was to avenge myself on lime 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.970
 and with death 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.100
 a revenge for a green mouth loved 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.310
 It seems that you still do not understand the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.380
 men and women there is no more proof 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.380
 great of love that my desire to kill 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.150
 then what you want is to impose your 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.049
 love 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.049
 is that not 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.610
 I see that you talk more 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.780
 please can not you with me 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.780
 but I'm not 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.340
 and tell me what will happen to my uncle he does not know 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.340
 opposes what I do 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.130
 let's say we have all the time in the world 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:48.919
 the NAP 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:52.990
 no thanks it's impossible for me to feel anything 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.990
 by a woman so indecent and immortal
