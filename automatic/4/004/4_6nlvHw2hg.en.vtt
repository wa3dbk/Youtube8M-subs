00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
of dry I can feel it it's not like

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.439 
of dry I can feel it it's not like
probably<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.610> hundred<00:05:16.729> percent<00:05:16.970> dry<00:05:17.300> or

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
probably a hundred percent dry or

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.840 
probably a hundred percent dry or
anything<00:05:17.660> but<00:05:18.229> it<00:05:18.380> doesn't<00:05:18.650> have<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.860> be<00:05:18.979> so

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
anything but it doesn't have to be so

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.620 
anything but it doesn't have to be so
I'm<00:05:20.090> just<00:05:20.210> gonna<00:05:20.330> let<00:05:20.570> let<00:05:21.440> it<00:05:21.590> down

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
I'm just gonna let let it down

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
oh look at that okay something with your

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.689 
oh look at that okay something with your
hair<00:05:35.110> this<00:05:36.110> is<00:05:36.169> what<00:05:36.560> my<00:05:36.770> hair<00:05:37.070> looks<00:05:37.580> like

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
hair this is what my hair looks like

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.090 
hair this is what my hair looks like
it's<00:05:37.850> definitely<00:05:38.210> a<00:05:38.510> lot<00:05:38.840> more<00:05:38.900> dry<00:05:39.590> but<00:05:39.949> it's

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
it's definitely a lot more dry but it's

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.159 
it's definitely a lot more dry but it's
not<00:05:40.400> obviously<00:05:41.090> a<00:05:41.360> kind<00:05:41.449> of<00:05:41.570> percent<00:05:41.870> dry<00:05:41.990> yet

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
not obviously a kind of percent dry yet

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.409 
not obviously a kind of percent dry yet
but<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:43.010> kind<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.370> like<00:05:43.550> it<00:05:43.580> like<00:05:43.820> that<00:05:43.970> like<00:05:44.030> the

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
but I kind of like it like that like the

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:45.760 
but I kind of like it like that like the
rest<00:05:44.570> of<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:44.900> way<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.020> think<00:05:45.350> it'll<00:05:45.470> be<00:05:45.590> good<00:05:45.710> to

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
rest of the way I think it'll be good to

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.460 
rest of the way I think it'll be good to
go<00:05:46.010> without<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:46.400> clips<00:05:46.870> but<00:05:47.870> if<00:05:47.960> you<00:05:48.080> want<00:05:48.350> you

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
go without the clips but if you want you

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.490 
go without the clips but if you want you
can<00:05:48.590> just<00:05:48.710> leave<00:05:48.919> them<00:05:49.039> in<00:05:49.130> for<00:05:49.340> whatever<00:05:49.639> um

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
can just leave them in for whatever um

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.469 
can just leave them in for whatever um
or<00:05:51.500> you<00:05:51.979> know<00:05:52.160> you<00:05:52.340> could<00:05:52.610> do<00:05:52.820> this<00:05:52.970> overnight

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
or you know you could do this overnight

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.230 
or you know you could do this overnight
too<00:05:54.110> um<00:05:54.979> but<00:05:55.520> I'm<00:05:55.610> not<00:05:55.729> going<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:55.910> do<00:05:56.000> that<00:05:56.120> for

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
too um but I'm not going to do that for

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.700 
too um but I'm not going to do that for
the<00:05:56.330> sake<00:05:56.510> of<00:05:56.539> the<00:05:56.720> video<00:05:56.810> you<00:05:57.260> could<00:05:57.380> just<00:05:57.560> do

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
the sake of the video you could just do

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.080 
the sake of the video you could just do
all<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.949> same<00:05:58.160> steps<00:05:58.400> except<00:05:58.880> when<00:05:59.000> you

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
all the same steps except when you

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.580 
all the same steps except when you
scrunch<00:05:59.419> it<00:05:59.539> up<00:05:59.630> you<00:05:59.780> could<00:05:59.900> just<00:05:59.930> wrap<00:06:00.229> a<00:06:00.289> hair

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
scrunch it up you could just wrap a hair

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.290 
scrunch it up you could just wrap a hair
elastic<00:06:00.710> around<00:06:01.250> it<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.699> keep<00:06:01.880> it<00:06:02.060> and<00:06:02.180> then

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
elastic around it to keep it and then

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.010 
elastic around it to keep it and then
sleep<00:06:02.660> on<00:06:02.870> it<00:06:03.020> all<00:06:03.560> right

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
sleep on it all right

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.620 
sleep on it all right
not<00:06:06.020> sure<00:06:06.580> I'm<00:06:07.580> just<00:06:07.760> gonna<00:06:07.850> add<00:06:08.060> a<00:06:08.090> little<00:06:08.419> bit

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
not sure I'm just gonna add a little bit

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.040 
not sure I'm just gonna add a little bit
more<00:06:08.900> of<00:06:09.050> the<00:06:09.139> same<00:06:09.380> use<00:06:10.120> and<00:06:11.120> scrunch<00:06:11.660> it<00:06:11.870> into

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
more of the same use and scrunch it into

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.330 
more of the same use and scrunch it into
it<00:06:12.440> just<00:06:12.470> to<00:06:13.090> ensure<00:06:14.090> that<00:06:14.389> it<00:06:14.539> stays<00:06:15.340> even

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
it just to ensure that it stays even

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.089 
it just to ensure that it stays even
more<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:17.120> my<00:06:17.570> bangs<00:06:17.810> kind<00:06:18.169> of<00:06:18.289> dried<00:06:18.620> to<00:06:18.950> this

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099

and um so I think instead of leaving
them<00:06:28.280> down<00:06:28.550> I<00:06:28.580> am<00:06:29.000> just<00:06:29.270> going<00:06:29.510> to<00:06:30.160> take<00:06:31.160> them

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.180 

back<00:06:35.000> okay<00:06:35.479> and<00:06:35.630> then<00:06:35.930> finally<00:06:36.229> um<00:06:36.860> I'm<00:06:37.070> just

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
back okay and then finally um I'm just
