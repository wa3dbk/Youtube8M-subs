00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
your remote remote operator it's

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.970 
your remote remote operator it's
basically<00:00:25.130> put<00:00:26.050> yeah<00:00:27.970> it's<00:00:28.970> a<00:00:29.539> missus<00:00:30.230> plugs

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
basically put yeah it's a missus plugs

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.760 
basically put yeah it's a missus plugs
into<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.310> back<00:00:31.369> of<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.000> unit<00:00:32.410> ok<00:00:33.410> well<00:00:33.590> here

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
into the back of the unit ok well here

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.310 
into the back of the unit ok well here
and<00:00:34.760> what<00:00:34.940> you've<00:00:35.090> got<00:00:35.300> here<00:00:35.570> but<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:36.110> don't

know hope you see it but that's pulse
for<00:00:40.100> short<00:00:40.399> bursts<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:41.030> mean<00:00:41.780> that's<00:00:42.379> constants

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
for short bursts I mean that's constants

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.680 
for short bursts I mean that's constants
that<00:00:43.039> just<00:00:43.309> keeps<00:00:43.699> it<00:00:43.940> pumping<00:00:44.270> out<00:00:44.449> with

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
that just keeps it pumping out with

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.910 
that just keeps it pumping out with
continuous<00:00:45.289> fog<00:00:45.500> machine<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.420> there<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.480> go

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
continuous fog machine so there you go

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.830 
continuous fog machine so there you go
now<00:00:48.920> move<00:00:49.160> on<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.520> right<00:00:49.670> now<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:50.600> here's

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
now move on to the right now and here's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.540 
now move on to the right now and here's
the<00:00:50.989> fog<00:00:51.199> machine<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:52.219> see<00:00:52.489> constant<00:00:53.149> fog<00:00:53.449> oh

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
the fog machine to see constant fog oh

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.349 
the fog machine to see constant fog oh
yeah<00:00:55.550> normal<00:00:56.239> year<00:00:56.359> kaylee<00:00:56.719> show<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.590> back<00:00:58.359> is

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
yeah normal year kaylee show the back is

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.919 
yeah normal year kaylee show the back is
there<00:00:59.840> just<00:01:00.050> give<00:01:00.320> input<00:01:00.590> for<00:01:01.340> your<00:01:01.929> control

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
there just give input for your control

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
it's just plugs into the back here then

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.630 
it's just plugs into the back here then
and<00:01:08.240> then<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.479> get<00:01:08.600> plugs<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.080> like<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.640> so

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
and then you get plugs in like that so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
ready to rock now let's do a few pulses

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.390 
ready to rock now let's do a few pulses
an<00:02:34.020> opera<00:02:34.260> ton<00:02:34.380> comments<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:34.950> links<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.280> can

an opera ton comments and links you can

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.480 
an opera ton comments and links you can
see<00:02:35.580> or<00:02:36.240> output<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:36.960> produce<00:02:37.280> okay

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:49.100 

there's<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.610> little<00:02:41.820> demo

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:00.559 

you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.710> follow<00:02:49.950> raymore<00:02:50.430> quite<00:02:50.730> quickly<00:02:55.790> see

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.989 

I've<00:03:01.079> heard<00:03:01.439> that<00:03:01.499> right<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.129> top<00:03:02.400> listen<00:03:02.700> to

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:02.999 
I've heard that right to top listen to

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.399 
I've heard that right to top listen to
you<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.420> probably<00:03:04.409> more<00:03:04.799> very<00:03:05.010> quickly<00:03:06.409> okay

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
you can probably more very quickly okay

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.619 
you can probably more very quickly okay
because<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.519> fog<00:03:08.730> hangs<00:03:08.999> around<00:03:09.150> its<00:03:09.389> water

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
because the fog hangs around its water

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.190 
because the fog hangs around its water
based<00:03:09.900> fog<00:03:10.409> and<00:03:10.950> not<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.810> glycol<00:03:12.810> both<00:03:12.989> you

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
based fog and not this glycol both you

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.890 
based fog and not this glycol both you
see<00:03:13.439> it<00:03:13.530> rises<00:03:14.189> because<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.670> thought<00:03:15.659> I<00:03:15.719> could

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
see it rises because I thought I could

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.869 
see it rises because I thought I could
make<00:03:15.930> fog<00:03:16.379> chiller<00:03:16.409> to<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.099> if<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.489> hug<00:03:17.730> the
