00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
of the midfield regarding interceptions

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.140 
of the midfield regarding interceptions
and<00:01:37.710> player<00:01:37.979> intelligence<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> matter

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and player intelligence on the matter

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.090 
and player intelligence on the matter
players<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:39.720> actively<00:01:40.290> look<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> intercept

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
players now actively look to intercept

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
players now actively look to intercept
block<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.729> divert<00:01:42.060> passes<00:01:42.509> which<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.899> close

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
block or divert passes which are close

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.840 
block or divert passes which are close
to<00:01:43.320> them<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:43.890> they'll<00:01:44.070> step<00:01:44.399> into<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to them so now they'll step into the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
to them so now they'll step into the
line<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> passes<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.810> anticipate<00:01:46.380> their

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
line of passes and anticipate their

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.109 
line of passes and anticipate their
final<00:01:46.950> destination<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.820> should<00:01:47.970> note

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
final destination and you should note

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
final destination and you should note
that<00:01:48.299> interception<00:01:48.810> intelligence<00:01:49.470> is

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that interception intelligence is

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.530 
that interception intelligence is
personality<00:01:50.130> based<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.759> some<00:01:51.060> players<00:01:51.299> will

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
personality based so some players will

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
personality based so some players will
just<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.869> better<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.290> than<00:01:52.500> others<00:01:52.770> now

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
just be better at it than others now

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
just be better at it than others now
some<00:01:53.399> new<00:01:53.520> passing<00:01:54.030> mechanics<00:01:54.509> there's<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
some new passing mechanics there's a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.920 
some new passing mechanics there's a
brand<00:01:55.290> new<00:01:55.409> r1<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.280> X<00:01:56.460> pass<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:57.000> FIFA<00:01:57.299> 16<00:01:57.450> which

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
brand new r1 and X pass in FIFA 16 which

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.870 
brand new r1 and X pass in FIFA 16 which
will<00:01:58.110> add<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:58.500> pace<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> ground<00:01:59.430> passes

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
will add more pace to the ground passes

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.639 
will add more pace to the ground passes
this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.299> designed<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.719> allow<00:02:00.899> passes<00:02:01.380> into

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
this is designed to allow passes into

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.200 
this is designed to allow passes into
tighter<00:02:01.860> spaces<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.640> allow<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.090> new

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
tighter spaces and allow for new

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
tighter spaces and allow for new
opportunities<00:02:03.479> due<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> added<00:02:04.680> pace

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
opportunities due to the added pace

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.620 
opportunities due to the added pace
greater<00:02:05.369> error<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.820> applied<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> pass

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
greater error is applied to the pass

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.630 
greater error is applied to the pass

no<00:02:13.630> touch<00:02:13.810> dribbling<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.380> new<00:02:14.650> dribble<00:02:15.010> type

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
no touch dribbling is a new dribble type

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.680 
no touch dribbling is a new dribble type
that<00:02:15.370> allows<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.910> feint<00:02:16.209> with<00:02:16.360> your<00:02:16.480> body

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
that allows you to feint with your body

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.540 
that allows you to feint with your body
without<00:02:16.870> actually<00:02:17.440> touching<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.920> ball<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.489> it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
without actually touching the ball so it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.010 
without actually touching the ball so it
kind<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.760> acts<00:02:18.880> as<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.060> clutch<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.450> dribbling

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
kind of acts as a clutch for dribbling

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.570 
kind of acts as a clutch for dribbling
providing<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.590> with<00:02:20.620> greater<00:02:20.980> freedom<00:02:21.430> and

providing you with greater freedom and
it'll<00:02:21.790> be<00:02:21.849> controlled<00:02:22.239> using<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.599> combination

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
it'll be controlled using a combination

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.809 
it'll be controlled using a combination
of<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.560> left<00:02:23.770> bumper<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.280> right<00:02:24.520> trigger

with this you'll be able to decide how

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.650 
with this you'll be able to decide how

shooting<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.739> now<00:02:50.920> more<00:02:51.160> consistent<00:02:51.819> with

so shots that are taken on the run will

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.559 
so shots that are taken on the run will
