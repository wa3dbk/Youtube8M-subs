00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.660
 It 's more than just a friend . 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:50.580
 He only has two gauges, three on the gauges and three on the third . 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.580
 The 5 gauge is full. 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.989

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:02.150

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:30.310
 Probably in the same place the dataset grew 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:34.479
 They're friends because they're trying to write again. 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.659
 So I think the clothes are the same. 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.630
 If you do this , you're done. 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.040

 One of the products came out with a pate. 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.319
 I made a lot of back and forth and I bought more 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.680

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.290
 It was not a business trip at that time, 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.030

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.209

 It will not be possible to conduct Facebook with a cover- like sound, but 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.840
 That cacao story has the ability to send it to a note. 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.650

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:43.240
