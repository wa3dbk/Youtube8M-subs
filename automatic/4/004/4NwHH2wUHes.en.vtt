these<00:00:56.670> things<00:00:56.940> into<00:00:57.210> place<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:58.700> just<00:00:59.700> an

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
these things into place I'm just an

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240 
these things into place I'm just an
idiot<00:01:00.210> anyway<00:01:00.720> so<00:01:01.320> let's<00:01:01.649> go<00:01:01.800> ahead<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.100> take

idiot anyway so let's go ahead and take

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.729 
idiot anyway so let's go ahead and take
a<00:01:02.280> look<00:01:02.610> at<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> transformation<00:01:03.290> is<00:01:04.290> actually

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
a look at the transformation is actually

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.490 
a look at the transformation is actually
pretty<00:01:05.189> darn<00:01:05.489> involved<00:01:06.320> we're<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
pretty darn involved we're going to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
pretty darn involved we're going to
start<00:01:07.770> by<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.189> breaking<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.850> back<00:01:09.030> open

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
start by just breaking the back open

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
start by just breaking the back open
here<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:11.600> coming<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.860> fold<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> look

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
here and coming in here and fold it look

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660 
here and coming in here and fold it look
sorry<00:01:15.650> coming<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.010> pulling<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.549> straight

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
out and then folding this back section

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.930 
out and then folding this back section
down<00:01:20.370> which<00:01:21.360> will<00:01:21.630> then<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.680> able<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.040> fold<00:01:23.520> the

the<00:02:32.930> tabs<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.890> are<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.610> underarms<00:02:35.300> in

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
the tabs that are on the underarms in

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480 
the tabs that are on the underarms in
line<00:02:35.810> with<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.110> tabs<00:02:36.380> inside<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.950> chest<00:02:37.250> and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
line with the tabs inside the chest and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.070 
line with the tabs inside the chest and
they<00:02:37.610> will<00:02:37.760> actually<00:02:37.850> close<00:02:38.330> right<00:02:38.750> up<00:02:38.900> on

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
they will actually close right up on

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.310 
they will actually close right up on
them<00:02:39.730> alright<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:41.270> are<00:02:41.420> almost<00:02:41.660> done<00:02:41.930> here

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
them alright so we are almost done here

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.820 
them alright so we are almost done here
so<00:02:42.620> let's<00:02:42.740> go<00:02:42.890> ahead<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.220> pull<00:02:43.430> out<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.970> hips

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
so let's go ahead and pull out the hips

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.720 
so let's go ahead and pull out the hips
and<00:02:46.000> twist<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.540> legs<00:02:48.050> around<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:49.130> form<00:02:49.430> to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and twist the legs around to form to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.430 
and twist the legs around to form to
show<00:02:49.760> those<00:02:50.150> nice<00:02:50.480> little<00:02:50.660> feet<00:02:51.050> we<00:02:51.230> saw

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
show those nice little feet we saw

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.190 
show those nice little feet we saw
earlier<00:02:51.770> then<00:02:52.640> we<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:52.910> collapse<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.690> wheels

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
earlier then we can collapse the wheels

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.930 
earlier then we can collapse the wheels
in<00:02:54.590> for<00:02:54.920> some<00:02:55.040> extra<00:02:55.340> stability<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:57.520> then<00:02:58.520> we

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
in for some extra stability and then we

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.660 
in for some extra stability and then we
come<00:02:59.240> in<00:02:59.360> here<00:02:59.660> and<00:02:59.870> just<00:03:00.350> fiddle<00:03:01.310> around<00:03:01.400> with

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
come in here and just fiddle around with

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.360 
come in here and just fiddle around with
the<00:03:01.850> panels<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.630> flip<00:03:03.170> out<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:06.040> arms<00:03:07.040> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
the panels and flip out the arms and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.980 
the panels and flip out the arms and
hands<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:09.460> futz<00:03:10.460> with<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.760> dreads<00:03:11.090> until<00:03:11.690> we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
hands and futz with the dreads until we

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.370 
hands and futz with the dreads until we
get<00:03:12.290> them<00:03:12.530> out<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.070> way<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.490> his<00:03:13.640> face<00:03:14.380> and

get them out of the way of his face and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.250 
get them out of the way of his face and

wheels<00:04:44.580> back<00:04:44.880> but<00:04:45.690> still<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.410> mean<00:04:46.680> come<00:04:47.100> on

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
wheels back but still I mean come on

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.830 
wheels back but still I mean come on
really<00:04:48.420> I<00:04:49.130> could<00:04:50.130> fix<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.730> with<00:04:51.000> some<00:04:51.390> just

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
really I could fix that with some just

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.370 
really I could fix that with some just
some<00:04:52.440> careful<00:04:52.950> sculpting<00:04:53.850> but<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.570> plastic

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
some careful sculpting but this plastic

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.250 
some careful sculpting but this plastic
is<00:04:55.500> so<00:04:55.740> flimsy<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:59.760> other<00:04:59.910> issue<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.210> have<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.720> I

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
is so flimsy the other issue I have is I

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.650 
is so flimsy the other issue I have is I
can't<00:05:01.860> get<00:05:02.070> mine<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.460> stand<00:05:02.760> up<00:05:02.940> that<00:05:03.270> all<00:05:03.480> that

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
can't get mine to stand up that all that

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.910 
can't get mine to stand up that all that
well<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.620> reason<00:05:04.650> is<00:05:05.130> these<00:05:06.470> ball<00:05:07.470> joints<00:05:07.830> on

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
well the reason is these ball joints on

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.820 
well the reason is these ball joints on
his<00:05:08.220> hips<00:05:08.550> are<00:05:09.230> very<00:05:10.230> very<00:05:10.620> very<00:05:11.550> loose<00:05:12.470> now<00:05:13.470> I

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
his hips are very very very loose now I

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.240 
his hips are very very very loose now I
have<00:05:14.310> already<00:05:14.850> given<00:05:14.970> my<00:05:15.300> figure<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:16.140> heck<00:05:16.860> of<00:05:17.070> a

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
have already given my figure a heck of a

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.870 
have already given my figure a heck of a
lot<00:05:17.430> of<00:05:18.200> treatment<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.260> keep<00:05:19.650> them<00:05:20.400> from

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
lot of treatment to keep them from

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.440 
lot of treatment to keep them from
sliding<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.720> keep<00:05:21.930> his<00:05:22.140> up<00:05:22.850> hips<00:05:23.850> from<00:05:24.120> sliding

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
sliding to keep his up hips from sliding

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.050 
sliding to keep his up hips from sliding
around<00:05:24.630> all<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.140> much<00:05:25.220> there's<00:05:26.220> only<00:05:26.490> so

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
around all that much there's only so

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.010 
around all that much there's only so
much<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.510> can<00:05:27.660> do

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
much I can do

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.240 
much I can do
also<00:05:28.860> he<00:05:29.100> doesn't<00:05:29.880> actually<00:05:30.110> have<00:05:31.250> feet

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
also he doesn't actually have feet

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.200 
also he doesn't actually have feet
they're<00:05:33.180> just<00:05:34.020> kind<00:05:34.470> of<00:05:34.590> panels<00:05:35.220> with<00:05:35.520> toes<00:05:35.850> on

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
they're just kind of panels with toes on

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.970 
they're just kind of panels with toes on
them<00:05:36.420> that's<00:05:36.990> another<00:05:37.350> issue<00:05:37.560> because<00:05:37.890> if

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
them that's another issue because if

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.950 
them that's another issue because if
he's<00:05:38.070> leaning<00:05:38.280> forward<00:05:38.940> there's<00:05:39.120> not<00:05:39.720> enough

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
he's leaning forward there's not enough

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.200 
he's leaning forward there's not enough
friction<00:05:40.260> on<00:05:40.680> these<00:05:40.890> hinges<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.700> actually

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
friction on these hinges to actually

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.800 
friction on these hinges to actually

hold it into place other than that this

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.220 
hold it into place other than that this
