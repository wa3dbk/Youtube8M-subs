an optional model called the Sport GT so

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.229 
an optional model called the Sport GT so
you<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.219> upgrade<00:00:50.519> of<00:00:50.640> wheels<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> tires

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.889 
you get the upgrade of wheels and tires
I<00:00:52.910> believe<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.269> I<00:00:54.329> haven't<00:00:54.510> able<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> get

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
I believe and I haven't able to get

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.060 
I believe and I haven't able to get
underneath<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> car<00:00:55.230> enough<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.679> see<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> but

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
underneath the car enough to see it but

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.529 
underneath the car enough to see it but
I<00:00:56.129> believe<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.519> a<00:00:56.609> custom<00:00:56.969> exhaust<00:00:57.090> on

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
I believe this has a custom exhaust on

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.569 
I believe this has a custom exhaust on
it<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> 2<00:00:58.170> B<00:00:58.320> exhaust<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.829> may<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:58.980> but

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it it's not a 2 B exhaust it may be but

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
it it's not a 2 B exhaust it may be but
it<00:00:59.670> definitely<00:00:59.820> sounds<00:01:00.059> different<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it definitely sounds different the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
it definitely sounds different the
inside<00:01:01.589> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> car<00:01:01.980> shows<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.579> really

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
inside of the car shows what really

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.180 
inside of the car shows what really
gives<00:01:03.000> us<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.870> extra<00:01:04.170> stuff<00:01:04.410> in<00:01:04.560> a<00:01:04.620> sport<00:01:04.890> GT

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
gives us the extra stuff in a sport GT

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.490 
gives us the extra stuff in a sport GT
with<00:01:05.340> the<00:01:05.430> carbon<00:01:05.760> fiber<00:01:05.790> trim<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.690> I<00:01:07.260> love
