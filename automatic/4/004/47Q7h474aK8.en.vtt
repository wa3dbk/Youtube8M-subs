all right speed right now as you can see
that<00:00:13.900> that<00:00:14.320> is<00:00:14.920> 80

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
that that is 80

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.770 
that that is 80
Wow<00:00:17.380> it's<00:00:17.770> hard<00:00:17.980> to<00:00:18.040> see<00:00:18.250> out<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:19.720> funds

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.650 

there's<00:00:23.230> somebody<00:00:23.590> that's<00:00:23.770> driving

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.710 

the<00:00:30.020> pressure<00:00:30.289> doing<00:00:30.850> 77<00:00:32.110> speed<00:00:33.110> camera<00:00:33.530> ok

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
the pressure doing 77 speed camera ok

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.310 
the pressure doing 77 speed camera ok
before<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.840> realized<00:00:37.290> speed<00:00:37.620> camera

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.990 

here's<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.590> speed<00:00:42.860> camera<00:00:43.130> coming<00:00:43.550> up<00:00:43.790> there

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
here's the speed camera coming up there

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.660 
here's the speed camera coming up there
it<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.270> you've<00:00:44.960> reached<00:00:45.290> your<00:00:45.590> mark<00:00:45.950> location

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
it is you've reached your mark location

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:56.460 
it is you've reached your mark location
one<00:00:47.570> to<00:00:47.720> me<00:00:48.280> speed<00:00:49.280> 11<00:00:49.700> at<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.850> time<00:00:50.739> was<00:00:53.140> 65

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.290 

or<00:00:56.950> there<00:00:57.100> abouts

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
or there abouts

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.810 
or there abouts
so<00:00:59.870> just<00:01:00.800> trying<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.100> show<00:01:01.219> how<00:01:01.340> this<00:01:01.550> works

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
so just trying to show how this works

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.380 
so just trying to show how this works
this<00:01:02.149> is<00:01:02.360> uh<00:01:03.010> two<00:01:04.010> things<00:01:04.369> I<00:01:04.580> got<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:04.970> here<00:01:05.180> that

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
this is uh two things I got in here that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.640 
this is uh two things I got in here that
keeps<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:06.250> track<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.610> speed<00:01:08.140> one<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.970> more

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
keeps a track of the speed one is more

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.490 
keeps a track of the speed one is more
up<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.710> date<00:01:13.130> than<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.550> other<00:01:13.729> one<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.500> would

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
up to date than the other one I would

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.350 
up to date than the other one I would
like<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.009> think<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.430> they're<00:01:16.909> both<00:01:17.119> is

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
like to think that they're both is

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.880 
like to think that they're both is
reliable<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.259> other<00:01:18.409> one<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.560> don't<00:01:18.680> know

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
reliable is the other one I don't know

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.480 
reliable is the other one I don't know
which<00:01:19.009> ones<00:01:19.369> more<00:01:19.580> reliable<00:01:21.850> excuse<00:01:22.850> me

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
which ones more reliable excuse me

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.320 
which ones more reliable excuse me
anyway<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:27.140> one<00:01:27.380> up<00:01:27.500> here<00:01:27.800> is<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.880> recently

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330

system this one is embedded oh there's a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.309 
system this one is embedded oh there's a
future<00:02:26.760> speed<00:02:27.150> camera<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.780> should<00:02:27.989> have<00:02:28.050> marked

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
future speed camera I should have marked

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.590 
future speed camera I should have marked
that<00:02:28.470> one<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> nav<00:02:31.769> system<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:33.269> made

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
that one this is a nav system it's made

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.820 
that one this is a nav system it's made
by<00:02:33.810> jvc<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:36.120> has<00:02:36.360> traffic<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.230> but<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.620> does

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
by jvc it has traffic in it but it does

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.270 
by jvc it has traffic in it but it does
not<00:02:38.069> have<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:40.260> speed<00:02:40.560> camera<00:02:40.830> nor<00:02:41.160> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
not have the speed camera nor the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.670 
not have the speed camera nor the
capability<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.850> put<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.299> there<00:02:42.510> res<00:02:43.049> stands

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
capability to put it in there res stands

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.710 
capability to put it in there res stands
now<00:02:44.010> maybe<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.549> future<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.450> would<00:02:45.569> be

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
now maybe in the future that would be

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.710 
now maybe in the future that would be
something<00:02:45.930> nice<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.530> GBC<00:02:46.860> would<00:02:47.160> add<00:02:47.310> that

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
something nice of GBC would add that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.250 
something nice of GBC would add that
over<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.799> cheese<00:02:50.100> feet<00:02:50.340> gps<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.060> a
