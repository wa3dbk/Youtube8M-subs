feel torn by the conflict and as with
all<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:00.990> us<00:03:01.110> when<00:03:01.350> we're<00:03:01.500> too<00:03:01.710> much

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
all of us when we're too much

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.190

emotionally aroused we don't think very

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.160 
emotionally aroused we don't think very
well<00:03:04.520> that's<00:03:05.520> why<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.880> indecisive<00:03:06.810> couldn't

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
well that's why the indecisive couldn't

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.020 
well that's why the indecisive couldn't
find<00:03:07.410> his<00:03:07.590> way<00:03:07.770> out<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.130> conflict<00:03:08.460> himself
