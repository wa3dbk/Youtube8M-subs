feel something strongly I would make a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.080 
feel something strongly I would make a
photograph<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.289> would<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.090> equivalent

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090

of<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.630> saw<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.170> Fell's<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.830> reason<00:00:23.160> that

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
of what I saw in Fell's the reason that

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.720 
of what I saw in Fell's the reason that
he<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.269> important<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.410> us<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.920> think<00:00:26.369> he

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
he is as important to us as I think he

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.339 
he is as important to us as I think he
is<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.240> because<00:00:27.570> he<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> good<00:00:28.980> artist<00:00:30.349> when

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
