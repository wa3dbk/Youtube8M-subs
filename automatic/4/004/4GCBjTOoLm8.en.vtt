do<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:05.879> motion<00:00:06.740> musically<00:00:07.740> what<00:00:07.919> do

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
do we do this motion musically what do

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.560 
do we do this motion musically what do
we<00:00:08.099> want<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.340> accomplish<00:00:08.610> what<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> seed<00:00:09.480> a

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
we want to accomplish what is the seed a

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.470 
we want to accomplish what is the seed a
disease<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.530> number<00:00:11.130> one<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.969> singing<00:00:12.210> but

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
disease the number one is singing but

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.680 
disease the number one is singing but
rolling<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:14.009> twos<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:15.179> when<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.540> play

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
rolling is in twos because when you play

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.420 
rolling is in twos because when you play
eighth<00:00:15.960> notes<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.500> two<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:16.800> anything<00:00:17.039> let's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
eighth notes in two or anything let's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.340 
eighth notes in two or anything let's
say<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.609> were<00:00:17.820> doing<00:00:18.150> even<00:00:18.480> two<00:00:18.779> sixteenths

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
say you were doing even two sixteenths

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.070 
say you were doing even two sixteenths
but<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.590> slow<00:00:19.740> tempo<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.240> organic

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
but in slow tempo the the organic

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.519 
but in slow tempo the the organic
feeling<00:00:22.529> about<00:00:22.769> them<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.160> indeed<00:00:23.730> this

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
feeling about them is indeed this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:39.520 
feeling about them is indeed this
feeling<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.710> watch<00:00:34.880> me<00:00:37.700> down

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
feeling of watch me down

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.470 
feeling of watch me down
forward<00:00:40.530> forward<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.250> even<00:00:41.460> come<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> side

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
forward forward I even come to the side

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360 
forward forward I even come to the side
I<00:00:42.780> come<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> side<00:00:43.649> because<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.040> told<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
I come to the side because I told you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.299 
I come to the side because I told you
about<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:45.300> rotation<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.100> rounds

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
about that that rotation so that rounds

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.170 
about that that rotation so that rounds
out<00:00:47.640> things<00:00:48.149> forward<00:00:49.610> down<00:00:50.610> when<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> know

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
out things forward down when you know

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.979 
out things forward down when you know
what<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.539> trick<00:00:51.750> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
what the trick is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.250 
what the trick is
it's<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> thing<00:00:53.100> slowly

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it's the thing slowly

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.020 
it's the thing slowly
you<00:00:56.260> gotta<00:00:56.440> think<00:00:56.680> slowly<00:00:57.070> you<00:00:57.550> can't<00:00:57.820> think

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
you gotta think slowly you can't think

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.760 
you gotta think slowly you can't think
what<00:00:58.329> am<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:58.540> gonna<00:00:58.720> do<00:00:58.930> next<00:00:59.170> like<00:00:59.440> where's<00:00:59.650> my

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
slow motions from below forward know

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.080 
slow motions from below forward know
what<00:01:05.260> takes<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.650> forward<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.640> wrist

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
what takes you forward the wrist

almost use the side of my finger I mean
it's<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.569> sort<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.930> like<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
it's just sort of like because of the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.220 
it's just sort of like because of the
curve<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.820> card<00:02:19.060> motion<00:02:19.510> tells<00:02:19.690> me<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.080> do

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
curve the card motion tells me to do

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.990 
curve the card motion tells me to do
this<00:02:20.670> right<00:02:22.140> dad<00:02:23.340> could<00:02:24.340> also<00:02:24.459> do<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:24.820> in

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
this right dad could also do this in

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.060 
this right dad could also do this in
Panama<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.630> could<00:02:25.870> be<00:02:26.019> home<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.470> watch<00:02:26.769> your

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
Panama you could be home and watch your

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.090 
Panama you could be home and watch your
motions<00:02:27.489> easier<00:02:28.000> watch<00:02:28.360> if<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:29.530> silent

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
motions easier watch if it's silent

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.270 
motions easier watch if it's silent
practice<00:02:30.580> just<00:02:31.510> as<00:02:31.690> well<00:02:31.900> because<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:33.160> want

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
practice just as well because you want

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.910 
practice just as well because you want
to<00:02:33.370> get<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.550> motion<00:02:33.790> right

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.330 

forward<00:02:42.359> down<00:02:43.409> down<00:02:44.430> forward<00:02:45.430> them<00:02:45.969> up<00:02:46.209> down

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
forward down down forward them up down

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.699 
forward down down forward them up down
forward<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:49.260> delay<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:51.549> was<00:02:51.670> good<00:02:52.500> yeah<00:02:53.500> no

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
forward and delay that was good yeah no

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.170 
forward and delay that was good yeah no
that's<00:02:53.859> good<00:02:54.189> for<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.489> doubles<00:02:54.879> because

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
that's good for the doubles because

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.300 
that's good for the doubles because
remember<00:02:55.359> we<00:02:55.569> do<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:56.290> do<00:02:56.409> the<00:02:56.560> single<00:02:56.950> quarter

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
remember we do you do the single quarter

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.640 
remember we do you do the single quarter
notes<00:02:57.519> what<00:02:57.730> are<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:57.879> doing<00:02:58.090> impulse<00:02:58.510> for<00:02:59.230> we

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
yeah cuz that's what you do for singles

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.160 
yeah cuz that's what you do for singles
right<00:04:04.760> for<00:04:05.150> doubles<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.690> now<00:04:05.780> you're<00:04:06.020> doing

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
right for doubles and now you're doing

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.950 
right for doubles and now you're doing
your<00:04:06.830> gulping<00:04:07.310> two<00:04:07.610> in<00:04:07.940> each<00:04:08.180> motion<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.810> that

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
your gulping two in each motion is that

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.130 
your gulping two in each motion is that
right<00:04:09.110> yeah<00:04:09.620> okay<00:04:10.190> now<00:04:10.760> for<00:04:10.820> triplets<00:04:11.480> what

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
right yeah okay now for triplets what

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.340 
right yeah okay now for triplets what
happens<00:04:12.470> with<00:04:12.620> triplets<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:14.720> could<00:04:14.870> do<00:04:15.020> some

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
happens with triplets you could do some

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:29.430 
happens with triplets you could do some
threes<00:04:15.680> yes<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.790> slowly<00:04:22.090> down<00:04:23.740> forward<00:04:24.740> down

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.200 

swing<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.950> notice<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.310> your<00:04:34.490> thumb<00:04:34.760> kind<00:04:35.120> of

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
swing you notice that your thumb kind of

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.240 
swing you notice that your thumb kind of
has<00:04:35.330> yeah<00:04:35.540> we<00:04:35.870> talked<00:04:36.080> about<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.500> it<00:04:37.100> never

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
has yeah we talked about that it never

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.480 
has yeah we talked about that it never
freezes<00:04:37.520> it's<00:04:38.000> um<00:04:38.180> it's<00:04:38.360> pivotal<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.960> this

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
freezes it's um it's pivotal to this

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.040 
freezes it's um it's pivotal to this
right<00:04:40.490> had<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.880> have<00:04:41.030> flexibility<00:04:41.840> of

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
right had to have flexibility of

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.450 
right had to have flexibility of
rotational<00:04:42.890> rotational<00:04:44.440> right<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.920> it<00:04:46.340> has

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
rotational rotational right and it has

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.280 
rotational rotational right and it has
to<00:04:46.550> be<00:04:46.610> feather<00:04:46.940> kind<00:04:47.240> of<00:04:47.360> thing<00:04:47.540> right<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.230> it

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
to be feather kind of thing right so it

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.960 
to be feather kind of thing right so it
doesn't<00:04:48.620> get<00:04:48.710> but<00:04:49.100> on<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.370> other<00:04:49.490> hand<00:04:49.610> you

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
doesn't get but on the other hand you

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.240 
doesn't get but on the other hand you
have<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.240> connect<00:04:50.630> what<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.470> note<00:04:51.680> before<00:04:52.070> the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
have to connect what the note before the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.460 
have to connect what the note before the
thumb<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:52.760> note<00:04:53.000> after<00:04:53.450> in<00:04:54.080> both<00:04:54.260> hands

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
thumb and the note after in both hands

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.320 
thumb and the note after in both hands
that's<00:04:54.650> tricky<00:04:55.070> most<00:04:55.280> people<00:04:55.550> start<00:04:56.090> hopping

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
that's tricky most people start hopping

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330 
that's tricky most people start hopping
and<00:04:56.660> they<00:04:56.720> go<00:04:56.810> down<00:04:56.990> it<00:04:57.170> up<00:04:57.260> thought<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.740> up<00:04:57.860> it

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
and they go down it up thought it up it

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.940 
and they go down it up thought it up it
up<00:04:58.460> got<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:58.880> up<00:04:59.050> okay<00:05:00.050> let's<00:05:00.260> try<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.530> three

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
up got it up okay let's try the three

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.220 
up got it up okay let's try the three
now<00:05:01.160> roll<00:05:01.910> into<00:05:02.120> freeze<00:05:02.570> you<00:05:02.780> gotta<00:05:02.930> start

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
now roll into freeze you gotta start

three<00:05:46.930> notes<00:05:47.110> forward<00:05:47.880> in<00:05:48.880> other<00:05:48.970> words<00:05:49.210> you

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
three notes forward in other words you

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.410 
three notes forward in other words you
have<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:50.340> going<00:05:51.340> forward<00:05:51.670> motion<00:05:51.970> covering

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
have a going forward motion covering

00:05:52.420 --> 00:06:02.689 
have a going forward motion covering
three<00:05:52.840> notes

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.829 

some<00:06:03.699> has<00:06:03.879> a<00:06:03.909> little<00:06:04.209> cushion<00:06:04.629> on<00:06:04.809> it

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:04.839 
some has a little cushion on it

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.929 
some has a little cushion on it
sometimes<00:06:05.589> so<00:06:05.889> it<00:06:06.009> doesn't<00:06:06.309> come<00:06:06.490> crashing

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
sometimes so it doesn't come crashing

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:27.480 
sometimes so it doesn't come crashing
very<00:06:07.899> soft<00:06:16.319> from<00:06:17.319> here<00:06:17.499> watch

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.490 

that's<00:06:28.330> what<00:06:28.449> you<00:06:28.539> need<00:06:28.690> to<00:06:28.720> practice<00:06:29.229> there

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
that's what you need to practice there

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.170 
that's what you need to practice there
just<00:06:29.949> scope<00:06:30.190> it<00:06:30.370> right<00:06:30.610> over<00:06:30.819> there

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
just scope it right over there

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.790 
just scope it right over there
today<00:06:31.720> you<00:06:31.810> have<00:06:31.930> to<00:06:32.020> keep<00:06:32.199> going<00:06:32.349> back<00:06:32.500> up

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
today you have to keep going back up

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.309 
today you have to keep going back up
here<00:06:33.099> right<00:06:33.699> time<00:06:34.120> yeah

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
here right time yeah

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.499 
here right time yeah
now<00:06:35.530> so<00:06:35.830> and<00:06:36.039> we<00:06:36.190> also<00:06:36.370> do<00:06:36.699> what<00:06:36.910> we<00:06:36.970> do<00:06:37.240> then<00:06:37.479> is

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
now so and we also do what we do then is

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.080 
now so and we also do what we do then is
we<00:06:37.750> preserve<00:06:38.560> the<00:06:38.740> triplet<00:06:39.160> and<00:06:39.490> we<00:06:39.699> double

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
we preserve the triplet and we double

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.790 
we preserve the triplet and we double
the<00:06:40.180> triplet<00:06:40.539> when<00:06:40.720> you<00:06:40.840> double<00:06:41.289> the<00:06:41.380> triplet

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
the triplet when you double the triplet

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.040 
the triplet when you double the triplet
you<00:06:42.009> start<00:06:42.280> thinking<00:06:42.580> in<00:06:42.669> six<00:06:43.030> cuz<00:06:43.840> you<00:06:43.930> know

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
you start thinking in six cuz you know

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.140 
you start thinking in six cuz you know
you<00:06:44.410> go<00:06:44.500> fast<00:06:44.800> you<00:06:45.069> don't<00:06:45.220> want<00:06:45.370> to<00:06:45.430> think<00:06:45.639> like

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
you go fast you don't want to think like

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.080 
you go fast you don't want to think like
three<00:06:46.300> it's<00:06:46.539> impossible<00:06:50.910> let's<00:06:51.910> say<00:06:52.060> I

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
three it's impossible let's say I

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.969 
three it's impossible let's say I
doubled<00:06:52.539> the<00:06:52.599> speed<00:06:52.870> of<00:06:53.050> this<00:06:53.199> I<00:06:53.410> would<00:06:53.830> think

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
doubled the speed of this I would think

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:16.469 
doubled the speed of this I would think
six<00:07:14.340> we're<00:07:15.340> just<00:07:15.520> thinking<00:07:15.669> of<00:07:15.970> a<00:07:16.030> current

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
six we're just thinking of a current

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.770 
six we're just thinking of a current
motion<00:07:16.690> from<00:07:17.229> what<00:07:17.500> every<00:07:17.889> six<00:07:18.750> basically<00:07:19.750> I

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
motion from what every six basically I
