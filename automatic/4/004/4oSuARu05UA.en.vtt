tell<00:01:21.540> by<00:01:21.750> their<00:01:21.960> gold<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> check

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
tell by their gold and they have a check

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.830 
tell by their gold and they have a check
next<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:25.009> if<00:01:26.150> they<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
next to them and if they do not have a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
next to them and if they do not have a
lock<00:01:28.140> next<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.369> then

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
lock next to them like these do then

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.550 
lock next to them like these do then
that<00:01:30.420> means<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.020> them<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.439> then
