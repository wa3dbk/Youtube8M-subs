00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
16 or 14 gauges or you can get like a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.190 
16 or 14 gauges or you can get like a
teens<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> regular<00:01:42.329> size<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
teens which is like the regular size of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.310 
teens which is like the regular size of
an<00:01:43.950> earring<00:01:44.960> my<00:01:45.960> lip<00:01:46.229> was<00:01:46.680> pierced<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:48.320> 14

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
an earring my lip was pierced with a 14

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.630 
an earring my lip was pierced with a 14
gauge<00:01:49.530> safety<00:01:50.520> pin<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.939> reckon<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.640> air

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
gauge safety pin I reckon that's the air

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.679 
gauge safety pin I reckon that's the air
or<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.299> size<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> safety<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> I

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
or the size of the safety think is it I

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.580 
or the size of the safety think is it I
compared<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.110> 14<00:01:58.649> gauge<00:01:59.869> this<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> 16

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
compared it to a 14 gauge this is a 16

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.900 
compared it to a 14 gauge this is a 16
and<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:06.060> not

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
and you so what you do do not

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.530 
and you so what you do do not
nom<00:02:08.910> your<00:02:09.179> lip<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:10.050> ice<00:02:10.430> because<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:12.269> is

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
nom your lip with ice because that is

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.750 
nom your lip with ice because that is
just<00:02:13.410> gonna<00:02:13.560> make<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.739> harder<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.430> because

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
just gonna make it harder on you because

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.550 
just gonna make it harder on you because
it<00:02:14.879> makes<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.209> harder<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.660> have<00:02:15.840> safety<00:02:16.410> pin

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
it makes it harder just have safety pin

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.100 
it makes it harder just have safety pin

you don't have to draw that but that

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.289 
you don't have to draw that but that
just<00:03:47.130> makes<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.459> easier<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:47.970> didn't<00:03:48.239> do
