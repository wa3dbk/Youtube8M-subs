00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you need a Torx bit for this you know

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.789 
you need a Torx bit for this you know
what<00:01:05.280> size<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.799> 7<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:07.950> 8<00:01:08.130> mm<00:01:09.799> dark

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799

what size it I think it's 7 or 8 mm dark
spit-take<00:01:11.670> goes<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.060> off<00:01:12.950> get<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> small<00:01:14.369> pry

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
spit-take goes to off get a small pry

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.810 
spit-take goes to off get a small pry
bar<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.299> pry<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.659> caliper<00:01:16.460> car<00:01:17.460> there's<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
bar and pry the caliper car there's a

bar and pry the caliper car there's a
window<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:19.189> just<00:01:20.189> put<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> pry<00:01:21.450> bar<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
window here just put the pry bar and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.850 
window here just put the pry bar and
made<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> inner<00:01:23.490> brake<00:01:23.729> pad<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.590> prying<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
made a inner brake pad and prying the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.810 
made a inner brake pad and prying the
pistons<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:27.020> reduce<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> pressure<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.610> use

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pistons to reduce the pressure and use

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.380 
pistons to reduce the pressure and use
take<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> off<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
inner rail outer brake pad and clean up

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.289 
inner rail outer brake pad and clean up
these<00:01:49.310> contact<00:01:50.310> points<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:53.299> bracket

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
these contact points here on the bracket

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.270 
these contact points here on the bracket
and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.960> put<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.350> new<00:01:55.740> pad<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.490> this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and compress back this piston back into

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.200 
and compress back this piston back into
the<00:02:12.820> caliper<00:02:14.070> then<00:02:15.070> just<00:02:15.370> put<00:02:15.700> back<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.060> new
