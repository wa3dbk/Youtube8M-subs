00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
different points but at the end of the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.960 
different points but at the end of the
day<00:01:13.680> most<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> fights<00:01:14.280> went<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.700> favor<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
day most of the fights went in favor of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.429 
day most of the fights went in favor of
curse<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> purely<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:16.020> had<00:01:16.170> hard

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
curse is it purely because they had hard

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.899 
curse is it purely because they had hard
engage<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.950> their<00:01:17.040> champions<00:01:17.430> did<00:01:17.759> slightly

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
engage and their champions did slightly

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.270 
engage and their champions did slightly
better<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.420> those<00:01:18.509> fights<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> digging

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
better in those fights or was it digging

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.890 
better in those fights or was it digging
out<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.580> position<00:01:20.700> what's<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.210> take<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.570> think

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
out of position what's your take I think

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.120 
out of position what's your take I think
they<00:01:22.020> proved<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.530> early<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.979> they

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
they proved really early on that they

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
they proved really early on that they
were<00:01:23.189> able<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.610> close<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.180> positioning<00:01:24.810> if

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
were able to close in on positioning if

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
were able to close in on positioning if
dignitas<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:25.710> anywhere<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> amount<00:01:26.400> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
dignitas was anywhere the amount of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
dignitas was anywhere the amount of
times<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.850> could<00:01:26.970> jump<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.390> de<00:01:27.720> scars<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.200> Italy

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
times it could jump on de scars in Italy

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.800 
times it could jump on de scars in Italy
really<00:01:29.340> early<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.850> saw<00:01:30.030> them<00:01:30.210> pile<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
really early on we saw them pile on the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.240 
really early on we saw them pile on the
mid<00:01:31.020> lane<00:01:31.200> once<00:01:31.470> they<00:01:31.590> killed<00:01:31.770> scar<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.130> at

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
mid lane once they killed scar and at

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770 
mid lane once they killed scar and at
that<00:01:32.340> point<00:01:32.520> we're<00:01:32.729> saying<00:01:32.909> yeah<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.659> can

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that point we're saying yeah they can

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.910 
that point we're saying yeah they can
kill<00:01:33.930> middle<00:01:34.140> e<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
kill middle e if they get the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
kill middle e if they get the
positioning<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.820> cursed<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.409> feel

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
positioning and it was cursed I feel

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
positioning and it was cursed I feel
like<00:01:37.530> relaxing<00:01:37.829> bringing<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.579> much<00:01:38.820> harder

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
like relaxing bringing a much harder

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
like relaxing bringing a much harder

then less than two minutes later he sort

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.550 
then less than two minutes later he sort
of<00:02:21.030> really<00:02:21.360> engages<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:21.930> fitting<00:02:22.170> start<00:02:22.409> goes

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
of really engages the fitting start goes

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.229 
of really engages the fitting start goes
down<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.040> was<00:02:23.340> much<00:02:23.610> happier<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.120> his

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
down I was much happier with his

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.240 
down I was much happier with his
performance<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.140> Game<00:02:25.290> two<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.920> touched<00:02:26.129> on

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
performance in Game two you touched on

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.710 
performance in Game two you touched on
the<00:02:26.340> fact<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.610> quash<00:02:27.120> would<00:02:27.299> have<00:02:27.390> shook<00:02:27.629> off

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the fact that quash would have shook off

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.869 
the fact that quash would have shook off
some<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.019> nose<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.500> general<00:02:29.159> curse<00:02:29.640> seemed

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
some of the nose in general curse seemed

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.030 
some of the nose in general curse seemed
to<00:02:30.000> more<00:02:30.150> alive<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.349> game<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.890> think

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to more alive in this game and you think

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.350 
to more alive in this game and you think
it<00:02:32.129> is<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.370> settling<00:02:32.790> down<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.030> getting

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
it is just settling down and getting

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.089 
it is just settling down and getting
into<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.989> rhythm<00:02:34.110> again<00:02:34.440> yeah<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.769> think<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.069> I

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
into the rhythm again yeah I think so I

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.140 
into the rhythm again yeah I think so I
mean<00:02:35.190> they<00:02:35.400> were<00:02:35.489> still<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> little<00:02:35.879> bit<00:02:36.030> behind

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
mean they were still a little bit behind

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.690 
mean they were still a little bit behind
when<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.599> came<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.069> rotations<00:02:38.069> but<00:02:38.430> at

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
when it came to the rotations but at

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.920 
when it came to the rotations but at
least<00:02:38.910> they<00:02:39.120> were<00:02:39.180> there<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.599> defend<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
least they were there to defend the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.380 
least they were there to defend the
turret<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.349> time<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.829> yeah<00:02:41.760> they<00:02:42.030> they<00:02:42.209> were

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
turret this time and yeah they they were

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.759

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
actually there holding the turrets in

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.589 
actually there holding the turrets in
prolonging<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.400> game<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.730> taking<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.510> of

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.970 
that fast push that newly really likes
so<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.690> think<00:02:48.840> that's<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.079> big<00:02:49.260> factor<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.709> would

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
so I think that's a big factor I would

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.940 
so I think that's a big factor I would
say<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.849> game<00:02:51.090> progressed<00:02:51.750> they<00:02:52.410> got<00:02:52.620> more

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
say as the game progressed they got more

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.680 
say as the game progressed they got more
and<00:02:53.129> more<00:02:53.220> over<00:02:53.549> their<00:02:53.849> nerves<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.480> at<00:02:54.599> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and more over their nerves right at the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.089 
and more over their nerves right at the
start<00:02:54.930> quoz<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> little<00:02:55.590> hesitant<00:02:55.950> even

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
start quoz a little hesitant even

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.069 
start quoz a little hesitant even
through<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:56.670> mid<00:02:56.910> game<00:02:57.090> bunny<00:02:57.599> foo<00:02:57.810> foo<00:02:57.840> is

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
through the mid game bunny foo foo is

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.690 
through the mid game bunny foo foo is
making<00:02:58.349> some<00:02:58.470> bad<00:02:58.650> mistakes<00:02:58.829> but<00:02:59.280> by<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.549> end

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
making some bad mistakes but by the end

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.309 
making some bad mistakes but by the end
of<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> they<00:03:00.540> seemed<00:03:00.780> comfortable<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.290> I

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
of it they seemed comfortable and I

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.660 
of it they seemed comfortable and I
think<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.620> carries<00:03:01.950> all<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.129> momentum

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
think that carries all the momentum

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.009 
think that carries all the momentum
through<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> next<00:03:03.299> game<00:03:03.420> well<00:03:03.660> we'll<00:03:03.810> see

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
through the next game well we'll see

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.449 
through the next game well we'll see
because<00:03:04.230> one<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.799> things<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:05.099> gave<00:03:05.250> them<00:03:05.370> a

because one of the things I gave them a

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.890 
because one of the things I gave them a
lot<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.819> momentum<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.390> lot<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.569> confidence

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
lot of momentum and a lot of confidence

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.680

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
becoming that monster was that the tool

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.920 
becoming that monster was that the tool
they<00:04:11.549> needed<00:04:11.819> or<00:04:11.940> cook<00:04:12.359> were<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.750> other

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
they needed or cook were the other

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.930 
they needed or cook were the other
options<00:04:13.379> available<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.799> dignitas<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.400> think

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
options available to dignitas I think

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.039 
options available to dignitas I think
that<00:04:15.150> they<00:04:15.239> definitely<00:04:15.449> to<00:04:15.599> go<00:04:15.690> for<00:04:15.840> bear<00:04:15.959> in

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
that they definitely to go for bear in

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.529 
that they definitely to go for bear in
there<00:04:16.169> that's<00:04:16.829> just<00:04:16.979> what<00:04:17.070> Jax<00:04:17.340> does<00:04:17.549> he<00:04:17.820> makes

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
there that's just what Jax does he makes

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.420 
there that's just what Jax does he makes
you<00:04:18.720> force<00:04:18.930> your<00:04:19.079> hand<00:04:19.229> and<00:04:19.590> he<00:04:19.799> Jack<00:04:20.220> still

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
you force your hand and he Jack still

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.770 
you force your hand and he Jack still
had<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.639> TP<00:04:20.910> up<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.180> he<00:04:21.269> could<00:04:21.449> come<00:04:21.660> into

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
had the TP up so he could come into

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.320 
had the TP up so he could come into
Baron<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.219> wasn't<00:04:23.610> Turtles<00:04:23.849> TV<00:04:24.030> down<00:04:24.180> I'm

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
Baron and I wasn't Turtles TV down I'm

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.880 
Baron and I wasn't Turtles TV down I'm
pretty<00:04:24.510> sure<00:04:24.599> is<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.840> was<00:04:25.050> time<00:04:25.169> yeah<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:25.800> he

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
pretty sure is that was time yeah so he

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.620 
pretty sure is that was time yeah so he
has<00:04:25.979> no<00:04:26.219> TP<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.729> sit<00:04:26.880> there<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.090> hold

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
has no TP to sit there and hold

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.050 
has no TP to sit there and hold
Jax<00:04:27.870> they<00:04:28.380> have<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.860> for<00:04:29.370> something<00:04:29.760> they<00:04:29.880> have

Jax they have to for something they have

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.060 
Jax they have to for something they have

thank God for dignitas that crumbs did

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.960 
thank God for dignitas that crumbs did
end<00:04:34.410> up<00:04:34.500> hitting<00:04:34.590> thats<00:04:34.830> might<00:04:35.040> if<00:04:35.520> he<00:04:35.670> didn't

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
end up hitting thats might if he didn't

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.890 
end up hitting thats might if he didn't
that<00:04:36.090> would<00:04:36.210> probably<00:04:36.360> been<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.690> end<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
that would probably been the end of the

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.360 
that would probably been the end of the
game<00:04:36.930> right<00:04:37.140> there<00:04:37.290> yeah<00:04:37.830> he<00:04:38.040> hit<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.220> couple

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
game right there yeah he hit a couple

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.430 
game right there yeah he hit a couple
smites<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:38.850> would<00:04:39.000> say<00:04:39.210> they<00:04:39.960> didn't<00:04:40.230> need<00:04:40.350> to

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
smites I would say they didn't need to

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.860 
smites I would say they didn't need to
go<00:04:40.560> for<00:04:40.800> Baron<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.490> fashion<00:04:41.910> necessarily

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
go for Baron in that fashion necessarily

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.910 
go for Baron in that fashion necessarily
I<00:04:42.900> think<00:04:43.170> they<00:04:43.260> probably<00:04:43.440> should<00:04:43.860> have

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
I think they probably should have

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.090 
I think they probably should have
actually<00:04:44.280> had<00:04:44.690> Cruiser<00:04:45.690> back<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.350> trundle<00:04:46.950> and

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
actually had Cruiser back on trundle and

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.450 
actually had Cruiser back on trundle and
try<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:48.420> force<00:04:49.110> Dignitas<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:49.980> TP<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:50.340> and

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
try and just force Dignitas to TP in and

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.950 
try and just force Dignitas to TP in and
try<00:04:50.640> a<00:04:50.670> five<00:04:50.970> before<00:04:51.300> Ben<00:04:51.480> because<00:04:51.750> at<00:04:51.870> least

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
try a five before Ben because at least

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.360 
try a five before Ben because at least
they<00:04:52.140> wouldn't<00:04:52.410> just<00:04:52.560> be<00:04:52.650> opting<00:04:53.100> into<00:04:53.250> a

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
they wouldn't just be opting into a

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.880 
they wouldn't just be opting into a
screwed-up<00:04:54.210> fight<00:04:54.450> for<00:04:54.660> them<00:04:54.780> overall<00:04:55.770> though

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
screwed-up fight for them overall though

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.070 
screwed-up fight for them overall though
they<00:04:56.010> were<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.520> bad<00:04:56.760> situation<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.870> think

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
they were in a bad situation and I think

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.690 
they were in a bad situation and I think
they<00:04:58.170> made<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.350> slightly<00:04:58.830> suboptimal<00:04:59.310> call

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
they made a slightly suboptimal call

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.670 
they made a slightly suboptimal call
well<00:05:00.390> I<00:05:00.420> really<00:05:00.750> like<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.140> decision-making

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
well I really like the decision-making

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.290 
well I really like the decision-making
in<00:05:01.890> this<00:05:01.980> game<00:05:02.100> because<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.520> seen<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.030> swing

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
in this game because you seen it swing

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.880 
in this game because you seen it swing

it<00:05:30.360> right<00:05:30.420> here<00:05:30.480> he<00:05:30.630> just<00:05:30.810> nailed<00:05:31.230> one<00:05:31.380> right

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
it right here he just nailed one right

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.500 
it right here he just nailed one right
on<00:05:31.650> cop<00:05:31.950> and<00:05:32.130> just<00:05:32.280> blew<00:05:32.550> him<00:05:32.700> up<00:05:32.820> instantly<00:05:33.270> I

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
on cop and just blew him up instantly I

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.580 
on cop and just blew him up instantly I
thought<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.110> is<00:05:34.170> the<00:05:34.350> end<00:05:34.440> of<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.560> game

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
thought this is the end of the game

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.860 
thought this is the end of the game
right<00:05:34.830> here<00:05:34.890> but<00:05:35.670> Quast<00:05:36.240> is<00:05:36.420> just<00:05:36.600> such<00:05:36.840> a

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
right here but Quast is just such a

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.690 
right here but Quast is just such a
powerhouse<00:05:37.260> at<00:05:37.530> this<00:05:37.620> point<00:05:37.890> you<00:05:38.280> can<00:05:38.400> see<00:05:38.550> me

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
powerhouse at this point you can see me

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.550 
powerhouse at this point you can see me
he's<00:05:38.820> just<00:05:38.870> bulldozing<00:05:39.870> cutie<00:05:40.170> pie<00:05:40.260> down<00:05:40.410> he

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
he's just bulldozing cutie pie down he

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.740 
he's just bulldozing cutie pie down he
doesn't<00:05:40.830> care<00:05:40.950> who<00:05:41.100> is<00:05:41.250> on<00:05:41.370> him<00:05:41.580> just<00:05:42.540> takes

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
doesn't care who is on him just takes

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.210 
doesn't care who is on him just takes
out<00:05:42.900> two<00:05:42.930> members<00:05:43.380> of<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.530> team<00:05:43.710> on<00:05:43.890> his<00:05:44.070> own

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
out two members of the team on his own

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.580 
out two members of the team on his own
so<00:05:44.640> I<00:05:44.940> think<00:05:45.030> in<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.600> straight<00:05:45.960> head-to-head

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
so I think in a straight head-to-head

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.530 
so I think in a straight head-to-head
teamfight<00:05:46.980> curse<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.730> just<00:05:47.910> a<00:05:48.000> much<00:05:48.270> better

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
teamfight curse is just a much better

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.940 
teamfight curse is just a much better
team<00:05:48.780> if<00:05:49.020> you<00:05:49.170> can't<00:05:49.380> fight<00:05:49.560> head-on<00:05:49.830> with

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
team if you can't fight head-on with

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.320 
team if you can't fight head-on with
Italy<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.490> have<00:05:50.610> to<00:05:50.730> hit<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:50.910> little<00:05:51.120> bit<00:05:51.240> of

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
Italy you have to hit a little bit of

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.260 
Italy you have to hit a little bit of
bug<00:05:51.450> first<00:05:52.070> okay<00:05:53.070> very<00:05:53.340> good<00:05:53.490> play<00:05:53.790> there<00:05:54.000> from

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
bug first okay very good play there from

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.780 
bug first okay very good play there from
dignitas<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.840> jacks<00:05:55.260> really<00:05:55.790> shining

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
dignitas the jacks really shining

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.490 
dignitas the jacks really shining
through<00:05:57.090> so<00:05:57.270> two<00:05:57.420> for<00:05:57.600> two<00:05:57.690> on<00:05:57.720> Jax's<00:05:58.230> this

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
through so two for two on Jax's this

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.250 
through so two for two on Jax's this
series<00:05:58.800> so<00:05:58.920> far<00:05:59.180> both<00:06:00.180> teams<00:06:00.480> some<00:06:01.050> minor

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
series so far both teams some minor

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.170 
series so far both teams some minor
minor<00:06:01.770> mistakes<00:06:02.130> here<00:06:02.280> and<00:06:02.310> there<00:06:02.460> but<00:06:02.760> in

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
minor mistakes here and there but in

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.610 
minor mistakes here and there but in
general<00:06:03.360> that<00:06:03.780> was<00:06:03.930> a<00:06:03.960> little<00:06:04.080> bit<00:06:04.230> more<00:06:04.410> about

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
general that was a little bit more about

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.640 
general that was a little bit more about
curse<00:06:05.300> in<00:06:06.300> especially<00:06:07.020> in<00:06:07.080> comparison<00:06:07.230> to

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
curse in especially in comparison to

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.050 
curse in especially in comparison to
Game<00:06:07.800> one<00:06:08.040> they're<00:06:08.490> feeling<00:06:08.760> good<00:06:08.910> you've

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
Game one they're feeling good you've

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.030 
Game one they're feeling good you've
discussed<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.480> momentum<00:06:09.930> pretty<00:06:10.800> happy<00:06:10.950> with

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
discussed the momentum pretty happy with

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.910 
discussed the momentum pretty happy with
the<00:06:11.130> performance<00:06:11.250> before<00:06:11.580> I<00:06:11.880> think<00:06:12.360> curse<00:06:12.920> was

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
the performance before I think curse was

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.380 
the performance before I think curse was
actually<00:06:14.340> a<00:06:14.370> little<00:06:14.460> lucky<00:06:14.850> to<00:06:14.940> win<00:06:15.030> that<00:06:15.150> game

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
actually a little lucky to win that game

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.880 
actually a little lucky to win that game
because<00:06:15.930> of<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.170> mistakes<00:06:16.530> they<00:06:16.710> made

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
because of the mistakes they made

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.100 
because of the mistakes they made
earlier<00:06:17.280> I<00:06:17.550> think<00:06:18.150> of<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.360> dragon<00:06:18.780> fight<00:06:18.990> that

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
earlier I think of the dragon fight that

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.300 
earlier I think of the dragon fight that
happened<00:06:19.200> earlier<00:06:19.620> on<00:06:19.740> in<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:19.890> game<00:06:20.040> where

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
happened earlier on in the game where

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.430 
happened earlier on in the game where
they<00:06:20.430> tried<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:21.210> kill<00:06:21.510> voyboy<00:06:21.690> then<00:06:22.230> bunny

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
they tried to kill voyboy then bunny

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.170 
they tried to kill voyboy then bunny
foo-foo<00:06:22.680> went<00:06:23.010> in<00:06:23.100> and<00:06:23.220> died<00:06:23.400> and<00:06:23.700> like<00:06:23.790> least

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
foo-foo went in and died and like least

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.100 
foo-foo went in and died and like least
they<00:06:24.270> got<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.540> dragon<00:06:24.780> but<00:06:24.870> they're<00:06:24.960> down

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
they got the dragon but they're down

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.500 
they got the dragon but they're down
like<00:06:25.260> three<00:06:25.440> or<00:06:25.530> four<00:06:25.590> thousand<00:06:26.010> gold<00:06:26.100> I<00:06:27.000> do

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
like three or four thousand gold I do

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.320 
like three or four thousand gold I do
think<00:06:28.140> they<00:06:28.290> played<00:06:28.530> much<00:06:29.070> more<00:06:29.910> to<00:06:30.180> their

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
think they played much more to their

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.540 
think they played much more to their
style<00:06:30.780> and<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.350> momentum<00:06:31.560> should<00:06:32.070> carry<00:06:32.400> them

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
style and the momentum should carry them

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.620 
style and the momentum should carry them
through<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:32.790> game<00:06:32.910> three<00:06:33.120> of<00:06:33.150> a<00:06:33.240> man<00:06:33.390> that

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
through the game three of a man that

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.790 
through the game three of a man that
game<00:06:33.840> was<00:06:34.470> so<00:06:35.040> crazy<00:06:35.430> even<00:06:36.150> now<00:06:36.300> it's<00:06:36.540> like<00:06:36.660> a

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
game was so crazy even now it's like a

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.650 
game was so crazy even now it's like a

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:01.889 
mean look at hers they are not convinced

though no I I am it's incredibly their

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.930 
though no I I am it's incredibly their
momentum<00:07:04.680> based<00:07:05.040> I'd<00:07:05.250> say<00:07:05.520> they're<00:07:05.669> a<00:07:05.700> heavily

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
momentum based I'd say they're a heavily

momentum based I'd say they're a heavily
momentum<00:07:06.330> base<00:07:06.450> team<00:07:06.720> and<00:07:07.100> the<00:07:08.100> nerves<00:07:08.310> are

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
momentum base team and the nerves are

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.560 
momentum base team and the nerves are
gone<00:07:08.580> if<00:07:08.730> they<00:07:08.850> do<00:07:08.940> the<00:07:09.060> right<00:07:09.210> band<00:07:09.360> pick

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
gone if they do the right band pick

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.680 
gone if they do the right band pick
phase<00:07:10.580> hopefully<00:07:11.580> they<00:07:11.760> carry<00:07:12.030> the<00:07:12.300> look<00:07:12.480> of

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
phase hopefully they carry the look of

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.140 
phase hopefully they carry the look of
it<00:07:12.810> so<00:07:13.050> Jets<00:07:13.380> feeling<00:07:13.800> the<00:07:13.919> confidence<00:07:14.150> st.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
it so Jets feeling the confidence st.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.550 
it so Jets feeling the confidence st.
