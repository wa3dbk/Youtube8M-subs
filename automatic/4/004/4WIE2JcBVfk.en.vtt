00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
clean it in between steps and I'm gonna

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.130 
clean it in between steps and I'm gonna
pump<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.510> out<00:02:37.570> on<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> back<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.200> my<00:02:38.320> hand<00:02:38.560> so

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
doesn't really do the halfway mark and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.860 
doesn't really do the halfway mark and
you<00:02:45.370> almost<00:02:45.610> always<00:02:45.970> get<00:02:46.240> too<00:02:46.420> much<00:02:46.570> product

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
you almost always get too much product

you almost always get too much product
but<00:02:47.140> again<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.980> could<00:02:48.130> always<00:02:48.310> unscrew<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
but again you could always unscrew the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.600 
but again you could always unscrew the
top<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.840> then<00:02:50.050> um<00:02:50.260> take<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.130> product<00:02:51.550> from

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
top and then um take the product from

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.160 
top and then um take the product from
the<00:02:51.700> bottle<00:02:52.030> itself<00:02:52.360> instead<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.780> using<00:02:52.959> the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
the bottle itself instead of using the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.440 
the bottle itself instead of using the
