00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
house waived and spring training so it'd

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.880 
house waived and spring training so it'd
be<00:00:23.400> nice<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.640> epsilon<00:00:24.260> last<00:00:25.260> year<00:00:25.470> put<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.769> on

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
be nice if epsilon last year put it on

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.560 
be nice if epsilon last year put it on
and<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> kind<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.519> gradually<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:26.970> kept<00:00:27.269> going

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and it kind of gradually just kept going

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.099 
and it kind of gradually just kept going
on<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.560> didn't<00:00:28.830> feel<00:00:28.949> 487<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.840> then

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
on and on so I didn't feel 487 and then

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.720 
on and on so I didn't feel 487 and then
this<00:00:31.560> toxic<00:00:31.890> when<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.520> 496<00:00:37.730> was

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
this toxic when you have to like 496 was

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.310 
this toxic when you have to like 496 was
that<00:00:38.910> deliberate<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> were<00:00:40.020> trying<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that deliberate that you were trying to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.740 
that deliberate that you were trying to
yeah<00:00:42.440> okay<00:00:46.940> but<00:00:47.940> other<00:00:48.149> than<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.690> was

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
yeah okay but other than that it was

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
yeah okay but other than that it was
just<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.710> whole<00:00:49.829> offseason<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> whole

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
just the whole offseason or the whole

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790 
just the whole offseason or the whole
season<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.649> I'm<00:00:52.710> just

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
season was just like I think I'm just

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.049 
season was just like I think I'm just
eating<00:00:53.010> more<00:00:53.480> focused<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:56.059> I've

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
eating more focused on that I think I've

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.369 
eating more focused on that I think I've
always<00:00:57.210> had<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.420> problem<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.899> gaining<00:00:58.199> weight

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
always had a problem with gaining weight

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.330 
always had a problem with gaining weight
so<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.980> sick

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
so it was just sick

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.819 
so it was just sick
pressing<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.180> eating<00:01:00.780> proportion<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
pressing the eating proportion and it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.930 
pressing the eating proportion and it
kind<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.070> caught<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.520> me<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> think

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
kind of caught up to me I think

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.850 
kind of caught up to me I think
obviously<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.870> probably<00:01:04.470> catching<00:01:04.619> about

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
obviously it's probably catching about

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.160 
obviously it's probably catching about
20<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.519> metabolism

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
20 or so metabolism

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.100 
20 or so metabolism
delivery<00:01:09.170> in<00:01:09.350> anyway<00:01:09.680> yeah<00:01:10.899> maybe<00:01:11.899> a<00:01:12.020> little

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
delivery in anyway yeah maybe a little

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.620 
delivery in anyway yeah maybe a little
bit<00:01:12.380> just<00:01:12.619> because<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:13.100> feel<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:13.759> felt<00:01:14.000> when<00:01:14.450> you

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
bit just because I feel I felt when you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.700 
bit just because I feel I felt when you
feel<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.869> difference<00:01:14.990> in<00:01:15.289> your<00:01:15.380> knees<00:01:15.560> and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
feel the difference in your knees and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.859 
feel the difference in your knees and
your<00:01:15.829> ankles<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:17.030> know<00:01:17.119> but<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:17.539> mean<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.780> think

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
your ankles you know but I mean I think

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.389 
your ankles you know but I mean I think
also<00:01:18.200> with<00:01:18.380> carrying<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:18.829> weight<00:01:18.950> your<00:01:19.189> legs

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
also with carrying the weight your legs

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.700 
also with carrying the weight your legs
in<00:01:19.549> your<00:01:19.670> ankles<00:01:19.880> get<00:01:20.000> stronger<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:20.590> for<00:01:21.590> me

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
in your ankles get stronger but for me

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.139 
in your ankles get stronger but for me

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
to just use that that's kinda like I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.179 
to just use that that's kinda like I
wasn't<00:01:23.600> using<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:24.049> as<00:01:24.259> an<00:01:24.409> experimental<00:01:24.979> year

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
wasn't using it as an experimental year

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.649 
wasn't using it as an experimental year
it<00:01:25.280> was<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:25.549> like<00:01:25.729> this<00:01:25.909> is<00:01:26.060> what<00:01:26.149> happened<00:01:26.569> I

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
it was just like this is what happened I

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.359 
it was just like this is what happened I
could<00:01:26.869> deal<00:01:27.020> with<00:01:27.049> it<00:01:27.319> it<00:01:27.860> was<00:01:27.979> like<00:01:28.159> I<00:01:28.189> think

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
could deal with it it was like I think

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.669 
could deal with it it was like I think
like<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.090> find<00:01:29.869> things<00:01:30.049> out<00:01:30.200> about<00:01:30.259> yourself

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679

try to avoid the then announce you know
a<00:02:20.400> McDonald's<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.390> jack-in-the-box<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:22.380> I

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
a McDonald's the jack-in-the-box like I

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.810 
a McDonald's the jack-in-the-box like I
kind<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.280> cut<00:02:23.520> out<00:02:24.740> so<00:02:25.740> what<00:02:26.460> made<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.640> pick

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
kind of cut out so what made you pick

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.740 
kind of cut out so what made you pick
swimming<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:28.080> was<00:02:28.230> accessible<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.950> think

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
swimming it was accessible I think

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.730 
swimming it was accessible I think
literally<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.990> was<00:02:31.020> my<00:02:31.230> reasoning<00:02:31.590> it's

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
literally that was my reasoning it's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.020 
literally that was my reasoning it's
like<00:02:32.090> later<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:34.140> max<00:02:34.610> why<00:02:35.610> not<00:02:35.790> try<00:02:35.970> that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
like later on so max why not try that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.670 
like later on so max why not try that
okay<00:02:36.420> works<00:02:36.720> that's<00:02:37.230> not<00:02:37.380> one<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.530> those

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
okay works that's not one of those

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.860 
okay works that's not one of those
stationary<00:02:38.250> yeah<00:02:38.460> like<00:02:38.730> they<00:02:39.150> disk<00:02:39.360> it's<00:02:39.570> just

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
stationary yeah like they disk it's just

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.370 
stationary yeah like they disk it's just
the<00:02:39.960> current<00:02:40.200> we're<00:02:40.740> going<00:02:40.860> against<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:42.380> yeah
