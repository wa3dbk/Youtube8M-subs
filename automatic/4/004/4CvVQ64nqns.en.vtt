computer<00:04:31.479> consoles<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.949> I've<00:04:33.190> died<00:04:33.490> about

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
computer consoles and I've died about

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.740 
computer consoles and I've died about
three<00:04:34.300> times<00:04:35.139> during<00:04:35.590> this<00:04:35.770> challenge<00:04:36.509> so<00:04:37.509> I

red flashing light

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.540 
red flashing light
the<00:04:46.060> first<00:04:46.300> one<00:04:46.509> is<00:04:46.629> super<00:04:46.990> easy<00:04:47.020> but<00:04:47.590> then<00:04:47.800> the

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
the first one is super easy but then the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.610 
the first one is super easy but then the
shield<00:04:48.879> starts<00:04:49.210> going<00:04:49.539> up<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.990> down<00:04:50.139> up<00:04:50.379> and

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
shield starts going up and down up and

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.339 
shield starts going up and down up and
down<00:04:50.710> up<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.159> down<00:04:51.719> the<00:04:52.719> best<00:04:52.930> way<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.139> get

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
down up and down the best way to get

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.839 
down up and down the best way to get
through<00:04:53.560> these<00:04:53.680> terminals<00:04:54.190> like<00:04:54.460> going

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
through these terminals like going

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.200 
through these terminals like going
around<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.180> room<00:04:55.210> in<00:04:55.659> a<00:04:55.750> clockwise<00:04:56.409> fashion

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
around the room in a clockwise fashion

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.640 
around the room in a clockwise fashion
you<00:04:58.210> know<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.449> avoid<00:04:58.569> this<00:04:58.960> shield<00:04:59.349> without

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
you know to avoid this shield without

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.040 
you know to avoid this shield without
getting<00:04:59.949> hurt<00:05:00.219> you<00:05:01.000> should<00:05:01.060> use<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:01.599> spider

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
getting hurt you should use the spider

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.980 
getting hurt you should use the spider
reflexes<00:05:02.800> by<00:05:03.009> pushing<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.460> l1<00:05:03.940> button<00:05:04.180> you

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
reflexes by pushing the l1 button you

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.189 
reflexes by pushing the l1 button you
look<00:05:05.530> through<00:05:06.090> for<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.240> word<00:05:07.419> is<00:05:07.780> compared

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
look through for the word is compared

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.140 
look through for the word is compared
console<00:05:08.710> hurry<00:05:08.889> and<00:05:09.310> each<00:05:09.669> time<00:05:09.940> you<00:05:09.969> break

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
console hurry and each time you break

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.450 
console hurry and each time you break
the<00:05:10.300> computer<00:05:10.509> console<00:05:11.199> the<00:05:11.770> pattern<00:05:12.190> of<00:05:12.340> the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
the computer console the pattern of the

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.760 
the computer console the pattern of the
shield<00:05:12.729> should<00:05:12.909> have<00:05:13.060> changed<00:05:13.629> so<00:05:14.590> there's

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
shield should have changed so there's

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.730 
shield should have changed so there's
pay<00:05:15.009> attention<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.669> pattern<00:05:16.379> and<00:05:17.379> let's

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
pay attention to the pattern and let's

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.080 
pay attention to the pattern and let's
think<00:05:17.949> you<00:05:18.069> got<00:05:18.219> the<00:05:18.340> pattern<00:05:18.520> down<00:05:18.699> make<00:05:19.060> a

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
think you got the pattern down make a

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.140 
think you got the pattern down make a
run<00:05:19.449> for<00:05:19.479> it<00:05:19.780> at<00:05:20.259> the<00:05:20.440> right<00:05:20.650> moment<00:05:21.150> that

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
run for it at the right moment that

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.850 
run for it at the right moment that
still<00:05:22.389> makes<00:05:22.569> a<00:05:22.719> perfect<00:05:23.080> circle<00:05:23.440> button<00:05:23.710> when

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
still makes a perfect circle button when

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.320 
still makes a perfect circle button when
you<00:05:23.919> see<00:05:24.130> spider<00:05:24.490> sense<00:05:24.819> that<00:05:25.180> means

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
you see spider sense that means

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.360 
you see spider sense that means
lightning<00:05:25.719> is<00:05:26.139> going<00:05:26.349> to<00:05:26.440> attacks<00:05:26.800> by<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.159> man

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
lightning is going to attacks by the man

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.110 
lightning is going to attacks by the man
one<00:05:30.370> more<00:05:30.580> left

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
one more left

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.820 
one more left
all<00:05:32.020> right<00:05:32.740> can<00:05:33.009> he<00:05:33.310> do<00:05:33.490> it<00:05:34.409> right<00:05:35.409> so<00:05:35.650> just

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
all right can he do it right so just

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.610 
all right can he do it right so just
like<00:05:35.949> before<00:05:36.539> serving<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:37.659> pattern<00:05:40.289> ten<00:05:41.289> took

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
like before serving the pattern ten took

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.149 
like before serving the pattern ten took
me<00:05:41.830> a<00:05:41.889> minute<00:05:42.219> or<00:05:42.340> two<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:43.319> get<00:05:44.319> down<00:05:44.560> actually

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
me a minute or two to get down actually

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.100 
me a minute or two to get down actually
but<00:05:45.819> nor<00:05:46.060> there<00:05:46.270> what's<00:05:46.479> it<00:05:46.599> step<00:05:46.870> in<00:05:47.020> this

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
but nor there what's it step in this

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.080 
but nor there what's it step in this
pattern

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
pattern

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.480 
pattern
right<00:05:50.090> go<00:05:52.479> and<00:05:53.479> there<00:05:54.229> we<00:05:54.409> go<00:05:54.590> we<00:05:54.979> beat<00:05:55.280> the

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
right go and there we go we beat the

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.010 
right go and there we go we beat the
challenge<00:05:58.180> but<00:05:59.180> what<00:05:59.389> a<00:05:59.419> mess

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
challenge but what a mess

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.209 
challenge but what a mess
