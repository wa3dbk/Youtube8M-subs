 I finally record my video it's me 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.010
 just have to take my little card 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
 sd and put the files on my 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.180
 computer what can take more or 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.460
 less more time it depends on the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.720
 length of the video and everything is next 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.130
 once that's over I can 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.720
 start editing the video 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.420
 how long does it take to edit 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.100
 a minimum video we will say 30 minutes 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.460
 but most of the time it takes me 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.720
 about 1h30 2h and depending on which 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.890
 what I will do for video 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.150
 example this video there that I'm in 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.160
 now record on a 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.960
 day in my skin she will surely 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.550
 take about four to six hours 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.510
 to edit because I have plenty of 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.980
 files that I have to put back 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.610
 together and so it 'll take a lot 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.840
 more time 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.900
 so now here I am going to start 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.030
 and ditema video and here you are there 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.380
 here is a video of 3 minutes 38 so 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.100
 it should only take a few seconds 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.630
 to put on my computer 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.860
 the video has finally come to be on 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.680

 so let's start editing my video 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:19.310
 I know that I was wrong at 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:20.660

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.490

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.260
 put that back in the early and go 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.510
 here it is going to have to do it 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.700
 voiceover so that's when I 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:57.380
 speak on top of the video to make 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.810
