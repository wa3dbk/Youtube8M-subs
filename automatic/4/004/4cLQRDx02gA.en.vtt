see<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.530> there's<00:01:25.799> something

we had this morning or yesterday when we

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.359 
we had this morning or yesterday when we
were<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> noisier<00:01:55.229> kind<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.829> frame<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.189> mind

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
were in a noisier kind of frame of mind
right<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.270> also<00:01:57.570> suggests<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.350> while

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
right and it also suggests that while

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.280 
right and it also suggests that while
Gemini<00:01:59.189> you're<00:01:59.820> right<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.240> noisy<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:00.960> has

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
Gemini you're right is noisy and has

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.340 
Gemini you're right is noisy and has
lots<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.860> information<00:02:02.420> Libra<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.869> usually

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
lots of information Libra can usually

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.730 
lots of information Libra can usually
present<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.610> other<00:02:06.079> opposite<00:02:07.079> point<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.530> view

present one other opposite point of view

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.219 
present one other opposite point of view
so<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.209> being<00:02:09.270> overloaded<00:02:09.989> with

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
so it's not about being overloaded with

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.050 
so it's not about being overloaded with
information<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:11.250> becoming<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.760> bit<00:02:11.910> more
