00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
ask what time everything he wasn't able

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.539 
ask what time everything he wasn't able
to<00:04:04.440> beat<00:04:04.590> me<00:04:04.739> but<00:04:04.859> he<00:04:04.980> didn't<00:04:05.160> even<00:04:05.220> get<00:04:05.430> close

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
to beat me but he didn't even get close

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.729 
to beat me but he didn't even get close
to<00:04:05.819> being<00:04:06.000> Mayweather<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:08.389> Canelo<00:04:09.739> didn't

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
to being Mayweather and Canelo didn't

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.470 
to being Mayweather and Canelo didn't
steal<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.069> day<00:04:11.190> he<00:04:11.730> should<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.150> he<00:04:12.299> weren't

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
steal the day he should if he weren't

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.240 
steal the day he should if he weren't
the<00:04:12.690> day<00:04:12.900> he<00:04:13.139> should<00:04:13.560> have<00:04:13.650> beat<00:04:13.799> mayor<00:04:14.010> that

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
the day he should have beat mayor that

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.800 
the day he should have beat mayor that
this<00:04:14.370> day<00:04:14.579> is<00:04:14.609> kind<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.269> pride<00:04:15.510> thing<00:04:15.540> I

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
this day is kind of a pride thing I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.779 
this day is kind of a pride thing I
think<00:04:16.019> rye<00:04:16.169> bar<00:04:16.380> now<00:04:16.530> for<00:04:16.739> Canelo<00:04:17.070> especially

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
think rye bar now for Canelo especially

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.000 
think rye bar now for Canelo especially
but<00:04:18.450> maybe<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.840> junior<00:04:19.200> understands<00:04:19.919> this

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
but maybe the junior understands this

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.580 
but maybe the junior understands this
whole<00:04:20.250> thing<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:21.720> my<00:04:21.750> opinion<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.560> think

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
whole thing and in my opinion I think

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.640 
whole thing and in my opinion I think
Floyd<00:04:23.039> knows<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.520> it's<00:04:23.669> not<00:04:23.820> possible<00:04:24.030> for

Pacquiao Mayweather if it does happen
but<00:05:01.260> I<00:05:01.320> don't<00:05:01.530> think<00:05:01.590> maybe<00:05:01.770> once<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.100> fight<00:05:02.370> I

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
but I don't think maybe once a fight I

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.890 
but I don't think maybe once a fight I
don't<00:05:02.970> think<00:05:03.000> maybe<00:05:03.270> wants<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.630> pacquiao

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
don't think maybe wants the pacquiao

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.930 
don't think maybe wants the pacquiao
fight<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.170> think<00:05:04.470> he's<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.740> saying<00:05:04.920> it<00:05:05.190> just

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
fight I think he's just saying it just

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.360 
fight I think he's just saying it just
to<00:05:06.090> say<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.840> know<00:05:06.870> I<00:05:07.200> wanted<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.160> fight

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
to say that you know I wanted the fight

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.350 
to say that you know I wanted the fight
but<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:08.670> don't<00:05:08.880> think<00:05:09.000> it's<00:05:09.180> gonna<00:05:09.270> happen

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
but I don't think it's gonna happen

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.820 
but I don't think it's gonna happen
nothing<00:05:09.780> mayor<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.230> very<00:05:10.380> clever<00:05:10.620> I'm<00:05:10.710> not

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
nothing mayor this very clever I'm not

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.760 
nothing mayor this very clever I'm not
gonna<00:05:10.920> say<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.220> few<00:05:11.550> things<00:05:11.960> but<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.020> know<00:05:13.740> a

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
gonna say a few things but I know a

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.030 
gonna say a few things but I know a
couple<00:05:14.250> of<00:05:14.490> things<00:05:14.810> not<00:05:15.810> really<00:05:16.380> no<00:05:16.530> regards

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
couple of things not really no regards

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.770 
couple of things not really no regards
to<00:05:17.190> mirror<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.520> paki<00:05:17.790> up<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.150> couple<00:05:18.390> of<00:05:18.540> other

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
to mirror the paki up a couple of other

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.500 
to mirror the paki up a couple of other
things<00:05:19.020> which<00:05:19.860> makes<00:05:20.100> me<00:05:20.280> really<00:05:20.610> believe<00:05:20.790> and

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
things which makes me really believe and

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.970 
things which makes me really believe and
I<00:05:21.930> think<00:05:22.230> a<00:05:22.320> lot<00:05:22.350> of<00:05:22.470> people<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.800> Jerry

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
I think a lot of people to Jerry

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.950 
I think a lot of people to Jerry
probably<00:05:23.280> don't<00:05:23.460> understand<00:05:23.730> this<00:05:23.880> but<00:05:24.540> I

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
probably don't understand this but I

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.600 
probably don't understand this but I
think<00:05:25.020> maybe<00:05:25.320> was<00:05:25.500> very<00:05:25.980> very<00:05:26.220> clever<00:05:26.460> and

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
think maybe was very very clever and

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.450 
think maybe was very very clever and
he's<00:05:26.790> doing<00:05:27.030> something<00:05:27.330> right<00:05:27.450> now<00:05:27.510> which

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
he's doing something right now which

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.320 
he's doing something right now which
trust<00:05:29.460> me<00:05:29.550> he<00:05:29.640> doesn't<00:05:29.730> want<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.030> pacquiao

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
trust me he doesn't want the pacquiao

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.260 
trust me he doesn't want the pacquiao
fight<00:05:30.390> that's<00:05:31.290> not<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.470> face<00:05:31.680> after<00:05:31.980> I<00:05:32.970> don't

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
fight that's not the face after I don't

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.670 
fight that's not the face after I don't
know<00:05:33.330> if<00:05:33.420> it's<00:05:33.540> he's<00:05:33.900> still<00:05:34.290> scared<00:05:34.560> of

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
know if it's he's still scared of

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.930 
know if it's he's still scared of
Pacquiao<00:05:35.010> what<00:05:35.190> is<00:05:35.310> but<00:05:35.490> he<00:05:35.580> doesn't<00:05:35.760> want<00:05:35.880> the

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
Pacquiao what is but he doesn't want the

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.250 
Pacquiao what is but he doesn't want the
pacquiao<00:05:36.210> fight<00:05:36.270> for<00:05:36.600> whatever<00:05:36.810> reason<00:05:37.200> he

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
pacquiao fight for whatever reason he

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.350 
pacquiao fight for whatever reason he
doesn't<00:05:37.380> want<00:05:37.560> it<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:38.220> think<00:05:38.490> one<00:05:39.210> of<00:05:39.240> the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
doesn't want it and I think one of the

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.640 
doesn't want it and I think one of the
major<00:05:39.540> things<00:05:39.840> there's<00:05:40.080> another<00:05:40.290> reason<00:05:40.470> for

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
major things there's another reason for

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.890 
major things there's another reason for
it<00:05:40.830> as<00:05:40.920> well<00:05:41.010> but<00:05:41.130> I<00:05:41.220> think<00:05:41.250> one<00:05:42.120> major<00:05:42.360> reason

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
it as well but I think one major reason

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.930 
it as well but I think one major reason
