00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
travel far through the air and makes it

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:12.900 
travel far through the air and makes it
more<00:01:11.740> difficult<00:01:11.890> for<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.310> goalkeeper<00:01:12.789> as

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
more difficult for the goalkeeper as

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.609 
more difficult for the goalkeeper as
well<00:01:13.090> but<00:01:13.539> when<00:01:13.660> he<00:01:13.720> places<00:01:13.929> it<00:01:14.050> down<00:01:14.320> as<00:01:14.470> well

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
well but when he places it down as well

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:15.990 
well but when he places it down as well
you<00:01:14.800> mentioned<00:01:15.039> sank<00:01:15.429> about<00:01:15.550> obviously<00:01:15.789> as

you mentioned sank about obviously as

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.790 
you mentioned sank about obviously as
different<00:01:16.300> as<00:01:16.330> well<00:01:16.479> before<00:01:16.690> planning<00:01:17.050> so<00:01:17.320> he

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
different as well before planning so he

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.529 
different as well before planning so he
like<00:01:18.009> will<00:01:18.160> place<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.369> divot<00:01:18.820> placed<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.210> ball<00:01:19.360> in

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
like will place a divot placed a ball in

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.260 
like will place a divot placed a ball in
it<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.860> then<00:01:21.009> as<00:01:21.190> he<00:01:21.310> strikes<00:01:21.580> a<00:01:21.820> ball<00:01:21.970> because

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
it and then as he strikes a ball because

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.880 
it and then as he strikes a ball because
there's<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.479> little<00:01:22.690> lip<00:01:22.899> that<00:01:23.410> allows<00:01:23.710> the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
there's a little lip that allows the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.740 
there's a little lip that allows the
balls<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.250> really<00:01:24.429> punch<00:01:25.060> through<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.630> then

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
balls to really punch through and then

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.330 
balls to really punch through and then
get<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> bit<00:01:26.380> more<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.770> dip<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.099> the<00:01:27.130> ball

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
get a bit more of a dip on the ball

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.419 
get a bit more of a dip on the ball
again<00:01:27.580> so<00:01:28.000> we're<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.390> that<00:01:28.569> position<00:01:28.690> there<00:01:29.429> so

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
again so we're in that position there so

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.630 
again so we're in that position there so
I've<00:01:30.580> Val<00:01:30.789> facing<00:01:31.209> towards<00:01:31.539> us<00:01:32.190> he<00:01:33.190> then<00:01:33.399> takes

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
I've Val facing towards us he then takes

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.600 
I've Val facing towards us he then takes
a<00:01:33.880> certain<00:01:34.090> amount<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.539> steps<00:01:34.690> back<00:01:35.340> he<00:01:36.340> sets

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
a certain amount of steps back he sets

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.639

pretty much straight on to where he

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.240 
pretty much straight on to where he
wants<00:01:40.959> the<00:01:41.080> ball<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.380> go<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:41.800> if<00:01:41.890> i<00:01:41.979> wanted<00:01:42.190> to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
i'm actually bang straight behind it

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.029 
i'm actually bang straight behind it
here<00:01:46.239> quite<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:46.959> hard<00:01:47.170> technique<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.890> master

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
here quite a hard technique to master

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.440 
here quite a hard technique to master
and<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.399> feels<00:01:48.610> quite<00:01:48.789> uncomfortable<00:01:49.149> when

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
and it feels quite uncomfortable when

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.520 
and it feels quite uncomfortable when
you're<00:01:49.569> about<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.840> strike<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.200> ball<00:01:50.349> because

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
you're about to strike the ball because

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.740 
you're about to strike the ball because
naturally<00:01:51.130> we<00:01:51.640> like<00:01:51.880> having<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.330> little<00:01:52.599> bit<00:01:52.690> of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
naturally we like having a little bit of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.510 
naturally we like having a little bit of
an<00:01:52.899> angle<00:01:53.110> because<00:01:53.920> then<00:01:54.069> we<00:01:54.190> could<00:01:54.310> obviously

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
an angle because then we could obviously

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.279 
an angle because then we could obviously
our<00:01:54.880> body<00:01:55.090> shake<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.599> help<00:01:55.750> us<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.899> strike<00:01:56.200> the

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
our body shake and help us to strike the

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.190 
our body shake and help us to strike the
pool<00:01:56.470> but<00:01:57.039> he<00:01:57.190> stands<00:01:57.550> directly<00:01:57.729> behind<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.630> as

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
pool but he stands directly behind it as

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.130 
pool but he stands directly behind it as
he<00:01:59.860> runs<00:02:00.039> up<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.459> ball<00:02:00.700> he<00:02:01.599> then<00:02:01.899> is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
he runs up to the ball he then is

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.800 
he runs up to the ball he then is
looking<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.860> strike<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.369> ball<00:02:03.550> with<00:02:04.060> with<00:02:04.660> his
