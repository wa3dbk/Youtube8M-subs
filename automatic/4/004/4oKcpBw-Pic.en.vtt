00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello friends with you again me and this 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.870
 next construction on minecraft 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.389
 I haven't laid out anything for quite a while 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.800
 from vidos but there are reasons for it 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.019
 build a big map 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.160
 who want to outdo my own 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.710
 prison card but so how to build 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.560
 constantly one some project i don't 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.390
 just cant I don't know how others are but I am 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.849
 I can not zamylyvaetsya and need 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.859
 be distracted by something for something serious 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.289
 distracted again no time 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.739
 that's why I was distracted by this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.680
 prikolyuhu I can not even call a card 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.570
 it's just one of the tests that you 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.700
 have to go if you do this 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.739
 decide here 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.079
 learning command blocks for me 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.780
 poured out in such a joke zhku matter in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.860
 tom that the whole essence of this 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.539
 roughly speaking micro card cards will 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.930
 be to get out of this room 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.579
 get into the room there with the arrow 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.350
 nothing difficult in principle to take like this 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.039
 click on start to appear on one 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 islet 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.740
 which has four pressure plates 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.030
 and find that combination pressing on 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.280
 which will lead you to move you to that 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.070
 the room 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.509
 all islands here are 23 or something like 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.580
 I don't even remember exactly 23 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.520
 having each islet has four 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.880
 pressure plates and you can principle 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.340
 calculate who knows math 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.250
 geometric progression by quantity 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.229
 options 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.060
 how many options are there to do 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.310
 all pass 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.799
 the correct option is only one I 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.120
 naturally I don’t remember because here 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.610
 lots of 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.440
 buttons of these pressure plates i already have it 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.470
 completely forgot but before 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.720
 I post this card after all 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.229
 I tried to go with such a fresh look 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.460
 as if i didn't do it at all 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.280
 it took about 15 minutes to go from one to 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.459
 another leaping but I still went 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.930
 so I decided to lay out for the universal 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.030
 Ferris suddenly someone else will pass this thing 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.980
 Here is such a prikolyuha not even a map 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.350
 just so killer 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.840
 a small time killer who I am 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.320
 I hope someone else can and enjoy 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.120
 so I think you should download it 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.170
 at least try it nothing 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.060
 requires everything on vanilla blocks done 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.970
 the only thing I ask you of those who 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.370
 try and offer some 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.920
 options how to use it because 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.890
 leave her alone as she is 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.049
 but it would be utter nonsense 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.780
 I know I have two options to add 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.350
 it's like a test of one of there 10 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.560
 for example tests on some map 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.600
 either take this principle of transitions from 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.250
 one island to another teleports yes 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.850
 and expand the islands themselves make them 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.480
 more and more possible to add 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.049
 plot and hints there how to get through and how 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.880
 go correctly 1 to another island not 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.560
 I know I have such two turns 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.560
 I don’t know what options to come to 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.260
 perhaps to something and the come but 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.380
 just not tips and extra sentences 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.360
 on the contrary will not be over so I am with 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.910
 pleasure I read your comments 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.870
 which you are likely to leave i can 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.360
 and do not leave but do not know in general swing 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.959
 go to the channel itself subscribe 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.959
 put the likes and for today guys
