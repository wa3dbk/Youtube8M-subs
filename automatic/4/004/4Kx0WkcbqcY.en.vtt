nomads<00:00:05.210> for<00:00:05.359> moving<00:00:05.540> audio<00:00:05.870> cool<00:00:06.140> and<00:00:06.800> what<00:00:06.950> we

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
nomads for moving audio cool and what we

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.200 
nomads for moving audio cool and what we
here<00:00:07.100> to<00:00:07.189> do<00:00:07.340> today<00:00:07.399> is<00:00:07.640> have<00:00:07.729> a<00:00:07.880> look<00:00:08.029> at<00:00:08.120> the

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
here to do today is have a look at the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.610 
here to do today is have a look at the
really<00:00:08.389> good<00:00:08.510> range<00:00:08.660> of<00:00:08.780> our<00:00:08.900> speakers<00:00:09.380> this

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
really good range of our speakers this

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.650 
really good range of our speakers this
is<00:00:10.010> the<00:00:10.099> IRS<00:00:10.309> range<00:00:10.760> of<00:00:10.910> our<00:00:11.059> speakers<00:00:11.450> we<00:00:11.540> need

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
is the IRS range of our speakers we need

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.730 
is the IRS range of our speakers we need
to<00:00:11.719> be<00:00:11.780> looking<00:00:11.990> at<00:00:12.049> the<00:00:12.110> first<00:00:12.320> three<00:00:12.559> in<00:00:12.679> the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
to be looking at the first three in the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.669 
to be looking at the first three in the
range<00:00:12.980> so<00:00:13.280> iris<00:00:13.879> one<00:00:14.269> the<00:00:14.809> standard<00:00:15.110> answer

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
range so iris one the standard answer

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.480 
range so iris one the standard answer
iris<00:00:16.309> three<00:00:16.640> and<00:00:17.080> rs5<00:00:18.080> for<00:00:18.110> two<00:00:18.490> floor

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
iris three and rs5 for two floor

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.700 
iris three and rs5 for two floor
Stander's<00:00:19.940> so<00:00:20.660> starting<00:00:21.020> with<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:21.200> RS<00:00:21.440> one

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
Stander's so starting with the RS one

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.740 
Stander's so starting with the RS one
differences<00:00:22.700> over<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:22.970> our<00:00:23.150> series<00:00:23.570> which

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
differences over the our series which

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.430 
differences over the our series which
they<00:00:24.260> supersede<00:00:24.790> mainly<00:00:25.790> in<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:26.360> tweeter<00:00:26.630> all

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
they supersede mainly in the tweeter all

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.070 
they supersede mainly in the tweeter all
through<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.800> cameras<00:00:28.550> have<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.360> said<00:00:29.870> our

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
through the cameras have the said our

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.870 
through the cameras have the said our
our<00:00:30.290> tweeter<00:00:30.620> this<00:00:31.310> is<00:00:31.400> a<00:00:31.460> big<00:00:31.610> improvement

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
our tweeter this is a big improvement

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.479 
our tweeter this is a big improvement
over<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.629> previous<00:00:33.079> Esther<00:00:33.620> much<00:00:34.190> cleaner

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
over the previous Esther much cleaner

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.520 
over the previous Esther much cleaner
response<00:00:34.910> much<00:00:35.180> more<00:00:35.390> detail<00:00:35.839> far<00:00:36.320> less

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
response much more detail far less

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.259 
response much more detail far less
overhangs<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:37.219> it's<00:00:37.339> a<00:00:37.399> very<00:00:37.640> very<00:00:37.879> precise

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
overhangs so it's a very very precise

iris<00:00:48.739> one<00:00:49.010> stay<00:00:49.460> announcer<00:00:50.230> reported<00:00:51.230> but<00:00:51.800> it

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
iris one stay announcer reported but it

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.739 
iris one stay announcer reported but it
can<00:00:52.190> go<00:00:52.370> first<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.850> all<00:00:52.909> because<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.359> sound<00:00:53.600> of

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
can go first of all because the sound of

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.529 
can go first of all because the sound of
it<00:00:53.870> appears<00:00:54.589> it's<00:00:54.829> very<00:00:55.309> tight<00:00:55.640> quite<00:00:56.179> dry

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
it appears it's very tight quite dry

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.380 
it appears it's very tight quite dry
it's<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.260> very<00:00:57.530> very<00:00:57.769> honest<00:00:58.100> speaking<00:00:58.579> the

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
it's a very very honest speaking the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.880 
it's a very very honest speaking the
higher<00:00:59.629> quality<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.170> electronics<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:00.649> use

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
higher quality of electronics you use

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.369 
higher quality of electronics you use
the<00:01:01.550> more<00:01:01.789> sound<00:01:02.089> it'll<00:01:02.359> give<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.899> very

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
the more sound it'll give you a very

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.410 
the more sound it'll give you a very
good<00:01:03.620> little<00:01:03.769> speak<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.220> that<00:01:04.309> one<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.760> then

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
good little speak of that one and then

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.170 
good little speak of that one and then
these<00:01:06.260> four<00:01:06.800> Sounders<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:07.790> is<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.030> ice

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
these four Sounders this is the ice

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.480 
these four Sounders this is the ice
three<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.200> as<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.439> can<00:01:09.530> see<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.219> know<00:01:10.430> you

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
three and as you can see so you know you

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.819 
three and as you can see so you know you
configuration<00:01:11.149> in<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.450> front<00:01:11.689> front<00:01:12.409> porting

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
configuration in the front front porting

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.130 
configuration in the front front porting
this<00:01:12.979> time<00:01:13.219> so<00:01:13.549> although<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.600> cabinet<00:01:14.960> being

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
this time so although the cabinet being

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.770 
this time so although the cabinet being
larger<00:01:15.530> than<00:01:15.560> our<00:01:15.890> greater<00:01:16.189> base<00:01:16.460> extension

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
larger than our greater base extension

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.880 
larger than our greater base extension
again<00:01:17.780> these<00:01:17.930> will<00:01:18.079> go<00:01:18.200> close<00:01:18.469> to<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.710> wall

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
again these will go close to a wall

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.639 
again these will go close to a wall
because<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.579> quarters<00:01:19.939> at<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.090> front

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
because the quarters at the front

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.020 
because the quarters at the front
interesting<00:01:21.649> that<00:01:21.799> although<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:22.880> is

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
interesting that although this is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.060 
interesting that although this is
actually<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.479> two-way<00:01:23.689> speaker<00:01:24.289> it<00:01:24.680> does<00:01:24.890> have

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
actually a two-way speaker it does have

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.700 
actually a two-way speaker it does have
a<00:01:25.100> third<00:01:25.310> drive<00:01:25.640> unit<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.899> side<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.380> this

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
a third drive unit on the side and this

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.069 
a third drive unit on the side and this
is<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.920> base<00:01:28.100> unit<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.149> cabinets<00:01:29.570> are<00:01:29.659> handed

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
is a base unit the cabinets are handed

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.200 
is a base unit the cabinets are handed
so<00:01:30.289> what<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.070> can<00:01:31.219> do<00:01:31.369> is<00:01:31.490> have<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.789> base<00:01:31.939> use

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
so what you can do is have the base use

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.510 
so what you can do is have the base use
either<00:01:32.329> firing<00:01:32.750> out<00:01:33.200> against<00:01:33.859> the<00:01:34.070> solid

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
either firing out against the solid

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.330 
either firing out against the solid
walls<00:01:34.729> or<00:01:35.350> turning<00:01:36.350> around<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:36.979> they<00:01:37.250> can

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
walls or turning around and they can

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.459 
walls or turning around and they can
find<00:01:37.609> towards<00:01:38.060> each<00:01:38.149> other<00:01:38.299> there's<00:01:39.049> no<00:01:39.229> right

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
find towards each other there's no right

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.889 
find towards each other there's no right
or<00:01:39.500> wrong<00:01:39.740> about<00:01:40.070> which<00:01:40.430> one<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:40.729> better<00:01:41.000> what

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
or wrong about which one is better what

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.050 
or wrong about which one is better what
you<00:01:41.930> have<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.289> do<00:01:42.469> is<00:01:43.009> try<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.430> new<00:01:43.700> listening

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
you have to do is try the new listening

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.639 
you have to do is try the new listening
room<00:01:44.210> see<00:01:44.659> which<00:01:44.869> sounds<00:01:45.170> best<00:01:45.350> in<00:01:45.530> your

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
room see which sounds best in your

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.919 
room see which sounds best in your
listening<00:01:46.039> room<00:01:46.219> so<00:01:46.820> that's<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.299> little<00:01:47.570> bit<00:01:47.780> of

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
listening room so that's a little bit of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.359 
listening room so that's a little bit of
tweaking<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.469> can<00:01:48.590> do<00:01:48.710> for<00:01:48.890> yourself<00:01:49.189> when

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
tweaking you can do for yourself when

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.940 
tweaking you can do for yourself when
you<00:01:49.429> get<00:01:49.549> them<00:01:49.670> home<00:01:50.619> what's<00:01:51.619> really<00:01:51.829> clever

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
you get them home what's really clever

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.209 
you get them home what's really clever
about<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.340> drive<00:01:52.549> here<00:01:53.109> no<00:01:54.109> crossover<00:01:54.530> just

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
about that drive here no crossover just

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.889 
about that drive here no crossover just
want<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:55.490> say<00:01:55.609> it's<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.759> two-way<00:01:56.119> speaker<00:01:56.630> so

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
want to say it's a two-way speaker so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.300 
want to say it's a two-way speaker so
although<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.289> frequencies<00:01:57.770> are<00:01:57.799> divided<00:01:58.219> up

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
although the frequencies are divided up

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.380 
although the frequencies are divided up
between<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.640> base<00:01:58.789> immediately

between the base immediately

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.039 
between the base immediately
and<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.929> tweeter<00:02:00.170> there<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.249> no<00:02:01.429> crossover

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
and the tweeter there is no crossover

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.800 
and the tweeter there is no crossover
dividing<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.590> base<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.520> base<00:02:04.909> unit<00:02:05.149> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
dividing the base to the base unit the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.570 
dividing the base to the base unit the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
coil is deliberately hike

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.460 
coil is deliberately hike
so<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.150> means<00:02:08.330> get<00:02:08.780> away<00:02:08.930> without<00:02:09.020> using<00:02:09.410> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
so that means get away without using a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.440 
so that means get away without using a
crossover<00:02:09.860> because<00:02:10.220> will<00:02:10.670> not<00:02:10.820> produce<00:02:11.000> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
crossover because will not produce a
