00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
at it Gary wasn't only the players the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.459

intensity level from the coaching staff

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.080 
intensity level from the coaching staff
you<00:00:34.800> could<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.160> see<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.910> notch

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you could kind of see it was up a notch

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
you could kind of see it was up a notch
it<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.989> hot<00:00:37.140> today<00:00:37.290> we've<00:00:37.500> had<00:00:37.530> some

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it really is hot today we've had some

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.440 
it really is hot today we've had some
mild<00:00:37.950> days<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> humidity<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.969> back<00:00:39.270> today

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
mild days but the humidity is back today

mild days but the humidity is back today

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
I guess that's fitting with them being

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.229 
I guess that's fitting with them being
in<00:00:40.680> full<00:00:40.860> pads<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.790> talk<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
a lot of depth the longer that practice

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.920 
a lot of depth the longer that practice
goes<00:00:53.789> without<00:00:53.940> those<00:00:54.180> guys<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
goes without those guys out there it's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.049 
goes without those guys out there it's
more<00:00:55.110> likely<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.280> won't<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> factor

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
more likely that they won't be a factor

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.310 
more likely that they won't be a factor

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
on the offensive line they're looking

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
on the offensive line they're looking
for<00:01:35.130> five<00:01:35.310> guys<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:36.210> fit<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> hand

for five guys that will fit like a hand

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.990 
for five guys that will fit like a hand
in<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.320> glove<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> speak<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
in a glove so to speak but the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940 
in a glove so to speak but the
probability<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.900> they'll<00:01:40.350> start<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> true

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
probability is that they'll start a true

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.710 
probability is that they'll start a true

I know he went through spring but your

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
I know he went through spring but your
impressions<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.030> him<00:01:45.229> based<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.439> you've

seen in the fall and will he be ready
well<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> said<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.200> know<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.320> long<00:01:49.500> time<00:01:49.530> ago

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
well and I said you know a long time ago

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.080 
well and I said you know a long time ago
i<00:01:49.920> thought<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> biggest<00:01:50.579> thing<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:50.759> cam

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
i thought the biggest thing for cam

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
i thought the biggest thing for cam
robinson<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> fact<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.140> he<00:01:52.259> could<00:01:52.409> go

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
robinson was the fact that he could go

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.780 
robinson was the fact that he could go
through<00:01:52.649> spring<00:01:53.009> practice<00:01:53.369> got<00:01:53.549> acclimated

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
through spring practice got acclimated

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.940 
through spring practice got acclimated
and<00:01:54.210> he<00:01:54.329> made<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> lot<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.720> progress<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.409> i

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and he made a lot of progress and i

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.260 
and he made a lot of progress and i
think<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> decision<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.790> made<00:01:56.850> kind<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
think the decision was made kind of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.999 
think the decision was made kind of
halfway<00:01:57.450> through<00:01:57.840> spring<00:01:58.200> let's<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.799> cam

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
halfway through spring let's go with cam

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.889 
halfway through spring let's go with cam
robinson<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.700> see<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.149> he<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
robinson and see see what he can do and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
robinson and see see what he can do and
he's<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.680> made<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> progress<00:02:02.280> carry

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
he's really made a lot of progress carry

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.310 
he's really made a lot of progress carry
i<00:02:02.640> thought<00:02:02.820> he<00:02:02.909> looked<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.600> good<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
i thought he looked really good in the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.050 
i thought he looked really good in the
one-on-ones<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.040> sunday<00:02:05.399> when<00:02:05.520> i<00:02:05.579> watched<00:02:05.820> him

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
one-on-ones on sunday when i watched him

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.940 
one-on-ones on sunday when i watched him
and<00:02:06.119> i<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.240> he<00:02:06.479> may<00:02:07.140> start<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.710> slow

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and i think he may start a little slow

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
and i think he may start a little slow
in<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.190> games<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.819> i<00:02:08.849> think<00:02:09.119> his<00:02:09.209> time<00:02:09.479> goes

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
in the games but i think his time goes

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.080 
in the games but i think his time goes
on<00:02:09.869> by<00:02:10.050> middle<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.410> year<00:02:10.679> he<00:02:10.770> should

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
on by middle of year he should

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.940 
on by middle of year he should
really<00:02:11.330> good<00:02:11.480> player<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.140> finally<00:02:12.680> riding

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
really good player and finally riding

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.229 
really good player and finally riding

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
is his chance to really step up and make
