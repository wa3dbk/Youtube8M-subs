00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:21.080
 I roll a layer of black clay 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:25.539
 then wrapping the cling film trends 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.400

 lithic first roll the ball then 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.840
 I push a little with the reception of the needle on 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.360
