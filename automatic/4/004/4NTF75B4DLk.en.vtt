00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.480 

we'll<00:00:00.810> look<00:00:00.930> at<00:00:01.110> drawing<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.560> squirrel<00:00:02.159> with

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
we'll look at drawing a squirrel with

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.370 
we'll look at drawing a squirrel with
iteration<00:00:02.669> first<00:00:03.540> we'll<00:00:03.810> review<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
iteration first we'll review the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.590 
iteration first we'll review the
iteration<00:00:04.890> pattern<00:00:05.040> here<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.029> have<00:00:06.270> three

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
iteration pattern here I have three

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.970 
iteration pattern here I have three
scripts<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.109> use<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.470> iteration<00:00:07.950> pattern

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
scripts that use the iteration pattern

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.549 
scripts that use the iteration pattern
this<00:00:08.670> first<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.090> sets<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.630> variable<00:00:09.840> my<00:00:10.320> note

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
this first one sets the variable my note

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.910 
this first one sets the variable my note
to<00:00:10.830> 60<00:00:11.250> then<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.120> repeats<00:00:12.509> 10<00:00:12.870> times<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.559> each

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
to 60 then it repeats 10 times and each

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.000 
to 60 then it repeats 10 times and each
time<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.429> plays<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.910> note<00:00:15.120> my<00:00:15.780> note<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.440> half

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
time it plays the note my note for half

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.090 
time it plays the note my note for half
a<00:00:17.130> beat<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.580> changes<00:00:18.330> my<00:00:18.449> note<00:00:18.660> by<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:19.100> let's

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
a beat and changes my note by one let's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.130 
a beat and changes my note by one let's
watch<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.670> variable<00:00:21.119> mine<00:00:21.390> note<00:00:21.660> while<00:00:22.020> we

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
watch the variable mine note while we

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.560 
watch the variable mine note while we
run<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> each<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:30.179> through<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.480> loop

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
run this so each time through the loop

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.990 
run this so each time through the loop
it<00:00:30.720> changes<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> variable<00:00:31.800> my<00:00:32.070> note<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.489> also

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it changes the variable my note and also

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.959 
it changes the variable my note and also
plays<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.690> note<00:00:34.550> here's<00:00:35.550> another<00:00:35.760> example

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
plays my note here's another example

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.750 
plays my note here's another example
where<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.480> set<00:00:36.870> my<00:00:37.050> number<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.649> 10<00:00:37.950> my<00:00:38.430> numbers

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
where we set my number to 10 my numbers

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
where we set my number to 10 my numbers
a<00:00:38.790> variable<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.809> we're<00:00:39.960> gonna<00:00:40.110> repeat<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
a variable then we're gonna repeat this

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.340 
a variable then we're gonna repeat this
time<00:00:40.950> 11<00:00:41.340> times<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.940> we're<00:00:42.540> gonna<00:00:42.660> say<00:00:42.989> my

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
time 11 times and we're gonna say my

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.650 
time 11 times and we're gonna say my
number<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.980> each<00:00:44.399> time<00:00:44.730> we'll<00:00:45.000> change<00:00:45.390> my

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
number and each time we'll change my

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
number and each time we'll change my
number<00:00:45.719> by<00:00:46.079> negative<00:00:46.140> 1<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:47.399> count

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
number by negative 1 so this will count

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.630 
number by negative 1 so this will count
down<00:00:47.910> from<00:00:48.210> 10<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.890> actually<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.950> will<00:00:50.039> say<00:00:50.250> 10

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
down from 10 and actually it will say 10

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.970 
down from 10 and actually it will say 10
through<00:00:51.180> zero<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:52.350> we're<00:00:52.469> gonna<00:00:52.590> repeat

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
through zero because we're gonna repeat

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.810 
through zero because we're gonna repeat
11<00:00:53.489> times<00:00:54.680> let's<00:00:55.680> watch<00:00:55.980> how<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.460> number

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
11 times let's watch how my number

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.200 
11 times let's watch how my number
changes<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> cat<00:00:58.649> says<00:00:59.210> two

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
changes and see what the cat says two

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.700 
changes and see what the cat says two
seconds<00:01:00.660> might<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.199> longer<00:01:01.379> than<00:01:01.530> we

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
seconds might be a little longer than we

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
seconds might be a little longer than we
need<00:01:01.859> let's<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.789> play<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.359> half<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
need let's have it play for half a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.000 
need let's have it play for half a
second<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:11.540> look<00:01:12.540> how<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:13.080> number<00:01:13.439> ends<00:01:13.890> at

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
second and look how my number ends at

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
second and look how my number ends at
negative<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:15.360> after<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.780> say<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
negative one because after we say the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.140 
negative one because after we say the
last<00:01:16.259> number<00:01:16.710> which<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> zero<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.640> changes<00:01:18.030> my

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
last number which is zero it changes my

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.620 
last number which is zero it changes my
number<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:18.630> negative<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:20.030> this<00:01:21.030> next<00:01:21.450> one

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
number by negative one this next one

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
number by negative one this next one
doesn't<00:01:21.900> look<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.380> much<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> iteration

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
doesn't look as much like the iteration

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.330 
doesn't look as much like the iteration
pattern<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.000> also<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:26.189> like

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pattern but it also is so here just like

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.819 
pattern but it also is so here just like
I<00:01:26.400> set<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> variable<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:27.600> note<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.049> set<00:01:28.350> tempo

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
I set the variable my note I set tempo

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.760 
I set the variable my note I set tempo
and<00:01:29.070> tempo<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.579> provided<00:01:30.119> variable<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and tempo is a provided variable then I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.399 
and tempo is a provided variable then I
repeat<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> bottom<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.960> change

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
repeat and here on the bottom I change

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
repeat and here on the bottom I change
the<00:01:34.680> tempo<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.340> my<00:01:35.460> variable<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.060> change

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the tempo so that's my variable I change

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.289 
the tempo so that's my variable I change
the<00:01:36.600> tempo<00:01:36.900> by<00:01:37.020> 20<00:01:37.520> other<00:01:38.520> examples<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> our

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the tempo by 20 other examples of our

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
the tempo by 20 other examples of our
iteration<00:01:39.659> pattern<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.229> was<00:01:40.350> easier<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> see

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
iteration pattern it was easier to see

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.810 
iteration pattern it was easier to see
how<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.220> use<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.970> variable<00:01:42.950> here<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.220> play<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
how we use the variable here we play the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.149 
how we use the variable here we play the
note<00:01:45.000> my<00:01:45.270> note<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.320> said<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.829> number

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
note my note and here we said the number

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
note my note and here we said the number
my<00:01:47.399> number<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.960> we're<00:01:49.170> gonna<00:01:49.259> play<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
my number but here we're gonna play a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.460 
my number but here we're gonna play a
drum<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.640> beat<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.869> beat<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
drum for one beat and one beat is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.010 
drum for one beat and one beat is
determined<00:01:53.130> by<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.280> tempo<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.720> we're

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
determined by the tempo so here we're

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.100 
determined by the tempo so here we're
actually<00:01:55.229> using<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.219> variable<00:01:56.549> tempo<00:01:57.149> let's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
actually using that variable tempo let's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.240 
actually using that variable tempo let's
listen<00:02:04.009> cool

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
listen cool

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.270 
listen cool
I<00:02:05.280> made<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> reset<00:02:06.840> script<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.710> use<00:02:07.979> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I made a reset script that I can use to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.729 
I made a reset script that I can use to
clear<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.670> screen<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.270> I've<00:02:09.929> also<00:02:10.140> made<00:02:10.440> two

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
clear the screen and I've also made two

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.890 
clear the screen and I've also made two
scripts<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.250> are<00:02:11.459> hidden<00:02:11.670> right<00:02:11.970> now<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
scripts that are hidden right now to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.890 
scripts that are hidden right now to
draw<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> Squire

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
draw a Squire

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.610 
draw a Squire
which<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.349> like<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:14.799> spiral<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:15.730> square-shaped

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
which is like a spiral but square-shaped

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.710 
which is like a spiral but square-shaped
look<00:02:17.620> how<00:02:17.829> size<00:02:18.280> changes<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.420> first

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
look how size changes in this first

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.819 
look how size changes in this first
version<00:02:21.959> could<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.079> see<00:02:23.260> how<00:02:23.439> it<00:02:23.620> gets

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
version could you see how it gets

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.199 
version could you see how it gets
smaller<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.549> smaller

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
smaller and smaller

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.720 
smaller and smaller
now<00:02:25.780> I'll<00:02:25.959> clear<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.319> again<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.950> now<00:02:27.579> I'll

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
now I'll clear it again and now I'll

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.710 
now I'll clear it again and now I'll
draw<00:02:27.909> a<00:02:27.970> different<00:02:28.510> version<00:02:28.720> check<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.739> out

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
draw a different version check it out

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.640 
draw a different version check it out
could<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.750> tell<00:02:31.989> what<00:02:32.109> was<00:02:32.230> different<00:02:32.470> about

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
could you tell what was different about

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.869 
could you tell what was different about
these<00:02:32.920> two<00:02:33.030> let<00:02:34.030> me<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.329> first<00:02:34.480> one<00:02:34.750> again

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
these two let me do the first one again

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.580 
these two let me do the first one again
here<00:02:36.879> I<00:02:36.909> started<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.659> the<00:02:37.750> outside<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
here I started on the outside of the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.890 
here I started on the outside of the
spiral<00:02:39.159> and<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.879> this<00:02:40.060> second<00:02:40.480> version<00:02:40.599> I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
spiral and on this second version I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.410 
spiral and on this second version I
started<00:02:41.290> on<00:02:41.379> the<00:02:41.500> inside<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.159> spiral<00:02:42.640> when

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
started on the inside of the spiral when

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.789 
started on the inside of the spiral when
you're<00:02:43.569> making<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.930> spiral<00:02:44.349> you'll<00:02:44.560> need<00:02:44.709> to

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
you're making the spiral you'll need to

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:45.809 
you're making the spiral you'll need to
make<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.950> decision<00:02:45.280> about<00:02:45.519> which<00:02:45.760> direction

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
make a decision about which direction

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.660 
make a decision about which direction
you<00:02:46.480> want<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.690> go<00:02:46.840> let's<00:02:47.799> watch<00:02:47.980> one<00:02:48.250> more<00:02:48.400> time

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
you want to go let's watch one more time

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.809 
you want to go let's watch one more time
and<00:02:48.970> see<00:02:49.120> how<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.329> variable<00:02:49.780> size<00:02:50.019> changes<00:02:53.819> so

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
and see how the variable size changes so

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.449 
and see how the variable size changes so
their<00:02:55.090> size<00:02:55.540> kept<00:02:55.959> getting<00:02:56.260> bigger<00:02:56.409> and<00:02:56.620> size

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
their size kept getting bigger and size

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.539 
their size kept getting bigger and size
is<00:02:57.909> how<00:02:58.120> long<00:02:58.359> each<00:02:58.599> of<00:02:58.720> these<00:02:59.049> sides<00:02:59.319> is<00:02:59.650> what

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
is how long each of these sides is what

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.210 
is how long each of these sides is what
about<00:03:00.639> the<00:03:00.819> other<00:03:00.849> version<00:03:01.389> here<00:03:02.290> sides<00:03:02.769> keeps

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
about the other version here sides keeps

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.789 
about the other version here sides keeps
getting<00:03:03.579> smaller<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.810> squirrel<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.409> another

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
getting smaller the squirrel is another

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.170 
getting smaller the squirrel is another
example<00:03:06.040> where<00:03:06.519> you're<00:03:06.639> going<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.879> use<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
example where you're going to use the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.210 
example where you're going to use the
iteration<00:03:07.720> pattern<00:03:07.750> it'll<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:08.799> be<00:03:08.889> a<00:03:08.920> little

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
iteration pattern it'll just be a little

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.420 
iteration pattern it'll just be a little
bit<00:03:09.340> trickier<00:03:09.700> good<00:03:10.239> luck
