 The story of dad's hairstyle will not be good and I will always say 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.230

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.380
 Go in the direction you want to go with the strong gas adjustment direction key 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.890
 It will be convenient a 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.509
 If I ca n't do it for a moment , 6 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:14.270
 The operation of the balloon is so delicate that one mistake is fatal 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.590
 It's alright, it's just a bit disappointing It's really dangerous because you 're that kind of character Yamamoto 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.860
 I hate you 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.860
 Mr. Yamamoto has nothing to do, because I only touch for a moment 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.470
 It's tough You can't operate without a remote control 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.290
 I'm going to do it 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.290
 It's because you're going to squeeze 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.129

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.810
 When the terrorist of the disaster's very first injection 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.310

 It's what happens you go on leave this 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.990
 I wondered what would happen if it weakened 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.910
 I did it differently 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.540
 I have less gas left 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.829
 If it is this way, I 'll fall out of gas 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.829
