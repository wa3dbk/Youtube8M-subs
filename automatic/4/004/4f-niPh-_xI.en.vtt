00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.610
 hello welcome to a program that 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.800
 shows that being professional to be 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.360
 a great artist you already know that always 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.700
 we want to buy cell phones last model 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.430
 but the money does not reach us either by 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.950
 spend it on prostitutes or drugs or what 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.119
 let it be but that's over today I'm going to 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.130
 teach how to make a cell phone with 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.770
 home materials look good for this 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.620
 you'll need 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.910
 a leaf 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.950
 a battery of the hair era 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.510
 an antenna and a fiber is up what 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.880
 first thing to do is open the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.430
 fiber 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.790
 you have to write down the numbers from 1 to 9 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.500
 56 then comes the 7 with this are 9 and 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.740
 you can put the word center 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.200
 once you have the board you go to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:17.409
 need a battery 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.810
 and now to summarize everything in something like 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.219
 once you have the board molded to 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.319
 the battery the last thing you're going to need 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.319
 it's an antenna to answer signal 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.640
 and then you can take care of painting it with 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.900
 some colors or other details 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.550
 I will prove my finished 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.550
 there's going to be something like this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.659
 an authentic art and you can do it for 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.299
 we sit great we keep it in osaka 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.399
 last but I will have next week in 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.530
 where I will teach you how to paint your nails 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.530
 with closed eyes goodbye

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.540
 You can believe I buy a box of 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.540
 lighter and does not go any 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.480
 I wonder I'll break a box 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.480
 man 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.769
 Tell us 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:31.069
 so, rather, all good that I am 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.200
 yes all good everything is well aimed as 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.180
 which covers many things like time not 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.489
 I know is that you respond to everything 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.739
 is that one part the other left out that 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.599
 I do not know anything that I do not know 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.340
 fits that question seems pretty 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.129
 stupid if I ask you is 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.170
 say yes that exceeded everything because 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.909
 really everything and the face can not be 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.900
 no longer it has then not all good 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:56.290
 you can not answer me that you saw 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.290
 everything is not right 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 there is something good 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.880
 As Alfredo used to tell you, I am doing very well 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.470
 well I can not go better in day or 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.610
 notice that I am administering the silver 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.400

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.940
 the taxes are paid alone also I 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.410
 I'm fucking mother 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.420

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.100

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.750
