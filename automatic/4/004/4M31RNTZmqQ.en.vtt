00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.589
 well in this video I will mention you 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.120
 some data that probably 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.360
 they did not know about soccer 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.040
 so let's start with the information 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.710
 know the exact origin of football is 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.570
 impossible but popularly considered 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.090
 that this was created on the islands 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.610
 British in the Middle Ages although it fits 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.399
 note that different ancient cultures 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.399
 as the Mayans already practiced very 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.649
 similar to football the sporting event 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.510
 most seen in history until the day of 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.690
 today was the final of the World Cup 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.570

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.100
 of samoa americana this data is 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.289
 scary but real and that is to bring 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.649
 out the world cup to be held 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.989
 in qatar 2022 will charge more than 3 thousand lives 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.780
 this because of the very dangerous 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.780
 working conditions under which 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.120
