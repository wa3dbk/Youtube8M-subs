00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
I figured out it is pretty easy to make

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.659 
I figured out it is pretty easy to make
it<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:56.380> simply<00:04:56.650> need<00:04:56.979> several<00:04:57.280> images

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
it you simply need several images

properly cut into layers and a little

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.800 
properly cut into layers and a little
bit<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.070> coding<00:05:00.370> getting<00:05:01.150> a<00:05:01.240> developer

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
bit of coding getting a developer

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.020 
bit of coding getting a developer
account<00:05:02.050> with<00:05:02.260> Apple<00:05:02.650> was<00:05:02.860> pretty<00:05:03.190> easy<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:04.000> I

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
account with Apple was pretty easy so I

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.850

and guide me I guess I spent three times
longer<00:05:10.870> than<00:05:11.020> average<00:05:11.320> creating<00:05:12.040> it<00:05:12.160> than<00:05:12.310> I

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
longer than average creating it than I
