00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.250
 uninhibited as if you were by way 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.470
 speak again on a field with boyfriend 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.820
 plays what is it with you yes I think 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.900
 to do the rolling with the competition 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.550
 has 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.550
 I the opponent 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.949
 yes analyzed and found right back 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.190
 actually not that strong and the 1 to 1 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.480
 so well, and with good football 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.760
 if you like players like 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 plays the role of cutting and then 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.280
 it is also easy to be the free man 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.710
 find 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 because something wants to have the ball 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.590
 they are easy and playable 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.340
 quietly received assignments from Vergaap 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340
 do you do the store 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.800
 yes just so much of a paid one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.239
 just do what I always enter 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.829
 and that I did try more often 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.250
 just trying to play my third game 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.799
 play 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.659
 yes that says a rail union on 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.390
 square but is about the same 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.770
 now many things can be done better 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.290
 actions 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.220
 I try to be threatening then you have 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.060
 this gesture 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.450

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.760
 None of dispersion for this 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.760

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.420
