00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.780
 One two, one two. I want my superhero at home. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.080
 Override. 

00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:07.454
 Yeah, you got it. Don't worry. 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.560
 Hi. My name is Erik and today we are looking at a great superhero! 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.080
 And not just for ordinary superheroes. And Spiderman! 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.000
 The guy who saves human lives and sends bad guys down to hell. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.040
 And it's not just an ordinary figure. 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.440
 If you think Spiderman is just a plastic figure that stands and moves hands, 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.080
 so you are in a big mistake. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.520
 Because Spiderman has a built-in radio in it 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.960
 that starts on the side. 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 ON button. 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.580
 And here's another button on the side, 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.600
 you control her. 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.220
 Of course, this radio can be used both outdoors and at home 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.820
 because it has a frequency of up to 40.6 MHz. 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.040
 So this is Spiderman - the radio. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.800
 And the one beside him is also a radio that already has a built-in Super Spiderman antenna. 

00:01:19.587 --> 00:01:21.587
 And let's see how it works. 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140
 There is a button on the side - ON / OFF again. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 You hear the noise. 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.280
 That is right. 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.400
 This is how every good Spiderman chase for a bad guy starts. 

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:37.274
 So I'm switching. 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.340
 Razdvarazdvarazdva ... Do we hear? 

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:42.694
 Do we hear? 

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:43.194
 Override. 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120
 This radio is good for boys from 3 years old. 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.620
 And I think it can be used in any way. 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.880
 Household. 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 You definitely must not miss your boys in the room. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.660
 It is made entirely of plastic material, 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.380
 it's handy 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.960
 of course, guys can only play with it if they don't have it turned on as a radio, 

00:02:04.493 --> 00:02:06.133
 it can be manipulated in any way. 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.420
 Don't go, 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.000
 it does not have bendable joints ... 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.220
 this Spiderman figurine. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.720
 But! 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.220
 She has moving hands. 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.340
 All you need to do is take a handy crosshair, a screwdriver, 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.660
 at the back you remove it, open your back and put the flashlight there. 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 The same is the case with the other radio. 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.820
 Also a crosshair ... You remove, lift, connect a flashlight and it works. 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080
 We don't only have these radios in the collection 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.460
 but we also have a Spiderman ejection helicopter, 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.507
 and we have the plush Spiderman himself. 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.420
 And I'm still saying goodbye to you and sending us to us. 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.680
 See you next video. 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.820
 Hi!
