guess<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.379> farm<00:00:16.650> would<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.890> based<00:00:17.130> off

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
guess the farm would be based off

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.640 
guess the farm would be based off
probably<00:00:17.730> at<00:00:17.940> six<00:00:18.240> seven<00:00:18.660> hundred<00:00:18.779> Cal<00:00:19.439> calf

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
probably at six seven hundred Cal calf

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.250 
probably at six seven hundred Cal calf
operation<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.119> that's<00:00:21.359> where<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.080> main

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
operation and that's where the main

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.160 
operation and that's where the main
income<00:00:22.470> would<00:00:22.890> come<00:00:23.070> from<00:00:23.570> they<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.810> they

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
income would come from they don't they

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.410 
income would come from they don't they
don't<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.439> lot<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> row<00:00:25.920> crop<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.550> as<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
don't have a lot of row crop and as you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.439 
don't have a lot of row crop and as you
can<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.890> here<00:00:28.890> we've<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.400> fall<00:00:30.090> herd<00:00:30.330> of

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
can see here we've got a fall herd of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.500 
can see here we've got a fall herd of
cows<00:00:30.920> it's<00:00:31.920> I'd<00:00:32.610> say<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:32.969> based<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
cows it's I'd say it's based off a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.470 
cows it's I'd say it's based off a
middle<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.440> summer<00:00:34.739> towards<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> end<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.390> the
