slingshot a lot trying to get a little
bit<00:00:54.379> of<00:00:54.440> an<00:00:54.499> overload<00:00:55.449> especially<00:00:56.449> while<00:00:56.690> I'm

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
bit of an overload especially while I'm

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.369 
bit of an overload especially while I'm
not<00:00:57.920> feeling<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.339> hundred<00:00:58.370> percent<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.379> over

not feeling a hundred percent and over

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.739 
not feeling a hundred percent and over
here<00:01:00.620> we<00:01:00.769> got<00:01:00.949> some<00:01:01.579> reverse<00:01:01.879> band<00:01:02.210> bench<00:01:02.539> and

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
here we got some reverse band bench and

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:07.270 
here we got some reverse band bench and
going<00:01:02.839> on<00:01:03.109> here's<00:01:03.800> Juan<00:01:04.040> doing<00:01:05.110> 585<00:01:06.280> six

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
going on here's Juan doing 585 six

going on here's Juan doing 585 six
plates<00:01:08.020> reverse<00:01:09.020> band<00:01:09.320> with<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.619> slingshot

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
plates reverse band with the slingshot

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.749 
plates reverse band with the slingshot
on<00:01:10.130> getting<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.840> double<00:01:11.840> overload<00:01:12.520> some<00:01:13.520> people

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
on getting a double overload some people

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.670 
on getting a double overload some people
think<00:01:13.939> this<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:14.299> a<00:01:14.329> little<00:01:14.540> bit<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:15.020> overkill

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
think this is a little bit of overkill

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.789 
think this is a little bit of overkill
but<00:01:16.159> it's<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:17.450> another<00:01:17.630> exercise<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:18.619> know

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
but it's just another exercise you know

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.920 
but it's just another exercise you know
it<00:01:19.009> it's<00:01:19.549> just<00:01:19.759> another<00:01:20.180> way<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.420> overload<00:01:20.899> the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
it it's just another way to overload the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.920 
it it's just another way to overload the
body<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.880> don't<00:01:23.030> have<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.450> use<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.570> slingshot

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
body you don't have to use a slingshot

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.130 
body you don't have to use a slingshot
obviously<00:01:24.649> when<00:01:24.770> you're<00:01:24.829> doing<00:01:25.070> reverse<00:01:25.310> band

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
obviously when you're doing reverse band

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.770 
obviously when you're doing reverse band
but<00:01:27.140> we<00:01:27.799> we<00:01:28.369> found<00:01:28.640> be<00:01:28.850> pretty<00:01:29.060> effective<00:01:29.180> here

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
but we we found be pretty effective here

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.840 
but we we found be pretty effective here
in<00:01:30.049> our<00:01:30.229> in<00:01:30.380> our<00:01:30.500> gym<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.490> guys<00:01:31.700> at

westside barbell they actually kind of

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.899 
westside barbell they actually kind of
started<00:01:35.810> doing<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.110> first<00:01:36.340> even<00:01:37.340> before<00:01:37.369> i<00:01:37.610> did

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
started doing it first even before i did

started doing it first even before i did
i<00:01:37.939> sent<00:01:38.270> them<00:01:38.390> out<00:01:38.479> some<00:01:38.719> slingshots<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.469> guys

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
good step in the right direction but

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.870 
good step in the right direction but
it's<00:02:18.250> been<00:02:18.460> frustrating<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:20.380> say<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.590> least

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
it's been frustrating to say the least

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
it's been frustrating to say the least
just<00:02:21.880> having<00:02:22.210> been<00:02:22.450> haven't<00:02:22.960> been<00:02:23.080> myself<00:02:23.230> on

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
just having been haven't been myself on

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.070 
just having been haven't been myself on
the<00:02:23.740> bench<00:02:23.920> pressing<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.790> while<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.780> like<00:02:26.020> I

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the bench pressing in a while and like I

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.300 
the bench pressing in a while and like I
said<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.590> good<00:02:26.770> step<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.220> right

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
said this is a good step in the right

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.920 
said this is a good step in the right
direction<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.850> think<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.210> about<00:02:28.390> seven

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
direction I think this is about seven

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.350 
direction I think this is about seven
thirty<00:02:29.310> or<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.520> might<00:02:30.670> be<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> one<00:02:31.030> before

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
thirty or it might be the one before

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.900 
thirty or it might be the one before
that<00:02:31.600> something<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.670> moved

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
that something like that but that moved

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.699 
that something like that but that moved
well<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.390> was<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.540> good<00:02:34.750> press<00:02:35.170> there<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
well that was a good press there and

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.980 
well that was a good press there and
this<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.190> something<00:02:36.310> I've<00:02:36.610> been<00:02:36.990> dedicating

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
this is something I've been dedicating

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.620 
this is something I've been dedicating
myself<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.760> trying<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.850> increase<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
myself to trying to increase the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.230 
myself to trying to increase the
shoulder<00:02:41.140> strength<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.740> stability<00:02:42.240> because

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
shoulder strength and stability because

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.030 
shoulder strength and stability because
as<00:02:43.480> I've<00:02:43.690> lost<00:02:43.930> weed<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.500> further<00:02:44.740> range

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
as I've lost weed I have a further range

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.280 
as I've lost weed I have a further range
of<00:02:45.160> motion<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.580> go<00:02:45.760> maybe<00:02:46.540> I'll<00:02:46.720> share<00:02:47.020> some

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
of motion to go maybe I'll share some

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.290 
of motion to go maybe I'll share some
other<00:02:47.950> exercises<00:02:48.489> with<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.760> guys<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.180> I've

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
other exercises with you guys that I've

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.040 
other exercises with you guys that I've
been<00:02:49.390> doing<00:02:50.610> I'll<00:02:51.610> film<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.420> for<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:52.660> guys<00:02:52.690> so

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
been doing I'll film it for you guys so

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.240 
been doing I'll film it for you guys so
you<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.260> kind<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.500> see<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.830> I've<00:02:53.920> been<00:02:54.040> doing

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you can kind of see it I've been doing

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.090 
you can kind of see it I've been doing
some<00:02:54.280> front<00:02:55.180> raises<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.930> some<00:02:56.140> variations<00:02:57.010> of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
some front raises and some variations of

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.870 
some front raises and some variations of
front<00:02:57.370> raises<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.780> try<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.050> just<00:02:59.320> really<00:03:00.190> you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
front raises to try to just really you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.050 
front raises to try to just really you
know<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.180> into<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.570> front<00:03:02.140> delt<00:03:02.500> there<00:03:03.060> due

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
know get into that front delt there due

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.370 
know get into that front delt there due
to<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.209> fact<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.600> range<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:04.930> motion<00:03:04.989> is

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
to the fact that range of motion is

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.550 
to the fact that range of motion is
greater<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:07.360> almost<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.750> my<00:03:07.930> arms<00:03:08.410> got

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
greater it's almost like my arms got

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.960 
greater it's almost like my arms got
longer<00:03:08.890> somehow<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.400> don't<00:03:09.580> really<00:03:09.730> know<00:03:09.940> how

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
longer somehow I don't really know how

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.470 
longer somehow I don't really know how
that<00:03:10.239> happened<00:03:10.270> but<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:11.680> weird<00:03:12.330> anyway<00:03:13.330> this

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
that happened but it's weird anyway this

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.430 
that happened but it's weird anyway this
is<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.630> bamboo<00:03:14.170> bench<00:03:14.470> press<00:03:14.860> with<00:03:15.330> kettlebells

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
is a bamboo bench press with kettlebells

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.280 
is a bamboo bench press with kettlebells
bands<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.799> sides<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:19.450> can<00:03:19.570> see<00:03:19.780> how<00:03:19.989> bad

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
bands on the sides you can see how bad

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.800 
bands on the sides you can see how bad
that<00:03:20.530> barbell<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.280> shaking<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:22.690> is

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
that barbell is shaking this is

that barbell is shaking this is
typically<00:03:23.170> done<00:03:23.290> for<00:03:23.680> high<00:03:23.890> reps<00:03:25.799> what<00:03:26.799> I've

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
typically done for high reps what I've

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.320 
typically done for high reps what I've
been<00:03:27.100> trying<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.489> do<00:03:27.580> on<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:27.790> one<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.090> push

this<00:03:46.480> exercise<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:48.070> could<00:03:48.280> use<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.489> regular

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
this exercise is you could use a regular

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.830 
this exercise is you could use a regular
barbell<00:03:49.360> for<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.730> see<00:03:51.940> Jim<00:03:52.209> whipping

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
barbell for it you see Jim whipping

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.210 
barbell for it you see Jim whipping
around<00:03:52.930> there<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.320> little<00:03:53.440> bit<00:03:53.590> that's<00:03:53.739> exactly

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
around there a little bit that's exactly

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.210 
around there a little bit that's exactly
the<00:03:54.910> way<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.180> should<00:03:55.209> look<00:03:55.660> it's<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.530> it's

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
the way it should look it's a it's

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.800 
the way it should look it's a it's
supposed<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.610> be<00:03:57.760> unstable<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.480> can<00:03:58.600> see

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
supposed to be unstable and you can see

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.990 
supposed to be unstable and you can see
those<00:03:59.500> bands<00:03:59.890> really<00:04:00.250> moving<00:04:00.519> around<00:04:00.670> but<00:04:00.880> was

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
those bands really moving around but was

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.110 
those bands really moving around but was
going<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.209> say<00:04:01.360> is<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.780> could<00:04:02.230> use<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> regular

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
going to say is you could use a regular

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.150 
going to say is you could use a regular
barbell<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:05.320> can<00:04:05.440> figure<00:04:05.650> out<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.860> way<00:04:06.100> to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
barbell and you can figure out a way to

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.530 
barbell and you can figure out a way to
loop<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.519> through<00:04:06.579> plates<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.269> things<00:04:07.299> like

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
loop it through plates and things like

more<00:04:44.010> stable<00:04:44.960> if<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.140> use<00:04:46.260> like<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> light<00:04:46.770> band

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
more stable if you use like a light band

more stable if you use like a light band
or<00:04:47.250> something<00:04:47.340> like<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.610> obviously<00:04:48.420> it's

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
or something like that obviously it's

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.600 
or something like that obviously it's
going<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.750> be<00:04:48.840> more<00:04:49.020> stable<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.650> obviously

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
going to be more stable and obviously

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.720 
going to be more stable and obviously
we're<00:04:50.820> using<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.090> regular<00:04:51.240> barbell<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:53.580> would

we're using a regular barbell it would
be<00:04:53.850> more<00:04:54.060> stable<00:04:54.620> but<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.680> point<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:56.130> just<00:04:56.310> to

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
be more stable but the point is just to

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.360 
be more stable but the point is just to
get<00:04:56.580> some<00:04:56.760> reps<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.180> get<00:04:57.330> some<00:04:57.510> work<00:04:57.660> in<00:04:57.960> and
