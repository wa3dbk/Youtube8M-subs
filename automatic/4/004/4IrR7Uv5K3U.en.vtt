00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 so many people have never been so hot up here 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.750
 minecraft pocket edition 0.11 zero point 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.440
 to be able to carry out a complete review 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.540
 of the version that just came out today 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.549
 then let's start immediately by saying that in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.500
 this new home screen was of 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.630
 indeed we can get some new things 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 immediately see next to the old rate 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.590
 imputations this new setting 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 that will be the language are many, many 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.029
 languages ​​almost all known ones e 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.250
 important and also have changed how 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 you must also see the key here immediately 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.270
 play with play so we click on it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.480
 immediately then we can see the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.520
 our list of worlds a little bit 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.079
 in fact, there are these new ones 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.020
 server that we can see if they will be on 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.350
 line this or not from this button 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.329
 circle elected to the right which will be green or 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.070
 red second if it will be online or not e 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.410
 clicking our world a case 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.570
 we could make new options like 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.480
 rename it for example now I'll call it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.039
 fest or other things as it could 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.020
 be the limitless creative urgency 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.199
 and always put day or not e 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 also delete it in mind if we would like 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.470
 but back and change ours 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.310
 world we can start to see what 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.140
 then added the scooter and in 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.220
 this less as they added that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.500
 sand dug nothing 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.299
 in the second still nothing while in the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.080
 third we can see how they added 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.150
 really very many blocks the first one 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 perhaps even more important is the cane from 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.470
 fishing in fact with this story is not there 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.540
 a water source we can start at 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.119
 fish by simply clicking the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.520
 our rate catches cancer and we will launch 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.140
 our love you were clicking then taking it back 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.180
 obviously the survival will bite 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.820
 fish we can take another 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 very important block is the boat 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.009
 in fact here we can see an ok tent 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.180
 perfect 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.509
 here we can see that we can fish 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.939
 on the water and clicking on board we can 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.399
 start shaking 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.110
 by clicking these two buttons the marquee 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.049
 pressed both we will go straight and to 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.130
 create one at a time we can pull 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 year to see in these new nu 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.540
 to the help of the new eggs disposes 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.289
 and indeed as we can see they have 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.400
 added spider and vague but cube squid 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.310
 have the squid immediately 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.519
 the squid as we can see was 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.129
 added and can finally repopulate the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.579
 our seas instead was in the caves 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.370
 will have resolve in those of the 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.540
 caves where there will be rails and 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.840
 survival you will receive an effect that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.909
 later I will explain the last mob instead the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.640
 moma cube and as you can see thinking 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.069
 it will be a simple slime in a lava version 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.430
 but with truly monstrous dimensions 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.250
 some some ways in the ass sometimes 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.200
 let's say another thing which is an addition 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.940
 in which he is actively having these 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.819
 all the tools of all materials 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.950
 and sorry it's also the snowball that 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.560
 okay good thing that always does 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.599
 however convenient of this screen as 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.430
 if seeing finalists added i 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.260
 various weights we could pescarin survival 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.200
 last thing he achieved in creative 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.150
 is to be able to have a longer range 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.310
 high with which we can carry out 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.159
 our changes on the blocks do 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.739
 see can split one very distant 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.079
 what you have excellent and now we pass instead 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.350
 back to the original title 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:26.630
 as you can see here we have a 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.330
 11 re style of these settings with 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.830
 various mind systems like the rude of the 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.460
 volume immediately on this screen 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.920
 initial or after having 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.720
 simplified with the addition of 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.490
 hide caeli this what it is instead 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.920
 passing this skin note here 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.050
 we will be able to see how this is obviously 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.400
 a lot changed in fact before 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.170
 we will be able to make changes to the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.270
 skin absolutely third-party applications 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.340
 share as launcher blocks while 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.290
 now we can finally put the 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.540
 Our skins also visible multiplayer 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.680
 from the app how many we can see if 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.500
 various models will be various various objects 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.360
 alex steve and consult what they could 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.489
 let's see our skin 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.560
 customized africa from the internet or 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.230
 created by us instead in this part 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.440
 we will be able to see the skin for a fee e 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.750
 also some free ones with which it will be 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.000
 let's say a little bad thing but one 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.200
 good thing for the nonres with whom not 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.440
 maybe we could put the skins on 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.690
 custom, maybe I unfortunately here 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.240
 he can't know 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.419

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.640
 potions effects work 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.100
 in fact if we send raw chicken 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.360
 like what's in our hands now 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.760
 a check may sometimes appear 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.800
 object an icon the act that will be in the 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.710

 challenge yourself that there are you were going out 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.490
 different effects like chicken 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.620
 that will damage the spiders 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.400
 that will damage us or is really 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.630
 that of the ball that we could 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.280
 to make nausea 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.620
 after veneti are all the other effects 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.080

 which in this version are these various 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.440
 buildings especially in the desert that 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.910
 they really have more depth 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.520
 the exploration that we can carry out 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.650
 minecraft in fact before the desert was 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.930
 very bare while maybe with these 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.449
 constructions even if there are any 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.070
 of the same shape it really gives a lot 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.990
 more depth our exploration there 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.840
 almost gave a sense of goal 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.160

 Hello
