yeah<00:00:00.599> again<00:00:01.100> in<00:00:02.100> conditions<00:00:02.610> like<00:00:02.669> tonight

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
yeah again in conditions like tonight

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.550 
yeah again in conditions like tonight
and<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.389> last<00:00:03.600> time<00:00:03.810> they<00:00:03.959> faced<00:00:04.140> them<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.440> New

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
and the last time they faced them in New

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.829 
and the last time they faced them in New
York<00:00:04.710> borough<00:00:04.950> was<00:00:05.100> cold

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
York borough was cold

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.709 
York borough was cold
I<00:00:06.870> think<00:00:07.680> hiddens<00:00:08.010> will<00:00:08.220> say<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.820> we<00:00:09.330> want<00:00:09.630> a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
I think hiddens will say that we want a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.740 
I think hiddens will say that we want a
picture<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.080> have<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.820> grip<00:00:11.820> where<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> pitch

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
picture to have a grip where a pitch

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.870 
picture to have a grip where a pitch
doesn't<00:00:13.019> get<00:00:13.110> away<00:00:13.200> from<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.500> guy<00:00:13.670> but<00:00:14.670> when

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
doesn't get away from a guy but when

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.210 
doesn't get away from a guy but when
it's<00:00:15.030> obvious<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:18.140> think<00:00:19.140> there's<00:00:19.439> better<00:00:20.039> ways

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
it's obvious I think there's better ways

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.779 
it's obvious I think there's better ways
to<00:00:20.279> maybe<00:00:20.670> concealer<00:00:21.210> well<00:00:21.750> aware<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.080> what

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
to maybe concealer well aware of what

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.980 
to maybe concealer well aware of what
the<00:00:23.789> thought<00:00:24.000> across<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> field<00:00:24.660> might<00:00:24.840> be

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the thought across the field might be

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.589 
the thought across the field might be
that<00:00:25.320> there<00:00:25.760> may<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.789> more<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.269> willingness

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
that there may be more of a willingness

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.589 
that there may be more of a willingness
to<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:27.960> our<00:00:28.140> guys<00:00:28.289> checked<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.210> again<00:00:30.210> I

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to have our guys checked but again I

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.590 
to have our guys checked but again I
think<00:00:30.720> there's<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.170> accepted<00:00:31.769> level<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:33.210> some

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
think there's an accepted level of some

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.799 
think there's an accepted level of some
attitude<00:00:34.050> used<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.590> gain<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> grip<00:00:35.600> just<00:00:36.600> felt

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
attitude used to gain a grip just felt

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.389 
attitude used to gain a grip just felt
like<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> two<00:00:37.440> stars<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.040> we've<00:00:38.219> had

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
like in the two stars that we've had

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.180 
like in the two stars that we've had
against<00:00:42.079> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> second<00:00:43.500> inning<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.920> looked

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
against in the second inning it looked

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.690 
against in the second inning it looked
from<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> dugout<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.660> a

from the dugout that there was a

did see it from the dugout it was

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.250 
did see it from the dugout it was
confirmed<00:00:53.489> by<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> number<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> camera<00:00:55.110> angles

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
