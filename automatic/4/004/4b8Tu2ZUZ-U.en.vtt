00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 From this movie, you will learn that except 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:18.180
 training is necessary for good 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:20.490
 command execution to me if so much 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.500
 ways of learning then why many 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 dogs perform this command poorly 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.939
 because dog handling depends 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.250
 not only from learning but from what 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.109
 dogs character and what style of behavior 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.420
 and this in turn depends on how 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.420
 the dog was raised and how it spun 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 the behavior of the dog depends on its character 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.420
 the needs of the prevailing instincts and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.769
 habits all this can be described as 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.769
 dog orientation 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.590
 very often people endure bogorodskoe 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.990
 statements of their dog's instincts and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.479
 use for this command but the degree 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.920
 the dog's submission command may not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.720
 grab to slow down 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.079
 poison is desirable head 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.719
 but if she does not have her 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.159
 can be taught teamwork if 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.219
 nature and focus of behavior 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.350
 dogs formed then to correct 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.750
 such a dog will have to spend very 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.670
 a lot of work time therefore better 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.009
 engage in training with puppy 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.259
 age 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.140
 we call it often happens so despite 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.399
 for dog training remains 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.829
 out of control and out of control 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.149
 it happens to the owner because it goes 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.789
 two parallel processes 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.220
 training dog teamwork and 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.780
 raising a dog like that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:19.280
 style that she just does not want 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:26.549
 obey a man and scare me 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:33.650
 broke sit no climb there no 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.650
 climb there no sit 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.020
 no no 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.610
 in such situations character is formed 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.640
 dogs and as a result puppy which 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.100
 knows the command to me sometimes refuses 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.890
 and and perform with age it sometimes 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.120
 can become very common and in fact 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.120
 will turn into always 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.959
 if training is combined with the wrong 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.879
 education then in the end we have here 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.560
 such is the attitude towards man and his 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.269
 teams 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.159
