00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
 1 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 Oh 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.210
 how 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 Oh 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.260
 hello everyone i'm here with youssef 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.110
 of souda good place game youssef 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.030
 hello hello to all youssef here 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.980
 we provide a very very nice job 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.500
 yes if we have a very nice project so 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.870
 in a customer where we had to redo a 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.510
 tightness mowing initially on a 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.490
 basin that was masonry with a resin 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.710
 so liquid rubber on it that 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.840
 was bubbling so when we got 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.210
 preferred to replace this seal 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.640
 by a good seal from us 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.970
 so a casing we came to get dressed 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.900
 with walls 4 mm to make a 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.270
 perfect seal 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.100
 we took over of course all he had 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.660
 as filtration technique 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.970
 we adapt and therefore fund banks 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.740
 and skimmers at its current filtration 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.570
 or in filtration of the particular little 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.660
 since here we are on a lagooning 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.760
 made relatively important which one 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.590
 change and lava stone all four 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.560
 pretty much so that makes it possible to have 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.730
 a very clear water and then good but 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.860
 it's a bit of a system of 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.960
 personal filtration to the owners 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.870
 here it is so here it is really the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.340
 customer who handles this filtration this 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.830
 who asked us is to adapt 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.080
 in fact adapted our services to his needs 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.270
 and his need was the tightness 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.740
 so we did not respond perfectly and 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.900
 in times that are still 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.130
 relatively interesting compared to a 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.169
 resin solution 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.960
 besides it will be here now on a 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.690
 basin of about forty cubic meters 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.120
 good there are also planting bins 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.550
 which have been integrated so here was 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.550
 need is felt throughout the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.830
 installation phase so seeing her 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.630
 pond chained itself proud 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.190
 we asked ourselves questions with the 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.770
 client telling us is what we could 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.940
 not have water tanks so we 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.340
 could be immersed in the water of a 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.120
 some way to plant 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.950
 simply plants and so we 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.230
 implant in install anyway here 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.060
 at this customer bins on stilts 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.760
 so all in polyethylene 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.190
 that's it so is so good a 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.200
 special request it was actually the 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.630
 pumping chamber etc which is a small 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.100
 little particular who had who 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.230
 knew some worries before 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.270
 so the demand is to enlarge his and 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.850
 put the same system back in there 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.960
 so the idea is that there we are 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.940
 knows below the water level and we have 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.100
 infiltration areas that arrives from 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.770
 ground that is a bit higher so 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.270
 from a higher level and this client had 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.300
 two of the seepage water that was coming 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.520
 so in his filtration system 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.200
 we had to wait until they remove 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.730
 all his technique to come back 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.260
 a seal again but 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.630
 this time in the technical room 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.160
 that's it so ben here is all this 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.350
 works well a small blade of water 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.550
 thirty knocks I think we 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.770
 can talk about a true passionate 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.270
 it is a very very beautiful basin it is a 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.950
 Actually it is a haven of peace 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.020
 marseille it's really magical 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.580
 absolutely not only the beautiful basin 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.260
 but the landscaping of the garden is 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.690
 really beautiful I think we can 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.990
 congratulate 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.270
 congratulations to this gentleman 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.160
 actually because it's true that 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.130
 it's a place that's really they 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.020
 lends itself well to zen attitude on 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.090
 will say absolutely 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.960
 Well, here is another proof of fact 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.990
 if need be, with the help of 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.150
 do a lot of different things 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.650
 different possibilities every 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.750
 adaptations are possible 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.790
 always with the flexibility and the 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.550
 reactivity beneath plast one gets to 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.640
 really adapt our concept to the 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.110
 situation of each need is to 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.780
 find solutions that are really 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.040
 adapted here is ben youssef me I you 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.460
 thanks for making them visit 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.160
 this little haven of peace and then good 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.960
 will once again congratulate the 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.480
 owner who is also a little bit 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.760
 the creator of the garden here because he has 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.410
 really does something superb 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.830
 in a space that is still 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.090
 relatively small it must be said 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.400
 it's always harder to do 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.470
 something in a small garden that 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.540
 to do it in a big of course so 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.040
 alas is particularly very very 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.280
 successful with his integrations of 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.230
 terraces these stone wood mixtures 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.730
 and so on 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.820
 hat in the hat down it's really 

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.920
 very nice to be here and then good 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.280
 So here you have questions 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.160
 complementary or whatever it is to 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.290
 know more about phd and all 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.480
 the casing systems that basically under 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.600
 of plasma there is a website for its 

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.370
 still voices www for a bucket of water 

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.470
 place point view or contact us 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.550
 directly so will move will find 

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.650
 easily on the internet 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.120
 here is already on aquatic nobel there is a 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.800
 button under place I am looking for a 

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.630
 little bit in the pimples and found 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.740
 its easily it gives a direct link 

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.460
 square cheissoux 

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.620
 and then I'm good 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.740
 stay with us and as I always 

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:17.039
