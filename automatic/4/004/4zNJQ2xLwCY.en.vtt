00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
just a bit dark now this map or layout

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.680 
just a bit dark now this map or layout
is<00:00:34.719> supposed<00:00:35.140> to<00:00:35.289> resemble<00:00:35.649> a<00:00:36.010> city<00:00:36.489> in<00:00:36.760> Italy

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
is supposed to resemble a city in Italy

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.990 
is supposed to resemble a city in Italy
and<00:00:38.130> basically<00:00:39.130> you're<00:00:39.370> just<00:00:39.579> walking<00:00:39.730> around

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
and basically you're just walking around

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.270 
and basically you're just walking around
checking<00:00:40.480> out<00:00:40.750> how<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.140> engine<00:00:41.740> works<00:00:41.770> and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
checking out how the engine works and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.850 
checking out how the engine works and
how<00:00:42.370> fast<00:00:42.730> it<00:00:42.970> works<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.480> yeah<00:00:44.230> like<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:44.620> said

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
how fast it works and yeah like I said

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.069 
how fast it works and yeah like I said
it's<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.160> little<00:00:45.430> hard<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.970> see<00:00:46.239> so<00:00:46.720> what<00:00:46.960> they

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
it's a little hard to see so what they

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.080 
it's a little hard to see so what they
could<00:00:47.320> do<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.680> kind<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:47.980> brighten<00:00:48.430> up<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.790> game

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
could do is kind of brighten up the game

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.910 
could do is kind of brighten up the game
and<00:00:49.390> make<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.840> little<00:00:50.140> bit<00:00:50.260> nicer<00:00:50.710> because

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
and make it a little bit nicer because

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.790 
and make it a little bit nicer because
it<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.399> really<00:00:51.880> hard<00:00:52.210> to<00:00:52.300> see<00:00:52.600> here<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.170> even

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
it is really hard to see here and even

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.380 
it is really hard to see here and even
with<00:00:53.950> these<00:00:54.100> lights<00:00:54.489> sometimes<00:00:55.060> when<00:00:55.270> you're

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
with these lights sometimes when you're

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.240 
with these lights sometimes when you're
outside<00:00:55.810> like<00:00:56.140> in<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.380> blue<00:00:56.590> area<00:00:56.800> with<00:00:57.160> the

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
outside like in the blue area with the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.069 
outside like in the blue area with the
blue<00:00:57.460> skies<00:00:57.760> out<00:00:58.030> there<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:58.690> can<00:00:58.840> see<00:00:59.050> a

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
blue skies out there you can see a

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.690 
blue skies out there you can see a
little<00:00:59.320> bit<00:00:59.470> better<00:00:59.649> as<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.100> can<00:01:00.250> see<00:01:00.430> there's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
little bit better as you can see there's

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.910 
little bit better as you can see there's
a<00:01:00.790> grass<00:01:01.210> field<00:01:01.510> with<00:01:01.870> some<00:01:02.110> fences<00:01:02.649> right

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
a grass field with some fences right

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.950 
a grass field with some fences right
there<00:01:03.219> but<00:01:03.820> when<00:01:04.030> you're<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:04.420> here<00:01:04.750> it's

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
there but when you're in here it's

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.990 
there but when you're in here it's
almost<00:01:05.199> impossible<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.250> see<00:01:06.610> where<00:01:06.850> you're

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
almost impossible to see where you're

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.940 
almost impossible to see where you're
going<00:01:07.270> unless<00:01:07.600> you're<00:01:07.930> looking<00:01:08.259> really<00:01:08.680> close

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
going unless you're looking really close

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.670 
going unless you're looking really close
at<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.280> screen<00:01:09.640> now<00:01:10.330> what<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.600> do<00:01:10.720> like<00:01:11.110> even

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
at the screen now what I do like even

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.380 
at the screen now what I do like even
though<00:01:11.799> it's<00:01:11.830> really<00:01:12.310> easy<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.670> make<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.180> these

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
though it's really easy to make is these

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.960 
though it's really easy to make is these
reflections<00:01:13.930> on<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.530> floor<00:01:14.890> we<00:01:15.460> saw<00:01:15.760> these

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
reflections on the floor we saw these

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.030 
reflections on the floor we saw these
with<00:01:16.360> Epic<00:01:16.750> Citadel<00:01:16.990> as<00:01:17.409> well<00:01:17.650> what<00:01:17.920> they

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
with Epic Citadel as well what they

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.160 
with Epic Citadel as well what they
basically<00:01:18.250> do<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.850> just<00:01:19.120> mirror<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.600> image

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
basically do is just mirror the image

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.950 
basically do is just mirror the image
that's<00:01:20.470> up<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.250> put<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.060> on<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.630> floor

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
that's up here and put it on the floor

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.810 
that's up here and put it on the floor
behind<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.740> floor<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:24.220> just<00:01:24.340> kind<00:01:24.729> of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
behind the floor and just kind of

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.430 
behind the floor and just kind of
overlay<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.390> floor<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:25.810> that's<00:01:25.990> kind<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.229> easy

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
overlay the floor so that's kind of easy

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.310 
overlay the floor so that's kind of easy
but<00:01:26.740> people<00:01:26.770> seem<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.369> be<00:01:27.490> amazed<00:01:27.850> by<00:01:28.180> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
but people seem to be amazed by that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.750 
but people seem to be amazed by that
anyways<00:01:29.320> let's<00:01:29.560> go<00:01:29.680> back<00:01:29.860> outside<00:01:30.100> here<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
anyways let's go back outside here the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.030 
anyways let's go back outside here the
maps<00:01:30.970> not<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.690> big<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.290> loads<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.830> lot

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
maps not that big and it loads a lot

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.250 
maps not that big and it loads a lot
kind<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.549> takes<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.240> little<00:01:34.420> bit<00:01:34.570> too<00:01:34.810> long<00:01:35.020> to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
kind of takes a little bit too long to

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.010 
kind of takes a little bit too long to
load<00:01:35.470> but<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.189> is<00:01:36.340> also<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.850> big<00:01:37.390> layout<00:01:37.659> as<00:01:37.990> well

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
load but it is also a big layout as well

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.750 
load but it is also a big layout as well
as<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.710> can<00:01:38.830> see<00:01:38.890> we<00:01:39.220> see<00:01:39.400> a<00:01:39.430> nice<00:01:39.729> little

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
as you can see we see a nice little

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.510 
as you can see we see a nice little
statue<00:01:40.360> right<00:01:40.810> here<00:01:41.170> looks<00:01:41.650> really<00:01:41.770> great<00:01:42.340> the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
statue right here looks really great the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.780 
statue right here looks really great the
3d<00:01:42.939> graphics<00:01:43.450> are<00:01:43.630> just<00:01:43.659> pretty<00:01:44.350> crazy<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.189> if

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
3d graphics are just pretty crazy and if

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.670 
3d graphics are just pretty crazy and if
you<00:01:45.909> look<00:01:46.090> really<00:01:46.299> close<00:01:46.659> they<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:47.380> look

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
you look really close they just look

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.380 
you look really close they just look
like<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> game<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.460> would<00:01:48.580> be<00:01:48.700> on<00:01:48.850> consoles
