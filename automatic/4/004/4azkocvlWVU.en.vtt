aging and explain it's a disease most
people<00:00:04.830> think<00:00:04.980> it's<00:00:05.160> just<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.520> part<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.930> life<00:00:06.930> or

whether you call aging a disease or not

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.730 
whether you call aging a disease or not
depends<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.839> your<00:00:16.109> definition<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.680> word

intervention because what aging actually

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.660 
intervention because what aging actually

all of the diseases of old age

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.709 
all of the diseases of old age
so<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.520> collection<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> precursors<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.540> those

so the collection of precursors of those

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.540 
so the collection of precursors of those
diseases<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.040> reason<00:00:35.370> why<00:00:35.520> a

diseases if you like the reason why a
disease<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> disease<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.809> old<00:00:37.079> age<00:00:37.230> that

disease is a disease of old age that
doesn't<00:00:37.800> affect<00:00:37.980> young<00:00:38.190> adults<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.760> simply

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
doesn't affect young adults is simply

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 
doesn't affect young adults is simply
because<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.690> some<00:00:39.870> aspect<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.980> later

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
throughout life and that is aging aging

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
throughout life and that is aging aging
could<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.450> scarred<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.840> another<00:00:46.079> way<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.530> the

could be scarred in another way as the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
could be scarred in another way as the
accumulation<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.870> molecular<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:48.899> cellular

damage in the body damage which is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.630 
damage in the body damage which is
called<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.960> simple<00:00:52.469> side<00:00:52.770> effect<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.340> the

called a simple side effect of the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.119 
called a simple side effect of the
body's<00:00:53.910> normal<00:00:54.059> operation<00:00:54.800> which<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> body

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
body's normal operation which the body

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.830 
body's normal operation which the body
is<00:00:56.280> set<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.910> tolerate<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.360> certain<00:00:57.420> amount

is set up to tolerate a certain amount
of<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> why<00:00:58.710> aging<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.340> basically

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
of which is why aging is basically

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.279 
of which is why aging is basically
harmless<00:01:00.120> until<00:01:00.449> middle<00:01:00.719> age<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> little

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
harmless until middle age or a little

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.850 
harmless until middle age or a little
older<00:01:01.789> but<00:01:02.789> eventually<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:04.260> amount<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
older but eventually the amount of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.520 
older but eventually the amount of
damage<00:01:05.250> exceeds<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.119> threshold<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.990> our

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
damage exceeds the threshold that our

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
damage exceeds the threshold that our
body<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> set<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.189> tolerate<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.880> that's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
body is set up to tolerate and that's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.460 
body is set up to tolerate and that's
when<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> diseases<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.930> disabilities<00:01:10.049> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
all very much so what that means is that

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
all very much so what that means is that

the<00:01:26.100> problem<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.330> aging<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.930> really

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the problem is that aging is really

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.719 
the problem is that aging is really
complicated<00:01:28.409> there's<00:01:29.159> lots<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> things<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
complicated there's lots of things that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
complicated there's lots of things that
go<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:29.909> throughout<00:01:30.180> life<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:31.200> lead<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
go on throughout life and they lead to a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.380 
go on throughout life and they lead to a
vast<00:01:32.009> number<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.400> different<00:01:32.880> disabilities

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
vast number of different disabilities

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.810 
vast number of different disabilities
and<00:01:33.420> diseases<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> course<00:01:34.350> late<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.799> life<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and diseases of course late in life so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.980 
and diseases of course late in life so
the<00:01:36.000> question<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.360> how<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.750> actually

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the question is how can we actually

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
the question is how can we actually
tackle<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> moment<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> short

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
tackle this and at the moment the short

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.090 
tackle this and at the moment the short
answer<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.150> can't<00:01:39.390> at<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> moment<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
answer is we can't at the moment the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.469 
answer is we can't at the moment the
simple<00:01:41.549> interventions<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.299> have

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
simple interventions that we have

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.170 
simple interventions that we have
supplements<00:01:43.140> directly<00:01:43.640> regimes<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.000> on

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
supplements directly regimes and so on

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
supplements directly regimes and so on
can<00:01:45.659> only<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.439> small<00:01:46.560> amount<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
can only do a very small amount to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
can only do a very small amount to
postpone<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> ill<00:01:48.450> health<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.810> old<00:01:48.960> age

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
postpone the ill health of old age

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740 
postpone the ill health of old age
unless<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.159> course<00:01:50.189> you're<00:01:50.700> somehow<00:01:51.119> unlucky

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
unless of course you're somehow unlucky

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.810 
unless of course you're somehow unlucky
you<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:51.990> you're<00:01:52.170> aging<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.399> way<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you know you're aging in some way at a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.440 
you know you're aging in some way at a
particularly<00:01:54.240> rapid<00:01:54.930> rate<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.880> there

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
particularly rapid rate and then there

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.789 
particularly rapid rate and then there
are<00:01:57.479> things<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.439> somewhat

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
are things we can do that can somewhat

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.289 
are things we can do that can somewhat
normalize<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.520> rate<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.119> if<00:02:00.210> you're

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
normalize that rate but if you're

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.760 
normalize that rate but if you're
already<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.600> more<00:02:00.899> better<00:02:01.110> than<00:02:01.229> normal<00:02:01.619> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
already not more better than normal you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.249 
already not more better than normal you
if<00:02:01.890> you're<00:02:02.040> doing<00:02:02.159> wealthier<00:02:02.549> age<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
if you're doing wealthier age then the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.170 
if you're doing wealthier age then the
things<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.130> available<00:02:05.460> today<00:02:05.549> there's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
things that are available today there's

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.340 
things that are available today there's
no<00:02:06.329> evidence<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.079> really<00:02:07.259> do

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
no evidence that we can really do

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
no evidence that we can really do
anything<00:02:07.619> at<00:02:07.829> all<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.550> that's<00:02:08.759> why<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.479> need

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
anything at all so that's why we need

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.300 
anything at all so that's why we need
therapies<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.500> don't<00:02:10.649> yet<00:02:10.709> exist<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
therapies that don't yet exist and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.650 
therapies that don't yet exist and
that's<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.670> sounds<00:02:11.910> research<00:02:12.150> foundation

we're<00:02:13.739> working<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.340> developing<00:02:14.610> medicines

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
we're working on developing medicines

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.240 
we're working on developing medicines
that<00:02:15.540> really<00:02:15.840> well<00:02:16.049> tackle<00:02:16.439> aging<00:02:16.829> properly

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
that really well tackle aging properly

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.679 
that really well tackle aging properly
and<00:02:17.519> here's<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.000> big<00:02:18.150> thing<00:02:18.180> we're

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
and here's the big thing we're

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.270 
and here's the big thing we're
interested<00:02:19.079> in<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.290> medicines<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.010> don't

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
interested in it medicines that don't

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.240 
interested in it medicines that don't
merely<00:02:20.579> slow<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.810> clock<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.170> aging<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
merely slow down the clock of aging the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.860 
merely slow down the clock of aging the
accumulation<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:24.000> damage<00:02:24.269> they

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
accumulation of this damage they

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.240 
accumulation of this damage they
actually<00:02:25.230> repair<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.739> damage

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
actually repair the damage

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.520 
actually repair the damage
so<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.459> genuinely<00:02:26.909> rejuvenate<00:02:27.599> people<00:02:28.049> we

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
so they genuinely rejuvenate people we

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.509 
so they genuinely rejuvenate people we
will<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.769> able<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.980> take<00:02:29.129> people<00:02:29.250> who<00:02:29.459> are

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
will be able to take people who are

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.069 
will be able to take people who are
already<00:02:29.609> in<00:02:29.909> middle<00:02:30.150> age<00:02:30.239> or<00:02:30.420> older<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
already in middle age or older and

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.990 
already in middle age or older and
actually<00:02:31.680> fix<00:02:31.890> them<00:02:32.069> up<00:02:32.189> so<00:02:32.250> they<00:02:32.670> don't<00:02:32.909> know

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
actually fix them up so they don't know

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.819 
actually fix them up so they don't know
you<00:02:33.090> look<00:02:33.329> but<00:02:33.510> also<00:02:33.540> feel<00:02:34.079> and<00:02:34.349> function

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
you look but also feel and function

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.309 
you look but also feel and function
exactly<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> young<00:02:35.970> adult<00:02:36.090> as<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> result

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
exactly like a young adult as a result

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.780 
exactly like a young adult as a result
of<00:02:37.379> these<00:02:37.500> therapies<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.400> course<00:02:38.609> that

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
of these therapies and of course that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.369 
of these therapies and of course that
sort<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> therapy<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:40.019> be<00:02:40.140> applied

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
sort of therapy can be applied

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.929 
sort of therapy can be applied
periodically<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.250> there's<00:02:41.430> no<00:02:41.549> reason<00:02:41.909> for

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
periodically so there's no reason for

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.940 
periodically so there's no reason for
any<00:02:42.239> limit<00:02:42.569> on<00:02:42.659> how<00:02:42.810> long<00:02:42.870> one<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.409> stay<00:02:43.590> truly

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
any limit on how long one can stay truly

I<00:02:46.200> don't<00:02:46.920> think<00:02:47.069> they're<00:02:47.190> all<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.310> far<00:02:47.609> away

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
I don't think they're all that far away

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.420 
I don't think they're all that far away
I<00:02:48.120> think<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.440> at<00:02:49.560> least<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.889> 50/50

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
I think that we have at least a 50/50

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.119 
I think that we have at least a 50/50
chance<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:51.049> developing<00:02:52.049> truly<00:02:52.650> comprehensive

the cells we actually go into the cells

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.790 
the cells we actually go into the cells
and<00:04:59.820> restore<00:05:00.479> their<00:05:00.690> internal<00:05:01.169> structure<00:05:01.470> by

removing molecular garbage that they

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.390 
removing molecular garbage that they

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.159 
haven't been able to digest for example
and<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:06.060> can<00:05:06.180> also<00:05:06.330> happen<00:05:06.540> in<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.840> spaces

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
and that can also happen in the spaces

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.180 
and that can also happen in the spaces
between<00:05:07.200> cells<00:05:07.710> what<00:05:07.919> we<00:05:07.979> call<00:05:08.100> the

between cells what we call the
extracellular<00:05:08.580> space<00:05:09.200> then<00:05:10.200> those<00:05:10.500> things

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
extracellular space then those things

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.350 
extracellular space then those things
like<00:05:10.919> hypertension<00:05:11.130> which<00:05:11.820> are<00:05:11.970> caused<00:05:12.180> by

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.960 
like hypertension which are caused by
the<00:05:12.570> stiffening<00:05:13.320> of<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:14.340> extracellular
