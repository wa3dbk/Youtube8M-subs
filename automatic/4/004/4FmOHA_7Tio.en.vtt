I had to put a 45 by Street 45 with a
little<00:00:32.219> 2<00:00:32.339> inch<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:33.269> then<00:00:33.449> what<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:33.929

that's going to be my spray bar and then

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.540 
that's going to be my spray bar and then
I<00:01:28.440> had<00:01:29.420> had<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> basically<00:01:31.340> configure<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> like

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
there's my spray ball once I put my

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.620 
there's my spray ball once I put my
media<00:01:35.010> obviously<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.300> that's<00:01:36.450> the

media obviously you can see that's the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.460 
media obviously you can see that's the
inlet<00:01:37.020> pipe<00:01:37.260> right<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:38.900> 3/4<00:01:39.900> reduce<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.410> 1/2

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
inlet pipe right here 3/4 reduce to 1/2

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.100 
inlet pipe right here 3/4 reduce to 1/2
inch<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.150> use<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> 1<00:01:42.600> inch<00:01:42.780> green

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
inch and then they use the 1 inch green

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.550 
inch and then they use the 1 inch green
spout<00:01:44.030> with<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> shutoff<00:01:45.380> hopefully<00:01:46.380> that'll

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
spout with a shutoff hopefully that'll

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.940 
spout with a shutoff hopefully that'll
work<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.920> fine<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:48.500> I'm<00:01:49.500> gonna<00:01:49.650> start

through the tee here
flow<00:02:40.889> through<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.250> pipe<00:02:41.569> what<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.599> did<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:42.930> I

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
flow through this pipe what I did is I

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.089 
flow through this pipe what I did is I
took<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.909> two<00:02:44.909> inch<00:02:45.090> male<00:02:45.269> fitting<00:02:45.689> and<00:02:46.230> the

took a two inch male fitting and the
two-inch<00:02:47.400> male<00:02:47.609> fitting<00:02:48.530> dremeled<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.650> so

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
two-inch male fitting dremeled it so

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.589 
two-inch male fitting dremeled it so
that<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.189> looks<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.459> little<00:02:50.730> stout<00:02:50.970> the
