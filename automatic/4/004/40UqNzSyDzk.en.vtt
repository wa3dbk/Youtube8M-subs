today of people saying oh I just ill
can't<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.119> basically<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.810> think<00:00:30.990> what

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
can't do it so basically I think what

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.590 
can't do it so basically I think what
they're<00:00:31.410> doing<00:00:31.439> wrong<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> tutorial<00:00:33.480> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
they're doing wrong is in the tutorial I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
they're doing wrong is in the tutorial I
said<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.469> press<00:00:35.210> Y<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.899> Xbox<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.710> triangle<00:00:38.250> on

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
said to press Y on Xbox or triangle on

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.430 
said to press Y on Xbox or triangle on
ps3<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.540> call<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.020> killstreak

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
ps3 and then call in your killstreak

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
ps3 and then call in your killstreak
really<00:00:40.649> fast<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.250> you'll<00:00:41.700> get<00:00:41.850> an<00:00:41.969> animation

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
really fast and you'll get an animation

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.069 
really fast and you'll get an animation
like<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.760> they<00:00:44.760> thought<00:00:45.059> every<00:00:45.660> single

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
like this and they thought every single

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.479 
like this and they thought every single
time<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.320> did<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.039> would<00:00:47.160> over<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
time you did that it would over the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.000 
time you did that it would over the
shoulder<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.940> killcam<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
shoulder in killcam but that's not the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220 
shoulder in killcam but that's not the
case<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
case you have to you have to do that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.130 
case you have to you have to do that
animation<00:00:53.010> after<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.449> switch<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.050> your

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
animation after you switch to your

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380 
animation after you switch to your
sniper<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> pistol<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.000> something

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
sniper from like a pistol or something

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.389 
sniper from like a pistol or something
and<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:58.050> go<00:00:58.170> over<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> shoulder<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.100> kill

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and they go over the shoulder in kill

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.660 
and they go over the shoulder in kill
cam<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> penny<00:01:02.100> time<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.520> get

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
cam so if you have a penny time you get

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.490 
cam so if you have a penny time you get
that<00:01:02.879> animation<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.229> doing<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that animation like all I'm doing is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.230 
that animation like all I'm doing is
pressing<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:05.309> switching<00:01:05.729> weapons<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.119> now

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
pressing I'm switching weapons right now

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.420 
pressing I'm switching weapons right now
and<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.040> over<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and it's see how it's going over the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.300 
and it's see how it's going over the
shoulder<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> y+<00:01:10.470> killstreak<00:01:11.130> or

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
shoulder if you do the y+ killstreak or

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.429 
shoulder if you do the y+ killstreak or
