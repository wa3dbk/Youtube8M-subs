Hi! My name is Grzegorz Gliński and this are my teammates: Jakub Piętka and Daniel Kujawski.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.035
We are ambitious students form the Main School of Fire Service. 

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.000
This year we’re going to participate in the World Police and Fire Games.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.800
This event is located in Washington DC and nearby Fairfax at June in late June and early July, so it comes very quickly.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.700
As you know, such a trip reqiures a lot of financial support. 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.600
To encourage all of you – let’s see what we do!

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.600
Let’s go!

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.200
We need money especially for flight tickets, which are the biggest part of our budget.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.900
What’s more – we need to provide accomodation, food and sport gear.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.000
In exchange of your support we offer you excellent prizes: Main School of Fire Service gadget’s,               signed T-shirts and photos. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.695
As you can see – we practise not only on the basketball court,

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.300
so select your prize and let’s us fulfil our dreams!

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.900
GO AHEAD!!

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.355
Now you can see our casual life, our passion and everyday’s routine. 

00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:10.500
We hope that you will help us to make our dreams come true!

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.115
Everything is in your hands now!
