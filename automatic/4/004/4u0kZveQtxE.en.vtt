00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.019
 this legal view she 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.479
 by the borges market professor of biology at the time the student 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.189
 I came here to daladier you 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.050
 it is action several subjects that involve the vestibular of the area of ​​biology 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.689
 I chose now the theme is curious 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.900
 why will you say a little bit of adaptation to the floor of a very 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.179
 important 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.640
 in our lives in the life of all beings 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.870
 who are being watched over the planet 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.660
 that photosynthesis 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.070
 and adaptation of the cacti to live in a certain desert environment 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.690
 we say that there is something that is done in cases of less than zero because they 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.580
 they can 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.590
 is to save water 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.100
 I agree they have leaves turned into thorns in it 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.160
 stem then takes the photosynthetic function 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.600
 they go after roots that go to great depths to seek a 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.239
 little water exists 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.519
 in these environments 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.920
 ogier the water very scarce 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 and curiously in the same year that you get 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.350
 store the water inside the pt 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.390
 these morphological aspects are important 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.509
 more 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.509
 as important as that maybe a little more 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.270
 is to understand that the cacti make a photo so 13 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.479
 1 the different side 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.240
 that the seplan touch in a general way 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.750
 on leaf surface of the leaf epidermis 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.470
 there are structures that we think are the stomata are small 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.350
 organs, we can call it that. 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.349
 which allow the gas exchanges né the pentrita is the river - closed plant 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.060
 and through discounts I'm going to have fixing the co2 carbon 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.740
 to recompose 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 among substances that form early during photosynthesis 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.880
 it is also known that a plant 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.719
 she says that studies to fix her 2 and paid an expensive price 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.750
 out of them 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.780
 that the loss of water in large quantity 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.999
 by sweating is more expensive 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.189
 this excessive water loss 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.150
 until recently when the studios are open once the plant 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.360
 either by releasing more water 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.919
 than its ability to absorb 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.169
 she is forced to close her gesture partially or totally 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.359
 already for the seixal positions for a long time she may have died 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.779
 it will survive the part of its reserves 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.489
 because she can not take photosynthesis 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.920
 and see that the plants in a forest in an area of ​​cerrado in the caatinga 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.459
 these stops for months. 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.929
 they open the suggestions during the day 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.819
 since it is the moment I have light that can activate the chlorophyll to 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.109
 production of photosynthesis may occur and it is in this 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.479
 moment of the manager but just when I have to treat the highest 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.179
 transpiration consequently it 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.210
 At night the plants did their studies 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.139
 the cacti do different 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.520
 the shards make lots of money 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.209
 then we call field metabolism 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.060
 in Portuguese it would mark 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.870
 is the metabolism possession of neglect 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.619
 are the succulent plants 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.619
 what discards this factor they do is simple 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.819
 is the team from Santa Catarina overflows during the day it will die 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:29.419
 because he had lots of water so he could not bc the fools during the day 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.300
 most plants can not live in the desert 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.300
 This is one of the reasons why I could not 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.059
 the catheters have adapted to open their stomachs at night 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.850
 atmospheric co2 fiction 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.100
 converts co2 to a substance that can be stored which is the maximum 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.099
 currently vast magician 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.030
 stores this acid 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.590
 he drove leaves his histories and takes advantage of the light 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.820
 activate chlorophyll 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.650
 and promote the photosynthetic process 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.610
 at the time she needs the leased car to come from the co2 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.289
 she broke somalia 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:06.450
 and you can then 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.530
 to produce vehicles if no cup or physiological is mentioned then 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.580
 cacti would not get over violence I say that because many 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.990
 people know about traditional photosynthesis and these exceptions that are 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.070
 important adaptations need to be seen also because it is there that 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.360
 that issue that others do not the two issues that puts them there 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.160
 inside of nothing, ask that rock 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.720
 a big hug
