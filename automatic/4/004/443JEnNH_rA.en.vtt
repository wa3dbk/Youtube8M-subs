00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
nuclear with the five-seven on meltdown

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.040 
nuclear with the five-seven on meltdown
and<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.190> fact<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:37.910> he<00:00:38.059> was<00:00:38.150> able<00:00:38.239> to<00:00:38.390> use<00:00:38.930> the

and the fact that he was able to use the
five-seven<00:00:39.500> on<00:00:39.590> meltdown<00:00:39.920> is<00:00:40.100> kind<00:00:40.309> of

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
five-seven on meltdown is kind of

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.860 
five-seven on meltdown is kind of
surprising<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:41.000> me<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:41.120> mean<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:41.660> know<00:00:41.780> the

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
surprising to me I mean you know the

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.450 
surprising to me I mean you know the
pistils<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.290> black<00:00:42.470> ops<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:42.830> are<00:00:43.070> very

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
pistils and black ops you are very

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.920 
pistils and black ops you are very
overpowered<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.120> probably<00:00:44.390> understand<00:00:44.780> that

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
overpowered you probably understand that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.270 
overpowered you probably understand that
when<00:00:45.079> you<00:00:45.200> get<00:00:45.320> bodied<00:00:45.649> by<00:00:45.770> some<00:00:45.980> kid<00:00:46.129> with<00:00:46.219> a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
when you get bodied by some kid with a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.310 
when you get bodied by some kid with a
point<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.610> Katie<00:00:46.850> but<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:47.600> know<00:00:47.719> the

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
point to Katie but you know the

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.410 
point to Katie but you know the
five-seven<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.190> any<00:00:49.550> pistol<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:49.940> black<00:00:50.090> ops<00:00:50.270> 2

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
five-seven and any pistol in black ops 2

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.180 
five-seven and any pistol in black ops 2
is<00:00:50.600> not<00:00:50.780> meant<00:00:50.989> for<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.230> long<00:00:51.440> range<00:00:51.890> gunfights

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
is not meant for a long range gunfights

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.920 
is not meant for a long range gunfights
and<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.640> fact<00:00:52.820> that<00:00:52.940> it<00:00:53.120> meltdown<00:00:53.539> has<00:00:53.690> a<00:00:53.719> lot

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
and the fact that it meltdown has a lot

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.900 
and the fact that it meltdown has a lot
of<00:00:54.050> long<00:00:54.500> range<00:00:54.710> engagements<00:00:54.890> is<00:00:55.430> surprising

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
of long range engagements is surprising

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.520 
of long range engagements is surprising
that<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.390> know<00:00:56.480> remake<00:00:56.780> was<00:00:56.930> able<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.230> survive

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
that you know remake was able to survive

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.720 
that you know remake was able to survive
and<00:00:57.739> get<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.890> double<00:00:58.039> nuclear<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.610> that's

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
and get a double nuclear so that's

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.069 
and get a double nuclear so that's
pretty<00:00:58.910> awesome<00:00:58.969> if<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.420> guys<00:00:59.449> go<00:00:59.750> over<00:00:59.780> and
