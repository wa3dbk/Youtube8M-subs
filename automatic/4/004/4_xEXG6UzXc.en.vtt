for forcing their formula 1 we get a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.220 
for forcing their formula 1 we get a
complete<00:00:15.960> drivetrain<00:00:16.619> package<00:00:17.540> we<00:00:18.540> get<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
complete drivetrain package we get the

won<00:01:58.520> we<00:01:59.330> were<00:01:59.479> already<00:01:59.810> developing<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.650> vjm

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
won we were already developing the vjm

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.880 
won we were already developing the vjm
or<00:02:01.310> two<00:02:01.550> for<00:02:01.820> next<00:02:02.090> year<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.600> as<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.710> know

or two for next year and as you know
there<00:02:04.130> are<00:02:04.280> significant<00:02:04.970> rule<00:02:05.330> changes<00:02:05.960> that

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
there are significant rule changes that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.639 
there are significant rule changes that
will<00:02:06.380> apply<00:02:06.590> from<00:02:06.950> 2009<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.780> we<00:02:09.080> were<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.350> long

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
will apply from 2009 so we were a long

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.720 
will apply from 2009 so we were a long
way<00:02:09.860> down<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.940> road<00:02:11.150> we<00:02:11.510> have<00:02:11.540> our<00:02:12.050> own<00:02:12.730> 2009

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
way down the road we have our own 2009

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.449 
way down the road we have our own 2009
car<00:02:14.540> in<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.930> Windtunnel<00:02:15.500> already<00:02:15.890> undergoing

car in the Windtunnel already undergoing

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.090 
car in the Windtunnel already undergoing
testing<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.990> we<00:02:18.320> were<00:02:18.410> pretty<00:02:18.590> much<00:02:18.800> along<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
testing so we were pretty much along the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.199 
testing so we were pretty much along the
way<00:02:19.280> now<00:02:20.020> we<00:02:21.020> have<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.950> make<00:02:22.100> some<00:02:22.459> changes<00:02:22.700> to

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
way now we have to make some changes to

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.870 
way now we have to make some changes to
accommodate<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.610> Mercedes<00:02:25.610> McLaren

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880

development path and we hope to be a lot
more<00:02:36.200> competitive<00:02:36.709> in<00:02:36.860> 2009

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700

many<00:02:57.879> seasons<00:02:58.450> before<00:02:59.349> they<00:02:59.500> actually

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.380 
started winning races and championships
but<00:03:03.120> even<00:03:04.120> though<00:03:04.329> I<00:03:04.360> told<00:03:05.220> everyone<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.430> we

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.710 
but even though I told everyone that we
would<00:03:07.569> take<00:03:07.720> baby<00:03:08.049> steps<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.680> 2008<00:03:09.720> people

expected a lot more from us and so when

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.710

I<00:03:14.230> sat<00:03:14.590> back<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:14.890> did<00:03:15.459> some<00:03:15.489> introspection<00:03:16.000> I

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720

teams<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.389> think<00:05:04.419> have<00:05:05.110> realized<00:05:05.560> that<00:05:05.770> they

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
teams I think have realized that they

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.159 
teams I think have realized that they
need<00:05:06.099> to<00:05:06.210> support<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.419> help<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.930> small

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
need to support and help the small

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.260 
need to support and help the small

independent teams without which there

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.850 
independent teams without which there
isn't<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.690> complete<00:05:11.020> grid<00:05:11.639> and<00:05:12.639> I<00:05:13.000> think<00:05:13.240> that

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
isn't a complete grid and I think that
