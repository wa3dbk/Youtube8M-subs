Series for him to turn on his team
but<00:02:33.180> we<00:02:33.600> think<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:33.930> it'll<00:02:34.110> go<00:02:34.260> Randy<00:02:34.680> off<00:02:34.770> of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
but we think then it'll go Randy off of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800 
but we think then it'll go Randy off of
this<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.220> Sheamus<00:02:35.550> possibly<00:02:36.240> Elimination

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
this is Sheamus possibly Elimination

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.420 
this is Sheamus possibly Elimination
Chamber<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.380> think<00:02:37.950> he's<00:02:38.070> actually<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.370> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
Chamber I think he's actually on the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.630 
Chamber I think he's actually on the
poster<00:02:38.850> or<00:02:39.000> possibly<00:02:39.930> at<00:02:40.460> WrestleMania<00:02:41.460> so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
poster or possibly at WrestleMania so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.750 
poster or possibly at WrestleMania so
that'll<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:41.970> interesting<00:02:42.080> but<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.110> think<00:02:43.760> that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
that'll be interesting but I think that

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.880 
that'll be interesting but I think that
really<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.090> kind<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.050> put<00:02:46.200> Sheamus<00:02:46.440> down<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:46.830> I

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
really I kind of put Sheamus down but I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.040 
really I kind of put Sheamus down but I
can't<00:02:47.430> see<00:02:47.640> winning<00:02:47.940> twice<00:02:48.150> he<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> ask<00:02:48.810> on

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.320 
can't see winning twice he can I ask on
out<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.320> picture<00:02:49.710> but<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.610> think<00:02:51.210> they're

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
out of the picture but I think they're

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.820 
out of the picture but I think they're
setting<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.660> up<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.810> few<00:02:52.020> for<00:02:52.200> Sheamus<00:02:52.530> versus

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
setting you up a few for Sheamus versus

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.380 
setting you up a few for Sheamus versus
Randy<00:02:53.130> Orton<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.580> winning<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> Royal<00:02:54.240> Rumble

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080

think John Cena is definitely gonna win
this<00:05:58.199> match<00:05:58.259> at<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.650> Royal<00:05:58.680> Rumble<00:05:59.039> there<00:05:59.669> is

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
this match at the Royal Rumble there is

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.999 
this match at the Royal Rumble there is
no<00:05:59.969> question<00:06:00.360> I<00:06:00.539> just<00:06:01.139> think<00:06:01.349> I<00:06:01.409> can<00:06:01.680> just<00:06:01.800> feel

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
no question I just think I can just feel

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.149 
no question I just think I can just feel
it<00:06:02.070> I<00:06:02.340> mean<00:06:02.550> W<00:06:02.880> we<00:06:03.000> can<00:06:03.180> be<00:06:03.300> so<00:06:03.599> so<00:06:04.590> predictable

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
it I mean W we can be so so predictable

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.290 
it I mean W we can be so so predictable
I<00:06:05.280> think<00:06:05.460> they're<00:06:05.550> gonna<00:06:05.639> be<00:06:05.729> predictable

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
I think they're gonna be predictable

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.689 
I think they're gonna be predictable
again<00:06:06.630> John<00:06:07.110> Cena<00:06:07.139> wins<00:06:07.590> like<00:06:07.740> at<00:06:07.889> OE<00:06:08.009> but<00:06:08.580> this

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
again John Cena wins like at OE but this

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.219 
again John Cena wins like at OE but this
time<00:06:08.909> he's<00:06:09.030> going<00:06:09.150> to<00:06:09.210> come<00:06:09.330> in<00:06:09.419> number<00:06:09.780> one<00:06:09.990> I

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
time he's going to come in number one I

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.510 
time he's going to come in number one I
think<00:06:10.409> it's<00:06:10.530> gonna<00:06:10.620> be<00:06:10.770> a<00:06:10.800> low<00:06:10.979> entrant<00:06:11.370> at

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
think it's gonna be a low entrant at

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.850 
think it's gonna be a low entrant at
Windsor<00:06:11.820> if<00:06:11.969> it's<00:06:12.120> not<00:06:12.360> John<00:06:12.599> Cena<00:06:12.870> so<00:06:13.650> yeah

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
Windsor if it's not John Cena so yeah

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.920 
Windsor if it's not John Cena so yeah
that's<00:06:14.070> my<00:06:14.159> prediction<00:06:14.430> guys<00:06:14.909> I<00:06:15.210> also<00:06:15.599> think

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
that's my prediction guys I also think

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.980 
that's my prediction guys I also think
Ryback<00:06:16.469> will<00:06:17.400> get<00:06:17.610> a<00:06:17.639> faceoff<00:06:18.090> or<00:06:18.360> I<00:06:18.389> face<00:06:18.750> down

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
Ryback will get a faceoff or I face down

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.409 
Ryback will get a faceoff or I face down
with<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.199> shield<00:06:19.590> Ryker<00:06:20.250> Ryback<00:06:20.909> could

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
with the shield Ryker Ryback could

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:22.999 
with the shield Ryker Ryback could
possibly<00:06:21.900> win<00:06:22.199> Kane's

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
possibly win Kane's

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.310 
possibly win Kane's
record<00:06:23.550> of<00:06:23.729> eliminating<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.509> most<00:06:24.780> people<00:06:25.139> in

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
record of eliminating the most people in

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.719 
record of eliminating the most people in
a<00:06:25.409> Royal<00:06:25.620> Rumble<00:06:25.680> match<00:06:26.099> I<00:06:26.250> think<00:06:26.430> it<00:06:26.520> can

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
a Royal Rumble match I think it can

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.730 
a Royal Rumble match I think it can
calculate<00:06:27.150> it's<00:06:27.630> about<00:06:27.840> 12<00:06:28.229> people

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
calculate it's about 12 people

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.339 
calculate it's about 12 people
John<00:06:29.310> Cena<00:06:29.580> could<00:06:29.789> also<00:06:30.060> take<00:06:30.690> over<00:06:31.080> Rey

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
John Cena could also take over Rey

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.680 
John Cena could also take over Rey
Mysterio's<00:06:32.219> record<00:06:33.000> I've<00:06:33.180> been<00:06:33.479> in<00:06:33.599> the

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
Mysterio's record I've been in the

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.680 
Mysterio's record I've been in the
Rumble<00:06:34.229> match<00:06:34.259> for<00:06:34.949> an<00:06:35.009> hour<00:06:35.190> and<00:06:35.580> six<00:06:36.029> minutes

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
Rumble match for an hour and six minutes

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.079 
Rumble match for an hour and six minutes
so<00:06:37.050> these<00:06:37.620> two<00:06:38.039> would<00:06:38.639> be<00:06:38.820> kind<00:06:39.029> of

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.089 
so these two would be kind of

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:41.000 
so these two would be kind of
interesting<00:06:39.260> Ryback<00:06:40.260> to

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
interesting Ryback to

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.100 
interesting Ryback to
complete<00:06:41.850> or<00:06:42.060> make<00:06:42.450> a<00:06:42.480> new<00:06:42.750> record<00:06:42.960> for

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
complete or make a new record for

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.690 
complete or make a new record for
eliminating<00:06:43.560> the<00:06:43.860> most<00:06:44.040> people<00:06:44.340> because<00:06:44.550> he

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
eliminating the most people because he

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.130 
eliminating the most people because he
really<00:06:44.970> needs<00:06:45.000> to<00:06:45.240> keep<00:06:45.390> some<00:06:45.630> heat<00:06:45.810> as<00:06:45.930> well

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
really needs to keep some heat as well

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.170 
really needs to keep some heat as well
he's<00:06:46.620> kind<00:06:46.890> of<00:06:46.920> lost<00:06:47.070> a<00:06:47.220> bit<00:06:47.400> of<00:06:47.490> momentum<00:06:47.700> for

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
he's kind of lost a bit of momentum for

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.640 
he's kind of lost a bit of momentum for
the<00:06:48.270> last<00:06:48.480> few<00:06:48.630> days<00:06:48.780> he<00:06:48.960> was<00:06:49.050> on<00:06:49.230> main<00:06:49.380> event

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
the last few days he was on main event

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.560 
the last few days he was on main event
as<00:06:49.770> well<00:06:49.920> this<00:06:50.130> week<00:06:50.340> and<00:06:50.880> I<00:06:50.970> think<00:06:51.150> he<00:06:51.270> really

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
as well this week and I think he really

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.780 
as well this week and I think he really
needs<00:06:51.690> to<00:06:51.810> have<00:06:51.990> something<00:06:52.380> and<00:06:52.790> eliminating

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
needs to have something and eliminating

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.250 
needs to have something and eliminating
the<00:06:54.090> most<00:06:54.300> people<00:06:54.510> ever<00:06:54.750> in<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:54.990> Royal<00:06:55.200> Rumble
