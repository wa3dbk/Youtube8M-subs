00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello I am also today is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.969
 Monday and today we are going to make a dessert that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.860
 I already had a lot of desire for a long time 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.320
 teach them to do we are talking about 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.890
 my favorite Italian dessert and it's the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 Tiramisu is the perfect combination 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.109
 between chocolate between cheese and coffee 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.000
 that I love this combination of 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.980
 flavors all the ingredients are 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.280
 down here the information box and in 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.020
 my facebook tanita the ingredients of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.739
 Tiramisu labors that are very easy to 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.079
 get you know egg is chocolate cheese 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.910
 coffee is the only thing that could be 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.309
 get to complicate are these cookies 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.469
 which are called soletas and depending on 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 your region or country have a lot 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.120
 names this is called a mouthful of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.219
 prawns where the magma and are ideal for 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 this dessert because they are super hard but 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.870
 how are we going to soak them in the coffee 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 these are the ones we should use for this 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.949
 dessert and good so they do not put 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.360
 pretexts of years who against in the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.830
 I'm going to teach you how to make them 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.720
 for the solitos the first thing that we have 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.000
 What to do is to separate the whites from the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 buds the second step is to add the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 clear to the blender 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
 it does not matter if your blender is hand-held 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.979
 it can also be done perfect and let's go 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.259
 to add a quarter teaspoon of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.670
 cream tartar this they sell it in the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.830
 part of the super where all the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.530
 spices 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.530
 let's add half the sugar 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.890
 when we have a consistency like 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.270
 we are going to add little by little the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.270
 another part of sugar 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.960
 the yolk 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.560
 when it's meringue it's the firmest 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:01.259
 possible what they are going to do 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.259
 is to sift the flour little by little over 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.729
 first half and we're going to incorporate it 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.890
 with enveloping movements so as not 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.890
 get the air we just got 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.900
 to incorporate 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.600
 what they have to do is put the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.200
 mix in one sleeve and let's start 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.140
 do 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.670
 as dashes try to have them left 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.670
 the most Mexican couples 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.549
 and we're going to take this to the oven that 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.110
 it must be preheated to 160 degrees 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.110
 About 10 minutes 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.770
 to make the classic cream cheese 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.900
 tiramisu let's start in a bath 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.900
 Mary to put the whites 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.540
 and we are going to add half the sugar 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.120
 do not stop moving because if not here they go 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.120
 to make clear revolts ok 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.569
 this is to pasteurize or kill 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.380
 all the little bugs that the 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.390
 albumen 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.320
 when we notice that the sugar is already 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.150
 dissolved we are going to walk to the blender 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.150
 to finish riding 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:40.140
 and in the same way we can the buds with the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.080
 remaining sugar to bain- marie only 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.560
 we are going to bleach them a little bit 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.970
 we passed the buds and we continued beating 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.970
 about 5 minutes 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.040
 It has mascarpone cheese, which is a cheese 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.690
 creamy Italian that is sometimes difficult 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.910
 to get even in the part of 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.100
 super burnett so if not 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.560
 they get mascarpone cheese they can use 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.290
 what is believed 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.780
 when your egg mixture is fluffy 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.260
 are going to be adding little by little the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.260
 surprise 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.250
 the next thing is to beat whipping cream 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.250
 with a little sugar 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.180
 when your whipped cream is already well 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.610
 the firm will add to the mixture of 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.610
 cheese with egg so very 20 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.809
 let's soak our ballots in a 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:48.740
 coffee syrup so here I have the 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:52.479
 soluble coffee with sugar and I'm going to 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.479
 add a little hot water 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.149
 they can use espresso coffee from their 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:01.249
 favorite coffee shop or the nearest one that 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:03.770
 It is ideal but also with coffee 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.389
 soluble is quite good and we are going to 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.849
 add a touch of amaretto that is 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.770
 almond liqueur this obviously what 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.839
 can substitute for some other liquor 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.749
 that you like or just with coffee 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:16.759
 okay well and now if I have everything 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:19.759
 to start I have the cream cheese 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.050
 I have the hot coffee and the tickets and 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.999
 The first thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.620
 just start soaking the 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:31.490
 ballots about two seconds we submerge them 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.699
 and we are going to accommodate the mold has 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.700
 a plastic bieber car for what 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.890
 can unmold very easily 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.830
 when we collect our ballots what 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.290
 we look is something like this that remain 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.840
 soft on the outside but crispy 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.850
 inside once they have their first 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.330
 layer of well-arranged cookies 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.610
 let's put a little bit of cream 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.270
 of our delicious cream of cheese that 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.270
 we just did 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:05.439
 to continue we are going to sprinkle a 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.439
 little coconut on the entire surface 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.449
 and we start again with another layer of 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.090
 I used to 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.090
 let's finish with another layer of cheese 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.840
 once our layers are ready, we 're going to 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.890
 take to the freezer overnight or 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.890
 less for 8 hours 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:33.310
 and to dismantle it simply what 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.170
 we turn over our plate as he 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.750
 We put in plastic because it's the easiest 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.290
 of the world we are only going to withdraw the 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.290
 plastic 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.070
 is ready and to finish we are going to 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.290
 grate a little chocolate on top 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.650
 as he covered himself well very well with 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.580
 chocolate 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.580
 and now yes my favorite part 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.960
 and ready to enjoy I hope that from 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.730

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.560
