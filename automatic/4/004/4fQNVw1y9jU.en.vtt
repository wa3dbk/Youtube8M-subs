00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610 

now<00:00:00.149> that<00:00:00.329> I've<00:00:00.420> cut<00:00:00.719> my<00:00:00.900> corrugated<00:00:01.350> paper

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
now that I've cut my corrugated paper

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.800 
now that I've cut my corrugated paper
into<00:00:02.250> two<00:00:02.429> separate<00:00:02.879> pieces<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.510> want<00:00:03.720> to

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
into two separate pieces I want to

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.650 
into two separate pieces I want to
attach<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.650> magnifying<00:00:05.190> glass<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.390> end

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
attach the magnifying glass to the end

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.400 
attach the magnifying glass to the end
of<00:00:06.990> each<00:00:07.410> one<00:00:07.790> so<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.820> go<00:00:09.030> ahead<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.450> put<00:00:10.139> glue

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
of each one so I go ahead and put glue

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.549 
of each one so I go ahead and put glue
around<00:00:10.969> the<00:00:11.969> outside<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.019> magnifying

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
around the outside of the magnifying

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.310 
around the outside of the magnifying
glass<00:00:13.710> I'm<00:00:14.370> using<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.299> rubber<00:00:15.480> cement<00:00:15.719> glue<00:00:15.960> for

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
glass I'm using a rubber cement glue for

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.730 
glass I'm using a rubber cement glue for
this<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:20.359> put<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.420> nice<00:00:21.660> thick<00:00:21.930> coat<00:00:22.439> around

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
this I put a nice thick coat around

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.279 
this I put a nice thick coat around
because<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.880> magnifying<00:00:24.449> glass<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.199> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
because the magnifying glass is going to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.250 
because the magnifying glass is going to
be<00:00:25.439> turned<00:00:25.849> using<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> handle<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.599> that's

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
be turned using the handle and that's

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380 
be turned using the handle and that's
going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.769> used<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.070> focus<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.730> upside

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
going to be used to focus the upside

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.080 
going to be used to focus the upside
down<00:00:30.570> telescope<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.500> want<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> put<00:00:32.850> enough

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
down telescope so I want to put enough

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
down telescope so I want to put enough
glue<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.140> nice<00:00:34.380> solid<00:00:36.260> seal<00:00:37.260> around

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
glue to make a nice solid seal around

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.340 
glue to make a nice solid seal around
the<00:00:38.640> magnifying<00:00:39.149> glass<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.719> where<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.079> touches

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the magnifying glass to where it touches

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.430 
the magnifying glass to where it touches
the<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.280> paper<00:00:44.930> because<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> be

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the the paper because it's going to be

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
the the paper because it's going to be
handled<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> lot<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.450> want<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> make

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
handled a lot and I just want to make

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
handled a lot and I just want to make
sure<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> holds<00:00:49.410> nice<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.399> go<00:00:50.520> ahead

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
sure that it holds nice so I go ahead

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.459 
sure that it holds nice so I go ahead
and<00:00:50.850> put<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> edge<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and put it on to the edge of the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.850 
and put it on to the edge of the
corrugated<00:00:53.039> paper<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.989> start<00:00:55.320> rolling<00:00:55.739> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
corrugated paper and I start rolling it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.209 
corrugated paper and I start rolling it
around<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:57.719> edge<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> magnifying<00:00:58.859> glass

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
around the edge of the magnifying glass

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
around the edge of the magnifying glass
a<00:01:02.480> good<00:01:03.480> thing<00:01:03.600> about<00:01:03.660> rubber<00:01:03.930> cement<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
a good thing about rubber cement as it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.950 
a good thing about rubber cement as it
dries<00:01:04.769> pretty<00:01:04.799> quick<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.729> she'll<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.659> able<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
dries pretty quick so she'll be able to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.710 
dries pretty quick so she'll be able to
create<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> nice<00:01:07.439> seal<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.299> hold<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
create a nice seal and we hold it in

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200 
create a nice seal and we hold it in
place<00:01:09.869> now<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.350> paper<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> go

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
place now the paper is not going to go

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.640 
place now the paper is not going to go
around<00:01:12.540> where<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.080> handle<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
around where the handle of the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.010 
around where the handle of the
magnifying<00:01:14.189> glass<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.540> I'm<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> have

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
magnifying glass is so I'm going to have

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.120 
magnifying glass is so I'm going to have
to<00:01:16.140> make<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:17.210> snip<00:01:18.799> around<00:01:19.799> where<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to make a little snip around where the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.340 
to make a little snip around where the
handle<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.270> close<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.960> rest<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
handle is and then close the rest of the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
handle is and then close the rest of the
corrugated<00:01:22.650> paper<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> try<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.270> do

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
corrugated paper I'm going to try and do

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.530 
corrugated paper I'm going to try and do
that<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:24.659> close<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.350> possible<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.939> outside

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
that as close as possible to the outside

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630 
that as close as possible to the outside
of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> magnifying<00:01:28.200> glass<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.549> leave

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
of the magnifying glass so I don't leave

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.690 
of the magnifying glass so I don't leave
any<00:01:29.790> spaces<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.500> cut<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
any spaces and I just cut that that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
any spaces and I just cut that that
strip<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.259> hanging<00:01:34.500> on

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
strip which is going to be hanging on

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.069 
strip which is going to be hanging on
the<00:01:35.009> handle<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.299> magnifying<00:01:36.630> glass<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the handle of the magnifying glass and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.510 
the handle of the magnifying glass and
then<00:01:37.380> afterwards<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.070> ahead<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.340> cut

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
then afterwards I can go ahead and cut

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.310 
then afterwards I can go ahead and cut
it<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> should<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.479> able<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> close<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it but now I should be able to close the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
it but now I should be able to close the
rest<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.680> corrugated<00:01:41.189> paper<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.759> make<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
rest of the corrugated paper and make a

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.899 
rest of the corrugated paper and make a
seal<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.470> go<00:01:43.619> ahead<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.860> put<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> glue<00:01:44.579> back

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
seal so I go ahead and put the glue back

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.670 
seal so I go ahead and put the glue back
onto<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> edge<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> corrugated<00:01:46.439> paper

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
onto the edge of the corrugated paper

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.060 
onto the edge of the corrugated paper
and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:48.000> I'm<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> close<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.070> still

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and then I'm going to close it still

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
and then I'm going to close it still
holding<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> edge<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> magnifying

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
holding on to the edge of the magnifying

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.960 
holding on to the edge of the magnifying
glass<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.759> be

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
glass so I know that it's going to be

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.679 
glass so I know that it's going to be
creating<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.960> nice<00:01:55.189> tight<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.520> also<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> strait

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
creating a nice tight and also a strait

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.319 
creating a nice tight and also a strait
seal<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.469> want<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> corrugated<00:01:59.790> paper<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.210> make

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
seal I want the corrugated paper to make

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.550 
seal I want the corrugated paper to make
a<00:02:00.409> even<00:02:01.579> even<00:02:02.579> size<00:02:02.820> tube<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:04.170> make<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
a even even size tube to make up the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
a even even size tube to make up the
body<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> telescope<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.630> hold<00:02:06.840> on

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
body of the telescope so I just hold on

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.839 
body of the telescope so I just hold on
to<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> edge<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.280> magnifying<00:02:08.759> glass

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
to the edge of the the magnifying glass

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.750 
to the edge of the the magnifying glass
and<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.629> my<00:02:09.780> guide

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
and that will be my guide

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.060 
and that will be my guide
and<00:02:11.760> then<00:02:12.240> once<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.750> done<00:02:12.870> you'll<00:02:13.380> have<00:02:13.590> your

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
and then once it's done you'll have your

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.730 
and then once it's done you'll have your
first<00:02:14.640> tube<00:02:15.030> with<00:02:15.780> one<00:02:16.050> side<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
first tube with one side of the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.460 
first tube with one side of the
magnifying<00:02:17.040> glass<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.450> end<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.200> we'll<00:02:19.380> be

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
magnifying glass on the end and we'll be

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
magnifying glass on the end and we'll be
ready<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.800> make<00:02:19.920> our<00:02:20.070> second<00:02:20.520> tube<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.000> that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
ready to make our second tube and that

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.390 
ready to make our second tube and that
will<00:02:21.690> actually<00:02:21.870> go<00:02:22.170> over<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.530> first<00:02:22.860> one<00:02:23.100> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
will actually go over the first one and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.090 
will actually go over the first one and
that<00:02:24.240> will<00:02:24.330> also<00:02:24.600> have<00:02:25.140> its<00:02:25.320> own<00:02:25.500> magnifying

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that will also have its own magnifying

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.430 
that will also have its own magnifying
glass<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.580> its<00:02:26.760> end<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.180> therefore<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.290> can

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
glass on its end and therefore we can

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.710 
glass on its end and therefore we can
move<00:02:28.560> them<00:02:28.770> back<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.010> forth<00:02:29.330> one<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.480> top<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
move them back and forth one on top of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.260 
move them back and forth one on top of
the<00:02:30.870> other<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.440> we'll<00:02:32.250> be<00:02:32.370> able<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.610> use<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:33.240> to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the other and we'll be able to use it to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.430 
the other and we'll be able to use it to
focus<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.050> an<00:02:34.200> image<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.020> I've<00:02:37.170> shown<00:02:37.200> you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
focus on an image so now I've shown you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.810 
focus on an image so now I've shown you
how<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:38.660> attach<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.020> corrugated<00:02:40.740> paper<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
how to attach the corrugated paper to

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.640 
how to attach the corrugated paper to
the<00:02:41.910> magnifying<00:02:42.450> glass<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.810> create<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the magnifying glass and create the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.650 
the magnifying glass and create the
first<00:02:44.250> tube<00:02:44.850> that's<00:02:45.120> going<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> make<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.630> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
first tube that's going to make up the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.540 
first tube that's going to make up the
body<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.140> our<00:02:46.200> telescope<00:02:46.800> our<00:02:46.950> upside<00:02:47.370> down

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
body of our telescope our upside down
