00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
they're basically a little smaller

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.890 
they're basically a little smaller
because<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.820> new<00:00:27.000> design<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> Xbox

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900

one<00:00:28.260> thumb<00:00:29.010> sticks<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> new<00:00:29.609> controller

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
one thumb sticks on the new controller

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
one thumb sticks on the new controller
but<00:00:31.679> these<00:00:32.160> are<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.610> first<00:00:32.940> control<00:00:33.300> freaks

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
but these are the first control freaks

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
but these are the first control freaks
that<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:33.840> all<00:00:34.050> white<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.770> they're<00:00:34.860> pretty

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
that are all white so they're pretty

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
that are all white so they're pretty
cool<00:00:35.489> nice<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> white<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.809> probably<00:00:37.110> won't

cool nice and white you probably won't

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720 
cool nice and white you probably won't
lose<00:00:37.530> them<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.920> drop<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> floor

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
lose them if you drop it on the floor

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.750 
lose them if you drop it on the floor
cuz<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.270> won't<00:00:39.629> blend<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.410> anything

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
cuz they won't blend in with anything

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
something um and the top grip design for
this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> inspired<00:00:47.730> by<00:00:47.850> Call<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> Duty<00:00:48.570> ghosts

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
so it's a really cool design on the top

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
so it's a really cool design on the top
pretty<00:00:53.190> good<00:00:53.399> grip<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.760> feel<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> the

previous control freaks I've had have
had<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> better<00:00:57.000> grip<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.260> also<00:00:58.469> with

these you don't get that rigid outer
ring<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.059> built-in<00:01:04.640> sticks

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
on the Xbox one controller but overall

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
on the Xbox one controller but overall
these<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.920> great<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.760> really<00:01:11.970> don't

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
on the 360 I'm talking about the grip on

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.590 
on the 360 I'm talking about the grip on

the ring and after a while the control

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.210 
the ring and after a while the control
freak<00:01:18.810> tops<00:01:19.080> they<00:01:19.380> probably<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.799> wear<00:01:19.979> down

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
freak tops they probably will wear down

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
freak tops they probably will wear down
if<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> use<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> lot<00:01:21.530> but<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> pretty<00:01:22.799> much

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
if you use them a lot but I pretty much

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.649 
if you use them a lot but I pretty much
only<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.340> them<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.580> I'm<00:01:23.640> playing<00:01:23.790> FPS<00:01:24.330> games

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
only use them when I'm playing FPS games

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.080 
only use them when I'm playing FPS games
like<00:01:24.900> Battlefield<00:01:25.110> 4<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:26.070> called<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> ghost

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
like Battlefield 4 or called it a ghost

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600 
like Battlefield 4 or called it a ghost
right<00:01:27.390> now<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:28.470> I'm<00:01:28.560> playing<00:01:28.740> Fifa<00:01:29.130> 2k<00:01:29.579> I

right now but I'm playing Fifa 2k I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.770 
right now but I'm playing Fifa 2k I
usually<00:01:29.909> take<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> off<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.659> don't

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
usually take it off because I don't

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.929 
usually take it off because I don't
really<00:01:30.869> feel<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.290> needed<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.680> those<00:01:32.040> but

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
really feel it's needed for those but

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.310 
really feel it's needed for those but
what<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.119> does<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.479> you're<00:01:33.720> unaware<00:01:33.960> about

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
what it does if you're unaware about

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.310 
what it does if you're unaware about
control<00:01:34.650> freaks<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:36.030> stick<00:01:36.270> them<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:37.079> your

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
control freaks you stick them on to your

thumb sticks either left right or both I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800 
thumb sticks either left right or both I
only<00:01:40.409> put<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.509> because<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
only put it on the right because that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.700 
only put it on the right because that
really<00:01:43.110> allows<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.280> prime<00:01:45.710> superior

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
really allows for prime superior

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
really allows for prime superior
accuracy<00:01:47.460> when<00:01:47.640> aiming<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.119> sights<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
accuracy when aiming down the sights and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.200 
accuracy when aiming down the sights and
trying<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.140> maneuver<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:50.009> crosshairs<00:01:50.640> while

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
trying to maneuver your crosshairs while

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.460 
trying to maneuver your crosshairs while
on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> left<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.049> need<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
on the left you don't really need it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.600 
on the left you don't really need it
because<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.040> left<00:01:53.280> stick<00:01:53.430> it's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
because you're on the left stick it's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.730 
because you're on the left stick it's
just<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.909> movement<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.570> most<00:01:54.810> FPS<00:01:55.259> games<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
just for movement in most FPS games and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.410 
just for movement in most FPS games and
it's<00:01:56.130> pretty<00:01:56.369> broad<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.060> don't<00:01:57.270> really

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it's pretty broad so you don't really

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.109 
it's pretty broad so you don't really
need<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:58.040> lock<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.310> down<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.909> laser

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
need to lock that down to laser

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.530 
need to lock that down to laser
precision<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:02.189> what<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.729> does<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> extends

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
precision but what it does it extends

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.300 
precision but what it does it extends
your<00:02:03.630> range<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.079> motion<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> joysticks
