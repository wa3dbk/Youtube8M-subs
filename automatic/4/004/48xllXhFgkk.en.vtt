00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.630
 hello so here but already made reviews 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.250
 here 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.220
 review of phones of own functions 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.599
 all 5 30 forgot to do today 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.759
 correct non-admission 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.559
 but so let's get started 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.810
 as you can see the media enviable two keys 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.380
 if you click on the first one 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.989
 then we can dial the number 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.769
 or see store about contacts vitya 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.099
 contextually suggested 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.259
 and in the second the second one gives away 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.730
 contacts not only 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.080
 quite an interesting game is natural that 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.990
 such scrolling development actions 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.250
 by groups 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.720
 quite an interesting thing 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.950
 search here is it interactive 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.450
 getting from the letter he gradually us 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.850
 reduces great 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.510
 the number of options and accordingly 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.730
 very convenient to use it 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.700
 but what about contacts and so 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.950
 let's and perfection but how 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.950
 it all looks 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
 the call went 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.130
 how do you see the struggle depriving the conco 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.420
 worked 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.900
 is displayed 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.340
 you can turn on the head loudspeakers 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.710
 that is, there is a speakerphone 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 but that's all 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.259
 the Greeks but it's all principle happy 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.300
 standard 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.050
 so breeding if the opposite goes to 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.740
 Odessa call 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 everything came down to make 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.660
 and we see the following 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.740
 a year we can get out of two 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.100
 chambers of funds 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 In this regard, fight the keys 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.990
 in general to get but again to 35 30 it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.940
 smartphone 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.750
 and so we can write 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.620
 several programs that dramatically 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.990
 extends functionality 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.580
 so let's get these programs right away 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.140
 I want to say that such programs 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.379
 several types I will show exactly 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.289
 troop representative sandbox 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.609
 what it is 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.679
 this program is an answering machine 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:18.099
 we turn it on click hide 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.099
 and so we do, so I go out 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.249
 now i'm calling this phone 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.249
 from another phone so 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
 Here I call them 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.829
 Well, that's actually the whole point in the message 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 that's all 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.299
 it hopes for observance because they 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.099
 new voice messages 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.319
 offer 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.599
 look 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.399
 but let's see it 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.329
 choose it 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.099
 wg 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.459
 So 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.089
 if we see it adds completely in principle 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.859
 answering machine triggered 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.769
 so as for the answering machine 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.099
 we quit for this application 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.259
 besides the whole yam river we can still 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.099
 commit such a kind of espionage into action 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.089
 write down 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.769
 actually the conversation itself 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.909
 For this we in paradise program Oleg regiments 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.999
 we hide your programs for your old man 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.929
 see here a small appears below 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:45.879
 even voice recorder pe 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.879
 shown and zabanova kostuseva him again 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.919

 we start talking there and 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.070
 well here in general 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.070
 it is this work 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.339
 breeding 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.109
 we walk the same recorder 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.819
 and here he offers us wiretaps 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.849
 m m 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.820
 as I understand it 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.749
 the conclusion that the fighter just 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.269
 arises from the fact that I am telling the truth two 

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:40.199
 phone along with the collected 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.389
