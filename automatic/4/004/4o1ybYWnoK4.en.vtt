00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
so what we can do is invoke Quicksilver

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.840 
so what we can do is invoke Quicksilver
control<00:00:32.720> space<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.470> now<00:00:33.949> we're<00:00:34.160> going<00:00:34.280> to<00:00:34.370> hit

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
control space and now we're going to hit

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.200 
control space and now we're going to hit
the<00:00:35.120> period<00:00:35.690> key<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.880> this<00:00:37.880> is<00:00:37.969> where<00:00:38.090> we're

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
the period key and this is where we're

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.280 
the period key and this is where we're
going<00:00:38.329> to<00:00:38.390> start<00:00:38.510> typing<00:00:38.840> whatever<00:00:39.140> our

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
going to start typing whatever our

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.560 
going to start typing whatever our
reminder<00:00:39.770> is<00:00:40.420> put<00:00:41.420> clothes<00:00:41.960> in<00:00:42.440> dryer<00:00:43.059> okay<00:00:44.059> so

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
reminder is put clothes in dryer okay so

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
reminder is put clothes in dryer okay so
now<00:00:45.640> if<00:00:46.640> we<00:00:47.090> hit<00:00:47.329> enter<00:00:47.540> it's<00:00:47.960> going<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.320> do

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
now if we hit enter it's going to do

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.619 
now if we hit enter it's going to do
whatever<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:49.399> is<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.820> right<00:00:50.000> right<00:00:50.510> hand

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
whatever it is on the right right hand

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.660 
whatever it is on the right right hand
side<00:00:50.899> of<00:00:51.079> Quicksilver<00:00:51.590> which<00:00:51.770> is<00:00:52.010> large<00:00:52.280> type

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
side of Quicksilver which is large type

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.639 
side of Quicksilver which is large type
so<00:00:52.969> if<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:53.120> hit<00:00:53.210> enter<00:00:53.450> it's<00:00:53.899> just<00:00:54.469> going<00:00:54.590> to

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
so if we hit enter it's just going to

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.279 
so if we hit enter it's just going to
show<00:00:54.860> this<00:00:55.039> up<00:00:55.309> on<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.180> screen<00:00:56.510> not

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
show this up on the screen not

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.610 
show this up on the screen not
particularly<00:00:57.770> useful<00:00:58.250> but<00:00:58.910> if<00:00:59.360> we<00:01:00.230> try<00:01:00.469> that

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
particularly useful but if we try that

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.810 
particularly useful but if we try that
again<00:01:01.090> put<00:01:02.090> clothes<00:01:02.359> in<00:01:02.510> dryer<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:04.489> then<00:01:04.640> hit

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
again put clothes in dryer and then hit

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.359 
again put clothes in dryer and then hit
tab<00:01:05.030> again<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:05.810> now<00:01:06.259> we<00:01:06.320> hold<00:01:06.770> control<00:01:07.340> and

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
tab again and now we hold control and

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.789 
tab again and now we hold control and
hit<00:01:07.909> enter<00:01:08.180> we'll<00:01:09.020> get<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.170> whole<00:01:09.439> different

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
hit enter we'll get a whole different

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.679 
hit enter we'll get a whole different
set<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.040> options<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.760> this<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.420> where<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
set of options and this is where the

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.859 
set of options and this is where the
power<00:01:11.869> is<00:01:12.610> so<00:01:13.610> we're<00:01:13.790> going<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.000> do<00:01:14.210> run<00:01:14.479> after

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
power is so we're going to do run after

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.340 
power is so we're going to do run after
delay<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:16.520> I'm<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:17.540> using<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.020> down<00:01:18.170> arrow

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
delay so I'm just using the down arrow

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.289 
delay so I'm just using the down arrow
to<00:01:18.470> select<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.549> then<00:01:19.640> I'm<00:01:19.850> hitting<00:01:20.060> tab

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
to select it and then I'm hitting tab

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.630 
to select it and then I'm hitting tab
again<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.840> switch<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.380> third<00:01:21.650> pain<00:01:22.310> of

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
again to switch to the third pain of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.090 
again to switch to the third pain of
Quicksilver<00:01:23.210> which<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:23.900> basically<00:01:24.799> like<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
Quicksilver which is basically like the

end of the line for Quicksilver and here

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.260 
end of the line for Quicksilver and here
you<00:01:29.090> know<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.270> could<00:01:29.570> type<00:01:29.750> 25<00:01:30.680> m<00:01:31.130> for<00:01:31.909> 25

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
you know you could type 25 m for 25

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.999 
you know you could type 25 m for 25
minutes<00:01:32.509> but<00:01:33.229> in<00:01:33.320> this<00:01:33.409> case<00:01:33.590> we're<00:01:33.860> just

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009

hit enter and now in a couple of seconds

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.499 
hit enter and now in a couple of seconds
we're<00:01:39.229> going<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.439> that<00:01:40.400> that<00:01:40.909> box<00:01:41.119> is<00:01:41.270> going<00:01:41.450> to

specific<00:06:48.820> as<00:06:49.360> you<00:06:49.690> want<00:06:50.050> as<00:06:50.230> you<00:06:50.410> want<00:06:50.620> it<00:06:50.800> to

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
specific as you want as you want it to

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.710 
specific as you want as you want it to
be<00:06:51.190> yeah<00:06:52.110> so<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.380> mean<00:06:53.530> that's<00:06:53.910> pretty<00:06:54.910> much<00:06:55.150> the

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
be yeah so I mean that's pretty much the

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.900 
be yeah so I mean that's pretty much the
basics<00:06:56.410> of<00:06:56.530> using<00:06:56.590> Quicksilver<00:06:57.460> and<00:06:57.490> maybe

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
basics of using Quicksilver and maybe

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.510 
basics of using Quicksilver and maybe
even<00:06:58.090> a<00:06:58.300> little<00:06:58.330> bit<00:06:58.570> yeah<00:06:59.500> advanced<00:07:00.100> yeah

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
even a little bit yeah advanced yeah

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.160 
even a little bit yeah advanced yeah
because<00:07:00.640> I<00:07:00.820> wasn't<00:07:01.030> easy<00:07:01.240> to<00:07:01.630> do<00:07:01.750> any<00:07:01.930> of<00:07:02.050> those

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170 
because I wasn't easy to do any of those

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.230 
because I wasn't easy to do any of those
things<00:07:02.230> right<00:07:02.620> yeah<00:07:03.220> I<00:07:03.550> mean<00:07:03.640> unfortunately

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
things right yeah I mean unfortunately

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.390 
things right yeah I mean unfortunately
it<00:07:04.810> looks<00:07:04.870> like<00:07:05.170> the<00:07:05.470> triggers<00:07:08.100> yeah<00:07:09.100> it<00:07:09.220> looks

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 
it looks like the triggers yeah it looks

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.440 
it looks like the triggers yeah it looks
like<00:07:09.460> the<00:07:09.760> triggers<00:07:11.760> part<00:07:12.760> of<00:07:12.850> the<00:07:12.910> program<00:07:13.270> is

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.450 
like the triggers part of the program is

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.270 
like the triggers part of the program is
just<00:07:13.690> like<00:07:13.900> not<00:07:14.110> working<00:07:14.470> right<00:07:14.500> now<00:07:14.680> so<00:07:15.100> maybe
