00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
in the program as well and I think also

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.949 
in the program as well and I think also
it's<00:02:37.790> important<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.209> note<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.660> sort<00:02:38.870> of

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
it's important to note this sort of

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.300 
it's important to note this sort of
double<00:02:39.260> standard<00:02:39.680> right<00:02:39.830> i<00:02:39.860> wonder<00:02:40.190> how

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
double standard right i wonder how

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.309 
double standard right i wonder how
people<00:02:40.610> would<00:02:40.730> react<00:02:41.090> if<00:02:41.300> kids<00:02:41.930> were<00:02:42.080> instead

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
right but one thing I was thinking about

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.650 
right but one thing I was thinking about
though<00:04:39.650> is<00:04:39.680> that<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:40.300> don't<00:04:41.300> know<00:04:41.390> that<00:04:41.540> I<00:04:41.570> can

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
though is that I don't know that I can

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.120 
though is that I don't know that I can
trust<00:04:41.780> all<00:04:42.230> parents<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.740> make<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.980> right

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
trust all parents to make the right

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.560 
trust all parents to make the right
decisions<00:04:43.550> I'm<00:04:43.760> for<00:04:44.000> their<00:04:44.150> children<00:04:44.450> and

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
decisions I'm for their children and

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.730 
decisions I'm for their children and
also<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.900> make<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.110> right<00:04:45.200> decisions<00:04:45.560> for<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
also to make the right decisions for the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.710 
also to make the right decisions for the
country<00:04:46.040> as<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.160> whole<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.640> our<00:04:46.910> kids<00:04:47.450> are

country as a whole and our kids are
suffering<00:04:48.230> in<00:04:48.650> education<00:04:49.190> as<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.430> is<00:04:49.550> already

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
suffering in education as it is already

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.120 
suffering in education as it is already
our<00:04:50.120> educational<00:04:50.720> systems<00:04:51.080> are<00:04:51.200> failing<00:04:51.470> so

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
our educational systems are failing so

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.620 
our educational systems are failing so
to<00:04:52.190> say<00:04:52.460> we're<00:04:52.610> going<00:04:52.730> to<00:04:52.790> take<00:04:53.030> students<00:04:53.480> out

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
to say we're going to take students out

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.370 
to say we're going to take students out
and<00:04:54.400> let<00:04:55.400> let<00:04:55.880> them<00:04:56.060> get<00:04:56.210> fewer<00:04:56.630> hours<00:04:56.930> even

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
and let let them get fewer hours even

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.660 
and let let them get fewer hours even
though<00:04:57.560> we're<00:04:57.710> not<00:04:57.740> even<00:04:58.130> competing<00:04:58.430> with

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
though we're not even competing with

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.220 
though we're not even competing with
other<00:04:58.820> countries<00:04:59.060> right<00:04:59.570> in<00:04:59.720> terms<00:04:59.840> of<00:04:59.990> number

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
other countries right in terms of number

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.900 
other countries right in terms of number
of<00:05:00.320> hours<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.620> kids<00:05:00.890> get<00:05:01.040> i<00:05:01.100> think<00:05:01.370> is<00:05:01.460> it's

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
of hours that kids get i think is it's

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.870 
of hours that kids get i think is it's
completely<00:05:02.680> irresponsible<00:05:03.680> on<00:05:04.520> parents

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
completely irresponsible on parents

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.000 
completely irresponsible on parents
fight<00:05:05.000> so<00:05:05.150> I<00:05:05.180> don't<00:05:05.420> necessarily<00:05:05.510> feel<00:05:06.170> that

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
fight so I don't necessarily feel that

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.440 
fight so I don't necessarily feel that
you<00:05:07.520> know<00:05:07.640> parents<00:05:07.940> should<00:05:08.030> have<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.180> right<00:05:08.300> to

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
you know parents should have a right to

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.670 
you know parents should have a right to
do<00:05:08.540> that<00:05:08.570> just<00:05:08.900> in<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.110> same<00:05:09.260> way<00:05:09.320> that

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
do that just in the same way that

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.260 
do that just in the same way that
parents<00:05:10.100> don't<00:05:10.430> necessarily<00:05:10.880> have<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.030> right

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
parents don't necessarily have the right

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.760 
parents don't necessarily have the right
to<00:05:11.390> say<00:05:11.510> my<00:05:11.660> kids<00:05:11.870> not<00:05:11.990> going<00:05:12.140> to<00:05:12.200> be<00:05:12.260> educated

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
to say my kids not going to be educated

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.020 
to say my kids not going to be educated
if<00:05:12.860> your<00:05:12.980> kid<00:05:13.100> doesn't<00:05:13.280> go<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.490> school<00:05:13.820> or<00:05:13.970> have

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
if your kid doesn't go to school or have

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.660 
if your kid doesn't go to school or have
some<00:05:14.210> educational<00:05:14.720> instruction<00:05:15.320> then<00:05:16.100> you<00:05:16.520> as

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
some educational instruction then you as

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.300 
some educational instruction then you as
a<00:05:16.700> parent<00:05:16.970> can<00:05:17.330> be<00:05:17.480> you<00:05:17.990> know<00:05:18.020> slap<00:05:19.010> for<00:05:19.220> that

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
a parent can be you know slap for that

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.040 
a parent can be you know slap for that
you<00:05:19.400> can<00:05:19.550> potentially<00:05:20.090> serve<00:05:20.390> some<00:05:20.630> you<00:05:21.020> know

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
you can potentially serve some you know

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.410 
you can potentially serve some you know
jail<00:05:21.440> time<00:05:21.680> or<00:05:21.980> be<00:05:22.160> penalized<00:05:22.760> sins<00:05:23.090> like<00:05:23.270> that

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
jail time or be penalized sins like that

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.480 
jail time or be penalized sins like that
so<00:05:23.570> I<00:05:23.600> think<00:05:23.690> this<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.470> sort<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.800> in<00:05:24.980> line<00:05:25.250> with

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
so I think this is sort of in line with

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.460 
so I think this is sort of in line with
that<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:25.820> if<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.210> are<00:05:26.240> keeping<00:05:27.080> your<00:05:27.230> child

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
that that if you are keeping your child

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.530 
that that if you are keeping your child
from<00:05:27.650> getting<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:28.010> well-rounded<00:05:28.370> education<00:05:28.760> to

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
from getting a well-rounded education to

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.110 
from getting a well-rounded education to
use<00:05:29.660> their<00:05:29.930> own<00:05:30.050> terms<00:05:30.350> then<00:05:30.890> I<00:05:31.130> think<00:05:31.370> that<00:05:31.550> we

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
use their own terms then I think that we

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.930 
use their own terms then I think that we
should<00:05:32.290> we<00:05:33.290> should<00:05:33.320> have<00:05:33.770> measures<00:05:34.730> in<00:05:34.760> place

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
should we should have measures in place

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.820 
should we should have measures in place
to<00:05:35.120> change<00:05:35.570> that<00:05:35.780> and<00:05:35.960> we<00:05:36.050> should<00:05:36.230> also<00:05:36.410> really

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
to change that and we should also really

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.320 
to change that and we should also really
take<00:05:37.040> a<00:05:37.070> close<00:05:37.400> look<00:05:37.550> at<00:05:37.880> this<00:05:37.970> law<00:05:38.150> that's

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
take a close look at this law that's

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.420 
take a close look at this law that's
been<00:05:38.420> around<00:05:38.570> for<00:05:38.870> decades<00:05:39.100> that<00:05:40.100> perhaps

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
been around for decades that perhaps

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.600 
been around for decades that perhaps
shouldn't<00:05:40.940> be<00:05:41.060> around<00:05:41.300> anymore
