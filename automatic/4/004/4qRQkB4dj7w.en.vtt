and<00:00:00.210> it's<00:00:00.960> that<00:00:01.199> time<00:00:01.439> again<00:00:01.589> so<00:00:01.979> we're<00:00:02.159> going

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
and it's that time again so we're going

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.470 
and it's that time again so we're going
to<00:00:02.340> go<00:00:02.460> over<00:00:02.490> here<00:00:02.879> we're<00:00:03.030> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.210> pop<00:00:03.330> this

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
to go over here we're going to pop this

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.200 
to go over here we're going to pop this
in<00:00:03.689> here<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.470> I've<00:00:05.460> decided<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.910> I'm<00:00:06.120> going

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
in here and I've decided that I'm going

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.509 
in here and I've decided that I'm going
to<00:00:06.270> start<00:00:06.450> using<00:00:06.629> these<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.620> know<00:00:07.710> artifacts

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
to start using these you know artifacts

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.610 
to start using these you know artifacts
over<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.179> if<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.630> stick<00:00:09.900> them<00:00:10.050> onto<00:00:10.290> this

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
over here so if we stick them onto this

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.009 
over here so if we stick them onto this
side<00:00:10.950> they're<00:00:11.610> not<00:00:11.880> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.179> influence<00:00:12.690> what

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
side they're not going to influence what

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.200 
side they're not going to influence what
comes<00:00:13.440> out<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.620> here<00:00:14.040> but<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:14.880> get<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> much

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
comes out of here but we get a much

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.700 
comes out of here but we get a much
better<00:00:15.240> chance<00:00:15.630> there<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.230> eighty-five

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
better chance there you see eighty-five

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.290 
better chance there you see eighty-five
percent<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.279> there<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.670> go<00:00:17.699> that's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
percent so there we go that's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.540 
percent so there we go that's
automatically<00:00:18.960> when<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:20.039> put<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.369> back

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
automatically when and put that back

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.580 
automatically when and put that back
there<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.779> we've<00:00:21.900> got<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.020> format

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
there and we see we've got a format

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.950 
there and we see we've got a format
crystallizer<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.630> actually<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> shouldn't

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
crystallizer so actually I shouldn't

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.269 
crystallizer so actually I shouldn't
have<00:00:25.019> put<00:00:25.199> those<00:00:25.320> away<00:00:25.500> let's<00:00:25.890> bring<00:00:26.160> those

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
have put those away let's bring those

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.269 
have put those away let's bring those
back<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.560> where<00:00:29.039> i<00:00:29.070> took

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
back and as you can see where i took

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.950 
back and as you can see where i took
that<00:00:29.310> away<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.240> five<00:00:30.449> percent<00:00:30.720> chance

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that away that's a five percent chance

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.010 
that away that's a five percent chance
and<00:00:31.880> if<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.000> put<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.300> there<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
and if we put it in there that is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.600 
and if we put it in there that is
eighty-five<00:00:34.500> percent<00:00:34.620> chance<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> know

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
eighty-five percent chance so you know

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
eighty-five percent chance so you know
be<00:00:35.880> having<00:00:36.329> two<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.600> those<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.020> forty<00:00:37.320> percent

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
be having two of those is forty percent

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
be having two of those is forty percent
each<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> total<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.480> eighty<00:00:39.629> percent

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
each and with a total of eighty percent

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.770 
each and with a total of eighty percent
more<00:00:40.110> success<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.219> fantastic<00:00:41.780> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
more success so that is fantastic that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.540 
more success so that is fantastic that
is<00:00:42.930> why<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.410> finding<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.190> know<00:00:44.309> those

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
is why you like finding you know those

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
is why you like finding you know those
little<00:00:44.730> dungeons<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.870> artifacts

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
little dungeons with the artifacts

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.420 
little dungeons with the artifacts
inside<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.890> them<00:00:46.980> because<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> makes

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
inside of them because it makes

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.979 
inside of them because it makes
everything<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.239> much<00:00:48.300> easier<00:00:48.450> when<00:00:48.809> you're

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
everything so much easier when you're

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
everything so much easier when you're
trying<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> research<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.030> much<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.420> good

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
trying to research so so much it's good

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.490 
trying to research so so much it's good
okay<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> almost<00:00:53.670> done<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:55.289> after

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
okay and almost done just one more after

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
okay and almost done just one more after
this<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.620> fantastic<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.309> how<00:00:59.609> will<00:00:59.879> today

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
sure why not so I will put that back in

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.810 
sure why not so I will put that back in
there<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.010> stomach<00:01:14.280> duplicator

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
there because that stomach duplicator

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
there because that stomach duplicator
and<00:01:15.030> film<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.110> crystallized<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.799> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and film it crystallized that this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
and film it crystallized that this
arcane<00:01:17.310> device<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.759> convert<00:01:18.060> liquid<00:01:18.420> v-spec

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
arcane device can convert liquid v-spec

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.469 
arcane device can convert liquid v-spec
into<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.259> crystals<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> fantastic

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
into these crystals so that is fantastic

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.350 
into these crystals so that is fantastic
and<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> beast<00:01:23.460> crystals<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.240> know

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and the beast crystals are you know

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
and the beast crystals are you know
influenced<00:01:24.990> by<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.290> surroundings<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.310> we

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
influenced by your surroundings so we

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.899 
influenced by your surroundings so we
are<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.200> Plains<00:01:28.200> biome<00:01:28.490> can<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> make<00:01:29.759> this

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
are in a Plains biome can I make this

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
are in a Plains biome can I make this
sir<00:01:30.380> well<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.619> planes<00:01:31.890> over<00:01:32.130> there

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
sir well you see planes over there

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.789 
sir well you see planes over there
anyway<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.270> top<00:01:33.420> left<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.380> we're

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
anyway and the top left so we're

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
anyway and the top left so we're
probably<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.549> ones<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.240> what

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
probably going to get ones that what

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.300 
probably going to get ones that what
crystals<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.320> native<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> Plains

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
crystals that are native to the Plains

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.810 
crystals that are native to the Plains
biome<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.470> these<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.040> need<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
biome so if I get all of these I need to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.179 
biome so if I get all of these I need to
Goulding<00:01:42.270> gets<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.720> diamond<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.770> iron

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
Goulding gets one diamond and one iron

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.899 
Goulding gets one diamond and one iron
so<00:01:45.000> two<00:01:45.390> gold<00:01:45.630> ingots<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.380> diamond<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.100> need

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
so two gold ingots one diamond I need

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.219 
so two gold ingots one diamond I need
one<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> each<00:01:48.360> crystal<00:01:48.810> which<00:01:48.899> I'll<00:01:49.020> grab<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
one of each crystal which I'll grab a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.230 
one of each crystal which I'll grab a
different<00:01:49.560> way<00:01:49.649> hang<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> second<00:01:50.970> i'll<00:01:51.060> just

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
different way hang on a second i'll just

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.440 
different way hang on a second i'll just
grab<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.780> iron<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.670> each<00:01:53.790> crystal<00:01:54.270> do

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
grab the iron and one of each crystal do

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.240 
grab the iron and one of each crystal do
i<00:01:54.509> need<00:01:54.689> every<00:01:55.229> single<00:01:55.380> kind<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> crystal<00:01:56.070> so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
i need every single kind of crystal so

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.950 
i need every single kind of crystal so
we've<00:01:56.369> got<00:01:56.490> eight<00:01:56.850> cuius<00:01:57.360> i<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.869> i<00:01:57.899> need

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
we've got eight cuius i think i need

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560 
we've got eight cuius i think i need
everything<00:01:58.290> except<00:01:58.619> tainted<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.939> where<00:02:00.450> are

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
everything except tainted so where are

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.080 
everything except tainted so where are
my<00:02:00.689> crystals<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.820> one

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
my crystals that one that one that one

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.210 
my crystals that one that one that one
that<00:02:03.270> one<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.689> one

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
that one that one

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.170 
that one that one
and<00:02:04.460> not<00:02:05.150> that<00:02:05.180> one<00:02:05.480> okay<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.550> pop<00:02:07.970> in

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
and not that one okay so if I pop in

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.260 
and not that one okay so if I pop in
here<00:02:09.100> let's<00:02:10.100> see<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.790> I<00:02:10.820> find<00:02:11.150> the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
here let's see can I find the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.370 
here let's see can I find the
crystallizer<00:02:11.690> because<00:02:11.960> that<00:02:12.050> would<00:02:12.140> make<00:02:12.230> it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
crystallizer because that would make it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.220 
crystallizer because that would make it
a<00:02:12.410> bit<00:02:12.530> easier<00:02:12.680> for<00:02:12.890> me<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.130> put<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> recipe

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
a bit easier for me to put in the recipe

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.490 
a bit easier for me to put in the recipe
crystallizer<00:02:15.230> there<00:02:15.800> we<00:02:15.860> go<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.960> how

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
crystallizer there we go and that is how

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.220 
crystallizer there we go and that is how
everything<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.070> supposed<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.340> sit<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.780> red<00:02:21.200> is

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
everything is supposed to sit so red is

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.100 
everything is supposed to sit so red is
there<00:02:21.560> that's<00:02:21.980> these<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.180> vaporous<00:02:23.840> this

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
there that's these this is vaporous this

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.620 
there that's these this is vaporous this
is<00:02:24.230> green<00:02:25.030> gold<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:27.130> diamond<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.300> so

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
is green gold and diamond and I in so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.850 
is green gold and diamond and I in so
just<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:29.990> that<00:02:30.020> we've<00:02:30.230> got<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> format

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
just like that we've got a format

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.000 
just like that we've got a format
crystallizer<00:02:31.370> cool<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.110> I'm<00:02:33.620> going<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.830> put

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
crystallizer cool so I'm going to put

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.910 
crystallizer cool so I'm going to put
that<00:02:34.190> here<00:02:35.060> let's<00:02:35.750> see<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.560> would<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.770> nice

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
that here let's see that would be a nice

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.060 
that here let's see that would be a nice
place<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.160> put<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.400> yeah<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.990> what<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:39.709> is

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
place to put it yeah so what I do is

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.980 
place to put it yeah so what I do is
that<00:02:40.190> if<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.910> remember<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.270> we<00:02:41.750> have<00:02:41.959> a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
that if you remember this we have a

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.320 
that if you remember this we have a
whole<00:02:42.170> bunch<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.440> depleted<00:02:42.890> crystals<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.060> if

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
whole bunch of depleted crystals so if

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.270 
whole bunch of depleted crystals so if
we<00:02:44.360> grab<00:02:44.660> some<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.930> these<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.560> we<00:02:45.680> pop<00:02:45.980> them<00:02:46.250> up

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
we grab some of these and we pop them up

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.190 
we grab some of these and we pop them up
in<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.610> middle<00:02:46.760> we're<00:02:47.570> going<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.750> start<00:02:47.959> using

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
in the middle we're going to start using

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.280 
in the middle we're going to start using
oops<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.700> vs<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.120> we've<00:02:50.240> got<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.630> here<00:02:50.660> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
oops the vs that we've got in here and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.770 
oops the vs that we've got in here and
start<00:02:52.130> recharging<00:02:52.790> somebody's<00:02:53.180> crystals<00:02:53.630> so

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
start recharging somebody's crystals so

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.160 
start recharging somebody's crystals so
that<00:02:53.900> we<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:54.110> use<00:02:54.140> them<00:02:54.410> in<00:02:54.470> other<00:02:54.620> places<00:02:55.120> so

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
that we can use them in other places so

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.160 
that we can use them in other places so
almost<00:02:57.170> there<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.760> when<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.000> gets<00:02:59.780> to

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
almost there I think when that gets to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.770 
almost there I think when that gets to
the<00:03:00.700> bottom<00:03:01.700> there<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.410> bottom<00:03:03.650> yes<00:03:04.780> once

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
the bottom there to the bottom yes once

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.199 
the bottom there to the bottom yes once
that<00:03:05.959> gets<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.380> bottom<00:03:06.820> then<00:03:07.820> we'll<00:03:07.970> get<00:03:08.150> a

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
that gets the bottom then we'll get a

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.509 
that gets the bottom then we'll get a
different<00:03:08.450> crystal<00:03:08.900> based<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.650> know<00:03:09.769> what

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
different crystal based on you know what

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.690 
different crystal based on you know what
it's<00:03:10.730> managed<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.360> generate<00:03:11.570> into<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:13.070> if<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.550> go

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
it's managed to generate into so if I go

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.650 
it's managed to generate into so if I go
over<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:15.640> where<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.390> need<00:03:17.989> something
