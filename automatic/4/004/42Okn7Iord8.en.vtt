00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 very good condition arising we are in 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.629
 minecraft 1.7 point 2 let's see a mod 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.750
 a mountain of these four weapons that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.360
 you are seeing here is pretty cool 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.109
 gave the version was these are weapons 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.119
 but already for the in game 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.730
 When you have it all, it's 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.039
 example the light in root remember the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.269
 starter and two sticks a character a 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.429
 little bit we need them 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.480
 for lito that is not worth anything from scratch and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.250
 this throws thunder so Spain 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.890
 but as you can see, it has hurt me 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.100
 weird little gave the question what would be molar 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.079
 is that it will launch, that is, it will not wear out 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.120
 gave distance to the refrigerator to be for 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.160
 a thunder is a little bit that falls coal 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 if you do not spend it because they 're throwing 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.250
 as you want 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.500
 I like it a lot, for example, that you can 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.390
 point that out is something that when there's a 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.550
 weapon so throwing rays are never 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.040
 do it very well and that is if we give it 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.730
 here the ray falls where the crosshead is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.119
 we give here the cow falls right where 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.229
 is the crosshead and this nonsense 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.670
 this has to be complicated too 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:18.159
 but well this seems simple many 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.440
 Sometimes you can not do much I'm the 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.899
 sea god attacks then we have to be here 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.720
 the human ruth that is with three blocks 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.050
 diamond and two sticks and this what 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.880
 he does is summon bugs 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.630
 summon a few bugs and I do not know what 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.869
 if we click, you see, it's just this one 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.370
 is here is a book happens always we 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.170
 loved the bugs there are united 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.810
 but well let's kill them for 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.550
 curiosity about everything these are like that 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.200
 as specials 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.200
 where is the skeleton 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.940
 for the release of the bows look something is 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.170
 something that has power 4 by the state 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.210
 but as you can see, it's a little bit, but well 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.660
 now let's see these from here this is 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.360
 from here since Egypt called hobyo 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.030
 first thing this ground zero zero bomb 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.440
 that is with everything like that from tnt this is easy 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.320
 do more or less 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.390
 and this pedal minecraft but let's go 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.720
 that stays at our very best, let's do it 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.670
 here where is which we click 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.670
 right and look what falls 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.450
 and all that from tnt that's why I whistle 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.700
 a lot the good minecraft graceful the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.670
 man kraft as always but then 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.700
 we go back in and that's how it stayed 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.860
 it's very good, it's not like it's not very 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.079
 I am very symmetric but it is very 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.239
 cool as you see the destruction because it is 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.569
 epic or you have already seen the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.420
 Lieutenant who falls right there or from the wing 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.950
 let it be there to see what down to where 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.650
 this goes there and all this seriously there is a 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.200
 ladder 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.090
 to pass I do not want to spend good until 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.120
 here more or less has arrived is not bad 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.610
 of course and then the last the air 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.780
 strike this one that is also super epic 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.209
 the hole is left where 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.760
 we put this here as 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.909
 You see there is no one to see why it's a fighter 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.220
 or not 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.730
 the serious thing is that he throws a string 7 go 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.200
 to put the guides and we see it but this 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.640
 time is like a species attack a stick 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.200
 A) Yes 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.390
 the super epic and this is done with six 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.580
 of tnt a diamond block and two blocks 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.620
 of iron or equal the graphics are 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.000
 a little expensive is for taking into account 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.500
 spent 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.500
 but good I got over my hate 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.890
 backwards it is very cool to us 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.190
 see how this has been and how I do not 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.470
 charge this never that experience 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.820
 here this mystery has died well that what 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:10.430
 we are throwing to the sea then here 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.430
 that's cool a lot how he does it 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.889
 well, it's good, and what's so good 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.780
 as the ground zero bombs is 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.350
 very very cool but good as you see a 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.539
 mod 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.250
 rather curious 7 more than anything else 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.120
 but hey this is the mod 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.820
 is for 1.7 point 2 is installed with forging 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.940
 etcetera the typical I hope that you have 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.340
 liked is the ominous year a lot 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.340
 and this is all to another ciao 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.550
 ah
