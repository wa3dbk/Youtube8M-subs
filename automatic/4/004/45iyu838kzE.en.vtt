 laziness just mix the ingredients

 by oven and then you can combine 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.930

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.690
 world

 person is by sounding the meats here in 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.380
 home whenever we bought tray 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.600
 one pound of ground beef 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.320
 we took the spear and divided it into 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.540
 portions smaller than 200 or 250 grams 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.940
 so it is easier to freeze and 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.220
 after defrosting and you avoid 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.870
 Waste on the way was more because 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.930

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.360
 freezer a pound use only the text 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.440
 must freeze meat again 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.810
 spoiled 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.420
 running from the beginning you avoid 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.790
 waste and got talent is who loses it 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.160
