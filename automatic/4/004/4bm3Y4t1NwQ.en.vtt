varroa<00:00:20.369> mite<00:00:20.640> control<00:00:21.890> there<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.920> no<00:00:23.220> question

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
varroa mite control there is no question

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.609 
varroa mite control there is no question
that<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.150> number<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.750> enemy<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
that the number one enemy to the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.560 
that the number one enemy to the
beekeeper<00:00:26.130> are<00:00:26.369> varroa<00:00:26.939> mites<00:00:27.210> these<00:00:27.420> are

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
beekeeper are varroa mites these are

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.439 
beekeeper are varroa mites these are
large<00:00:28.160> parasitic<00:00:29.160> mites<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.699> mean<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.330> were

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
large parasitic mites I mean if we were

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
large parasitic mites I mean if we were
a<00:00:30.480> bee<00:00:30.960> it'd<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> dinner<00:00:31.740> plate

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
a bee it'd be like a dinner plate

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340 
a bee it'd be like a dinner plate
feeding<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.669> us<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.510> mites<00:00:33.780> pass<00:00:34.110> on

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
feeding on us and these mites pass on

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.319 
feeding on us and these mites pass on
viruses<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> they<00:00:35.309> caused<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> demise<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
viruses and they caused the demise of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.530 
viruses and they caused the demise of
colonies<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.930> lots<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.649> different<00:00:38.040> ways<00:00:38.129> and

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
colonies in lots of different ways and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.060 
colonies in lots of different ways and
so<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:39.719> pretty<00:00:39.960> important<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.010> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so it's pretty important that you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.680 
so it's pretty important that you
control<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.940> that's<00:00:42.090> why<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.329> numbers

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
control it and that's why these numbers

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
control it and that's why these numbers
are<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.020> surprising<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> me<00:00:43.920> because

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
are really surprising to me because

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.209 
are really surprising to me because
fully<00:00:44.730> 6<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.329> 59%<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> beekeepers<00:00:47.070> who

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
fully 6 to 59% of the beekeepers who

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.940 
fully 6 to 59% of the beekeepers who
respond<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.940> survey<00:00:48.329> did<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.110> use<00:00:49.620> an

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
respond to this survey did not use an

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
respond to this survey did not use an
overall<00:00:50.610> high<00:00:50.820> control<00:00:51.210> product<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.960> their

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
overall high control product in their

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.160 
overall high control product in their
hive<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> last<00:00:52.860> 12<00:00:53.309> months<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.960> want<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
hive in the last 12 months I want it I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.420 
hive in the last 12 months I want it I
don't<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.829> emphasize<00:00:56.039> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
don't know if we can emphasize this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.760 
don't know if we can emphasize this
anymore<00:00:57.000> every<00:00:57.539> beekeeper<00:00:57.930> needs<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.500> our<00:00:58.649> own

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
anymore every beekeeper needs of our own

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.040 
anymore every beekeeper needs of our own
my<00:00:59.010> control<00:00:59.430> strategy<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.239> mites

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
my control strategy you have mites

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750 
my control strategy you have mites
so<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.620> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> keep<00:01:02.010> bees<00:01:02.219> alive<00:01:02.520> for

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so if you want to keep bees alive for

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.399 
so if you want to keep bees alive for
the<00:01:02.820> winter<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> way<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the winter you have to have a way of

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.289 
the winter you have to have a way of
controlling<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.150> one

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
controlling it and I think this is one

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
controlling it and I think this is one
of<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> most<00:01:06.630> consistent<00:01:07.110> results<00:01:07.409> over<00:01:08.010> any

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
of the most consistent results over any

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
of the most consistent results over any
of<00:01:08.640> our<00:01:08.939> survey<00:01:09.270> questions<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.740> here

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
of our survey questions is this one here

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
of our survey questions is this one here
the<00:01:11.460> people<00:01:11.790> who<00:01:12.299> did<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.659> control<00:01:13.229> their<00:01:13.470> own

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the people who did not control their own

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.280 
the people who did not control their own
lights<00:01:13.890> lose<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:15.030> more<00:01:15.330> colonies<00:01:15.840> than

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
lights lose a lot more colonies than

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.580 
lights lose a lot more colonies than
those<00:01:16.650> who<00:01:17.100> don't<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.970> control<00:01:18.420> veronik<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
those who don't do control veronik you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.370 
those who don't do control veronik you
must<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.610> varroa<00:01:21.060> mite<00:01:21.299> control<00:01:21.750> strategy

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
must have a varroa mite control strategy

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.310 
must have a varroa mite control strategy
if<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.979> want<00:01:23.490> colonies<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> survive<00:01:24.659> over<00:01:25.229> the

seems<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:58.020> people<00:01:58.439> who<00:01:58.530> use<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.979> loss<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.430> lot

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
seems as people who use that loss of lot

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.830

fewer<00:01:59.850> colonies<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.450> those<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.719> use

comes into those cells and they

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.610 
comes into those cells and they
reproduce<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:48.060> those<00:03:48.209> cells<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.380> use

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
reproduce in those cells and we can use

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.830 
reproduce in those cells and we can use

them<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.049> colonies<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.709> then<00:03:53.160> remove<00:03:53.670> them

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
them to colonies and then remove them

all the mites and the drones and just do

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
that system over time what you can see

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
here is that the people who use this

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.120 
here is that the people who use this
technique<00:04:06.000> tended<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.989> lose<00:04:07.139> fewer<00:04:07.590> colonies

this effect this drone bird effect
really<00:04:22.770> becomes<00:04:23.099> very<00:04:23.340> clear<00:04:23.789> when<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.810> use

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
really becomes very clear when you use

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.290 
really becomes very clear when you use
it<00:04:25.380> on<00:04:25.560> all<00:04:26.070> your<00:04:26.400> colonies

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
it on all your colonies

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.260 
it on all your colonies
not<00:04:27.539> just<00:04:27.930> half<00:04:28.169> of<00:04:28.319> your<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.500> pre<00:04:29.090> but<00:04:30.090> rather

your entire operation and so if you're

your entire operation and so if you're

going to use drone group removal you

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.950 
going to use drone group removal you
have<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.250> use<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.759> all<00:04:36.120> your<00:04:36.389> operation<00:04:36.870> you

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
have to use it on all your operation you

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.140 
have to use it on all your operation you
can't<00:04:37.199> just<00:04:37.380> do<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.530> on<00:04:37.710> some<00:04:38.069> if<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.849> want<00:04:39.030> to

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
can't just do it on some if you want to

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.050 
can't just do it on some if you want to
have<00:04:39.300> increased<00:04:40.229> survivorship<00:04:40.819> this<00:04:41.819> peak

have increased survivorship this peak
this<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:42.479> an<00:04:42.599> important<00:04:43.080> point<00:04:43.289> to<00:04:43.650> make

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
this is an important point to make

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.059 
this is an important point to make
because<00:04:44.910> what<00:04:45.660> we<00:04:45.780> think<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.169> happening<00:04:46.199> is<00:04:46.770> if

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
because what we think is happening is if

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.040 
because what we think is happening is if
you're<00:04:47.190> not<00:04:47.220> doing<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.819> uniformly<00:04:48.599> if<00:04:48.870> there

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
you're not doing it uniformly if there

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.779 
you're not doing it uniformly if there
are<00:04:49.169> colonies<00:04:49.650> that<00:04:49.740> have<00:04:49.949> high<00:04:50.160> tide<00:04:50.430> levels

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
are colonies that have high tide levels

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.790 
are colonies that have high tide levels
there's<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:51.419> much<00:04:51.569> drift<00:04:52.050> between<00:04:52.560> your

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
there's so much drift between your

there's so much drift between your

for all my levels screen bottom boards

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.430 
for all my levels screen bottom boards
so<00:05:24.060> screen<00:05:24.300> bottom<00:05:24.539> boards<00:05:24.840> were<00:05:24.960> developed

in<00:05:38.909> the<00:05:38.940> bottom<00:05:39.270> board<00:05:39.479> of<00:05:39.630> bees<00:05:39.840> can<00:05:40.050> pass<00:05:40.259> by

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
in the bottom board of bees can pass by

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.310 
in the bottom board of bees can pass by
and<00:05:40.620> they<00:05:40.740> can<00:05:40.860> choke<00:05:41.070> back<00:05:41.280> on<00:05:41.490> their<00:05:41.610> speeds

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
and they can choke back on their speeds

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.839 
and they can choke back on their speeds
so<00:05:43.320> we<00:05:43.440> know<00:05:43.620> from<00:05:43.830> some<00:05:44.159> studies<00:05:44.430> that<00:05:44.699> this

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
so we know from some studies that this

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.659 
so we know from some studies that this
does<00:05:45.150> reduce<00:05:45.419> might<00:05:45.870> loads<00:05:46.139> but<00:05:46.830> from<00:05:47.219> from

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
does reduce might loads but from from

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.029 
does reduce might loads but from from
you<00:05:47.940> can<00:05:48.060> see<00:05:48.210> from<00:05:48.360> these<00:05:48.479> results<00:05:48.960> we<00:05:49.530> saw<00:05:49.710> no

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
you can see from these results we saw no

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.040 
you can see from these results we saw no
evidence<00:05:50.699> of<00:05:50.849> increased<00:05:51.330> survivorship<00:05:51.780> if

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
screen bottom board effect you can see

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.620 
screen bottom board effect you can see
did<00:06:18.780> not<00:06:18.810> seem<00:06:19.409> to<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:20.520> matter<00:06:20.759> by<00:06:21.000> region<00:06:21.419> so

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
did not seem to to matter by region so

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.149 
did not seem to to matter by region so
both<00:06:21.840> in<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:22.050> northern<00:06:22.259> states<00:06:22.680> and<00:06:22.830> southern

both in the northern states and southern

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.649 
both in the northern states and southern
states

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:23.659 
states

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.270 
states
basically<00:06:24.659> people<00:06:24.930> who<00:06:25.169> used<00:06:25.469> this<00:06:25.860> did<00:06:26.159> not

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
basically people who used this did not

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.430 
basically people who used this did not
lose<00:06:26.639> more<00:06:26.940> or<00:06:27.180> fewer<00:06:27.360> hives<00:06:27.690> than<00:06:28.110> those<00:06:28.289> who

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
lose more or fewer hives than those who

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.740 
lose more or fewer hives than those who
did<00:06:28.620> not

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
did not

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.809 
did not
so<00:06:30.750> I'll<00:06:30.870> sell<00:06:31.139> size<00:06:31.409> small<00:06:32.069> cell<00:06:32.280> sizes<00:06:32.520> one

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
so I'll sell size small cell sizes one

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.230 
so I'll sell size small cell sizes one
of<00:06:32.909> those<00:06:33.110> you<00:06:34.110> can<00:06:34.259> buy<00:06:34.289> comb<00:06:34.860> and<00:06:35.460> have<00:06:35.729> a

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
of those you can buy comb and have a

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.360 
of those you can buy comb and have a
worker<00:06:36.810> cell<00:06:37.139> size<00:06:37.380> that's<00:06:37.560> slightly<00:06:37.979> smaller

worker cell size that's slightly smaller

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.610 
worker cell size that's slightly smaller

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
than the one that's commercially they

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.890 
than the one that's commercially they
generally<00:06:41.360> there's<00:06:42.360> some<00:06:42.510> people<00:06:42.630> who

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
generally there's some people who

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.540 
generally there's some people who
believe<00:06:43.290> that<00:06:43.320> this<00:06:43.650> smaller<00:06:43.979> cell<00:06:44.280> size

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
believe that this smaller cell size

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.850 
believe that this smaller cell size
somehow<00:06:44.940> inhibits<00:06:45.810> the<00:06:45.990> ability<00:06:46.229> of<00:06:46.590> varroa
