00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.450 

I'm<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.600> review<00:00:04.049> out<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.589> vichu<00:00:05.100> which

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
I'm going to review out the vichu which

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.620 
I'm going to review out the vichu which
is<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.990> maxillary<00:00:07.639> maxillary<00:00:08.639> branch<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
is the maxillary maxillary branch of the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.499 
is the maxillary maxillary branch of the
trigeminal<00:00:09.900> nerve

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
trigeminal nerve

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.919 
trigeminal nerve
so<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:13.590> vichu<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.330> pass<00:00:15.599> a

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
so the vichu is going to pass a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.990 
so the vichu is going to pass a
structure<00:00:16.680> named<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.300> terrible<00:00:19.970> Paulo<00:00:20.970> Chien

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
structure named the terrible Paulo Chien

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.170 
structure named the terrible Paulo Chien
fissure<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:25.580> then<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> keep

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
fissure and then it's going to keep

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.549 
fissure and then it's going to keep
going<00:00:28.519> until<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:30.269> has<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.130> rotundum<00:00:33.559> for

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
going until it has the rotundum for

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.990 
going until it has the rotundum for
ramming<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:37.500> after<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
ramming and after that it's going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.510 
ramming and after that it's going to
send<00:00:39.329> our<00:00:39.660> cue<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:43.100> nerves

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
send our cue to nerves

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.910 
send our cue to nerves
the<00:00:45.210> first<00:00:45.510> named<00:00:45.840> nerve<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.800> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.850 

okay<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.940> second<00:02:54.329> branch<00:02:54.600> over<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
okay this second branch over here is the

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.380 
okay this second branch over here is the
most<00:02:56.070> important<00:02:56.610> for<00:02:56.820> us<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
most important for us is the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.440 
most important for us is the
infraorbital<00:02:59.959> probe<00:03:00.959> orbital<00:03:01.859> nerve<00:03:02.450> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
infraorbital probe orbital nerve and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.380 
infraorbital probe orbital nerve and
they<00:03:03.660> are<00:03:03.900> infraorbital<00:03:04.890> nerve<00:03:05.220> I'm<00:03:06.000> going<00:03:06.299> to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
they are infraorbital nerve I'm going to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.259 
they are infraorbital nerve I'm going to
make<00:03:08.540> orange

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
make orange

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.960 
make orange
so<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.420> infraorbital<00:03:12.989> nerve<00:03:13.859> is<00:03:14.640> going<00:03:14.880> to

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
so the infraorbital nerve is going to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.410 
so the infraorbital nerve is going to
send<00:03:15.299> up<00:03:15.600> three<00:03:15.840> branches<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.910> first<00:03:18.180> one

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
send up three branches the first one

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.280 
send up three branches the first one
over<00:03:18.600> here<00:03:19.230> we're<00:03:19.859> going<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.160> call<00:03:20.430> the

over here we're going to call the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.569 
over here we're going to call the
posterior<00:03:22.290> superior<00:03:24.170> alveolar<00:03:25.170> nerve<00:03:25.579> and

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
posterior superior alveolar nerve and

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.800 
posterior superior alveolar nerve and
it's<00:03:26.850> gonna<00:03:27.260> innervate<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.620> molars<00:03:30.890> except

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
it's gonna innervate the molars except

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.809 
it's gonna innervate the molars except
the<00:03:34.040> mesial-buccal<00:03:35.040> root<00:03:35.780> of<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.500> first
