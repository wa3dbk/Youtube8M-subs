00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.489
 better show more details our best 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.289
 It's the same space that we have here for us. 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329
 have notion that I did that more time 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.910
 Quick, then I'll show you a little 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.559
 more to you and I want to record the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 recording these scenes these images 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.030
 all because I want to do the before and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.880
 after receiving an idea the voter 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.649
 call raffaele and she so what she 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.720
 think of changing completely that when 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.020
 I was released because I told you that I 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.450
 wanted to put that table is a table 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.090
 more relaxed with only files courses 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.610
 so some also know how to do is the room 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.140
 and she 's there in that space. 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.659
 by bp 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.909
 You watch, you'll understand or say. 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.509
 that after this video here the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.670
 balcony is from here to there and she gave me the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.999
 idea to put the dining table that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.039
 out in that clear covered part and she says 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:25.109
 cause a monster so neither is chic 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.310
 very simple but relaxed and I 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.679
 I was wondering why she said that 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.369
 profit health is more yes only 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:35.700

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.810
 covered that there are already materials 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.270

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.729
