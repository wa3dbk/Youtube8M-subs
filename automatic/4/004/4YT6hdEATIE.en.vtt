good for that price Dax and three
different<00:00:12.030> ideas<00:00:12.950> three<00:00:13.950> different<00:00:14.219> ways<00:00:14.340> in

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
different ideas three different ways in

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.730 
different ideas three different ways in
which<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.969> design<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> deck<00:00:16.289> now<00:00:18.470> someone<00:00:19.470> asked

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
which to design a deck now someone asked

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.550 
which to design a deck now someone asked
me<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:20.160> after<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:20.970> last<00:00:21.210> video<00:00:21.420> why<00:00:22.380> don't<00:00:22.410> you

have<00:00:22.710> recommendations<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.789> my<00:00:24.600> thought<00:00:24.900> is

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
have recommendations and my thought is

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.009 
have recommendations and my thought is
well<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.279> here<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.609> front<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.939> me<00:00:27.119> right

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
well if it's here in front of me right

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.929 
well if it's here in front of me right
now<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.949> recommend<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
now I recommend it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.590 
now I recommend it
