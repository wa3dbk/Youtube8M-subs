00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.030 
fiddle and a guitar you are actually
creating<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.500> sound<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.269> piano<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
creating the sound on the piano of a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.150 
creating the sound on the piano of a
rhythm<00:02:57.970> section<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:59.380> we're<00:02:59.590> talking<00:02:59.769> about<00:03:00.010> a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
rhythm section and we're talking about a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.460 
rhythm section and we're talking about a
jazz<00:03:00.549> rhythm<00:03:01.000> section<00:03:01.389> because<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.900> tends<00:03:02.290> to

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
jazz rhythm section because it tends to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.160 
jazz rhythm section because it tends to
swing<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:03.220> if<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.209> doesn't<00:03:04.540> tend<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.810> swing

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
swing and if it doesn't tend to swing

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.490 
swing and if it doesn't tend to swing
then<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.739> got<00:03:05.889> a<00:03:05.920> problem<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.450> here<00:03:08.019> we<00:03:08.139> go

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
then you got a problem so here we go

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.509 
then you got a problem so here we go
now<00:03:08.709> let's<00:03:08.950> try<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:10.510> Maple<00:03:10.870> Leaf<00:03:11.019> Rag<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:12.160> a

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
now let's try the Maple Leaf Rag in a

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.479 
now let's try the Maple Leaf Rag in a
stride<00:03:12.819> style<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.480> we'll<00:03:13.900> use<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:15.130> lower

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
stride style and we'll use the lower

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.360 
stride style and we'll use the lower
notes<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.540> put<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.650> in<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.829> little<00:03:18.069> bit<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.220> a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
notes and put it in a little bit of a

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.129 
notes and put it in a little bit of a
swing<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:19.150> show<00:03:19.359> you<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.690> difference<00:03:20.049> between

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
swing to show you the difference between

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.780 
swing to show you the difference between
this

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
this

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:43.420 
this
time

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.740 

now<00:03:44.430> there's<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.760> little<00:03:45.060> bit<00:03:45.210> of<00:03:45.330> a<00:03:45.420> stride

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
now there's a little bit of a stride

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.560 
now there's a little bit of a stride
approach<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.620> Maple<00:03:46.920> Leaf<00:03:47.040> Rag<00:03:47.570> which

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
approach to the Maple Leaf Rag which

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.700 
approach to the Maple Leaf Rag which
involves<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.350> lot<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:50.870> rhythmic<00:03:51.870> variations

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
involves a lot of rhythmic variations

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.500 
involves a lot of rhythmic variations
with<00:03:53.610> your<00:03:54.000> basic<00:03:54.450> tune<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.590> also<00:03:56.520> if<00:03:57.090> slower

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
with your basic tune and also if slower

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.110 
with your basic tune and also if slower
into<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.960> register<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.890> create<00:03:59.250> more<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.970> a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
into the register to create more of a

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.540 
into the register to create more of a
bass<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.080> drum<00:04:01.320> sound<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.070> left<00:04:02.280> hand

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
bass and drum sound in the left hand

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.920 
bass and drum sound in the left hand
rather<00:04:03.300> than<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.960> a<00:04:04.140> piano<00:04:04.410> figure
