treatment options that we have for
patients<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.529> seizures<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.220> epilepsy

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
patients with seizures and epilepsy

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.370 
patients with seizures and epilepsy
epilepsy<00:00:19.340> is<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> condition<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:21.539> people

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
epilepsy is a condition in which people

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
epilepsy is a condition in which people
have<00:00:22.880> continuing<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.060> recurrent<00:00:24.600> seizures

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
have continuing or recurrent seizures

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.519 
have continuing or recurrent seizures
even<00:00:25.980> unprovoked<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.689> epilepsy<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
even unprovoked and so epilepsy is a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.339 
even unprovoked and so epilepsy is a
much<00:00:29.220> more<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.880> medical<00:00:30.390> problem<00:00:30.750> rather

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
much more of a medical problem rather

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.979 
much more of a medical problem rather
than<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> single<00:00:32.009> seizure<00:00:32.450> epilepsy<00:00:33.450> strikes

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
looking into is a technique called

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.530 
looking into is a technique called
thermal<00:01:55.170> ablation<00:01:55.380> using<00:01:56.310> laser<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:57.030> actually
