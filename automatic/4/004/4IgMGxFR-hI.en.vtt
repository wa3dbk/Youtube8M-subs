00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
governance and that's how I started my

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.270 
governance and that's how I started my
improvement<00:00:48.809> journey<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.379> first<00:00:49.829> began<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
improvement journey I first began to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
improvement journey I first began to
develop<00:00:50.670> knowledge<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.390> quality

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
develop knowledge and quality

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
develop knowledge and quality
improvement<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.739> without<00:00:53.280> knowing<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
improvement really without knowing it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
improvement really without knowing it
and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.780> most<00:00:54.989> people<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.530> most<00:00:55.770> people

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
and I think most people do most people

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.830 
and I think most people do most people
have<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.430> an<00:00:56.730> aptitude<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.270> quality

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
have got an aptitude for quality

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020

improvement<00:00:57.930> without<00:00:58.920> knowing<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.820> for

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
improvement without knowing it so for

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
improvement without knowing it so for
example<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:01.680> remember<00:01:01.890> being<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
quality improvement which takes in

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.469 
quality improvement which takes in
organisational<00:02:02.640> development<00:02:02.790> skills

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.899 
improvement
I<00:02:12.629> think<00:02:13.620> one<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.159> challenges<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
I think one of the challenges for the

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.839 
I think one of the challenges for the
organization<00:02:15.780> has<00:02:15.900> been<00:02:15.930> able<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.579> give<00:02:17.579> from

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
organization has been able to give from

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.259 
organization has been able to give from
dedicated<00:02:18.420> support<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.049> that<00:02:19.909> what<00:02:20.909> I<00:02:20.939> mean<00:02:21.030> by

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
dedicated support to that what I mean by

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.599 
dedicated support to that what I mean by
dedicated<00:02:21.959> support<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.499> to<00:02:22.769> help<00:02:23.099> support

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
dedicated support is to help support

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.399 
dedicated support is to help support
teams<00:02:23.969> with<00:02:24.209> improvement<00:02:24.780> support<00:02:24.930> people

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
teams with improvement support people

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.660 
teams with improvement support people
who<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.709> profound<00:02:26.249> knowledge<00:02:26.430> and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
who do have profound knowledge and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.670 
who do have profound knowledge and
improvement<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.540> supporting<00:02:28.170> them<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.530> be

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
improvement but supporting them to be

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.259 
improvement but supporting them to be
able<00:02:28.859> to<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.099> in<00:02:29.219> and<00:02:29.310> act<00:02:29.489> changes<00:02:30.030> themselves

to<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.379> able<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:32.510> improve<00:02:33.510> their<00:02:33.750> own<00:02:33.930> service

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
to be able to improve their own service

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.729 
to be able to improve their own service
I<00:02:35.209> don't<00:02:36.209> think<00:02:36.299> if<00:02:36.810> service<00:02:37.109> improvement<00:02:37.620> is

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
I don't think if service improvement is

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.949 
I don't think if service improvement is
necessarily<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.459> dark<00:02:38.760> art<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.329> think<00:02:39.389> actually

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
necessarily a dark art I think actually

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.500 
necessarily a dark art I think actually
with<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.349> right<00:02:40.500> support<00:02:40.950> anybody<00:02:41.909> can<00:02:42.239> lead

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
with the right support anybody can lead

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.449 
with the right support anybody can lead
change<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.349> lead<00:02:43.499> improvement<00:02:44.069> within<00:02:44.189> their

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
change and lead improvement within their

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.209 
change and lead improvement within their
service<00:02:44.849> area<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.480> was<00:02:46.260> initially<00:02:46.530> interested

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
service area I was initially interested

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.379 
service area I was initially interested
in<00:02:47.280> quality<00:02:47.489> improvement<00:02:47.760> because<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.329> think

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
in quality improvement because I think

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.289 
in quality improvement because I think
I've<00:02:48.719> always<00:02:48.989> had<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.639> part<00:02:50.639> of<00:02:50.760> my<00:02:50.909> being<00:02:51.150> is

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
I've always had a part of my being is

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.599 
I've always had a part of my being is
being<00:02:51.510> open<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.900> change<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.709> being<00:02:53.310> quite

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
being open to change and being quite

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.209 
being open to change and being quite
flexible<00:02:53.909> I<00:02:54.419> think<00:02:54.780> those<00:02:55.709> are<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.919> skills

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
flexible I think those are the skills

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.640 
flexible I think those are the skills
that<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:57.269> think<00:02:57.629> I'm<00:02:57.780> most<00:02:57.930> proud<00:02:58.199> of<00:02:58.469> in<00:02:58.620> my

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
that I I think I'm most proud of in my
