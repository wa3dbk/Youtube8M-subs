direct UV print to dye bond and on the

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.389 
direct UV print to dye bond and on the
back<00:00:54.010> we<00:00:54.280> have<00:00:54.309> a<00:00:54.820> simple<00:00:55.539> cleat<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:57.250> one

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
back we have a simple cleat this one

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.930 
back we have a simple cleat this one
that<00:00:57.519> happens<00:00:57.789> to<00:00:57.850> be<00:00:57.910> painted<00:00:58.300> black

actually it's not that it's a typically
but<00:01:02.230> it's<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.620> box<00:01:02.890> cleat<00:01:03.250> it's<00:01:03.550> just<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.760> simple

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.090 
but it's a box cleat it's just a simple

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.030 
but it's a box cleat it's just a simple
system<00:01:04.269> for<00:01:04.480> hanging<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.199> you've<00:01:05.710> got<00:01:05.860> the

system for hanging and you've got the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.800 
system for hanging and you've got the
female<00:01:06.400> cleat<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:07.240> screwed<00:01:07.540> into<00:01:07.690> the

this<00:01:17.980> one<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:19.000> our<00:01:19.920> artisan<00:01:20.920> package<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
this one is our artisan package and the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960 
this one is our artisan package and the
main<00:01:23.290> difference<00:01:23.320> between<00:01:23.829> this<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:24.939> and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
main difference between this one and

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.429 
main difference between this one and
this<00:01:25.180> one<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.420> just<00:01:25.720> kind<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:26.079> you've<00:01:26.259> got<00:01:26.290> a

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
this one is just kind of you've got a

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.420 
this one is just kind of you've got a
gloss<00:01:26.950> infusion<00:01:27.670> lamination<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.340> way

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
gloss infusion lamination and the way

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.740 
gloss infusion lamination and the way
that<00:01:30.579> it's<00:01:30.700> actually<00:01:30.970> attached<00:01:31.299> to<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.509> wall

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
that it's actually attached to the wall

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.330 
that it's actually attached to the wall
we're<00:01:31.960> using<00:01:32.170> standoffs<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.040> you've<00:01:33.159> got

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
we're using standoffs so you've got

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.280 
we're using standoffs so you've got
these<00:01:33.490> four<00:01:33.549> in<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.600> particular<00:01:34.899> because

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
these four in this particular because

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.420 
these four in this particular because
it's<00:01:35.439> it's<00:01:35.619> small<00:01:35.740> enough<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:36.220> we're<00:01:36.310> going

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
it's it's small enough that we're going

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.569 
it's it's small enough that we're going
to<00:01:36.490> use<00:01:36.579> four<00:01:36.909> standoffs<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.280> way<00:01:39.399> that

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
to use four standoffs and the way that

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.749 
to use four standoffs and the way that
it's<00:01:39.729> attached<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.930> just<00:01:41.140> have<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:43.110> screw<00:01:44.759> head

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
it's attached you just have a screw head

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's attached you just have a screw head
that<00:01:46.329> has<00:01:46.689> a<00:01:47.250> bolt<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:49.210> threads<00:01:49.689> into<00:01:49.960> the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
that has a bolt that threads into the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.940 
that has a bolt that threads into the
base<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.490> that's<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.360> actual<00:01:52.740> screw<00:01:53.740> that's

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
base and that's the actual screw that's

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.569 
base and that's the actual screw that's
used<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.570> you've<00:01:55.570> got<00:01:55.750> four<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.140> them<00:01:56.579> let's

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
used and you've got four of them let's

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.149 
used and you've got four of them let's
screw<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:57.969> into<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.390> wall<00:01:58.829> through<00:01:59.829> the<00:01:59.950> back

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
screw it into the wall through the back

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.280 
screw it into the wall through the back
and<00:02:00.460> then<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:00.850> then

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and then this then

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.290 
and then this then
taxes<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.980> the<00:02:02.700> actual<00:02:03.800> standoff<00:02:05.150> which<00:02:06.150> is

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
taxes to the actual standoff which is

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.480 
taxes to the actual standoff which is
