00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
little absurd this is a good example of

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.610 
little absurd this is a good example of
mainstream<00:00:55.000> media<00:00:55.300> trying<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.080> create<00:00:56.320> fake

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
mainstream media trying to create fake

very<00:00:58.690> very<00:00:58.930> funny<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.620> obviously<00:00:59.920> is<00:01:00.549> not<00:01:00.850> a

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
very very funny it obviously is not a

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240 
media frenzy started when the senator
made<00:01:31.450> an<00:01:31.600> awkward<00:01:32.079> pause<00:01:32.259> there<00:01:33.039> it<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.219> right

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
made an awkward pause there it is right

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.209 
made an awkward pause there it is right
there<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:34.060> take<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.299> sip<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.630> water<00:01:34.990> right<00:01:35.649> okay

there to take a sip of water right okay
so<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.969> I<00:01:37.060> think<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:37.719> is<00:01:37.899> uh<00:01:37.929> being<00:01:38.530> this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
so I I think that this is uh being this

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.560 
so I I think that this is uh being this
is<00:01:39.039> an<00:01:39.130> example<00:01:39.429> of<00:01:39.549> CNN<00:01:40.000> being<00:01:40.210> overly
