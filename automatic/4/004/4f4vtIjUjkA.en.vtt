in

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.560 

and<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:35.970> secure<00:00:36.150> it<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and you can just secure it with a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.939 
and you can just secure it with a
hairpin

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.770 

everything's<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.179> coming<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
everything's going to be coming up to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
everything's going to be coming up to
this<00:00:42.899> crown<00:00:43.289> area<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> have

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
this crown area so you just want to have

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 
this crown area so you just want to have
a<00:00:45.449> little<00:00:45.719> bit<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> backcombing<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
a little bit of backcombing in that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.569 
a little bit of backcombing in that
crown<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:49.079> give<00:00:49.229> your<00:00:49.379> pin<00:00:49.620> something<00:00:50.129> to

settle in
so<00:00:53.379> you<00:00:53.440> just<00:00:53.710> take<00:00:53.949> a<00:00:54.010> little<00:00:54.250> section<00:00:55.170> just

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
so you just take a little section just

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.670 
so you just take a little section just
backcomb<00:00:56.500> bit<00:00:57.809> half-up<00:00:58.809> half-down<00:00:58.840> can<00:00:59.530> be

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
backcomb bit half-up half-down can be

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.479 
backcomb bit half-up half-down can be

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
anywhere from the tip of the ear up you

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.020 
anywhere from the tip of the ear up you
can<00:01:03.730> just<00:01:03.760> do<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.690> top<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.250> can<00:01:06.640> come<00:01:06.880> all

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
can just do the top or you can come all

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.020 
can just do the top or you can come all
the<00:01:07.119> way<00:01:07.150> from<00:01:07.509> underneath<00:01:07.810> here<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:10.000> it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
the way from underneath here and have it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
the way from underneath here and have it
come<00:01:10.270> up

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
come up

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.340 
come up
so<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> think<00:01:12.480> we're<00:01:12.659> gonna<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.020> we'll

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so I think we're gonna do that we'll

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.450 
so I think we're gonna do that we'll
take<00:01:13.560> from<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.780> below<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.080> ear<00:01:16.260> at<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> nape

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
take from just below the ear at the nape

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.539 
take from just below the ear at the nape
area

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
area

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:29.490 
area
straight<00:01:20.240> up<00:01:20.420> towards<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.869> crown

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.390 

and<00:01:29.920> using<00:01:30.340> mostly<00:01:30.700> our<00:01:30.850> fingers<00:01:31.300> a<00:01:32.400> little

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
and using mostly our fingers a little

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.109 
and using mostly our fingers a little
bit<00:01:33.550> of<00:01:33.700> pomade

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.139 

and<00:01:37.479> rake<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.409> through<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.820> through<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.939> hair

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
and rake it through the through the hair

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.940 
and rake it through the through the hair
just<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.509> create<00:01:40.869> definition<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:41.619> get<00:01:41.770> rid<00:01:41.890> of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
just to create definition and get rid of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.300 
just to create definition and get rid of
those<00:01:42.070> little<00:01:42.219> flyaway<00:01:42.789> pieces<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.920> best<00:01:45.130> way

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
those little flyaway pieces the best way

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.929 
those little flyaway pieces the best way
to<00:01:45.340> secure<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.149> hair<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:48.369> tie<00:01:48.579> it<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.819> a

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
to secure the hair is to tie it in a

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.700 
to secure the hair is to tie it in a
knot<00:01:49.469> and<00:01:50.469> this<00:01:50.679> comes<00:01:50.950> out<00:01:51.130> really<00:01:52.000> easily

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.320 

so<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.340> don't<00:01:55.550> have<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.760> worry<00:01:55.910> about<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
so you don't have to worry about the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.310 
so you don't have to worry about the
hair<00:01:56.510> getting<00:01:56.780> stuck

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
hair getting stuck

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.539 
hair getting stuck
but<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.409> creates<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.799> little<00:01:59.920> bit<00:02:00.009> of<00:02:00.100> softness

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
but it creates a little bit of softness

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.300 
but it creates a little bit of softness
and<00:02:01.479> then<00:02:01.719> it<00:02:01.840> gives<00:02:01.960> your<00:02:02.229> pins<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.829> nice<00:02:03.009> place

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
and then it gives your pins a nice place

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.760 
and then it gives your pins a nice place
to<00:02:03.549> set<00:02:03.820> in

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.150 

so<00:02:07.250> then<00:02:07.400> you<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:07.549> secure<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.450> knot

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.300 

and<00:02:11.520> we'll<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.850> other<00:02:11.880> side

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.270 

and<00:02:16.520> then<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.120> take<00:02:17.330> your<00:02:17.450> last<00:02:17.660> section

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.210 

take<00:02:21.910> this

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
take this

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.970 
take this
to<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.820> third<00:02:24.150> not

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.979 

and<00:02:31.340> then<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.580> can<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:31.910> push<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.720> create

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
and then you can just push it to create

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.350 
and then you can just push it to create
a<00:02:33.080> little<00:02:33.230> bit<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:34.300> lift

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.530 

and<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:41.160> secure<00:02:42.160> that

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.500
