Steve you taking up why do you think
that<00:02:01.510> so<00:02:01.870> I<00:02:02.140> think<00:02:02.830> Kobe's<00:02:03.400> not<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.760> player

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
that so I think Kobe's not the player

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.390 
that so I think Kobe's not the player
that<00:02:04.030> he<00:02:04.270> once<00:02:04.480> was<00:02:04.720> Kevin<00:02:05.350> mean<00:02:05.560> he's<00:02:05.980> not<00:02:06.190> as

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
that he once was Kevin mean he's not as

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.750 
that he once was Kevin mean he's not as
athletic<00:02:06.580> he's<00:02:07.120> not<00:02:07.360> as<00:02:08.050> capable<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:09.070> he<00:02:09.580> used

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
athletic he's not as capable as he used

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.600 
athletic he's not as capable as he used
to<00:02:09.910> be<00:02:10.060> getting<00:02:10.420> shots<00:02:10.720> off<00:02:11.070> against<00:02:12.070> any<00:02:12.310> type

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
to be getting shots off against any type

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.940 
to be getting shots off against any type
of<00:02:12.640> defense<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:14.170> think<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.560> rest<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
of defense and I think the rest of the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.620 
of defense and I think the rest of the
guys<00:02:15.040> maybe<00:02:15.280> lost<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.790> little<00:02:15.910> confidence<00:02:16.480> in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
guys maybe lost a little confidence in

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.230 
guys maybe lost a little confidence in
themselves<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.650> result<00:02:18.130> thinking<00:02:19.060> back<00:02:19.180> to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
themselves as a result thinking back to

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.300 
themselves as a result thinking back to
LeBron<00:02:19.690> you'd<00:02:20.050> have<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.380> think<00:02:20.440> he'd<00:02:20.830> go<00:02:21.040> about

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
LeBron you'd have to think he'd go about

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.970 
LeBron you'd have to think he'd go about
the<00:02:21.550> way<00:02:21.700> he<00:02:21.910> left<00:02:22.240> Cleveland<00:02:22.980> slightly

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
the way he left Cleveland slightly

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.160 
the way he left Cleveland slightly
different<00:02:24.640> in<00:02:24.760> retrospect<00:02:25.750> if<00:02:25.900> he<00:02:25.990> had<00:02:26.140> a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
different in retrospect if he had a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.410 
different in retrospect if he had a
chance<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.830> redo<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.940> rewind<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.750> bit
