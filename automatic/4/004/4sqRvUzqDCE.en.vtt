finally<00:01:23.870> place<00:01:24.110> your<00:01:24.320> solar<00:01:24.560> water<00:01:24.890> distiller

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
finally place your solar water distiller

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.969 
finally place your solar water distiller
outside<00:01:25.850> in<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.060> bright<00:01:26.210> Sun<00:01:26.710> you'll<00:01:27.710> soon

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
outside in the bright Sun you'll soon

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.380 
outside in the bright Sun you'll soon
notice<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.670> water<00:01:28.909> will<00:01:29.150> begin

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
notice that the water will begin

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.630 
notice that the water will begin
collecting<00:01:29.750> on<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.140> plastic<00:01:30.530> wrap<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:31.430> is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
collecting on the plastic wrap this is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.450 
collecting on the plastic wrap this is
because<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.060> evaporation<00:01:32.300> as<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:34.250> water

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
because of evaporation as the water

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.609 
because of evaporation as the water
collects<00:01:34.940> it<00:01:35.270> will<00:01:35.420> slowly<00:01:35.630> trickle<00:01:36.170> down<00:01:36.200> and

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
collects it will slowly trickle down and

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.230 
collects it will slowly trickle down and
then<00:01:36.710> fall<00:01:36.950> into<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.369> small<00:01:37.640> container<00:01:37.790> in

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
then fall into the small container in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240 
then fall into the small container in
the<00:01:38.330> middle<00:01:38.570> after<00:01:39.500> it's<00:01:39.860> been<00:01:40.040> out<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.160> the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
the middle after it's been out in the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.100 
the middle after it's been out in the
Sun<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.700> three<00:01:40.729> or<00:01:40.940> four<00:01:41.000> hours<00:01:41.150> take<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> look

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
Sun for three or four hours take a look

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.320 
Sun for three or four hours take a look
at<00:01:42.229> what<00:01:42.350> you've<00:01:42.470> collected<00:01:42.880> you'll<00:01:43.880> see<00:01:44.150> that

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
at what you've collected you'll see that

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.640 
at what you've collected you'll see that
many<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.780> impurities<00:01:45.350> have<00:01:45.500> been

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
many of the impurities have been

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.070 
many of the impurities have been
filtered<00:01:46.070> out<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.490> evaporated<00:01:47.060> water<00:01:47.240> you

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
filtered out of the evaporated water you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.690 
filtered out of the evaporated water you
won't<00:01:48.229> find<00:01:48.440> any<00:01:48.680> dirt<00:01:49.009> in<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.280> collection

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
won't find any dirt in the collection
