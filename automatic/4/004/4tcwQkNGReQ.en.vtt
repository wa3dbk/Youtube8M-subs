you are traveling they are designed a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.020 
you are traveling they are designed a
lot<00:00:35.670> better<00:00:36.149> than<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.750> original<00:00:38.030> headphones

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
as you can see the difference so you can

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.529 
as you can see the difference so you can
unwind<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.800> cord<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.489> take<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.300> off<00:00:45.980> and

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
unwind the cord here take that off and

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.610 
unwind the cord here take that off and
once<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.899> those<00:00:49.320> unwind<00:00:50.250> adduce<00:00:50.700> e<00:00:51.620> we

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
once you have those unwind adduce e we

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.010 
once you have those unwind adduce e we
do<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.430> remote<00:00:53.969> mic<00:00:54.300> here<00:00:54.660> which

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
do have the remote mic here which

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.619 
do have the remote mic here which
increases<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> volume<00:00:56.340> decreases<00:00:57.149> along

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
increases the volume decreases along

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.279 
increases the volume decreases along
with<00:00:57.840> next<00:00:58.770> track<00:00:59.039> previous<00:00:59.609> track<00:01:00.020> using<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
with next track previous track using the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.619

inside<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.920> Apple<00:02:08.369> earpods<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:09.000> been

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
inside the Apple earpods have been

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.420 
inside the Apple earpods have been
engineered<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.810> minimize<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.920> sound<00:02:11.190> loss

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
engineered to minimize the sound loss

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.380 
engineered to minimize the sound loss
and<00:02:11.700> maximize<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.209> sound<00:02:12.810> out

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
and maximize the sound out

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.720 
and maximize the sound out
so<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.620> been<00:02:14.770> using<00:02:14.890> them<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.520> bit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730
