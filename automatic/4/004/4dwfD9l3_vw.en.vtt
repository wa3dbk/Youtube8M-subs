00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.090
 Now, good for you, if it's going to be more 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.550
 discreet that things a match 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.130
 very discreet a little party 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.920
 we followed a game where except the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.560
 pomp of the monumental the soler of the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.030
 military band that played the anthem before and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.480
 the players the names but after 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.480
 the game 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.960
 explain the first time statement of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.230
 san lorenzo without explaining enduring in 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 his field to river and seeing what happened 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.219
 really a river team 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.840
 diminished 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.809
 with many substitutes prizes a salary 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:47.879
 champion of america with a team has 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:49.890
 many players in our house has 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.210
 demonstrated in this championship without piatti 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.739
 without strap and noble piatti pump 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.920
 strap that can play much better to the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.050
 ball that is a better attitude than 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.180
 when they saw good or bad king is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.539
 playing badly only only lost 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.539
 a match 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.920
 however what is the problem 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.400
 principal 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:21.340
 they do not explain anything about victories I did not have 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.500
 more when this couple and 53 if not what 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.470
 does outside liberators did not win the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.149
 four games for victories adding up 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.470
 liberators and championship cup I think 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.720
 when rivero takes out the backpack of the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.950
 liberators for good or bad a 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.509
 very heavy backpack that is the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 classification and the pressure that it has 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.160
 river to qualify for the round of 16 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.630
 but there are times that psychologically not 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.789
 Play this issue but sometimes the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.649
 product of just being in fernando 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.810
 wise random but team is 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.970
 accustomed to playing finals this team 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.250
 to demonstrate a past semester play 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.920
 final and have come out graceful is a 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.259
 deficit that has in the mouth steal in 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.539
 acepar failed at key moments failed 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.100
 with river in the South American failed with 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.020
 racing and with just launched in champion to 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.729
 Bieber ate 5 - and then he won the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.860
 recopa talking about cup when he had to play 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.720
 for a title to see you have to see both 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.820
 we continue as they react at the moment 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.190
 decisive it seems that the two are in 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.950
 transition 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.860
 in the mouth a transition passed and to be 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.390
 settling on the river step will be sitting 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.780
 and it seems to be in transition now 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.000
 lorenzo 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.150
 you know with the explanation that 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.650
 meeting in the historical tradition to me 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.540
 what those who know about me 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.830
 tradition and history is that san lorenzo 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.970
 with river 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.170
 Whatever happens as a grandchild 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.330
 I do not know if that question ends up playing 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.560
 somehow the truth is that I do not 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.850
 I know this is explained to me by the esoteric 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.310
 Bauza lost the six matches that 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.100
 directed to know the parties took a long time in 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.360
 put cauteruccio and cauterets for me 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:59.230
 humbly for tomorrow 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.060
 It must be technical and thank you very much 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.769
 we arrive at the place where we want to be 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.360
 good is going to expand the debate we are 2 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.360
 3 4 5 to 1 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.310
 you want to be there 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.980
 let's see what happened 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.230
 in the case of weak arsenals and by 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.330
 Of course, we put more emphasis on 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.570
 great controversy this happened with Germanic 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.570
