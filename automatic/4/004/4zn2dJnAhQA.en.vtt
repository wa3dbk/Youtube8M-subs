00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.909
 I'm just starting a fortune there 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.969
 groves stadin 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.969
 must 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.390
 I don't see that everywhere 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.989
 gerard reve 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.050
 m you see that along the sides 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 more has been touched and in that means that I am still full 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.450
 and look and if you do not do this after long understanding then you do cooperate 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.040
 come a while but not entirely 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.900
 so if you have one 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.130
 perfect backside 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.130
 only then can the front be perfect 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.320
 He is now working everywhere that ticks meet 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.360
 now I'm going on my own 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.700
 the thousand grain 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.330
 7 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.960
 k 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.090
 for an updated polishing that it will look like a mirror 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.680
 and there are other people 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.680
 3 with such a derby that if you 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.620
 a bit on aiming 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.810
 that is unfortunate than at that point then grabs but I would not at first 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.310
 do I go first see if I look at him like a mirror and then last 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.310
 with that limitation 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.930
 in addition to this extreme heat or records 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.530
 If you then have a ribbon when you impose it and not unimportant, it can already be 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.880
 to the end of coal 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.990
 that does not have this that is an unheard of annoyance 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.730
 then you have to take that into account 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.740
 the they start a flirt with this first 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.290
 because I want the team back wants the perfect hooves then no longer to 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.370
 come 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.370
 when I try to pay more attention in those three times 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.200
 it is an action you only do this once 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.610
 or you've caught on with the line of heaven 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.900
 and then you must do it again he must serve as a cut 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.659
 be a mirror 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.089
 That is precisely in the first instance that the majority role as and that he has the opportunity to 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.899
 grabbed 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:25.819
 But that is not true when it comes to proof of not being there anyway 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.149
 just grab it so I don't either 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.869
 the tranquility that I think it can be a high-quality offer most up to ten years 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:36.299
 a number of blind spot accidents just it has been proven 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.109
 so impact on the chip limit 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.429
 the helicopter can go there every month 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.739
 then I just grab 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.979
 the corner 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.919
 that the cut 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.249
 a 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.249
 the jury peace quick result 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.379
 a few nevertheless continued with dead 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.120
 to take a thousand tons so I go laws there and then 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.419
 I go back and forth a few times 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.419
 or anyway 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.759
 you hear the purchase from what he does in the beginning made more sounds heard 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.719
 I what a harder one 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:52.400
 drag moments and let's believe it were pretty less so 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.399
 sound 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.479
 not too hard or pressing 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.599
 a site in which way nature does and he did research 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.210
 on 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.919
 sooner so not too hard 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.450
 the more did the intelligence service shin behind little one in feeling 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.430
 that the gingerbread press 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.069
 and especially that 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.860
 who made a prediction 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.759
 a pile of seriousness 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.569
 you can also do it with a ruler 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.569
 it is a matter of feeling 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.589
 13 have caught 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.770
 skeptically far enough 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.080
 the right pole country 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.770
 x metal worker 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.650
 well then it's good
