clash of clans was do not upgrade your
town<00:03:10.890> hall<00:03:11.220> until<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.850> upgraded<00:03:12.390> everything

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
town hall until you upgraded everything

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.800 
town hall until you upgraded everything
else<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.320> most<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.010> possibly<00:03:14.220> can

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810

bloody the house so I put one more down
they<00:04:25.650> took<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.890> cannon<00:04:26.160> out

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
they took the cannon out

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.830 
they took the cannon out
and<00:04:26.560> one<00:04:26.770> here<00:04:27.040> these<00:04:27.460> two<00:04:27.700> bad<00:04:28.360> boys<00:04:28.510> here

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840

let's speed this up a little bit and put

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.230 
let's speed this up a little bit and put
it<00:04:32.830> four<00:04:33.010> times<00:04:33.190> they<00:04:33.430> end<00:04:33.580> up<00:04:33.670> picking<00:04:33.910> up<00:04:34.060> all

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
the gold I got like I think nine

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.550 
the gold I got like I think nine
thousand<00:04:37.240> gold<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.660> MDS<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.170> hear<00:04:38.380> they're

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
thousand gold in the MDS to hear they're

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.350 
thousand gold in the MDS to hear they're
working<00:04:39.100> away<00:04:39.190> on<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.460> set<00:04:39.730> him<00:04:39.850> away<00:04:40.120> on

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
working away on that I set him away on

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.260 
working away on that I set him away on
this<00:04:40.510> elixir<00:04:41.470> pump<00:04:42.070> because<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:42.910> was<00:04:43.060> where

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
this elixir pump because that was where

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.610 
this elixir pump because that was where
he<00:04:43.390> scored<00:04:43.600> most<00:04:44.080> of<00:04:44.200> it<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.440> is

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
he scored most of it and that is

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.410 
he scored most of it and that is
actually<00:04:44.770> what<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.100> care<00:04:45.700> more<00:04:45.910> for<00:04:45.970> rather

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
actually what I care more for rather

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.540 
actually what I care more for rather
than<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.750> gold<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:47.890> sent<00:04:48.100> another<00:04:48.310> guy<00:04:48.520> on

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
than the gold so I sent another guy on

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.100 
than the gold so I sent another guy on
there<00:04:48.790> they<00:04:48.970> damaged<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.450> so<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.720> picking<00:04:50.020> up

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
there they damaged that so I picking up

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.330 
there they damaged that so I picking up
more<00:04:50.200> gold<00:04:50.440> at<00:04:50.560> this<00:04:50.680> stage<00:04:50.890> I'd<00:04:51.070> already<00:04:51.190> had

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
more gold at this stage I'd already had

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.890 
more gold at this stage I'd already had
maximum<00:04:51.790> amount<00:04:52.090> of<00:04:52.180> gold<00:04:52.420> so<00:04:52.570> I<00:04:52.600> didn't

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
maximum amount of gold so I didn't

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.170 
maximum amount of gold so I didn't
really<00:04:53.140> make<00:04:53.470> any<00:04:53.920> difference<00:04:54.730> but<00:04:55.120> I

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
really make any difference but I

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.060 
really make any difference but I
destroyed<00:04:55.630> both<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:56.050> those<00:04:56.170> bad<00:04:56.530> boys<00:04:56.560> there

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
destroyed both of those bad boys there

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.410 
destroyed both of those bad boys there

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
little bit more elixir there that I

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.330 
little bit more elixir there that I
could<00:05:38.260> have<00:05:38.380> taken<00:05:38.530> he's<00:05:38.770> upgraded<00:05:39.220> that<00:05:39.310> a

air<00:05:40.720> space<00:05:41.020> there<00:05:41.290> but<00:05:41.950> I<00:05:41.979> pretty<00:05:42.190> much

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
air space there but I pretty much

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.700 
air space there but I pretty much
demolished<00:05:42.850> his<00:05:43.000> whole<00:05:43.180> camp<00:05:43.479> and<00:05:44.290> that

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
demolished his whole camp and that

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.969 
demolished his whole camp and that
brings<00:05:44.919> us<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:45.250> where<00:05:45.820> we<00:05:46.000> are<00:05:46.030> now<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:46.870> this<00:05:47.770> is

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
brings us to where we are now so this is

whilst we're still building up and

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.060 
whilst we're still building up and
hopefully<00:06:55.000> we<00:06:55.270> can<00:06:55.390> go<00:06:55.510> on<00:06:55.720> get<00:06:56.260> ourselves<00:06:56.350> I'm
