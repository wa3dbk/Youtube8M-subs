again<00:01:28.040> conscience<00:01:29.040> drives<00:01:29.430> us<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> our<00:01:29.909> knees

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
again conscience drives us to our knees

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.899 
again conscience drives us to our knees

but there is no sweet fellowship with

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.749 
but there is no sweet fellowship with
God<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.200> no<00:01:34.380> telling<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.340> our<00:01:35.460> wants

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

God there is no telling out of our wants
to<00:01:36.090> him<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.900> firm<00:01:37.110> conviction<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:38.040> he

to him in the firm conviction that he
will<00:01:38.460> supply<00:01:38.850> them<00:01:39.530> after<00:01:40.530> having<00:01:40.860> gone<00:01:41.070> again

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
will supply them after having gone again

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.639 
will supply them after having gone again
through<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> certain<00:01:42.509> round<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.079> customary

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
through a certain round of customary

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.039 
through a certain round of customary
utterances<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:45.149> rise<00:01:45.390> from<00:01:45.420> our<00:01:45.840> knees

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
utterances we rise from our knees

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.649 
utterances we rise from our knees
perhaps<00:01:46.920> more<00:01:47.280> troubled<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.820> conscience<00:01:48.360> and

perhaps more troubled in conscience and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.810 
perhaps more troubled in conscience and
more<00:01:49.020> distressed<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.860> mind<00:01:50.159> than<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.670> were

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
more distressed in mind than we were

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.469 
more distressed in mind than we were
before<00:01:52.100> there<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.130> many<00:01:53.280> Christians<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.149> think

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
before there are many Christians I think

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.870 
before there are many Christians I think
who<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.990> complain<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.670> they

who have to complain of this that they

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.569 
who have to complain of this that they
pray<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.960> much<00:01:58.170> because<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> blessed

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
pray not so much because it is a blessed

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.700 
pray not so much because it is a blessed
thing<00:01:59.610> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.390> allowed<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> draw<00:02:01.110> near<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> God

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
thing to be allowed to draw near to God
