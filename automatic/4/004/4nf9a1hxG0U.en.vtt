00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.970
 [musics] 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.600
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.040
 Oh oh oh 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.210
 cl 2 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.210
 [applause] 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:32.060
 I wanted to be a pro 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:33.410
 My father went to see his father's tournament at a professional bowler, but that's about my second grade in junior high school 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:41.300
 It was 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:43.160
 I saw that I won the tournament and I also wanted to do something like this in the world 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.180
 It is an opportunity 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 I think that I will aim for professional from then on 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.370
 The 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.000
 Beat the high school and go to the bowling alley 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.870
 Every day really 30 games 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.160
 To the page 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.060
 In two years 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.350
 I was professional at 17 but 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.310
 I say mixed doubles once a year 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.970
 It teamed up dance Puru' and women's professional 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:15.880
 There is a tournament to do, but with the main such as 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:19.190
 It was my dream of becoming a professional to win the parent and child team with Otoo 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.670
 And that first victory was that 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.670
 pt 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.100
 Consider now 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.729
 It is very much better from waiting than professional test 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.300
 It's not that it's a good thing to say once it got better once, so even today it's better 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.490
 It will be worse tomorrow 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.290
 I in the middle 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.620
 Because I may be upset 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.890
 Or say ophthalmic 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.990
 Oh dear 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:56.810
 Toka or wearing their favorite-body Japan this day, such as game 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.810
 I think bowling and really mental are important 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:09.190
 Because it still is in the teens once again when the 20s 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.350
 I 'm in my twenties and now in my thirties, but I'm totally different from fatigue 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.640
 After all care Toka is 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.410
 [musics] 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:25.060
 But whether the tournament I'm such Toka start from morning 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:29.050
 Event thing or something quite night 8 o'clock start day 9 o'clock start day 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.680
 So it's really irregular 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.680
 I am also asked to use Mr. Kumi's mat, but at home 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.430
 Also sleep is you I still toward the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.569
 More than a hotel 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.569
 [applause] 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.530
 After all, I do I have any good anymore and I think that together 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.150
 I have to win 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.560
 Because I don't think it makes sense 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.560
 I want to win after all 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.330
 Bankruptcy even though still working hard 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.400
 Now with my father 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.400
 Tteyuu Which is whether the minority that say earlier 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.480
 I promise to work hard with each other 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.950
 Hey 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.129
 Still now 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.129
 Kedomo I'd say I want to as long as possible
