representatives<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.090> think<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:25.230> goal<00:02:25.470> here

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500

is<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.160> meet<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.760> full<00:02:27.090> spectrum<00:02:27.750> of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
is to meet with a full spectrum of

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.069 
is to meet with a full spectrum of
voices<00:02:28.410> from<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.130> country<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:30.269> addition<00:02:30.900> to

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
voices from the country in addition to

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.800 
voices from the country in addition to
government<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.769> think<00:02:32.489> that's<00:02:32.640> very<00:02:32.760> smart<00:02:33.390> and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
government I think that's very smart and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.479 
government I think that's very smart and
I<00:02:34.049> think<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.410> exactly<00:02:34.799> what<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.069> United

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
I think it's exactly what the United

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.339 
I think it's exactly what the United
States<00:02:35.730> should<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.180> doing<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.690> building

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
States should be doing is building

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.520 
States should be doing is building
relationships<00:02:38.280> with<00:02:38.870> various<00:02:39.870> sectors

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
relationships with various sectors

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.180 
relationships with various sectors
within<00:02:40.890> Myanmar<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.110> especially<00:02:43.190> civil

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
within Myanmar and especially civil

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.319 
within Myanmar and especially civil
society<00:02:44.730> groups<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:47.069> will<00:02:47.280> allow<00:02:48.000> them

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
society groups and this will allow them

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.289 
society groups and this will allow them
to<00:02:48.660> have<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> bigger<00:02:49.140> voice<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.269> shore<00:02:51.269> up

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
to have a bigger voice and shore up

00:02:51.299 --> 00:03:01.470 
to have a bigger voice and shore up
their<00:02:51.959> presence<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.099> country<00:02:53.519> as<00:02:53.640> well

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.170 

so<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.110> think<00:03:02.290> Beijing<00:03:03.280> will<00:03:03.459> be<00:03:03.610> watching<00:03:04.060> this

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
so I think Beijing will be watching this

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.000 
so I think Beijing will be watching this
visit<00:03:04.599> very<00:03:04.810> closely<00:03:05.790> they'll<00:03:07.440> be<00:03:08.440> looking<00:03:08.680> in

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
visit very closely they'll be looking in

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.680 
visit very closely they'll be looking in
particular<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.849> see<00:03:10.590> what<00:03:11.590> results<00:03:11.799> from<00:03:12.310> it

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
particular to see what results from it

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.210 
particular to see what results from it
one<00:03:13.690> thing<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.200> United<00:03:14.530> States<00:03:14.799> has<00:03:14.950> been

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
one thing the United States has been

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.960 
one thing the United States has been
laying<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.610> groundwork<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.180> is

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
laying the groundwork for is

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.030 
laying the groundwork for is
military-to-military<00:03:19.170> ties<00:03:20.170> between

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
military-to-military ties between

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.670 
military-to-military ties between

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
Myanmar in the United States I don't

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.170 
Myanmar in the United States I don't

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
know if that will come to fruition with

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.839 
know if that will come to fruition with
this<00:03:25.420> visit<00:03:26.019> but<00:03:26.620> certainly<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.160> think<00:03:27.280> they're

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
this visit but certainly I think they're

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.150

shoring up trade and economic ties what

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.729 
shoring up trade and economic ties what
this<00:04:06.130> means<00:04:06.430> for<00:04:06.549> Beijing<00:04:07.349> they<00:04:08.349> will<00:04:08.530> likely

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
this means for Beijing they will likely

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.750 
this means for Beijing they will likely
see<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.340> as<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:10.630> very<00:04:11.109> strong<00:04:11.799> effort<00:04:12.310> to

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
see it as a very strong effort to

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.000 
see it as a very strong effort to
counter<00:04:12.970> balance<00:04:13.180> their<00:04:14.169> influence<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.919> the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
counter balance their influence in the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.069 
counter balance their influence in the
region<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:16.599> I<00:04:16.989> do<00:04:17.049> think<00:04:18.000> one<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.660> key

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
region and I do think one of the key

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.830 
region and I do think one of the key
challenges<00:04:20.109> facing<00:04:21.270> President<00:04:22.270> Obama<00:04:22.539> in<00:04:22.810> his

challenges facing President Obama in his

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.550 
challenges facing President Obama in his
second<00:04:23.349> term<00:04:23.470> will<00:04:23.800> be<00:04:24.490> how<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.880> manage<00:04:25.560> the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
second term will be how to manage the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.680 
second term will be how to manage the
relationship<00:04:26.740> with<00:04:27.370> Beijing<00:04:27.880> which<00:04:28.300> after

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
relationship with Beijing which after

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.190 
relationship with Beijing which after
all<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:29.490> arguably<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:31.180> most<00:04:31.210> important

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
all is arguably the most important

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.140 
all is arguably the most important
bilateral<00:04:32.580> relationship<00:04:33.580> for<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.820> United

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.120 
States and at the same time carry out
this<00:04:37.990> very<00:04:38.440> expansive<00:04:39.240> policy<00:04:40.240> towards<00:04:40.630> Asia

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
this very expansive policy towards Asia

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.560 
this very expansive policy towards Asia
so<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.310> is<00:04:42.460> going<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.820> be<00:04:42.940> take<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.419> is
