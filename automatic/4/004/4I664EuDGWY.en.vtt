 min 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.890
 2 I want you to point is a farce 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.039
 very well 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.569
 I put it in the palm of your hand 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.569
 could you tell me what letter is for the weight 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.579
 font ap 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.099
 I think it's from hearts 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.079
 it weighs quite 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.630
 without it must be 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.029
 the king of drinks 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.649
 expte 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.800
 with this work 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 I liked 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.720
 he also expressed 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 but they re-emerge 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.560
 I always say that magicians have a sixth sense and if you bet star of 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.840
 the saga 3 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.289
 looking 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.289
 three decades 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.560
 what 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.760
 in all this ascending process 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.819
 bianchi could be with all the beard 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.120
 I propose you a very nice game

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.270
 tvn the bm and attentive to what I'm going to do done letters to my right and my 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300
 left 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 you're wondering why not 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.220
 these very attentive 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.760
 simply separated the colors 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 putting the red to my right 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.930
 and black 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 to my left 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.460
 choose three letters 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.870
 from the deck 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.730
 and he does not want them 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.850
 these very well 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.200
 we put them in a visible place on the table 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:14.019
 now who believe that life what I believe is that it is one of the letters 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.779
 while I do exactly the same 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.099
 so that there are no pitfalls the spokeswoman to the unasur her role 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.429

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.999
 red 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.459
 the immigrant 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.379
 the Red 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.379
 black 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.739
 here are four aces, what will I lose by the deck? 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:11.949
 he knew he makes them have fantastic powers 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:14.909
 for example 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.579
 the ace of hearts 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.650
 the power of love 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.620
 the ace of spades 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.680
 the power of work 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 another one of the money the diamond 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.580
 very equal we always need a bit of luck 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.599
 I will give you 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.599
 two loose aces 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.039
 while I turned around 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.039
 on the table 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.809
 imagine that you are like authentic 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.819
 you will understand cheat 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.819
 guess with two posts 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:10.499
 I would bet all my money crowded 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.770
 let's play the famous lie detector game I'm going to be the 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.990
 detector and you can feel month when you want the game consists of the film the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.000
 letter that taught you and I'll tell you if you lie elms 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.130
 the selections and punishment so it feels from the heart of jesus the dietitians 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.229
 correct 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.919
 the fact that ortiz saddens me 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.809
 What is your name 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:50.259
 paco 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.680
 Hello Paco 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.259
 what will I do one more goal 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.860
 I take a letter 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.860
 memorize it 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.039
 and forlÃ¡n 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.400
 we mix 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.400
 and now I'm going to try to guess your letter 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.529
 but I think it's going to be difficult to find by the classical method 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:17.439
 so look 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:20.439
 Celeste or your name 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.469
 and your letter appears 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.509
 I want you to collect cards from the deck 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.449
 delta we put it on the table 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:33.570
 no other 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.570
 we put it next to the first 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.050
 now 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.050
 I'm going to take this paper and write a prediction 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.830
 On the one hand I blog so that nobody sees it until the end 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.830
 next I want you to point out that neither of the two legs 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.759
 this one we discard it 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.379
 now let's verify and your letter coincide with my prediction 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.449
 incredible corresponds with touching it 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.930
 but of course we verify that the other letter that you chose technically 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.719
 I love
