00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
bigger and you know I've been using this

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.520 
bigger and you know I've been using this
bucket<00:01:43.760> on<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.850> belt<00:01:44.090> system<00:01:44.510> now<00:01:44.660> for<00:01:44.930> a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
bucket on the belt system now for a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.290 
bucket on the belt system now for a
little<00:01:46.070> over<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.340> month<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.940> tell<00:01:47.120> you<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
little over a month and to tell you the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.720 
little over a month and to tell you the
truth<00:01:47.570> maybe<00:01:48.440> not<00:01:49.100> getting<00:01:49.310> around<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.700> doing

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
truth maybe not getting around to doing

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.090 
truth maybe not getting around to doing
this<00:01:49.970> two<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:51.650> reason<00:01:51.770> why<00:01:51.950> is

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
this two of you the reason why is

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.350 
this two of you the reason why is
probably<00:01:52.550> cuz<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.790> haven't<00:01:53.060> really<00:01:53.240> thought

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
probably cuz I haven't really thought

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.870 
probably cuz I haven't really thought
about<00:01:53.420> anything<00:01:54.200> special<00:01:54.830> in<00:01:55.370> regards<00:01:55.820> to

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
about anything special in regards to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.670 
about anything special in regards to
this<00:01:56.060> bucket<00:01:56.480> on<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.570> belt<00:01:56.840> now<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.500> may

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
this bucket on the belt now that may

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.620 
this bucket on the belt now that may
seem<00:01:57.740> at<00:01:58.130> first<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.460> be<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.580> negative<00:01:58.940> criticism

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
seem at first to be a negative criticism

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.350 
seem at first to be a negative criticism
but<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.990> course<00:02:00.730> you<00:02:01.730> know<00:02:01.820> one<00:02:01.970> tool<00:02:02.210> is

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
but of course you know one tool is

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.870 
but of course you know one tool is
working<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.960> way<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.200> supposed<00:02:03.260> to<00:02:03.880> you

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
working the way it's supposed to you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.350
