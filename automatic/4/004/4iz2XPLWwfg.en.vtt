is the board world

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.250 
is the board world
Malka<00:00:18.449> door<00:00:18.710> in<00:00:19.710> furnace<00:00:20.720> it's<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.810> pretty<00:00:22.020> big

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
Malka door in furnace it's a pretty big

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.950 
Malka door in furnace it's a pretty big
tank<00:00:22.560> guys<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.820> I'm<00:00:23.939> gonna<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.630> I'm

tank guys so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
tank guys so what I'm gonna do is I'm
just<00:00:24.990> gonna<00:00:25.320> split<00:00:25.619> off<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:30.560> get<00:00:31.560> bit<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
just gonna split off the get bit at the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.620 
just gonna split off the get bit at the
back<00:00:32.099> there

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
back there

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
back there
and<00:00:33.630> we're<00:00:33.960> gonna<00:00:34.079> go<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.770> look<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> bit

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and we're gonna go and look at it a bit

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.180 
and we're gonna go and look at it a bit
at<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> time<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.530> we've<00:00:37.530> weathered<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.040> whole

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
at a time so we've weathered the whole

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.790 
at a time so we've weathered the whole
thing<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:43.079> he's<00:00:43.230> looking<00:00:43.530> pretty<00:00:43.559> mean

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.360 

so<00:00:47.460> you've<00:00:48.210> seen<00:00:48.390> an<00:00:48.510> earlier<00:00:48.810> video<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.950> think

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
so you've seen an earlier video I think

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660

so<00:01:37.710> far<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:39.149> bit<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> play<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.930> some

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
so far a little bit of a play with some

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.160 
so far a little bit of a play with some
weathering<00:01:41.729> powders<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.660> spots<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
weathering powders for little spots of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.249 
weathering powders for little spots of
rust<00:01:43.380> coming<00:01:43.770> down<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:45.360> main<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.140> I've

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
rust coming down the main bit that I've

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.280 
rust coming down the main bit that I've
used<00:01:46.680> weathering<00:01:47.160> powder<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.990> part

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
used weathering powder on on this part

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.139 
used weathering powder on on this part
of<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> machines<00:01:50.539> is<00:01:51.539> here<00:01:52.670> around<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.910> flame

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
of the machines is here around the flame

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.219 
of the machines is here around the flame
a<00:01:54.179> nozzle<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> nice<00:01:55.380> buildup<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:57.229> soot

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
a nozzle for a nice buildup of soot

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.139 
a nozzle for a nice buildup of soot
around<00:01:58.709> there<00:01:59.190> cuz<00:01:59.429> it's<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.610> big<00:01:59.759> old<00:01:59.910> flame<00:02:00.119> II

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
around there cuz it's a big old flame II

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.309 
around there cuz it's a big old flame II
tank<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:01.100> think<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.160> bit<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> soot<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:03.209> needed<00:02:03.750> as

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
tank I think a bit of soot is needed as

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.779 
tank I think a bit of soot is needed as
you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:04.830> bottom<00:02:05.039> there<00:02:05.220> very<00:02:05.700> very

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
you can see the bottom there very very

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.180 
you can see the bottom there very very
clean<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:07.110> now<00:02:07.200> when<00:02:07.289> ever<00:02:07.470> sees<00:02:07.679> the<00:02:07.950> bottom

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
clean just now when ever sees the bottom

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.830 
clean just now when ever sees the bottom
of<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> tank<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:09.600> just<00:02:09.780> goes<00:02:09.959> around<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.560> that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
of a tank it just goes around like that

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.390 
of a tank it just goes around like that
so<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.990> sponsons<00:02:14.180> with<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.890> heavy<00:02:16.890> stuber's

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so the sponsons with the heavy stuber's

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.540 
so the sponsons with the heavy stuber's
on<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> side<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:19.190> didn't<00:02:20.190> want<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.370> pay<00:02:20.490> too

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
on the side I didn't want to pay too

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.820 
on the side I didn't want to pay too
much<00:02:20.700> point<00:02:21.060> cost<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.569> them<00:02:21.750> because<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.709> end

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
much point cost for them because the end

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.130 
much point cost for them because the end
of<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> day<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.610> an<00:02:24.060> anti<00:02:24.360> troop<00:02:24.660> weapon

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
of the day this is an anti troop weapon
