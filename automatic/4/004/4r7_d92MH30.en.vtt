00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
have my drums set up so any movement is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.000 
have my drums set up so any movement is
relatively<00:00:21.600> easy<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.170> I'm<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.650> struggling

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
relatively easy and I'm not struggling

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.640

height<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.640> I'm<00:00:29.730> not<00:00:29.880> putting<00:00:30.240> too<00:00:30.269> much

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
height so I'm not putting too much

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470 
height so I'm not putting too much
effort<00:00:30.779> into<00:00:31.109> hitting<00:00:31.410> them<00:00:32.180> take<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> look<00:00:33.270> at

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480

is something I picked up from Flo from
Krypton<00:01:59.410> see<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.800> lot<00:02:00.550> of<00:02:00.580> guys<00:02:00.789> like<00:02:01.000> sitting

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
Krypton see a lot of guys like sitting

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.969 
Krypton see a lot of guys like sitting
higher<00:02:01.509> for<00:02:01.810> speed<00:02:02.050> but<00:02:02.350> for<00:02:02.590> me<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:02.710> lose

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
higher for speed but for me I lose

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.980 
higher for speed but for me I lose
control<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.550> way<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:04.539> is<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.720> total

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
control that way this is a total

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.419 
control that way this is a total
personal<00:02:05.320> preference<00:02:05.710> thing<00:02:05.890> but<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.130> figured

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
personal preference thing but I figured

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:22.760 
personal preference thing but I figured
I'd<00:02:06.520> show<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.700> guys<00:02:06.910> how<00:02:07.179> I<00:02:07.210> do<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.570> anyways

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.140 

here's<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.830> close-up<00:02:24.100> shot<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.940> beater

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
here's a close-up shot on the beater

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.090 
here's a close-up shot on the beater
angle<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.720> keep<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.170> really<00:02:26.380> close<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.890> head

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
angle I keep it really close to the head

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.860 
angle I keep it really close to the head
probably<00:02:27.430> closer<00:02:27.760> than<00:02:27.940> any<00:02:28.330> other<00:02:28.480> drummer

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
probably closer than any other drummer

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.990 
probably closer than any other drummer
that<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:29.140> know<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:30.190> I've<00:02:30.310> headed<00:02:30.460> this<00:02:30.610> way<00:02:30.670> for

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
that I know but I've headed this way for

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.490 
that I know but I've headed this way for
so<00:02:31.300> long<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.690> I'm<00:02:31.810> really<00:02:32.020> comfortable<00:02:32.410> with

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
so long that I'm really comfortable with

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.380 
so long that I'm really comfortable with
it<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:33.130> idea<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.910> closer<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
it the idea is that the closer the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.240 
it the idea is that the closer the
beater<00:02:34.569> is<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.080> head<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.830> less<00:02:36.040> distance

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
beater is to the head the less distance

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.000 
beater is to the head the less distance
it<00:02:36.670> has<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.850> travel<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.420> hit<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.690> if<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.710> prefer

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
it has to travel to hit it if you prefer

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.410 
it has to travel to hit it if you prefer
a<00:02:39.040> big<00:02:39.250> swing<00:02:39.550> when<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.850> use<00:02:39.970> your<00:02:40.000> pedal

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
a big swing when you use your pedal

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
a big swing when you use your pedal
though<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.660> definitely<00:02:41.020> don't<00:02:41.080> want<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.319> have

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
though you definitely don't want to have

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.020 
though you definitely don't want to have
it<00:02:41.530> set<00:02:41.710> up<00:02:41.800> like<00:02:41.830> this

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
