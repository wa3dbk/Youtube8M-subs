00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.929
 the local mart where the vans are 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.429
 according to there everyone here that danese 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.210
 Nice to have you there in this episode. 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.850
 from the aljube number four series 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.160
 open from there every week or every 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.869
 10 days every 15 days when the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 people have time to do things 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.260
 We're just dropping those 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.660
 videos there for you giving jazz tips 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.770
 dj for beginners to enthusiasts dj 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.239
 for the guys who want to know a 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.390
 a little more for the song anyway 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 talking about generic themes and this week 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.030
 I'll continue with you on the subject 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.649
 how to behave in a club as if 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.649
 behave in a nightclub 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.840
 That's right last week in the episode 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.030
 number 13 we talked about entry into 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 club talk to people etc 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.140
 We deal with this series by you 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 can see that I did not change shirt 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.609
 or cap or even we are recording everything 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.860
 same day for us to edit later with 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.010
 the weather though we also did not edith 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.170
 because it is a paulada only but ultimately what 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.939
 I wanted to talk to you about the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
 sound booth has on the haute 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.460
 Sound booth is first to remember that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.409
 booth is a place of work 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.380
 so one thing I've always been 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.860
 relatively against the woman in the cabin 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.900
 be a dj not a jay woman 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.210
 For god's sake , jazz women are 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.909
 very cool but when I say a dj and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.250
 a man with his wife with the wife of 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.229
 side with girlfriend on the side in the cabin 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.710
 does not look cool 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.890
 remember that sound booth is a stage 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.049
 people are there to watch you there 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.049
 You're an entertainer, are you? 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.180
 entertaining the people you're doing 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.759
 people to dance with your sound 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.630
 with their music and they get 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.310
 your attitude or the first posture 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.409
 have confidence when you're on stage 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.659
 people feel when you 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.399
 have insurance when you see there 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.459
 something that is not working and 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.900
 77 some failing cable and 700 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.530
 people are realizing it so without 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.540
 belt 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.520
 the insurance in the cabin that is one thing 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.040
 that we only conquer over time with 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.010
 the experience is eventually people 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.410
 It is insecure if the party is 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.060
 more important is less important if it is 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.220
 a place that means more or less to 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.290
 you finally have a number of aspects 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.950
 that make us feel more or 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.580
 less secure but try to be the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.260
 insurance possible because 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.640
 This business I spoke of as a woman in the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.350
 cabin for example 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.930
 imagine you an audience are you there 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.970
 looking at the person protects has a 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.050
 other person on his side standing statue 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.750
 this is not cool 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.000
 there is a friend who wants to be fit 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.760
 in the work place treat the booth 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.250
 like a stage even then who is in the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.310
 booth the dj illuminator etc. 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.830
 it is very important to keep this in mind of 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.890
 that there is a stage is a place for 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.940
 Entertainment're even sure this is a 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.459
 tip that I was going to give 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.330
 another tip be careful what you do 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.610
 in the cabin 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.150
 remember that everyone is there 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.670
 looking then stuck his finger in the nose 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.180
 of that pretty scratched here and there are 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.430
 habits not so well seen in the cabin and 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.540
 so remember that you are in a 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.100
 stage on drinks etc etc 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.190
 careful what you are going to do it seems obvious 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.500
 but it is a classic dropped a vodka copay 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.630
 on top of the mixer on top of the computer 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.340
 It's up to me and for example I'm 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.500
 tense when I'm sometimes in a 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.769
 that people put a 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.120
 cup there on top of 700 always shot such 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.890
 You have to speak with great care. 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.519
 nobody understands little but will not fall 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.859
 But he said that the party ends there, not everything. 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.260
 club has a mix of reserve has a cd 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.480
 backup player so take a lot of 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.970
 careful that's right this was over 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.220
