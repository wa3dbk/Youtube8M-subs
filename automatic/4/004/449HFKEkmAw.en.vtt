00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
h it looks like a comic book i'm

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.420 
h it looks like a comic book i'm
guessing<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.480> it's<00:01:55.720> just<00:01:55.960> some<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.430> Stone

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
guessing that it's just some of Stone

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.470
