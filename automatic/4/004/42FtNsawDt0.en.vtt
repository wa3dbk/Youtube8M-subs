 analysis these are just rushing and 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.889
 analysis in marseille 4 ninis 0 below 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.480

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.669
 link to enter the 4 goals of the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 local team that of marcelo bielsa that 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.410
 crushed the visiting team 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.150
 the dario cvitanich team that was 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.490
 in the bank because it may be that the 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.250
 come to sell to Palermo from Italy to 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.970
 the 19 minutes started winning the team 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.370
 local with the goal of paget after the 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.650
 45 marked tobin until the end of the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.590
 first time and when it was just starting 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.410
 the second to the 48 90 sweats of falles 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.110
 after a great center of tweets from 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.480
 the left of the right sorry 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.360
 the left-hander of a large center and of a popcorn 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.080
 payet I got the 30 the fourth goal was 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.409
 stuck by bar hits the 87 crushed him 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.580
 it was passed up by 60% of the position 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.379
 of ball but it never disturbed the lynx 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.350
 what he did would mark a line body that 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.780
 could play in the first of france 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.820
 with respect to all other players 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.740
 the water product was the marker 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.409
 central number 20 very hard 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.960
 to go to the collision a defender who in 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.420
 such a physical league is needed like this and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.659
 he was also so sloppy when he left 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.200
 playing lying in law the captain of 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.909
 tennis that always worked in the why 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.100
 had the only project in the middle 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.830
 he practically tried to be out playing it 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.770
 to the players while nicolÃ¡s 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.560
 cool is the color of essence the blond of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.810
 lefty who plays very well also does not 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.580
 played very well but played well was the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.649
 those rescued from the country to me and by 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.450
 characteristics I think it also 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.670
 deserves to be in the first division of 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.360
 France and not much more 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.729
 the lefty was the attempt the guy is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.590
 hit has this goal well and then 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.580
 was the Belgian player in two of the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.179
 seven that is one of the additions 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.429
 a playmaker who had a 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.709
 outside auction place that looked like 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.989
 mandanda that is going to complicate 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.010
 12 points so much and hit him perfect almost 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.439
 the number 7 to one meter step from 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 Something that likes the goalie 's goalie 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.430
 the selection of france or are very close 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.689
 of really the auction and then finished 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.030
 entering if it is there is when it is the 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.939
 match was 3 to 0 not good you 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.129
 we said the three goals of the marseille the 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.860
 first it comes from a center of the 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.680
 left of mÃ©ndy that ends up marking 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.530
 all good when your partner was shot 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.629
 to the floor and the employee of 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.370
 now he had the rebound yesterday in the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.750
 put against the right post of the goalkeeper 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.329
 What a lazy thing the goalkeeper's team 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.040
 of visitor especially for the departures 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.680
 remember that in this team attacked 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.970
 the final videos went to the arsenal of 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.760
 england and this guy the number 20 is 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.549
 the loser in this team that has 20 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.209
 years is the one that replaces the second 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:12.150
 goal came from a good country pass and the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.140
 I got in there for 21 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.960
 I searched and arrived tobin 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.030
 the midfielder one of the jewels of 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.090
 Marseille but I want to say also 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.130
 boys that for my way of seeing 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.990
 this player plays too late 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.970
 it is quite determining every time 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.520
 climbs a goal and put an assist 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.709
 perfect for the country popcorn in the 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.209
 third party so much I think that 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.220
 I should play a little later 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.910
 because what do you play marcelo bielsa yes 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.520
 well already started to win and prove it 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.640
 the predominance of that time always in 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.850
 the leagues where it competes is made from the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.290
 chile selection either in bilbao 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.910
 of the first stage because the second 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.910
 stage form the if you change a couple 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.340
 of players that was them 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.459
 Jaime Martinez because it has gone better 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.350
 was fundamental to the structure of the 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.050
 Argentine had missed a couple of 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.720
 power and apart others did not go back to 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.120
 have their best level 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.100
 but then in Chile also in the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.080
 Argentine team until the World Cup that 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.269
 happened what happened the product we know the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.170
 level of all teams had tried 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.510
 to impose his idea and achieved it now with 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.580
 two lanes that are sold that was a 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.870
 left handed number 23 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.990
 previously it was lateral now 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.680
 gardener on the left and on the right is 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.290
 tawin who plays short said he's going for the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.920
 right line that is area 9 and 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.390
 goleador and there in broken company 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.850
 constantly to play from 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.140
 midfielder from the extreme left 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.490
 we could say and play hooking me 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.360
 aims and the fourth as much 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.870
 that is with the anise that was practically 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.970
 the second time he played as a gift 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.440
 because he had played and they did not have winnings and 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.900
 be well a center on the right of 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.129
 fishing the defense they put back the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.759
 center they have the taco 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:11.219
 the one who throws the cue was normal 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.259
 I was wrong yesterday was the rebound the archer 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.259
 the mind one counts for inside and 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.659
 ends by marking the front to give 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.580
 the fourth so much of the game so already 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.469
 they know many who have work in the 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.029
 description part to enter to see 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:28.050
 the goals to reason to the olympique of 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:30.419
 Marseille and Bielsa start doing well 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.059
 his play would make to the carrileros by 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.319
 everything will be players before 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:36.239
 headlines but it's only being done 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.490
 used to call for reinforcements 

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:39.959
 it seems that you will have a player 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.419
 newcastle a ford transit is a loan 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:44.849
 it is also a central marker for 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.919
 add someone the defense so you have to 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:50.309
 you have to bring the expectation of Marseille 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.379
 because it's marcelo bielsa can be play 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:56.209
 even better is good we found more 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.209
 late a big hug sound
