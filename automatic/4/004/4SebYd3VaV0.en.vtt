that's the cruel bit then that's when we
stopped<00:02:00.460> feeding<00:02:00.610> them<00:02:00.940> ourselves<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.690> then

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
stopped feeding them ourselves and then

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080 
stopped feeding them ourselves and then
they<00:02:02.410> can<00:02:02.560> start<00:02:02.770> feeding<00:02:03.010> themselves<00:02:03.280> two

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
they can start feeding themselves two

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.969 
they can start feeding themselves two
days<00:02:04.330> later<00:02:04.570> they<00:02:05.290> don't<00:02:05.500> want<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.710> know<00:02:05.800> yeah

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
days later they don't want to know yeah

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.249 
days later they don't want to know yeah
really<00:02:06.670> yeah<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.060> they<00:02:07.180> just<00:02:07.390> keep<00:02:08.020> away<00:02:08.229> from

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
really yeah and they just keep away from

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.260 
really yeah and they just keep away from
you<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:08.709> all<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.890> effort<00:02:09.250> you've<00:02:10.090> put<00:02:10.119> into

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
you so all the effort you've put into

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.020 
you so all the effort you've put into
them<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.869> run<00:02:10.989> me<00:02:11.190> shown<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.430> which<00:02:12.850> is

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
them and run me shown you which is

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.940 
them and run me shown you which is
perfect<00:02:13.840> for<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.680> type<00:02:14.920> of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
perfect for that for this type of

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.830 
perfect for that for this type of
project<00:02:15.250> because<00:02:16.000> that's<00:02:16.209> what<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.480> need<00:02:16.630> we

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
project because that's what we need we

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.120 
project because that's what we need we
don't<00:02:16.989> want<00:02:17.200> them<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.470> come<00:02:17.620> near<00:02:17.800> human

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
don't want them to come near human

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.680 
don't want them to come near human
beings<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.580> we<00:02:18.640> don't<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:19.060> want<00:02:19.180> them<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.450> be

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
beings and we don't we want them to be

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.620 
beings and we don't we want them to be
as<00:02:20.140> wild<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:20.739> possible<00:02:21.280> when<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.270> birds<00:02:22.480> are

three weeks old they moved from the

canary cages in the house and released
into<00:02:26.800> outdoor<00:02:26.980> Averys<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.900> they<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.260> safely

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
into outdoor Averys here they can safely

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.560 
into outdoor Averys here they can safely
be<00:02:29.680> acclimatized<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.910> can<00:02:31.120> interact<00:02:31.480> with

other birds as well as learning to

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.910 
other birds as well as learning to
recognize<00:02:33.700> potential<00:02:34.630> predators<00:02:35.110> like<00:02:35.620> cats

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
recognize potential predators like cats

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.220 
recognize potential predators like cats
and<00:02:36.100> sparrowhawks<00:02:36.780> after<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> few<00:02:38.050> weeks

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
and sparrowhawks after a few weeks

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.440 
and sparrowhawks after a few weeks
they're<00:02:38.650> released<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.520> not<00:02:39.730> completely<00:02:40.180> left

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
they're released but not completely left

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.430 
they're released but not completely left
to<00:02:40.540> their<00:02:40.690> own<00:02:40.720> devices

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
to their own devices

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.199 
to their own devices
this<00:02:42.040> gives<00:02:42.250> me<00:02:42.430> would<00:02:42.550> be<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> huge<00:02:42.970> step

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
this gives me would be a huge step

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.449 
this gives me would be a huge step
between<00:02:43.450> picking<00:02:44.019> food<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.590> dish<00:02:44.799> and

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
between picking food in a dish and

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.220 
between picking food in a dish and
actually<00:02:45.850> going<00:02:46.030> out<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.600> Cornwall<00:02:47.019> on

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
actually going out to Cornwall on

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.250 
actually going out to Cornwall on
finding<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.100> that's<00:02:48.459> why<00:02:48.670> that's<00:02:49.260> another

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
finding it so that's why that's another

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.000 
finding it so that's why that's another
stage<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:51.010> we've<00:02:51.280> picked<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.150> then<00:02:52.239> they<00:02:53.230> as

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
stage that we've picked and then they as

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.130 
stage that we've picked and then they as
they<00:02:54.310> emerge<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.060> go<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.450> further<00:02:55.720> afield

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
they emerge and go it the further afield

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.789 
they emerge and go it the further afield
and<00:02:56.830> become<00:02:57.190> wilder<00:02:57.850> we<00:02:58.650> overtime<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
and become wilder we overtime the

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.400 
and become wilder we overtime the
reduced<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.519> food<00:03:00.840> in<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.989> Averys

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
reduced in that food in the Averys

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.810 
reduced in that food in the Averys
because<00:03:02.650> obviously<00:03:02.799> eventually<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.580> ovaries

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
because obviously eventually the ovaries

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.000 
because obviously eventually the ovaries
are<00:03:03.880> gonna<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.090> taken<00:03:04.420> down<00:03:04.630> but<00:03:05.620> until<00:03:05.980> that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
are gonna be taken down but until that

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.250 
are gonna be taken down but until that

happens Carl and Julie regularly feed

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.470 
happens Carl and Julie regularly feed
the<00:03:08.410> Cirl<00:03:08.590> bunting<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.910> I'm<00:03:10.060> off<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.390> help

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
like this yes they don't go to bar it's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.000 
like this yes they don't go to bar it's
about<00:03:39.310> two<00:03:40.000> kilometers<00:03:40.599> from<00:03:41.590> here<00:03:41.860> it's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
about two kilometers from here it's

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.490 
about two kilometers from here it's
about<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.150> church<00:03:43.450> over<00:03:43.750> there<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.290> one

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
about to that church over there so one

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.589 
about to that church over there so one
that<00:03:45.160> means<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.459> habitats<00:03:45.880> even<00:03:46.450> more

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
that means that habitats even more

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.390 
that means that habitats even more
important<00:03:47.019> for<00:03:47.110> them<00:03:47.260> isn't<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.530> exactly<00:03:47.830> so

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
important for them isn't it exactly so

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.309 
important for them isn't it exactly so
we've<00:03:48.670> got<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:48.940> make<00:03:49.060> sure<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.840> really<00:03:50.019> excite

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
we've got to make sure the really excite
