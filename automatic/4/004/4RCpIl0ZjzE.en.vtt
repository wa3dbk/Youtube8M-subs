00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.900
 hello friends how are you how do you like 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.269
 the braid that we are going to weave today is 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.480
 well nice truth be welcome 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.070
 again to tele with me I am the and 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.920
 I'm happy to bring you this 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.560
 braid that is the braid of 3 segments is 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.480
 a braid that looks great and is 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.060
 woven and over a total of 16 points I 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.050
 here I add 4 and 4 on each side to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.180
 make it stand out a little bit more 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.120
 you do like this or if you want to weave the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 pure braid are 16 points then we go 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 to start are 12 laps 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.050
 and we started the first round we passed the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.879
 point without knitting and we weave 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.879
 backhand points 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.769
 then we weave 16 points of right and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.769
 again 4 reverse points 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.340
 on lap number 2 and all laps 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.550
 backwards 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.910
 let's knit 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.430
 let's move on a knit without knitting 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.430
 three points of right 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.579
 16 reverse points 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.649
 and the last four points also the 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.649
 let's knit right 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.600
 I already have my first two laps 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.630
 basically they are the ones that are going to repeat 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.789
 throughout the whole reason what I'm going 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.430
 to do to not lose my accounts is 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:54.270
 put a laps marker here 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.100
 to know where I started and not have 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.740
 difficulties precisely because it is a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.050
 braid and it is difficult to count the turns or 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.510
 keep track then here I know that 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.180
 here I started that is already my second 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.970
 back I go for the third one and that's how I'm going 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.970
 be much easier to count the twelve 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.280
 laps that I'm going to do 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.200
 if you do not have a marker like 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.040
 these can use anything like 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.690
 a needle for braids a bit of 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.690
 stamen pass it here 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.249
 when we get to turn number 5 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.659
 let's do our first crusade what 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:38.540
 what we are going to do is that we weave 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.540
 our first 4 edge points 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.840
 and let's move on 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.530
 4 points 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.170
 from our fabric to the needle for 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.180
 braids 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.730
 and we passed them back the 4 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.150
 later we are going to weave four 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.150
 rights 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.300
 3 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:21.460
 and 4 and we return the points we have 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.460
 in our needle for braids 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:48.249
 and we do the same again 4 points a 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.459
 We used the needle for braids to 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:50.459
 behind 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.650
 we weave 4 rights 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.630
 and we return our points 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.230
 of the needle for braids 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.740
 and I'm going to weave my 4 edge points 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.160
 that are setbacks 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.850
 and so we finished our round number 5 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.660
 when we arrived on the 11th lap 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.700
 let's do our second crusader and 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.400
 the last one then what we're going to do 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.910
 is to weave our four edge points 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.750
 here I slide the first one and weave three 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.750
 backhand points 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.710
 and I already have my 4 edge points in my 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.350
 right needle afterwards to do the 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.689
 Yew braid 1 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.230
 two 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.150
 3 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.770
 4 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:28.430
 and I pass four points to my needle to 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.260
 braids and I put them to the front and 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.129
 yew four others 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.699
 one 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.699
 two 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.230
 and four rights and return 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.750
 my stitches to my needle to weave the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.530
 and the legal texts 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.720
 one 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.610
 two 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.100
 3 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.920
 and 4 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.920
 I have four more rights 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.520
 one 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.520
 two 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.910
 3 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:27.580
 and 4 already finished the reason for the braid and 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.580
 now I weave the 4 backs of the edge 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:39.210
 and so ended the return to number 11 that 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:43.120
 it was the return to the second crusader and let's go 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.360
 to weave round number 12 and last 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.360
 return 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:55.710
 ready I have here my braid of 3 segments 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.270
 look how pretty is a very cute braid 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.640
