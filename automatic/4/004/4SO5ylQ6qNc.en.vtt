00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.999 

I'm<00:00:05.149> going<00:00:05.359> to<00:00:05.420> make<00:00:05.569> sure<00:00:06.020> my<00:00:06.049> pointy<00:00:06.890> edge

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:07.009 
I'm going to make sure my pointy edge

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.520 
I'm going to make sure my pointy edge
and<00:00:07.309> my<00:00:07.430> lead<00:00:07.700> are<00:00:07.939> at<00:00:08.420> the<00:00:08.570> same<00:00:08.750> level<00:00:08.809> I'm

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
and my lead are at the same level I'm

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.680 
and my lead are at the same level I'm
now<00:00:10.040> going<00:00:10.250> to<00:00:10.340> construct<00:00:10.910> a<00:00:11.240> perpendicular

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
now going to construct a perpendicular

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.920 
now going to construct a perpendicular
bisector<00:00:13.990> so<00:00:15.309> what<00:00:16.309> you<00:00:16.400> do<00:00:16.520> is<00:00:16.670> you<00:00:16.789> place<00:00:17.119> the

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
bisector so what you do is you place the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.570 
bisector so what you do is you place the
pointy<00:00:18.500> edge<00:00:18.710> on<00:00:19.100> one<00:00:19.550> end<00:00:19.850> of<00:00:20.119> eight<00:00:20.480> segments

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
pointy edge on one end of eight segments

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.210 
pointy edge on one end of eight segments
you<00:00:22.580> make<00:00:22.849> sure<00:00:23.240> your<00:00:23.599> compass<00:00:24.169> is<00:00:24.380> extended

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
you make sure your compass is extended

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.550 
you make sure your compass is extended
to<00:00:25.429> more<00:00:26.060> than<00:00:26.329> half<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.990> length<00:00:27.169> of<00:00:27.439> the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
to more than half the length of the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.950 
to more than half the length of the
segment<00:00:27.769> more<00:00:28.339> than<00:00:28.609> half<00:00:28.909> the<00:00:29.240> length<00:00:29.449> of<00:00:29.749> the

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
segment more than half the length of the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.989 
segment more than half the length of the
segment<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:31.279> one's<00:00:31.489> going<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.699> be<00:00:31.789> a<00:00:31.820> bit

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
segment this one's going to be a bit

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.510 
segment this one's going to be a bit
tricky<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:33.170> seems<00:00:33.470> less<00:00:33.800> than<00:00:34.040> half<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:34.460> I'm

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
tricky this seems less than half so I'm

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.330 
tricky this seems less than half so I'm
going<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.760> go<00:00:34.880> ahead<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:36.039> extend<00:00:37.039> it<00:00:37.160> some

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
going to go ahead and extend it some

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.750 
going to go ahead and extend it some
more<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:38.030> some<00:00:38.359> more<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:38.840> some<00:00:38.960> more<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:40.100> I'm

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
more and some more and some more and I'm

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.639 
more and some more and some more and I'm
going<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:40.910> draw<00:00:41.090> an<00:00:41.149> arc<00:00:44.379> then<00:00:45.379> I'm<00:00:45.469> going<00:00:45.620> to

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
going to draw an arc then I'm going to

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.400 
going to draw an arc then I'm going to
go<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.920> other<00:00:46.070> end<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.670> draw<00:00:47.000> another<00:00:47.359> arc

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:01:02.300 

I'm<00:00:51.410> going<00:00:51.949> to<00:00:52.160> connect<00:00:55.089> these<00:00:56.089> two<00:00:56.629> endpoints

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.329 

and<00:01:02.840> that<00:01:03.840> gives<00:01:04.199> me<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.650> perpendicular

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and that gives me a perpendicular

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.920 
and that gives me a perpendicular
bisector<00:01:06.050> I'm<00:01:07.050> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.410> highlight<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
bisector I'm going to highlight it

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.170 
bisector I'm going to highlight it
that's<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.320> perpendicular<00:01:11.250> bisector<00:01:12.150> for

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that's one perpendicular bisector for

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.440 
that's one perpendicular bisector for
one<00:01:12.979> side<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.280> triangle<00:01:14.550> I'm<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.330> do

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
one side of the triangle I'm going to do

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.530 
one side of the triangle I'm going to do
the<00:01:15.600> same<00:01:15.900> thing<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.770> other<00:01:17.030> side's<00:01:18.030> note

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the same thing for the other side's note

the same thing for the other side's note
I'm<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> adjust<00:01:19.260> my<00:01:19.530> compass

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
I'm going to have to adjust my compass

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.660 
I'm going to have to adjust my compass
according<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.420> length<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.260> segment

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
always for perpendicular bisectors you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.280 
always for perpendicular bisectors you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
want your compass to be more than half

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.160 
want your compass to be more than half

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
this case the perpendicular bisectors

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.250 
this case the perpendicular bisectors
are<00:02:31.980> intersecting<00:02:33.010> outside<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.300> triangle<00:02:34.600> so

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
are intersecting outside the triangle so

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.250 
are intersecting outside the triangle so
you<00:02:35.320> will<00:02:35.770> make<00:02:36.010> an<00:02:36.190> appropriate<00:02:37.260> conclusion

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
you will make an appropriate conclusion

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.650 
you will make an appropriate conclusion
and<00:02:40.050> look<00:02:41.050> over<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:41.910> my<00:02:42.910> construction<00:02:43.450> is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
and look over here my construction is

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.900 
and look over here my construction is
not<00:02:43.900> perfect<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.740> slightly<00:02:45.040> imperfect<00:02:45.790> or

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
not perfect is slightly imperfect or

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.730 
not perfect is slightly imperfect or
they<00:02:46.120> would<00:02:46.330> have<00:02:46.360> intersected<00:02:46.990> in<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.350> point

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
they would have intersected in a point

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.950 
they would have intersected in a point
but<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.700> comes<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.090> practice

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
but that comes with practice

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.200 
but that comes with practice
so<00:02:50.470> make<00:02:50.710> your<00:02:50.890> conclusion<00:02:51.400> accordingly<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
so make your conclusion accordingly and

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.600 
so make your conclusion accordingly and
you<00:02:52.270> will<00:02:52.570> do<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.900> same<00:02:53.170> thing<00:02:53.230> for<00:02:53.950> an<00:02:54.250> acute

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
you will do the same thing for an acute

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.960 
you will do the same thing for an acute
triangle<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.390> right<00:02:55.600> triangle
