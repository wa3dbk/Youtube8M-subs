00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 there is very good success for wanted 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.670
 commenting and today I bring you another that 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.200
 involved and competitive this time it was 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.480
 decides instead of rainy a guide 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.130
 up is another example of competitive and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.480
 well in this case we are playing a 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.519
 point that they encourage slams as you can see 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.020
 new with the n 94 playing r and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.310
 use this gameplay to talk a 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.470
 little bit about a subject that was 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.300
 quite talked about right now the subject of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.939
 change and change the rules or not in the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.980
 vp towards European rules since 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.599
 is right now going to start just 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.070
 the tournament of the 'ko' cx fur tournament of the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.210
 million dollars that they talk about also 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640
 a little bit so he would find out how 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.020
 the classification system works 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.460
 who is there and all that is worth in 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.530
 As for other Spanish teams and everything 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.570
 that so first of all tell you that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.950
 Well, I know that I have an audience that only 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.600
 is still competitive other than me 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.860
 they continue for public another that they pursue 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.989
 by how it's called by tutorials and good 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.250
 tell you that you see the use of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.600
 tomorrow because apart it's going to be a 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.980
 nuclear that will surely be with the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.449
 victory that is the one that you gave me more 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.250
 along with that of the suat that you have 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.260
 climb yesterday that was pretty pretty 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 good because tomorrow you will have the candle 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 nuclear vector in this icon going on 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.379
 quite on signed down as always 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.540
 so move on and spend more than by 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.190
 a nuclear so I'm going to say 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.990
 I'm going to talk a little bit with the authority 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.320
 of the channel I'm going to ask you a couple of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.630
 opinions and I will tell you two reasons or 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.970
 explanations of why there were some 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.860
 x videos are videos so to speak 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.420
 new videos and not everything 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.690
 type of videos or because I can not upload 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.010
 more than more than one video per day in general 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.510
 so well let's move on to talk a 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.430
 little bit of the gameplay like I said 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.020
 playing of slams map as I have 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.790
 said this map is very important the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 respawn theme in the first point 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.229
 hot as good I'll have to do the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.490
 This map's competitive guide will be 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.780
 surely the next call to that 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.850
 do you also know that you also have 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.500
 take the flag that walk and apart 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.820
 take the flag but good what we 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.410
 concerns that it is the hot spot in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.420
 this case the important thing is very very 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.530
 important the support as you see in the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.270
 point of mind the medium what you have to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.619
 to try is for your team to start 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 reborn on this side that I am now 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.400
 and at that point you've seen the one 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.869
 we were now trying to defend the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.580
 I support the wall when you have seen 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.840
 that there are about 15 seconds left I'm going 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.150
 moving so that the partners do not 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.520
 are born next to me and we started doing 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.200
 in this back part then some 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.670
 games has to charge to defend the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.920
 backup in this case was not me and I was 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.690
 supporting a bit on the point and good 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.160
 because it is what you have to do not 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.870
 this point is very important to maintain the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.060
 backup because the next room where 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.800
 I just looked at what you can 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.150
 splice the dots very easily and if 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.350
 do you support the colon 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 interiors you can put more than 100 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.570
 points in nothing in two minutes and is a 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.700
 which therefore unbalances a lot and therefore 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.670
 affects the rival's morale a lot, so 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.110
 let's move on to talk about how 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.310
 It's good to also tell you that I was getting 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.530
 I did not say it on another day of the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 competitive that I get a nuclear with 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.490
 Seculta and bullets and that too 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.290
 Well, all that is the people that you see in 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.240
 customers and competed to know the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.740
 you can nuclear very good and also because 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.270
 also warn those who see also 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.190
 public as it distributes everything so that 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.110
 today I also get a nuclear with the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.580
 shotgun m 12 and 16 shotgun that to the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.890
 people do not like it for me yes so 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.120
 well you also have it in the channel and 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.650
 Now we are going to start talking 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.570
 a little bit of what would be the subject of 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.520
 rules good first of all as you know 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.100
 this weekend but the team that 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.080
 It will celebrate the Quispe coce would therefore 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.730
 the million dollar tournament in the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.680
 that right now as a team 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.190
 Spanish is peng inning the team of 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.030
 peking with eyes 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.340
 law in 70 and james if I'm not wrong the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.980
 four players that are right now and 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.570
 good because they have classified themselves and 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.550
 no others no, well, you had to play 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.560
 a series of qualifiers a few times 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.700
 that you know is a one day cap that is 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.400
 like the ones that I got on the channel but 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.770
 specials that would be at European level and 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.600
 good depends on the points each good each 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.110
 round that advances more wins more x points 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.210
 that is , certain points and 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.000
 according to these points , a ranking of 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.130
 each country for example from Spain and 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.080
 two that more points had to pass 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.910
 rounds would face each other that 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.170
 and what has already happened that was judged against 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.480
 pain in germany in cologne and not pain 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.160
 in addition quite clearly in mode 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.380
 lama was a tournament in lan mode that 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.630
 confrontation was already in lan mode that 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.030
 it would be so regardless of the connection is 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.250
 say 8 consoles connected in series 4 and 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.300
 4 without connection or anything is already when 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.790
 see who is the best who wins 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.440
 really not by connection and that's what 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.360
 showed that he combed and is super strong 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.400
 not with this type of regulation so 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.169
 right now, as I tell you , they are 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.370
 in the angels ping team and I got together 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.270
 Because with 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.440
 12 other European teams I think if I do not 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.470
 that no more 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.720
 18 16 European teams and then another 16 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.150
 teams from america I believe right now 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.919
 I know exactly how and how the subject goes 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.690
 which they are in a group stage ie 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.060
 as if they were global that groups of 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.290
 four and the first two of each group 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.699
 they would face each other in the phases 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.680
 eliminatory already then like any 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.570
 elimination tournament as equal as 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.669
 worldwide we go so the one who wins will 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.430
 would take that one million dollars I guess 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.690
 that the runners-up only depends on what 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.699
 since it discounted higher up better 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.400
 They will give you a series of money to 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.699
 equipment thing that can come in handy for 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.180
 example to payne to win a little bit of 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.310
 possible the money to improve your I do not know 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.039
 all sponsors do not win very many 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.090
 sponsor good money to pay the 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.440
 players who are obviously 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.380
 doing great work and all those things 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.750
 apart they can buy things for 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.550
 the players helmets then is that in this 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.539
 case they do not need because they already have but 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.919
 you can not do many things with 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.419
 money is made everything in this life not like this 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.700
 that it would be pretty good if they arrived 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.440
 as high as they could thus leave 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.070
 to the Spanish community in a place like this 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.350
 it can be and good 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.510
 What about this type of tournament? 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.860
 because you play more different than in 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.960
 The ebep in the vp has some rules 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.510
 exclusive and it's a few rules without gusts 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.000
 with quite restricted accessories with 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.430
 tactical grenades up to restricted from 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.810
 So as you know there are many people who 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.850
 is in favor of maintaining the rules of 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.170
 vp but there are other people who do not 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.210
 and I am right now between 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.940
 between them cold let's go I would like more 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.230
 play with the rules of mlg or of certain 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.930
 the ones you want are very similar 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.840
 but it is not the same then why 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.140
 Well, what happens if the players 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.700
 at a Spanish level because they want to go out 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.860
 outside if you want to go out and play tournaments 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.110
 Europeans world tournaments since 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.820
 they have to play with other rules at 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.100
 different than what they are used to 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.900
 that is, they have to play without respawn 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.480
 they have to play with streaks 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.810
 They have to play with great broadcasters 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.670
 with peepholes dmm are many things that do not 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.680
 you're used to being used or not 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.670
 to use them then when you see them 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.830
 you are as surprised that 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.350
 surprisingly so many 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.060
 flags are not there are different standards 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.160
 not then you're used to playing a 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.880
 certain type of standards and if you put yourself 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.370
 to play 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.870
 against a team that apart from being very 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.510
 Well, he's used to those 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.310
 norms for normal is that fuck guys 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.870
 pe in a beating of the host not what is 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.460
 what is happening with most of 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.620
 Spanish teams we in fact all 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.990
 we already play good apart this this league 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.000
 is worth the console price is supposed to 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.700
 It is without respawn and it costs us a lot in 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.620
 this case no but other equipment has 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.690
 It cost quite a lot to face it because 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.970
 that of playing without answer truth that 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.370
 quite detrimental to the arn't 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.440
 benefits the months then you have to 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.600
 play differently and then in 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.790
 mlg standards as I tell you won 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.370
 six hours you can play with a thousand I know 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.050
 I do not know there are many things you can play 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.200
 with heavy things then the thing changes not 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.060
 even shotguns so you did not want 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.660
 ask you what do you think that 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.760
 yes it would be good to change the rules of 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.340
 to vp to mlg standards I am a 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.660
 please so that people can practice 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.270
 with those rules and then facing 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.650
 European or national tournaments or 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.720
 international so they can do something 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.580
 more in front of teams from other countries 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.810
 so if I say goodbye to them 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.430
 liked this video 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.720

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.720
