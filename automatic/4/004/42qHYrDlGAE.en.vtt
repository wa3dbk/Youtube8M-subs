okay so you are looking at the bottom

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.949 
okay so you are looking at the bottom
like<00:00:12.350> bar<00:00:12.620> that<00:00:12.889> is<00:00:13.039> mining<00:00:13.639> finished<00:00:14.119> code<00:00:14.600> 3

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
like bar that is mining finished code 3

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:21.490 
like bar that is mining finished code 3
in<00:00:15.230> the<00:00:15.699> 7000<00:00:18.279> all<00:00:19.279> detect<00:00:20.150> rotator<00:00:20.810> bar<00:00:21.109> we

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
in the 7000 all detect rotator bar we

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.290 
in the 7000 all detect rotator bar we
may<00:00:21.619> have<00:00:21.710> seen<00:00:21.830> a<00:00:21.890> picture<00:00:22.070> that<00:00:22.370> I<00:00:22.460> posted<00:00:22.640> a

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
may have seen a picture that I posted a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.840 
may have seen a picture that I posted a
couple<00:00:23.810> few<00:00:24.289> weeks<00:00:24.470> ago<00:00:24.620> now<00:00:24.710> actually<00:00:25.039> when<00:00:25.820> I

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
couple few weeks ago now actually when I

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.370 
couple few weeks ago now actually when I
first<00:00:26.090> got<00:00:26.270> it<00:00:26.420> I<00:00:26.510> think<00:00:26.539> I<00:00:26.750> paid<00:00:26.869> like<00:00:27.020> 50

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
first got it I think I paid like 50

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.200 
first got it I think I paid like 50
bucks<00:00:27.619> for<00:00:27.830> or<00:00:28.039> something<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.460> was<00:00:28.610> pretty

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
bucks for or something it was pretty

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.960 
bucks for or something it was pretty
well<00:00:29.390> beat<00:00:29.630> up<00:00:30.310> had<00:00:31.310> some<00:00:31.520> stuff<00:00:31.760> that<00:00:31.880> I

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
well beat up had some stuff that I

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.549 
well beat up had some stuff that I
didn't<00:00:32.210> need<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:32.570> I<00:00:32.629> took<00:00:32.719> it<00:00:32.930> apart<00:00:33.170> cleaned

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
didn't need so I took it apart cleaned

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.560 
didn't need so I took it apart cleaned
it<00:00:33.649> all<00:00:33.770> out<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.850> they<00:00:34.940> built<00:00:35.149> it<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.390> way<00:00:35.539> I

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
it all out and they built it the way I

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.200 
it all out and they built it the way I
needed<00:00:35.899> it<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.350> then<00:00:36.859> scrubbed<00:00:37.609> it<00:00:37.730> down<00:00:37.760> and

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
needed it and then scrubbed it down and

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.210 
needed it and then scrubbed it down and
polished<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:38.899> up<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.290> this<00:00:39.800> is<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.040> final

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
polished it up and this is the final

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.260 
polished it up and this is the final
product<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:42.070> it's<00:00:43.070> my<00:00:43.190> multitec<00:00:43.820> rotator

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
product so it's my multitec rotator

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.900 
product so it's my multitec rotator
because<00:00:44.720> i<00:00:45.020> have<00:00:45.380> two<00:00:46.130> rotators<00:00:46.640> on<00:00:46.760> either

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
because i have two rotators on either

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.880 
because i have two rotators on either
side<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:47.450> are<00:00:47.540> both<00:00:47.720> are<00:00:48.230> off<00:00:48.350> or<00:00:48.590> slow

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
side that are both are off or slow

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.069 
side that are both are off or slow
rather<00:00:49.160> with<00:00:49.520> mirrors<00:00:49.899> you<00:00:50.899> have<00:00:50.930> the

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
rather with mirrors you have the

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.720 
rather with mirrors you have the
intersector<00:00:51.620> like<00:00:51.800> normal<00:00:52.130> on<00:00:52.280> either<00:00:52.430> side

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
intersector like normal on either side

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.620 
intersector like normal on either side
and<00:00:53.000> then<00:00:53.090> I<00:00:53.120> have<00:00:53.300> two<00:00:53.540> flashers<00:00:54.140> per<00:00:54.469> side

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
and then I have two flashers per side

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.400 
and then I have two flashers per side
originally<00:00:56.630> I<00:00:56.660> was<00:00:56.840> going<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:57.079> do<00:00:57.170> something

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
originally I was going to do something

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.650 
originally I was going to do something
might<00:00:57.739> get<00:00:57.920> LED<00:00:58.430> flasher<00:00:58.910> because<00:00:59.329> I<00:00:59.420> had<00:00:59.510> seen

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
might get LED flasher because I had seen

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.090 
might get LED flasher because I had seen
on<00:00:59.809> YouTube<00:01:00.140> some<00:01:00.440> other<00:01:00.559> people<00:01:00.860> had<00:01:00.980> done

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
on YouTube some other people had done

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.060 
on YouTube some other people had done
the<00:01:01.250> same<00:01:01.280> thing<00:01:01.610> with<00:01:01.820> their<00:01:02.000> VTEC<00:01:02.390> bars<00:01:03.170> what

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
the same thing with their VTEC bars what

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.429 
the same thing with their VTEC bars what
I<00:01:04.129> ended<00:01:04.339> up<00:01:04.460> doing<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:05.119> I<00:01:05.539> found<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.229> couple

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
I ended up doing is I found a couple

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.160 
I ended up doing is I found a couple
extra<00:01:07.070> detect<00:01:07.610> rotator<00:01:08.090> assemblies<00:01:08.719> which

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
extra detect rotator assemblies which

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.370 
extra detect rotator assemblies which
are<00:01:09.380> other<00:01:09.710> up<00:01:09.920> here<00:01:10.390> these<00:01:11.390> are<00:01:11.600> glass<00:01:11.810> appear

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
are other up here these are glass appear

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.469 
are other up here these are glass appear
however<00:01:12.650> they<00:01:13.070> make<00:01:13.340> plastic<00:01:13.880> ones<00:01:14.060> like<00:01:14.270> this

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
however they make plastic ones like this

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.600 
however they make plastic ones like this
and<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:15.290> what<00:01:15.440> I<00:01:15.470> was<00:01:15.650> able<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:15.950> do<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.340> break

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
and so what I was able to do is break

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.170 
and so what I was able to do is break
this<00:01:16.850> apart<00:01:17.060> cleanly<00:01:17.900> into<00:01:18.409> two<00:01:19.180> equal

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
this apart cleanly into two equal

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.240 
this apart cleanly into two equal
sections<00:01:20.210> one<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.439> red<00:01:21.650> side<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:22.100> blue

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
sections one the red side of the blue

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.780 
sections one the red side of the blue
side<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.010> happens<00:01:25.369> that<00:01:25.490> these

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
side and it just so happens that these

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.210 
side and it just so happens that these
are<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.240> exact<00:01:26.600> same<00:01:26.630> size<00:01:26.900> as<00:01:27.680> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
are the exact same size as the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.359 
are the exact same size as the
reflectors<00:01:28.729> on<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.119> bottom<00:01:29.740> row<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.770> flashers

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
reflectors on the bottom row of flashers

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.510 
reflectors on the bottom row of flashers
so<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.850> was<00:01:32.270> able<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.540> install<00:01:33.320> these<00:01:33.530> as<00:01:33.860> the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
so I was able to install these as the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.520 
so I was able to install these as the
color<00:01:34.729> filters<00:01:35.150> for<00:01:35.600> my<00:01:35.930> little<00:01:36.110> rebuttal

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
color filters for my little rebuttal

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.149 
color filters for my little rebuttal
flashers<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:37.400> when<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:37.700> off<00:01:37.909> like<00:01:38.270> this

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
flashers so that when it's off like this

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.039 
flashers so that when it's off like this
whereas<00:01:40.159> this<00:01:40.340> bar<00:01:40.580> clearly<00:01:41.360> see<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:41.630> blue<00:01:41.840> and

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
whereas this bar clearly see is blue and

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.830 
whereas this bar clearly see is blue and
red<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.680> all<00:01:42.860> kind<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.280> silvery<00:01:43.700> and

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
red this is all kind of silvery and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.980 
red this is all kind of silvery and
polished<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.080> just<00:01:45.979> kind<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.189> look<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:47.689> really

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
polished and just kind of look I really

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.859 
polished and just kind of look I really
like<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.500> my<00:01:48.710> other<00:01:48.860> two<00:01:48.950> light<00:01:49.820> bars<00:01:50.119> that<00:01:50.840> I

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
like that my other two light bars that I

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.280 
like that my other two light bars that I
have<00:01:51.400> or<00:01:52.400> my<00:01:52.460> other<00:01:52.880> 2mx<00:01:53.479> like<00:01:53.720> bars<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.140> should

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
have or my other 2mx like bars I should

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.810 
have or my other 2mx like bars I should
say<00:01:54.500> are<00:01:54.880> all<00:01:55.880> light<00:01:56.210> fixtures<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:58.250> was<00:01:58.640> able

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
say are all light fixtures so I was able

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.859 
say are all light fixtures so I was able
to<00:01:59.320> get<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:00.470> one<00:02:00.680> which<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.070> my<00:02:01.220> first<00:02:01.869> okay

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
to get this one which is my first okay

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.429 
to get this one which is my first okay
which<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:03.860> my<00:02:04.009> first<00:02:04.810> chrome<00:02:05.810> one<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.140> can<00:02:06.290> see

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
which is my first chrome one you can see

see the top row here
have<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.180> slow<00:02:17.660> rotators<00:02:18.410> on<00:02:18.620> either<00:02:18.770> side

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
have the slow rotators on either side

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.220 
have the slow rotators on either side
and<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.720> bottom<00:02:21.140> row<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.780> see<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
and then the bottom row you can see the

and then the bottom row you can see the
flash<00:02:24.530> filters<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.520> did<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:29.870> have

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
flash filters that I did so you have

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.650 
flash filters that I did so you have
your<00:02:30.080> inter<00:02:30.320> sectors<00:02:31.030> nothing<00:02:32.030> fancy<00:02:32.480> there

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:42.170 

the<00:02:35.660> rotators

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.330 

which<00:02:42.750> are<00:02:42.959> if<00:02:43.799> you<00:02:43.920> don't<00:02:44.099> know<00:02:44.189> what<00:02:44.310> a

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
which are if you don't know what a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.399 
which are if you don't know what a
detect<00:02:44.730> light<00:02:45.090> bar<00:02:45.329> is<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:45.870> side<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
detect light bar is one side of the

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.830 
detect light bar is one side of the
rotator<00:02:46.829> is<00:02:47.099> red<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> other<00:02:48.360> side<00:02:48.659> is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
rotator is red and the other side is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
rotator is red and the other side is
blue<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.829> as<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.159> rotates<00:02:50.310> around<00:02:50.849> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
blue so as it rotates around and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:03.290 
blue so as it rotates around and
switches<00:02:51.420> colors

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.510 

and<00:03:04.300> then<00:03:04.510> lastly<00:03:05.290> my<00:03:06.210> my<00:03:07.710> engineering<00:03:08.710> genius

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
and then lastly my my engineering genius

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.460 
and then lastly my my engineering genius
if<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.330> will<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.620> red<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.010> blue<00:03:12.220> flashers

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.810 

which<00:03:17.470> again<00:03:17.770> if<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.100> look<00:03:18.280> at<00:03:18.460> them<00:03:18.640> they're

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
which again if you look at them they're

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.820 
which again if you look at them they're
red<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.150> blue<00:03:21.150> but<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.270> can<00:03:22.480> see<00:03:22.810> off<00:03:23.230> axis

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
red and blue but you can see off axis

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.050 
red and blue but you can see off axis
here<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.340> they<00:03:24.580> are<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.690> detect<00:03:26.140> filters<00:03:27.060> so

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
here that they are the detect filters so

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:59.010 
here that they are the detect filters so
the<00:03:28.390> whole<00:03:28.600> together

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:17.320 

okay

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.479 

and<00:04:18.330> there<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:18.630> have<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.920> you<00:04:19.920> make<00:04:20.130> seven

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and there you have it you make seven

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.470 
and there you have it you make seven
thousand<00:04:21.060> all<00:04:21.239> detecting<00:04:22.230> bar
