00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
by adding it little by little it keeps

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:29.800 
by adding it little by little it keeps
it<00:03:18.660> from<00:03:18.780> separating<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.260> little<00:03:19.320> bit<00:03:19.560> longer

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.520

I use
iceberg<00:04:01.980> lettuce<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.820> little<00:04:03.000> trick<00:04:03.269> for

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
iceberg lettuce and a little trick for

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.500 
iceberg lettuce and a little trick for
getting<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.110> out<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.910> smash<00:04:06.299> it

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
getting this out is if you just smash it

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.259 
getting this out is if you just smash it
on<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.750> counter<00:04:07.080> just<00:04:07.260> like<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.880> Sebastian

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
on the counter just like the Sebastian

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.250 
on the counter just like the Sebastian
takes<00:04:09.540> out<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.840> core<00:04:10.080> and<00:04:10.970> now<00:04:12.260> everything

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
takes out the core and now everything

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.140 
takes out the core and now everything
just<00:04:13.290> kind<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.680> unfolds<00:04:14.130> see<00:04:14.730> all<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:15.000> that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
just kind of unfolds see all that that

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.390 
just kind of unfolds see all that that
hold<00:04:15.510> all<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.900> together<00:04:16.200> now<00:04:16.979> it's<00:04:17.190> very

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
hold all of it together now it's very

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.599 
hold all of it together now it's very
brittle<00:04:18.229> you<00:04:19.229> don't<00:04:19.410> want<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:20.250> you're

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
brittle you don't want that is you're

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.000
