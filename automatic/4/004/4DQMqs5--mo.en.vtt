00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.220
 I will show you how to make a ball or not 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.650
 saw trough 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.480
 from improvised means is also very fast 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.460
 we will need the body of the handle 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:21.619
 the cheapest that can be 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:25.039
 there Ruble 2 spring-loaded can can it 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.539
 use then see where and here 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:34.090
 ball w x bearing of any diameter 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:38.960
 the main thing that he passed in the handle part 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:43.210
 that's the principle of all the principle of such we take 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:51.500
 we throw a ball handle look where stuck 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:56.030
 celebrate the edge of this ball 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.930
 do the stove do not have to do so I im 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.960
 on the edge of the dion the most extreme of it 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.960
 position all the ball can get 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:18.540
 after which we cut off according to our marks 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.760
 hacksaw can be grind but long 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.760
 it will be better to cut with a hacksaw for metal 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.369
 so when you cut off the main part of that 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.810
 what of the world 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:59.450
 clean then throw the ball again and 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.960
 see how much you still need to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.800
 a ball appeared somewhere around 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.520
 millimeter 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:12.549
 looked out of the hole here already better 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.549
 of course use sharpening 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.440
 still to 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.950
 Well, in principle, in principle, not enough 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.950
 know them 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.710
 the man appeared 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.650
 if you blow the other end of the tube and 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:00.890
 the air is no longer like food ready 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:09.310
 I like a little bit to find burrs 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.310
 there can be cleaned with file cleaned 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:19.640
 so that there is no unevenness all 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.000
 the air does not pass if the drinker 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.950
 use upright position then 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.660
 it will already perform its function 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 water will not pass for the ball when 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.860
 low water pressure that's if you 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.700
 going to use high 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.040
 water pressure that's better in this 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.190
 system then using a spring that 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.140
 crushed izderzhivala ball here spring 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.680
 messi put on such bu we will cast 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.870
 spring and za lazy and and such 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.510
 peg made of wood trash flat not 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:00.270
 round to be a place to go 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:07.580
 water around the edges all there 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:21.600
 another hour very much peg turned out 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:28.530
 you are confused here everything is in principle spring already 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.390
 fixed here and holds the ball itself when 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.300
 this water will flow calmly 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:39.510
 pass by our spring plugs and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:42.600
 go out through the holes all drinking bowl 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.360
 ready to check again can 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.850
 pour water or blow the easiest 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.990
 if you when blowing air is not like you 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.990
 did everything right all thanks to all
