when<00:00:04.200> it<00:00:04.319> comes<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.650> building<00:00:04.950> stronger<00:00:05.279> feet

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
when it comes to building stronger feet

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.610 
when it comes to building stronger feet
there<00:00:06.150> are<00:00:06.270> two<00:00:06.420> important<00:00:06.930> components<00:00:07.080> that

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
there are two important components that

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.740 
there are two important components that
really<00:00:08.099> are<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.849> biggest<00:00:09.090> part<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> game

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
really are the biggest part of the game

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.959 
really are the biggest part of the game
in<00:00:09.990> challenging<00:00:10.679> those<00:00:10.830> feet<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.519> keeping

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
in challenging those feet and keeping

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.759 
in challenging those feet and keeping
you<00:00:12.090> moving<00:00:12.389> forward<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.840> moving<00:00:13.139> fast

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
you moving forward and moving fast

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.340 
you moving forward and moving fast
they<00:00:13.980> are<00:00:14.130> balance<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.759> proprioception<00:00:15.350> in

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
they are balance and proprioception in

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.050 
they are balance and proprioception in
our<00:00:16.500> Hop<00:00:16.740> circuit<00:00:17.190> what<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.670> do<00:00:17.910> with

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
our Hop circuit what we like to do with

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.640 
our Hop circuit what we like to do with
both<00:00:18.240> balance<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.810> proprioception<00:00:18.930> is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
both balance and proprioception is

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.859 
both balance and proprioception is
challenge<00:00:20.369> them<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.609> two<00:00:20.820> different<00:00:21.270> ways<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
challenge them in two different ways to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
challenge them in two different ways to
really<00:00:22.529> create<00:00:22.769> good<00:00:23.189> strong<00:00:23.550> feet<00:00:23.850> because

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
really create good strong feet because

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.970 
really create good strong feet because
you<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.510> strong<00:00:24.990> feet<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> name<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
you know strong feet are the name of the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.589 
you know strong feet are the name of the
game<00:00:26.130> when<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.369> comes<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.789> lasting<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.390> in

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
game when it comes to lasting in this in

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.570 
game when it comes to lasting in this in
this<00:00:27.750> event<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:29.070> we've<00:00:29.220> come<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
this event so I think what we've come to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.370 
this event so I think what we've come to
work<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.840> Mammoth<00:00:31.230> is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
work on with that up here in Mammoth is

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
work on with that up here in Mammoth is
is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.980> foot<00:00:32.279> circuit<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.149> challenges

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
is a foot circuit that really challenges

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.510 
is a foot circuit that really challenges
that<00:00:33.840> balance<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.320> proprioception<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that balance and proprioception so that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.030 
that balance and proprioception so that
you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.910> basically<00:00:36.360> run<00:00:36.930> longer<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.680> run

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
you can basically run longer and run

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.920 
you can basically run longer and run
faster<00:00:38.579> without<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.270> kind<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> residual

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
faster without that kind of residual

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690 
faster without that kind of residual
fatigue<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> again<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
fatigue so that you can do it again the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.889 
fatigue so that you can do it again the
next<00:00:41.730> step<00:00:42.059> I'd<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.480> start<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.750> with

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
next step I'd like to start with with

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.869 
next step I'd like to start with with
appropriate<00:00:43.379> section<00:00:43.739> side<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> in

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
appropriate section side of it and in

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
appropriate section side of it and in
what<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.149> call<00:00:45.329> our<00:00:45.450> alternating<00:00:46.050> skip<00:00:46.440> though

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
what we call our alternating skip though

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
what we call our alternating skip though
our<00:00:46.800> alternating<00:00:47.280> hops<00:00:47.550> should<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.820> say<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.059> we

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
our alternating hops should I say so we

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840 
our alternating hops should I say so we
do<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.170> left<00:00:49.559> left<00:00:49.860> right<00:00:50.039> right<00:00:50.190> combo

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
do what a left left right right combo

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.090 
do what a left left right right combo
combining<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> hops<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.140> mixing<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.860> like

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
combining the hops and mixing it up like

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
combining the hops and mixing it up like
that<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.969> creates<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.360> proprioception

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that really creates a proprioception

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.459 
that really creates a proprioception
stimulus<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:57.390> bouncing<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.230> one

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
stimulus because you're bouncing on one

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
stimulus because you're bouncing on one
foot<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> body<00:00:59.129> gets<00:00:59.399> used<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.789> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
foot and the body gets used to that and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400 
foot and the body gets used to that and
that<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.329> becomes<00:01:00.600> normal<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that kind of becomes normal and then you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
that kind of becomes normal and then you
got<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> switch<00:01:01.859> really<00:01:02.160> quick<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.520> find<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.030> new

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
got a switch really quick and find a new

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.060 
got a switch really quick and find a new
balance<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.110> proprioception<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.890> other

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
balance and proprioception on that other

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.750 
balance and proprioception on that other
leg<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:07.350> left<00:01:07.560> left<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:07.920> right<00:01:08.070> combo

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
leg so the left left right right combo

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.289 
leg so the left left right right combo
again<00:01:09.450> simple<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.920> high<00:01:11.189> amplitude<00:01:11.640> not

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
again simple not very high amplitude not

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.149 
again simple not very high amplitude not
very<00:01:12.600> far<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> teaching<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
very far but just kind of teaching a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
very far but just kind of teaching a
nice<00:01:14.460> bounce<00:01:14.760> through<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.240> leg<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.900> there's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
nice bounce through one leg and there's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.210 
nice bounce through one leg and there's
suits<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.560> soon<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> hang

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
suits like as soon as you get the hang

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.469 
suits like as soon as you get the hang
of<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.400> then<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.610> got<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> switch<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:18.360> go

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
of it then you got a switch and then go

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.700 
of it then you got a switch and then go
to<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> other<00:01:18.780> leg<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.439> switch

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
to the other leg and then you switch

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
to the other leg and then you switch
again<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.340> always<00:01:20.729> challenging<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
again so it's always challenging that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.240 
again so it's always challenging that
that<00:01:21.780> proprioception<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.619> all<00:01:22.770> those<00:01:22.979> feet

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that proprioception of all those feet

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
that proprioception of all those feet
and<00:01:23.400> feet<00:01:23.700> muscles<00:01:24.090> let's<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.780> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and feet muscles let's see what that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.830 
and feet muscles let's see what that
looks<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.110> there

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.830 

now<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.619> good<00:01:30.890> job<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:31.610> left<00:01:32.270> left<00:01:32.540> right<00:01:32.689> right

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
now a good job so left left right right

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.770 
now a good job so left left right right
you<00:01:33.530> kind<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.799> get<00:01:34.009> that<00:01:34.040> challenge<00:01:34.780> pushing

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
you kind of get that challenge pushing

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.450 
you kind of get that challenge pushing
through<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.049> foot<00:01:36.470> again<00:01:36.829> not<00:01:37.040> very<00:01:37.250> high

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
through that foot again not very high

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.460 
through that foot again not very high
but<00:01:38.000> trying<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.299> keep<00:01:38.390> good<00:01:38.659> stability<00:01:38.899> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
but trying to keep good stability the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.139 
but trying to keep good stability the
other<00:01:39.590> thing<00:01:39.829> with<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.009> is<00:01:40.189> hip<00:01:40.549> balance<00:01:40.970> has

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
other thing with that is hip balance has

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.240 
other thing with that is hip balance has
to<00:01:41.360> test<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.869> stabilize<00:01:42.289> as<00:01:42.439> well<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:43.100> lot

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
to test to stabilize as well and a lot

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.100 
to test to stabilize as well and a lot
of<00:01:43.399> hip<00:01:43.520> balance<00:01:43.850> has<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.060> lot<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.420> do<00:01:44.720> with<00:01:44.750> good

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
of hip balance has a lot to do with good

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.779 
of hip balance has a lot to do with good
feet<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.890> let's<00:01:46.070> see<00:01:46.250> what<00:01:46.369> that<00:01:46.399> looks<00:01:46.700> like

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
feet so let's see what that looks like

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.249 
feet so let's see what that looks like
and<00:01:47.030> see<00:01:47.179> kind<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.450> how<00:01:47.600> those<00:01:47.810> hips<00:01:48.080> are

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
and see kind of how those hips are

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.899 
and see kind of how those hips are
hanging<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.649> there<00:01:48.830> in<00:01:49.189> relation<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.700> that

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
hanging in there in relation to that

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.460 
hanging in there in relation to that
foot<00:01:50.149> strike<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.780> let's<00:01:50.960> try<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.259> again

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.050 

nice<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.740> didn't<00:01:55.039> see<00:01:55.159> a<00:01:55.189> lot<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.490> hip<00:01:55.610> movement

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
nice I didn't see a lot of hip movement

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.870 
nice I didn't see a lot of hip movement
going<00:01:56.210> on<00:01:56.420> very<00:01:57.170> good<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.130> thing<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
going on very good so the thing with the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.999 
going on very good so the thing with the
left<00:01:59.090> left<00:01:59.329> right<00:01:59.509> right<00:01:59.659> combo<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:00.679> can<00:02:00.890> be

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
left left right right combo it can be

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.590 
left left right right combo it can be
done<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.399> variety<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.880> different<00:02:02.060> ways<00:02:02.330> we

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
done in a variety of different ways we

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.330 
done in a variety of different ways we
can<00:02:02.720> do<00:02:02.840> three<00:02:03.140> laughs<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.679> three<00:02:03.860> rides<00:02:04.100> or

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
can do three laughs and three rides or

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.859 
can do three laughs and three rides or
if<00:02:04.429> we<00:02:04.549> can<00:02:04.640> get<00:02:04.759> tricky<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.240> go<00:02:05.330> three<00:02:05.600> left's

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
if we can get tricky and go three left's

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.300 
if we can get tricky and go three left's
and<00:02:05.959> two<00:02:06.110> rights<00:02:06.350> or<00:02:06.590> two<00:02:06.740> rights<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.159> three

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
and two rights or two rights and three

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.779 
and two rights or two rights and three
left's

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
left's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.460 
left's
there's<00:02:08.000> any<00:02:08.239> number<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.690> ways<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:09.200> kind<00:02:09.350> of

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
there's any number of ways to kind of

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.830 
there's any number of ways to kind of
hit<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.700> ultimate<00:02:11.420> idea<00:02:11.540> is

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
hit it but the ultimate idea is

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.210 
hit it but the ultimate idea is
challenging<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.680> balance<00:02:13.100> and

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
challenging that balance and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.339 
challenging that balance and
proprioception<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:14.269> give<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.660> good<00:02:15.110> foot

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
proprioception to give you good foot

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.020 
proprioception to give you good foot
strength<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.830> get<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> mind<00:02:16.340> always<00:02:16.610> kind<00:02:16.970> of

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
strength and get the mind always kind of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.460 
strength and get the mind always kind of

Sara thanks so much nice okay so the
next<00:02:21.410> one<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.739> do<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.099> circuit<00:02:22.519> is<00:02:22.670> that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
next one we do in that circuit is that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.180 
next one we do in that circuit is that
medial<00:02:23.569> medial<00:02:24.290> work<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.769> know<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:25.010> lot

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
medial medial work you know I know a lot

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.620 
medial medial work you know I know a lot
of<00:02:25.310> distance<00:02:25.670> runners<00:02:25.940> they<00:02:26.090> log<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.360> lot<00:02:26.480> of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
of distance runners they log a lot of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.539 
of distance runners they log a lot of
miles<00:02:26.900> if<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:27.200> go<00:02:27.349> in<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.650> direction<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.310> it's

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
miles if we go in one direction and it's

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.370 
miles if we go in one direction and it's
just<00:02:28.760> straight<00:02:29.030> forward<00:02:29.420> we<00:02:29.810> never<00:02:30.019> go<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
just straight forward we never go to the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.320 
just straight forward we never go to the
left<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:30.709> never<00:02:30.890> go<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.280> right<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.030> our

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
left we never go to the right but our

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.300 
left we never go to the right but our
feet<00:02:32.660> do<00:02:33.230> go<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.709> left<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.160> right

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
feet do go to the left and the right

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.979 
feet do go to the left and the right
when<00:02:34.519> they<00:02:34.640> hit<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:35.180> it's<00:02:35.329> really<00:02:35.540> important

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
when they hit so it's really important

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.210 
when they hit so it's really important
to<00:02:36.079> challenge<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.620> let's<00:02:36.920> see<00:02:37.040> what<00:02:37.190> that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
to challenge that let's see what that

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:46.930 
to challenge that let's see what that
looks<00:02:37.340> like<00:02:37.700> Josh<00:02:40.690> nice<00:02:44.980> good<00:02:45.980> job<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.790> what

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
looks like Josh nice good job so what

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.849 
looks like Josh nice good job so what
you<00:02:47.060> see<00:02:47.209> what<00:02:47.329> josh<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:47.840> there<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.470> foot<00:02:48.739> is

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
you see what josh is there the foot is

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.910 
you see what josh is there the foot is
is<00:02:49.100> hopping<00:02:49.579> up<00:02:49.730> taking<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.600> step<00:02:50.780> forward

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
is hopping up taking a step forward

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.750 
is hopping up taking a step forward
ideally<00:02:51.920> what<00:02:52.069> we're<00:02:52.190> luck<00:02:52.340> trying<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.640> look

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
ideally what we're luck trying to look

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.190 
ideally what we're luck trying to look
forward<00:02:52.970> Josh<00:02:53.209> did<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.480> great<00:02:53.690> job<00:02:53.720> there<00:02:54.019> was

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
forward Josh did a great job there was

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.780 
forward Josh did a great job there was
making<00:02:54.470> sure<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.709> when<00:02:54.829> that<00:02:54.859> foot<00:02:55.190> lands<00:02:55.640> it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
making sure that when that foot lands it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.309 
making sure that when that foot lands it
lands<00:02:56.030> perpendicular<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.079> way<00:02:57.170> you're

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
lands perpendicular to the way you're

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.259 
lands perpendicular to the way you're
going<00:02:57.590> again<00:02:57.829> it<00:02:58.250> doesn't<00:02:58.670> turn<00:02:58.819> out<00:02:59.030> it

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
going again it doesn't turn out it

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.030 
going again it doesn't turn out it
doesn't<00:02:59.540> turn<00:02:59.810> in<00:02:59.989> because<00:03:00.620> that's<00:03:00.829> going<00:03:00.950> to

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
doesn't turn in because that's going to

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
doesn't turn in because that's going to
be<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.160> lot<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.370> hip<00:03:01.609> recruitment<00:03:02.359> going<00:03:02.540> on

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
be a lot of hip recruitment going on

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.960 
be a lot of hip recruitment going on
this<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.350> those<00:03:03.530> lower<00:03:03.859> leg<00:03:04.160> stirrup<00:03:04.609> muscles

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
this is those lower leg stirrup muscles

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.030 
this is those lower leg stirrup muscles
that<00:03:05.269> really<00:03:05.600> pull<00:03:05.900> up<00:03:06.079> that<00:03:06.260> arch<00:03:06.530> let's<00:03:06.950> see

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
that really pull up that arch let's see

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.780 
that really pull up that arch let's see
what<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.250> looks<00:03:07.430> like<00:03:07.579> again<00:03:09.910> nice

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.710 

so<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.940> looked<00:03:17.120> like<00:03:17.270> it<00:03:17.390> was<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.510> little

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
so it looked like it was a little

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.540 
so it looked like it was a little
tougher<00:03:18.140> on<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.440> right<00:03:18.650> yeah<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.160> left<00:03:19.310> leg

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
tougher on that right yeah the left leg

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.130 
tougher on that right yeah the left leg
yeah<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:19.880> think<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.450> all<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.660> miles<00:03:20.900> we're

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
yeah I think with all the miles we're

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.930 
yeah I think with all the miles we're
doing<00:03:21.410> it's<00:03:21.620> everything's<00:03:22.370> forward<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:22.790> back

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
doing it's everything's forward and back

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.970 
doing it's everything's forward and back
in<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.300> lateral<00:03:23.660> movement<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:24.860> totally

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
in the lateral movement is it's totally

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.860 
in the lateral movement is it's totally
neglected<00:03:25.520> unless<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:25.970> really<00:03:26.209> focus<00:03:26.720> on

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
neglected unless you really focus on

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.000 
neglected unless you really focus on
things<00:03:27.080> like<00:03:27.170> this<00:03:27.380> yeah<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:27.800> great<00:03:27.920> to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
things like this yeah and it's great to

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.530 
things like this yeah and it's great to
kind<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.340> see<00:03:28.490> that<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.700> left<00:03:29.000> side<00:03:29.090> hey<00:03:29.360> that

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
kind of see that the left side hey that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
kind of see that the left side hey that
looked<00:03:29.750> pretty<00:03:29.900> smooth

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
looked pretty smooth

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.440 
looked pretty smooth
the<00:03:30.860> hips<00:03:31.100> actually<00:03:31.520> stayed<00:03:31.760> pretty<00:03:32.000> balanced

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
the hips actually stayed pretty balanced

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.940 
the hips actually stayed pretty balanced
you<00:03:32.840> know<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.110> then<00:03:33.200> I'll<00:03:33.319> sit<00:03:33.470> on<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.739> right

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
you know and then I'll sit on that right

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.070 
you know and then I'll sit on that right
side<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.640> hip<00:03:34.819> hikes<00:03:35.090> up<00:03:35.300> on<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.569> left<00:03:35.780> and

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
side the hip hikes up on the left and

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.990 
side the hip hikes up on the left and
it's<00:03:36.290> not<00:03:36.560> as<00:03:36.770> smooth<00:03:37.069> so<00:03:37.580> it's<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.790> great

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
it's not as smooth so it's a great

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.300 
it's not as smooth so it's a great
exercise<00:03:38.270> to<00:03:38.450> try<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.810> rebuild<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:40.100> get

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
exercise to try to rebuild that to get

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.130 
exercise to try to rebuild that to get
those<00:03:40.520> feet<00:03:40.790> strong<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.540> know<00:03:41.660> we're

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
those feet strong you know we're

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.380 
those feet strong you know we're
typically<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:42.980> side<00:03:43.250> dominant<00:03:43.819> you<00:03:43.940> know<00:03:44.060> I'm

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
typically one side dominant you know I'm

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.880 
typically one side dominant you know I'm
gonna<00:03:44.600> guess<00:03:44.810> you're<00:03:44.989> probably<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.440> right-side

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
gonna guess you're probably a right-side

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.350 
gonna guess you're probably a right-side
dominant<00:03:46.370> guy<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:46.760> gets<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.030> little<00:03:47.239> bit

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
dominant guy and that gets a little bit

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.360 
dominant guy and that gets a little bit
fatigued<00:03:47.690> let's<00:03:48.500> see<00:03:48.680> if<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:48.830> can<00:03:48.950> do<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.070> one

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
fatigued let's see if you can do it one

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.460 
fatigued let's see if you can do it one
more<00:03:49.580> time<00:03:49.820> coming<00:03:50.239> through<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.720> now<00:03:51.170> let's

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
more time coming through and now let's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.050 
more time coming through and now let's
really<00:03:51.650> pay<00:03:51.890> attention<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.340> those<00:03:52.519> hips<00:03:52.820> and

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
really pay attention to those hips and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.000 
really pay attention to those hips and
see<00:03:53.269> if<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.480> hips<00:03:53.690> can<00:03:53.870> stay<00:03:54.110> balanced<00:03:56.890> good

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.320 

nice<00:04:01.010> job<00:04:01.040> so<00:04:01.580> that<00:04:01.730> looks<00:04:01.910> pretty<00:04:02.060> good<00:04:02.209> to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
nice job so that looks pretty good to

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.759 
nice job so that looks pretty good to
the<00:04:02.510> left<00:04:02.720> now<00:04:02.900> let's<00:04:03.110> switch<00:04:03.260> back<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.560> the

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
the left now let's switch back to the

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.100 
the left now let's switch back to the
right<00:04:03.890> okay<00:04:04.400> before<00:04:04.580> we<00:04:04.940> start<00:04:05.209> can<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.930> keep

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
right okay before we start can you keep

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.320 
right okay before we start can you keep
your<00:04:06.260> head<00:04:06.470> up<00:04:06.500> because<00:04:07.250> obviously<00:04:07.400> visually

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
your head up because obviously visually

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.729 
your head up because obviously visually
we're<00:04:08.480> looking<00:04:08.870> for<00:04:09.080> balance<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.620> we're

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
we're looking for balance and we're

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:10.870 
we're looking for balance and we're
talking<00:04:10.040> about<00:04:10.130> balance<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:10.760> proprioception

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
talking about balance and proprioception

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.900 
talking about balance and proprioception
here<00:04:11.600> our<00:04:11.959> eyes<00:04:12.290> love<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:13.040> find<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.430> grid<00:04:13.700> line

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
here our eyes love to find a grid line

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.790 
here our eyes love to find a grid line
that<00:04:14.450> we<00:04:14.569> can<00:04:14.750> lock<00:04:14.959> on<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:15.560> create

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
that we can lock on to and create

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.280 
that we can lock on to and create
balance<00:04:16.250> if<00:04:16.640> we<00:04:16.820> keep<00:04:17.000> our<00:04:17.209> head<00:04:17.419> up<00:04:17.600> then<00:04:18.140> we

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
balance if we keep our head up then we

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.080 
balance if we keep our head up then we
actually<00:04:18.650> have<00:04:18.859> to<00:04:19.040> feel<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.459> more<00:04:19.790> through

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
actually have to feel it more through

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.699 
actually have to feel it more through
our<00:04:20.120> feet<00:04:20.450> but<00:04:20.750> let's<00:04:20.930> see<00:04:21.079> if<00:04:21.169> you<00:04:21.290> can<00:04:21.440> do<00:04:21.560> it

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
our feet but let's see if you can do it

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.960 
our feet but let's see if you can do it
I'll<00:04:21.890> give<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.130> shot<00:04:26.020> not<00:04:27.020> bad<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.740> little

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
I'll give it a shot not bad a little

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
healthy hips moving in that medial

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.830 
healthy hips moving in that medial
direction<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.370> great<00:04:43.700> job<00:04:43.940> now<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.539> thing

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
direction is a great job now the thing

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.480 
direction is a great job now the thing
is<00:04:44.990> we<00:04:45.140> don't<00:04:45.169> really<00:04:45.410> want<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.770> go<00:04:45.890> lateral

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
is we don't really want to go lateral

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.250 
is we don't really want to go lateral
directions<00:04:46.640> because<00:04:47.240> as<00:04:47.630> any<00:04:47.840> distance

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.990 
runner knows mighty bands get ugly right
we've<00:04:51.590> get<00:04:51.800> those<00:04:51.979> tight<00:04:52.220> IT<00:04:52.400> bands<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:52.910> we're

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
we've get those tight IT bands and we're

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.520 
we've get those tight IT bands and we're
fight<00:04:53.180> with<00:04:53.330> them<00:04:53.479> all<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.720> time<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:54.110> we<00:04:54.260> don't

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
fight with them all the time so we don't

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.890 
fight with them all the time so we don't
go<00:04:54.830> into<00:04:55.010> lateral<00:04:55.520> motion<00:04:55.729> because<00:04:56.479> that<00:04:56.660> just

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
go into lateral motion because that just

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.020 
go into lateral motion because that just
tends<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.200> cinch<00:04:57.530> down<00:04:57.590> in<00:04:57.979> that<00:04:58.130> icy<00:04:58.550> band<00:04:58.789> and

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
tends to cinch down in that icy band and

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.150 
tends to cinch down in that icy band and
it<00:04:59.479> basically<00:04:59.900> doesn't<00:05:00.380> do<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.680> lot<00:05:00.800> for<00:05:00.950> that

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
it basically doesn't do a lot for that

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.010 
it basically doesn't do a lot for that
medial<00:05:01.580> arch<00:05:01.729> so<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.330> we<00:05:02.450> kind<00:05:02.630> of<00:05:02.690> avoid<00:05:02.960> that

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
medial arch so so we kind of avoid that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.719 
medial arch so so we kind of avoid that
one<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.530> meteos<00:05:03.860> do<00:05:04.039> a<00:05:04.070> great<00:05:04.340> job<00:05:04.520> at
