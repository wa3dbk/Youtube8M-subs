00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.950
 I also say that Eiger is first 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.570
 It is from this time 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:18.530
 I myself 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:23.380
 7 associate in the title I will think whether let's cited as opening video 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.380
 Thank you for your opening of Yu-Gi-Oh! 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.199
 Well from the first time though 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.050
 Or rather this Notice 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.160
 It is a notice 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:40.450
 It is this time about one million times playback breakthrough 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.450
 everyone's 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.330
 We were able to achieve with warm support 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.330
 Thank you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.740
 I mean, too 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.040
 Me too 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.290
 I also how 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.530
 Oh dear 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.380
 I'm not an extramarital child, but I'm going crazy 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.780
 It is a present plan 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.560
 February 11 good 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:11.110
 I would like to announce 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.110
 I think that you yourself in the running to get everyone Sift 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.810
 By the way, it is the cards we have hit so far in the past that we have exchanged while being angry 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.119
 Yes 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.119
 Well there were a lot of things, yes 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.480
 judgment of the light I think it was quite hit 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.909
 Star Eater 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.829
 I was hit pretty bang bang 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.829
 Well I do not have such a price now 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:50.360
 In February by say 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.360
 Notice on the 11th 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.619
 About the third week 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.619
 We think that we should be able to draw by lottery and ship 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.270
 It seems so bad 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.719
 Speaking of recent developments 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.719
 Something 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.390
 This is it 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.650
 It is to check 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.400
 This fact it is without knowing the Zekkusu four encased Rutteyuu rules 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:27.180
 You only have to apply for 3 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.750
 After all it is clear two pieces, but if there is hope , dm form of twitter 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.770
 so 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.760
 a 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.180
 And Itadaketara message 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.180
 Since it responds appropriately, thank you 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.200
 It is the one after the trade, too 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.490
 Because it comes with dm of twitter 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.770
 If you have a card with money 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.960
 I think you should know dm, but a 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.960
 It is said that it is not easy to get into trade 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.200
 I have something to do 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.040
 I Do not so much 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.630
 You may only want cards you do not want 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.230
 It's also hard to come out of here 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.230
 If someone 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.710
 Thank you for trading 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.480
 If you have a card in the sun or something like cash 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.510
 If you say such a card or not 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.510
 a 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.189
 I will look for it if I feel it Eh 4 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.080
 Is that mean ? 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.950
 Oh yes, sharing 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.470
 It was not at all in the US edition 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.470
 You don't even know that you stayed one night in the box 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:55.030
 I think Na whether Ne Ja do become another soon need 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.930
 I guess I was soaring a period of time carpool 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.910
 Well that's the time of the soaring time 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.640
 I wonder if it's gone 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.640
 It feels like I should buy after that 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.060
 Went 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.040
 After all more 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:27.730
 I'm thinking I want to change the tray book and resume there 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.810
 It is after the deck 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.490
 Let's set up a shaddle now 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.490
 It is under good trial production 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.810
 It's kind of a berninger miss 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.940
 I Nde roughly layer main card is it is of burning service 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.990
 If you try a little bit 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.340
 If you can make it 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.590
 By do I think 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.590
 I think that it should be able to introduce it 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:05.240
 I do not talk with my father 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:08.139
 If you can introduce a useless card or something about the unseen card 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.139
 I think it 's okay 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.260
 No one 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.260
 Well Nde pants is not yet enough 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.129
 However, it was good for the castel top to hit after all 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.110
 Because it soars so much 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.110
 It is new of burning service afterward 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.560
 Vergil also hit 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.560
 I am in an environment where decks are easy to make this time 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:45.790
 c 9 xo Waiter a bit t 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:53.210
 It was just about hitting the park . 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:55.990
 I think I will do my best when the old liquor over soul English version comes out next time 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.449

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:03.440
