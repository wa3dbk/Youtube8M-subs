00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.729
 as if it were a computer controller 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.869
 ok then after we have 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.869

 in the program the cd reads me 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.219
 here now should start 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.400
 as you can see 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.279

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.749
 camp so I tell you yes 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:41.160
 after configuring after we now see how to configure it window 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.740
 click on the handle 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.870

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.199
 configures 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.199
 where is it 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:54.930
 first of all we have to close 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.139
 to reopen 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.539
 trieste 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.029

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.580
 horizon gaye 2 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.580
 excellent configuration ok 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.189
 that's here 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:14.490
 here is the video drivers we need to click configure 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.900
 we are we want 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.160
 we want to add some things as important settings 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.839
 For example 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.069
 full screen olindo 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.259
 you should put window for better quality we can click here 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.179
 alan desktop resolution and to adjust the window size 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.539
 origin name 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.919
 32 bit colors 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.249
 other stories read text her high resolution 0 would be no 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:45.939
 or 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.909
 1 or 2 1 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.479
 for 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.330
 which needs more ram 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.490
 is the 2 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.490
 it takes a filter file 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:00.339
 for many ways computers have it word comes so well with how 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.029
 if final result 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:04.800
 here it is convenient to put 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.919
 2 price per 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:09.649
 after that 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:13.349
 just go here height filters to choose 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.349
 how we want it 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.029
 + number rooms see messina left handcuffs 

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:23.800
 think of not loving the filtered hair texture anymore so it will be more 

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:25.610
 homogeneous 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.050
 obviously for playstation 1 games this is the option 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.840
 variety, however, to a lesser extent depending on the game because sn 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.169
 let's put on the game of stupid sockets we don't know very well that it is and of one 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:38.770
 quality 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:44.870
 less lower gray would reside si scem 2 than of the pleistescion 3 oo xbox 

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:47.419
 ok after finishing 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:50.419
 with these settings I love you okay 

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:55.199
 I call the driver and we have configured it a little while ago and call it extreme 

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.389
 extreme 

00:07:56.389 --> 00:08:00.930
 it's larger operational area and then we reopen the game 

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.779
 I hope I have been helpful this tutorial is over to see each other
