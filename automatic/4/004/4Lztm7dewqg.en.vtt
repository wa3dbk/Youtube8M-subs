00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:37.410
 for me today we find ourselves for 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.550
 the videos on black ops 2 so 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.440
 today show how to do 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.489
 education specifies the 1.2 second patch 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.679
 who came out there is not very 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.749
 a long time so it's the same method 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.219
 that patch 1.9 nothing has changed so you 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:48.659
 will eat tutorial to show that he is 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.909
 always possible from the state after the 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.319
 patch 1.10 so it will also respond to your 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.670
 greetings we had sent 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.839
 full of messages telling me yeah he 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.199
 blast you can do wrong and have 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.789
 shown 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.499
 so after the police patch is still 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.760
 possible to do it yes it is always 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.659
 possible to do it so I 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.059
 showed the evidence on video 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.520
 well we will follow up with the tutorial 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.860
 so I started to prepare your 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.170
 the rest it is with ned tools the dp 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.430
 unicorn and youtube explained how 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.140
 do in my old videos 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 then so I go on black ops 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.650
 so with the tale that receives delegation 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.030
 whose moment is reached next 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.380
 so I joined the party as an 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.760
 skill with the number two dial 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.140
 jean suzanne went to shop 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.090
 Harbor Lighthouse cros with the joystick 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.650
 number two and they will do with m us 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.090
 will have a very quickly place us to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.860
 shine your screen you find 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.340
 in the main hall with a session 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.750
 opened 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.670
 the NGO quotes here you launched your lake 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750
 switch so if everything goes well 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.160
 you will see that it takes time 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.870
 loaded bond of 20 to 30 seconds that 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.790
 depends on your commission is 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.350
 normally if you like it always 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.460
 appear with the count qualification 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.740
 so for me it's written carsten 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.960
 that already had the masters prestige then 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.250
 here is to say that really very fast 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.290
 it was therefore necessary to go directly 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.850
 particular match to death by team a 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.560
 madness she launches yves will refer to it on 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.270
 see good teams go fergie 0 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.190
 you too found at the main menu so 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.390
 top of the time charged to see plenty of 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.560
 error messages so not a message 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.100
 Recall is better as I said 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.410
 several times 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.050
 then if everything goes well you go 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.880
 see that the account was duplicated on 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.619
 the premium account beeching so 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.789
 that's what manipulation to walk 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.590
 on the skate distant points that I 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.950
 proof that I 'm on legs 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.950
 1.10 so everything is duplicated whatsoever 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.170
 the titles the emblems then the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.370
 weapons all the statistics were all 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.050
 duplicate so that's the same question 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.459
 that you know as usual 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.050
 so in any case I hope this 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.519
 video will have pleased you so do not hesitate to 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.030
 subscribe to icac have been like 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.140
 usually 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.800
 I tell you one thing how the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.800
 next first video
