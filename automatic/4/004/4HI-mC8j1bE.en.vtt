00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.170
 hi girls and guys how are you today 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.949
 come to my studio tati calmell del 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.690
 Solar to recreate the makeup and 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.840
 change of look that we did in the 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.939
 Chapter number three consists of a cut 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.839
 of hair rather shorter than his 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.319
 hair and we painted it black is a 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.629
 rocker look with intense eyes 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:43.539
 let's moisturize the lips with this 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.239
 moisturizer and such and the skin with 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.879
 and release that I always use it 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.710
 love in the eyes let's start from 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.350
 front using this cream shadow 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.289
 from mack called black ground and we're going 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.389
 to put on the entire mobile eyelid for 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.059
 titín does not have much space in the 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:04.540
 eyelid so we will go up 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.640
 considerably towards the eyebrows 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.620
 so that the makeup can be seen as 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.190
 can see we take one more brush 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.460
 little girl and we're marking up where 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.130
 we want the little black shadow to arrive 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.130
 little by little we are applying and we are going 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.100
 blurring these cream shadows are 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.020
 long-term and what I like is 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.960
 that gives you enough time to blur 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.210
 they are not those you put in a 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.360
 second they have dried up and can no longer 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.820
 blur these are pretty flexible 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:45.580
 not perfect now let's do the other 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:47.290
 eye let's do exactly the same and 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.040
 with the same man in cream we are going to 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.330
 delineate the eyes on the bottom 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.540
 then let's take one more brush 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.100
 big and let's blur this has 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.710
 to be well blurred as it is 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.290
 like a smoky eyes totally black no 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.050
 let's use another color more than black 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.050
 we are pulling the shadow to where 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.390
 we want to take it 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.010
 little by little we are taking it 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 extending the and now I'm going to take this 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.420
 shadow in dust from where keith in 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.120
 blackout is this black shadow I love 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.330
 because it's super black and we're going to put it 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.980
 above the cream shadow this is going 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.350
 to give a little more intensity to the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.070
 black color and that is not going to see 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.290
 so gray but know black black then 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.920
 with a diffuse brush we blend 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.990

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.320

 water line we are going to mark well the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.960
 eyes and little by little we're going 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.300

 the top 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.410
 then we will put mascara 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.860

 I will cover where she needs it 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.760
 because I do not want the skin filled with base 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.609
 only correcting in zones 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.030

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.799
 It gives a pretty nice shine in this 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.799

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.230

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.600

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.710
 with states blushes of the mack brand in 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.980
 coffee world at we will reinforce this 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:49.840
 The area of ​​the cheekbones is perfect 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.040
 now let's do the eyebrows we're going to 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.700
 make the eyebrows of this a little more 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.430
 thick 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:58.150
 this is a landmark pencil of next braun's 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.120

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.760
 bow as you can see and we're going to 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.910
 swell I will place a little blush 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.280
 These are the brand and what we Inglott 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.280
 to put only on the cheeks 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.800
 now on the lips use this pencil 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.040
 of makeup rever waterproof in 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.750
 color 18 ce let's put it on all the 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.060
 contour of the lips I will go 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.730
 slightly out 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.620
 and I'm going to fill it with this lipstick 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.620
 Bobby Braun in green 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.920
 and ready girls and boys 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.650
 that is the before 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.680
 and that's the after as you can see it's 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.950
 a totally different look the hair 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.110
 was totally cut off at that time the 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.580
 hair was much shorter and I think I 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.540
 it looks like it was a little bit black 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.700
 jet in the photo shoot also 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.800
 We put on the eyelid a little bit of 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.350
 this cream of elisabeth arden was or 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.690
 crime like a petroleum jelly that what's going to 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.680
 is that it gives the impression that the 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:12.590
 eyelid be like patent leather or vinyl and 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.540
 it looks super super pretty nice now 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.200
 I do not recommend it for daily use because 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.390
 Vaseline makes makeup 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.370
 let's say it moves everywhere and 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.920
 unfortunately, it stains 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.680
 but in photos it looks very nice like 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.260
 can see I hope you liked it and 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.000
 nothing would be everything and until next time 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.000
 see you chao chao a little kiss
