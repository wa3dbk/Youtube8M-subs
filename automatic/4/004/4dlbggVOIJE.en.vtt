down<00:03:33.870> now<00:03:34.870> let's<00:03:34.900> take<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.290> look<00:03:35.530> at<00:03:35.650> masking

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
down now let's take a look at masking

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.610 
down now let's take a look at masking
with<00:03:36.340> pre-cut<00:03:36.760> masking<00:03:37.209> seals<00:03:37.450> once<00:03:38.349> again

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
with pre-cut masking seals once again

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.080 
with pre-cut masking seals once again
the<00:03:38.769> instructions<00:03:39.159> will<00:03:39.430> clearly<00:03:39.730> show<00:03:40.030> you

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
the instructions will clearly show you

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.849 
the instructions will clearly show you
where<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.750> masking<00:03:41.139> seals<00:03:41.409> need<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.739> be

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
where the masking seals need to be

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.679 
where the masking seals need to be
applied<00:03:42.069> so<00:03:42.730> make<00:03:42.909> sure<00:03:42.939> you<00:03:43.209> understand

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
applied so make sure you understand

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.460 
applied so make sure you understand
where<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.900> put<00:03:44.139> them<00:03:44.290> before<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.709> start<00:03:46.470> to

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
where to put them before you start to

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.619 
where to put them before you start to
avoid<00:03:47.709> weakening<00:03:48.159> the<00:03:48.310> adhesive<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.970> recommend

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
avoid weakening the adhesive I recommend

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.879 
avoid weakening the adhesive I recommend
that<00:03:49.689> you<00:03:49.750> don't<00:03:49.959> handle<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.500> seals<00:03:50.739> with

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
that you don't handle the seals with

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.039 
that you don't handle the seals with
your<00:03:51.040> fingers<00:03:51.459> but<00:03:51.730> instead<00:03:52.120> rely<00:03:52.750> on<00:03:52.780> your

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
your fingers but instead rely on your

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.379 
your fingers but instead rely on your
trusty<00:03:53.500> tweezers<00:03:53.919> just<00:03:54.129> gently<00:03:55.030> pull<00:03:55.239> the

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
trusty tweezers just gently pull the

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.000 
trusty tweezers just gently pull the
seal<00:03:55.599> from<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.959> backing<00:03:56.139> and<00:03:56.349> move<00:03:56.739> it<00:03:56.859> into

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
seal from the backing and move it into

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.339 
seal from the backing and move it into
the<00:03:57.159> position<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.639> need<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> model<00:04:01.349> while

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
the position you need on the model while

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.170 
the position you need on the model while
it's<00:04:02.500> hard<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.799> see<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.189> video<00:04:03.459> here<00:04:03.790> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
it's hard to see in the video here the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.300 
it's hard to see in the video here the
clear<00:04:04.450> parts<00:04:04.810> have<00:04:04.959> very<00:04:05.169> fine<00:04:05.500> lines<00:04:05.889> marked

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
clear parts have very fine lines marked

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.099 
clear parts have very fine lines marked
on<00:04:06.430> them<00:04:06.609> showing<00:04:06.879> where<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.389> seal<00:04:07.599> should<00:04:07.629> go

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
on them showing where the seal should go

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.809 
on them showing where the seal should go
so<00:04:08.620> positioning<00:04:09.129> them<00:04:09.250> correctly<00:04:09.579> is

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
so positioning them correctly is

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.339 
so positioning them correctly is
actually<00:04:10.239> pretty<00:04:10.480> easy<00:04:16.049> once<00:04:17.049> you're<00:04:17.199> happy

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
actually pretty easy once you're happy

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.379 
actually pretty easy once you're happy
with<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.769> position<00:04:17.919> use<00:04:18.820> your<00:04:19.030> fingers<00:04:19.359> to

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
with the position use your fingers to

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.870 
with the position use your fingers to
press<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.900> seals<00:04:20.139> down<00:04:20.409> nice<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:20.769> hard<00:04:21.130> this

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
press the seals down nice and hard this

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.029 
press the seals down nice and hard this
is<00:04:21.940> very<00:04:22.300> important<00:04:22.750> if<00:04:22.990> your<00:04:23.440> mask<00:04:23.680> isn't

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
is very important if your mask isn't

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.800 
is very important if your mask isn't
seated<00:04:24.550> firmly<00:04:24.880> on<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.210> surface<00:04:25.659> its

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
seated firmly on the surface its

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.990 
seated firmly on the surface its
protecting<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.770> paint<00:04:27.039> may<00:04:27.220> wrap<00:04:27.550> around<00:04:27.909> the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
protecting the paint may wrap around the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.730 
protecting the paint may wrap around the
edges<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.479> get<00:04:28.659> under<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.080> seals<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.650> the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
edges and get under the seals of the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.680 
edges and get under the seals of the
tape<00:04:29.949> and<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.729> sad<00:04:30.970> part<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.539> it's

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
tape and the sad part is that it's

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.839 
tape and the sad part is that it's
nearly<00:04:31.900> impossible<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.800> fix<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.130> paint<00:04:33.370> job<00:04:33.460> on

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
nearly impossible to fix a paint job on

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.640 
nearly impossible to fix a paint job on
a<00:04:33.880> clear<00:04:34.270> plastic<00:04:34.539> part<00:04:34.990> if<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.229> mess<00:04:35.380> it<00:04:35.560> up

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
a clear plastic part if you mess it up

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.129 
a clear plastic part if you mess it up
so<00:04:36.310> don't<00:04:36.639> spare<00:04:36.909> the<00:04:37.000> pressure<00:04:37.240> make<00:04:37.960> sure

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
so don't spare the pressure make sure

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.260 
so don't spare the pressure make sure
those<00:04:38.320> seals<00:04:38.620> are<00:04:38.860> down<00:04:39.220> firmly<00:04:42.120> applying<00:04:43.120> the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
those seals are down firmly applying the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.879 
those seals are down firmly applying the
larger<00:04:43.630> masks<00:04:44.020> is<00:04:44.169> done<00:04:44.349> pretty<00:04:44.530> much<00:04:44.650> the

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
larger masks is done pretty much the

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.680 
larger masks is done pretty much the
same<00:04:45.070> way<00:04:45.310> but<00:04:45.759> if<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:45.909> can't<00:04:46.150> support<00:04:46.509> them

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
same way but if you can't support them

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.689 
same way but if you can't support them
with<00:04:46.810> just<00:04:47.139> your<00:04:47.259> tweezers<00:04:47.650> go<00:04:48.099> ahead<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.550> use

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
with just your tweezers go ahead and use

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.070 
with just your tweezers go ahead and use
your<00:04:48.729> fingers<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.270> help<00:04:49.539> position<00:04:49.720> them

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
your fingers to help position them

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.490 
your fingers to help position them
properly<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:54.120> again<00:04:55.120> don't<00:04:55.870> spare<00:04:56.320> the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
properly and again don't spare the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.110 
properly and again don't spare the
pressure<00:04:56.740> when<00:04:57.070> rubbing<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.550> down<00:04:57.580> into

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
pressure when rubbing it down into

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.480 
pressure when rubbing it down into
position

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.950 

since<00:05:04.490> clear<00:05:04.730> parts<00:05:05.090> are<00:05:05.210> hard<00:05:05.390> to<00:05:05.480> fix<00:05:05.720> I

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
since clear parts are hard to fix I

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.960 
since clear parts are hard to fix I
didn't<00:05:06.440> want<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.650> risk<00:05:06.800> any<00:05:07.010> mistakes<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:07.730> I

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
didn't want to risk any mistakes so I

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.880 
didn't want to risk any mistakes so I
also<00:05:08.270> decided<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.870> protect<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.350> back<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.800> the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
also decided to protect the back of the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.070 
also decided to protect the back of the
parts<00:05:10.190> from<00:05:10.550> any<00:05:10.730> stray<00:05:11.060> paint<00:05:11.390> by<00:05:11.630> covering

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
parts from any stray paint by covering

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.290 
parts from any stray paint by covering
it<00:05:12.200> with<00:05:12.350> this<00:05:12.470> very<00:05:12.800> large<00:05:13.040> masking<00:05:13.640> tape<00:05:13.790> you

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
it with this very large masking tape you

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.090 
it with this very large masking tape you
can<00:05:14.450> find<00:05:14.660> extra<00:05:15.080> wide<00:05:15.230> tape<00:05:15.530> like<00:05:15.740> this<00:05:15.920> in

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
can find extra wide tape like this in
