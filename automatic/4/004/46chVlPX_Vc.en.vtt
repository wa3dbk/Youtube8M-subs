00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
PSP in the beginning it was always dsi

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.229 
PSP in the beginning it was always dsi
would<00:00:36.930> win<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.190> PSP<00:00:38.850> that's

would win now it's more PSP that's
winning<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.870> think<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.890> lot<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> people<00:00:41.489> owned<00:00:42.180> a
