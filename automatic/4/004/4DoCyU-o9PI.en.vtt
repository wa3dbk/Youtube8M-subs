00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello everyone with you gameplay then 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.750
 special review on the strategy under 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.000
 name lint caps name is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.670
 difficult because the game is Swedish 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.549
 swedish is hard enough 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.070
 almost like German and so let's 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.140
 let's start a new game now you yourself all 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.619
 see we play in open space 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390
 very much like space and here 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.760
 we have such minimalistic 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 platforms we have two characters 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.769
 at first with which we will 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.160
 build equip and develop our 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.440
 such a space platform and so yesterday 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.629
 This game came out I did not take it off because 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 wanted a little bit to figure it out 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.930
 I didn’t have enough time yesterday 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.329
 so 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.370
 review just today came and so 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.460
 it is necessary to build corridors 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 peculiar simple tracks which you 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.960
 then dock various 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.780
 other bases so put the corridor and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.949
 now we need people 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.439
 idlers precisely these two 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.930
 some rectangular send here 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.119
 this way on building like you 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.340
 see the construction started they wear 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.729
 special blocks here are three kinds 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.310
 resources here you see here cubes 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.850
 because that's such rollers relatives 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.729
 plates and little yellow pyramids and and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.710
 Respectively further we build simply 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 The following types of platforms for example here 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.090
 you can build a reactor and be sure 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.229
 this platform should dock with 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.360
 paths that is here these corridors to you 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.009
 just need to build like that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.250
 you can drink that zoom reduce 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.560
 see this whole vast universe in 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.840
 the four corners here are already playgrounds 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.640
 in principle, you can finish 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.579
 and how to research them and appropriate in yourself 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.920
 here from time to time you will start 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.200
 attack rivals therefore you 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.350
 will need to build a defensive 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.270
 base and when you will be attacked 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.780
 will also need to send 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.899
 workers on defense there will be another 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.879
 how to say the menu Ivan exactly 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.170
 in the same way svaypom necessary 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.959
 will be 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.750
 redirect your workers there so 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.319
 let's build something else now 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.270
 principle 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.520
 strategies interestingly enough she 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.209
 delays but it needs to be sorted out 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.209
 Yesterday I didn’t understand it 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.629
 at first was not like to say like 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.209
 Games here today I gave her 20 minutes I 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.170
 understood its meaning and toy really 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.930
 interesting and very addictive after all 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.709
 toy how to say many times searched for these 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.470
 words and and waited a lot was announcements 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.780
 and here it finally came out so who 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.030
 likes a similar strategy like games 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.010
 download 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.840
 develop your own this one 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.349
 say town 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.959
 and enjoy life all thank you very much 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.030
 for seeing my review game 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.030
 really cool for now
