better how you do it and we're going to
talk<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.949> you<00:00:02.010> today<00:00:02.159> about<00:00:02.250> seated<00:00:02.790> pull<00:00:02.970> eros

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
talk to you today about seated pull eros

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.200 
talk to you today about seated pull eros
and<00:00:03.480> one-armed<00:00:04.170> dumbbell<00:00:04.319> rows<00:00:04.770> now<00:00:05.370> these

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
and one-armed dumbbell rows now these

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.419 
and one-armed dumbbell rows now these
are<00:00:06.359> great<00:00:06.690> exercises<00:00:07.259> but<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.680> noticed<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.280> lot

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
are great exercises but I noticed a lot

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.040 
are great exercises but I noticed a lot
of<00:00:08.490> folks<00:00:08.790> are<00:00:09.000> not<00:00:09.120> getting<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> most<00:00:09.870> they

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
of folks are not getting the most they

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.230 
of folks are not getting the most they
can<00:00:10.230> out<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.469> these<00:00:10.679> exercises<00:00:11.429> because<00:00:11.969> of

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
can out of these exercises because of

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.760 
can out of these exercises because of
one<00:00:12.570> tiny<00:00:13.230> degree<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:14.700> being<00:00:15.000> off<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.650> let<00:00:16.650> me

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
one tiny degree of being off and let me

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.830 
one tiny degree of being off and let me
explain<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.340> when<00:00:18.090> most<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.480> us<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.690> doing

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
explain that when most of us are doing

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.359 
explain that when most of us are doing
the<00:00:19.020> seated<00:00:19.289> pulley<00:00:19.529> row<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:20.070> thinking

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the seated pulley row we're thinking

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.730 
the seated pulley row we're thinking
about<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.880> cable<00:00:21.539> right<00:00:21.900> coming<00:00:22.380> into<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
about this cable right coming into the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.470 
about this cable right coming into the
body<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.369> we're<00:00:23.640> trying<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.000> figure<00:00:24.180> out<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
body and we're trying to figure out a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.320 
body and we're trying to figure out a
way<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> bring<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.350> into<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> body<00:00:25.980> as

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
way to bring this into the body as

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.000 
way to bring this into the body as
effectively<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.720> possible<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.560> oftentimes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
effectively as possible now oftentimes

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.519 
effectively as possible now oftentimes
the<00:00:29.880> back<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.570> sensation<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.439> in

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the back the sensation that we get in

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.620 
the back the sensation that we get in
our<00:00:31.650> back<00:00:31.859> isn't<00:00:32.700> really<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
our back isn't really from the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.049 
our back isn't really from the
contraction<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.770> rather<00:00:35.070> from<00:00:35.520> all<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
contraction it's rather from all of the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.090 
contraction it's rather from all of the
muscles<00:00:36.420> kind<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.719> squeezing<00:00:37.380> together<00:00:37.590> now

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
muscles kind of squeezing together now

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
muscles kind of squeezing together now
that<00:00:38.129> doesn't<00:00:38.520> mean<00:00:38.820> when<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
that doesn't mean when you get that

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.690 
that doesn't mean when you get that
sensation<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.739> doesn't<00:00:41.040> necessarily<00:00:41.160> mean

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
sensation that doesn't necessarily mean

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
sensation that doesn't necessarily mean
that<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.000> muscles<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.570> working<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that the muscles are working and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650 
that the muscles are working and
contracting<00:00:43.920> properly<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.850> similar<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.420> if

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
contracting properly it's similar to if

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
contracting properly it's similar to if
I<00:00:45.780> were<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.050> take<00:00:46.200> my<00:00:46.230> arm<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.800> push<00:00:47.309> down<00:00:47.579> on

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
I were to take my arm and push down on

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
I were to take my arm and push down on
it<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.539> course<00:00:48.809> I'm<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> feel

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it like this of course I'm going to feel

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.650 
it like this of course I'm going to feel
squeezing<00:00:49.860> sensation<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> contraction

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
squeezing sensation but the contraction

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.260 
squeezing sensation but the contraction
doesn't<00:00:51.989> happen<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.640> way<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> contraction

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
doesn't happen that way the contraction

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
doesn't happen that way the contraction
happens<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.440> doesn't<00:00:55.590> happen<00:00:55.890> from

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
happens like this it doesn't happen from

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
happens like this it doesn't happen from
pushing<00:00:56.489> down<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> lot<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> sensation

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
pushing down so a lot of the sensation

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.319 
pushing down so a lot of the sensation
that<00:00:58.800> people<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.190> feeling<00:00:59.460> from<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> seated

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that people are feeling from the seated

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.799 
that people are feeling from the seated
rows<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.829> bunched<00:01:02.399> up<00:01:02.579> muscle<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
rows is the bunched up muscle so to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
rows is the bunched up muscle so to
speak<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.650> necessarily<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.549> contraction

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
speak but not necessarily a contraction

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
speak but not necessarily a contraction
everything<00:01:06.900> pushing<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.439> top<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.799> each<00:01:07.920> other

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
everything pushing on top of each other

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.280 
everything pushing on top of each other
but<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.510> connection<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
but the the connection and the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
but the the connection and the
contraction<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.310> happening<00:01:11.610> from<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
contraction is not happening from the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.320 
contraction is not happening from the
beginning<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.659> end<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> exercise<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
beginning to the end of the exercise so

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
beginning to the end of the exercise so
here's<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.600> suggest<00:01:16.189> instead<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.369> just

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
here's what I suggest instead of just

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
here's what I suggest instead of just
pulling<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.240> weights<00:01:18.540> into<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.409> body<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
pulling these weights into the body I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.450 
pulling these weights into the body I
want<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.810> doing<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.770> lat<00:01:23.009> spread

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
want you to think of doing a lat spread

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
want you to think of doing a lat spread
while<00:01:23.880> you're<00:01:24.180> doing<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> exercise<00:01:25.049> so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
while you're doing the exercise so

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
while you're doing the exercise so
you've<00:01:25.950> already<00:01:26.159> make<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.729> connection<00:01:27.360> with

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you've already make this connection with

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.920 
you've already make this connection with
your<00:01:27.630> mind<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.670> engage<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.000> lats<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> sort<00:01:30.869> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
your mind to engage the lats and sort of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.620 
your mind to engage the lats and sort of
have<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.439> sense<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.369> where<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
have a sense of where they are in the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
have a sense of where they are in the
exercise<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.380> then<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.310> want<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.970> your

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
exercise and then I want you to do your

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.359 
exercise and then I want you to do your
seated<00:01:36.479> pulley<00:01:36.720> rows<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.950> hands<00:01:38.250> on

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
seated pulley rows with your hands on

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670 
seated pulley rows with your hands on
the<00:01:38.490> hands<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.210> handle<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.750> pulling<00:01:40.530> out

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the hands on the handle and pulling out

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.580 
the hands on the handle and pulling out
this<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:41.670> right<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.390> automatically<00:01:43.049> from

this way right so you automatically from
the<00:01:43.649> beginning<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> movement<00:01:44.729> start<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the beginning of the movement start to
