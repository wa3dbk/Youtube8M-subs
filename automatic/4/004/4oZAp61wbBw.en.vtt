lines<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> same<00:00:31.590> time<00:00:31.860> I'm<00:00:32.099> only<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.519> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
lines at the same time I'm only going to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.340 
lines at the same time I'm only going to
diagram<00:00:32.879> it<00:00:33.089> with<00:00:33.179> two<00:00:33.539> lines<00:00:33.749> so<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.199> you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
diagram it with two lines so that you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.560 
diagram it with two lines so that you
can<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.649> exactly<00:00:34.980> what's<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.730> without

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
too much confusion with you know

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340 
too much confusion with you know
crossing<00:00:38.699> arrows<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.269> stuff<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.690> but

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
crossing arrows and stuff like that but

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.419 
crossing arrows and stuff like that but
what<00:00:40.769> we're<00:00:40.859> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.190> we're<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.370> to

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.450 
what we're going to do is we're going to
start<00:00:41.730> backwards<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.039> this<00:00:44.039> player<00:00:44.249> is<00:00:44.399> gonna

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
start backwards and this player is gonna

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.369 
start backwards and this player is gonna
skate<00:00:44.819> the<00:00:44.940> puck<00:00:45.089> backwards<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.899> inside

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
skate the puck backwards to the inside

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
skate the puck backwards to the inside
of<00:00:46.499> the<00:00:46.559> cone<00:00:47.239> pivot<00:00:48.239> around<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.600> bottom<00:00:48.899> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
of the cone pivot around the bottom of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
of the cone pivot around the bottom of
the<00:00:49.050> cone<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:50.249> pivot<00:00:50.730> from<00:00:50.850> backward<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the cone so pivot from backward to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.430 
the cone so pivot from backward to
forward<00:00:52.550> take<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> couple<00:00:53.909> steps<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.479> and<00:00:54.690> then

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
forward take a couple steps up and then

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.889 
forward take a couple steps up and then
he's<00:00:55.589> gonna<00:00:55.710> fire<00:00:55.979> pass<00:00:56.339> across<00:00:56.729> to<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.539> other

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
he's gonna fire pass across to the other

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.939 
he's gonna fire pass across to the other
line

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
line

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.799 
line
now<00:00:59.249> the<00:00:59.339> other<00:00:59.460> line<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.699> doing<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.539> same

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
now the other line is doing the same

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.709 
now the other line is doing the same
thing<00:01:01.519> except<00:01:02.519> without<00:01:02.819> a<00:01:02.850> puck<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> first

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.240 
see here so there's the first shot after
this<00:01:51.000> player<00:01:51.270> makes<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.810> pass<00:01:52.109> then<00:01:53.100> he's

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
this player makes that pass then he's

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.980 
this player makes that pass then he's
gonna<00:01:53.369> follow<00:01:53.820> his<00:01:54.119> passed<00:01:54.920> skate<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.100> ice

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.270 

and<00:02:00.409> he's<00:02:01.070> going<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.400> receive<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.799> pass<00:02:03.799> from

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
and he's going to receive a pass from

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.570 
and he's going to receive a pass from
the<00:02:04.400> next<00:02:04.700> player<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.450> line<00:02:08.440> then<00:02:09.580> obviously

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
the next player in line then obviously

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.670 
the next player in line then obviously
after<00:02:10.700> he<00:02:10.910> picks<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:12.170> he's<00:02:12.500> gonna

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
after he picks that up and he's gonna

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.270 
after he picks that up and he's gonna
follow<00:02:12.980> up<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.560> where<00:02:15.830> your<00:02:15.950> second

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
follow up and this is where your second

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.490 
follow up and this is where your second
shot<00:02:16.489> comes<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:19.489> looks<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.970> that

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
shot comes in so it looks just like that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.440 
shot comes in so it looks just like that
so<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.709> two-shot<00:02:22.069> warm-up<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:23.209> other

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
so that's the two-shot warm-up the other

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.150 
so that's the two-shot warm-up the other
side<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:23.989> doing<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.260> exact<00:02:24.470> same<00:02:24.500> thing<00:02:24.950> so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
side is doing the exact same thing so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.620 
side is doing the exact same thing so
you'll<00:02:25.430> probably<00:02:25.580> want<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.940> designate<00:02:26.390> that

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
you'll probably want to designate that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.960 
you'll probably want to designate that
this<00:02:27.140> line<00:02:27.380> starts<00:02:27.650> with<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.890> puck<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:28.819> that

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
this line starts with a puck so that

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.400 
this line starts with a puck so that
they're<00:02:29.120> coming<00:02:29.420> down<00:02:29.630> making<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.230> pass

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
they're coming down making the pass

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.360 
they're coming down making the pass
cross<00:02:30.709> ice<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.340> way<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.730> players<00:02:31.970> are

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
cross ice and that way the players are

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.979 
cross ice and that way the players are
overlapping<00:02:34.370> wet<00:02:34.730> without<00:02:34.970> crossing<00:02:35.780> paths

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
overlapping wet without crossing paths

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.650 
overlapping wet without crossing paths
so<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:37.550> know<00:02:37.640> kind<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:37.940> avoid<00:02:38.239> too<00:02:38.570> much

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
so you know kind of avoid too much

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.370 
so you know kind of avoid too much
confusion<00:02:39.050> too<00:02:39.290> much<00:02:39.580> overlapping<00:02:40.580> there<00:02:40.850> and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
confusion too much overlapping there and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.780 
confusion too much overlapping there and
get<00:02:42.380> some<00:02:42.530> good<00:02:42.709> quick<00:02:43.130> hard<00:02:43.340> shots<00:02:43.580> on<00:02:43.760> that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
get some good quick hard shots on that

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.240 
get some good quick hard shots on that
so<00:02:44.630> that's<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.930> spice<00:02:45.380> two-shot<00:02:45.920> warm-up

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
so that's the spice two-shot warm-up

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.420 
so that's the spice two-shot warm-up
hopefully<00:02:46.550> that<00:02:46.700> comes<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:46.970> useful<00:02:47.090> for
