00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.470 

so<00:00:01.620> here<00:00:01.829> I'm<00:00:01.979> showing<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.550> typical<00:00:03.120> wall

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
so here I'm showing you a typical wall

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.530 
so here I'm showing you a typical wall
flashing<00:00:04.319> detail<00:00:04.859> here<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.490> what<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.060> mean<00:00:06.330> by

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
flashing detail here and what I mean by

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.629 
flashing detail here and what I mean by
that<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.990> we're<00:00:07.170> taking<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.770> roof<00:00:07.980> system<00:00:08.280> up

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
that is we're taking the roof system up

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.030 
that is we're taking the roof system up
the<00:00:09.030> wall<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.840> reason<00:00:10.170> why<00:00:10.320> we<00:00:10.469> take<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.860> so

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
the wall the reason why we take it so

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.549 
the wall the reason why we take it so
far<00:00:11.070> up<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.849> wall<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.960> were<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
far up the wall is that if you were to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.760 
far up the wall is that if you were to
ever<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.160> sewer<00:00:14.700> back<00:00:15.059> up<00:00:15.389> where<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.560> water

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
ever get a sewer back up where the water

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
ever get a sewer back up where the water
cannot<00:00:17.130> go<00:00:17.279> down<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> drains<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.180> want<00:00:18.390> your

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
cannot go down the drains you want your

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.230 
cannot go down the drains you want your
up<00:00:19.350> walls<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.070> all<00:00:20.220> details<00:00:20.460> very<00:00:20.970> high

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
up walls and all details very high

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.840 
up walls and all details very high
because<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> water<00:00:22.410> level<00:00:22.590> raises<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.609> if

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
because if the water level raises up if

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
because if the water level raises up if
you<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> low<00:00:24.689> detail<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.680> water<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:26.130> then

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
you have a low detail the water can then

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.070 
you have a low detail the water can then
fall<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.760> behind<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> high

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
fall in behind it but if you have a high

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.790 
fall in behind it but if you have a high
detail<00:00:28.619> far<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.480> wall<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.470> water

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
detail far up the wall then the water

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.740 
detail far up the wall then the water
cannot<00:00:32.160> fall<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.700> behind<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.300> inside<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
cannot fall in behind and get inside the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.680 
cannot fall in behind and get inside the
building<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.380> case<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.250> sewer<00:00:35.790> does<00:00:36.360> back<00:00:36.660> up

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
building in case a sewer does back up

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.479 
building in case a sewer does back up
and<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.320> don't<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.710> drains<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.340> your

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and you don't have drains from your

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.650 
and you don't have drains from your
regular<00:00:38.640> drains<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> don't<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.510> any

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
regular drains you don't have any

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.080 
regular drains you don't have any
drainage<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.980> take<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> take<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
drainage so we take the take the the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
drainage so we take the take the the
field<00:00:42.420> goes<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> 90<00:00:43.590> degree<00:00:43.860> angle

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
field goes up to the 90 degree angle

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
field goes up to the 90 degree angle
then<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.879> take<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:45.510> plies<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
then we take two more plies of the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.709 
then we take two more plies of the
flashing<00:00:47.039> detail<00:00:47.399> which<00:00:47.610> either<00:00:48.090> modified

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
flashing detail which either modified

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.410 
flashing detail which either modified
bitumen<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.590> polyester<00:00:49.980> itself<00:00:50.520> down

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
bitumen or the polyester itself down

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.119 
bitumen or the polyester itself down
with<00:00:51.690> hot<00:00:51.840> ash<00:00:52.079> fall<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:52.530> onto<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> roof

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
with hot ash fall down onto the roof

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
with hot ash fall down onto the roof
system<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.149> flood<00:00:54.480> coat<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.989> at<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
system then we flood coat that at the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.069 
system then we flood coat that at the
end<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> seamless<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.629> then

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
end to make it all a seamless and then

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.889 
end to make it all a seamless and then
we<00:00:58.230> take<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.770> cold<00:00:59.730> mastic<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> around<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
we take a cold mastic put it around the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.290 
we take a cold mastic put it around the
top<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.710> some<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.280> good<00:01:02.489> water<00:01:02.670> tightness

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
top for some very good water tightness

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.740 
top for some very good water tightness
and<00:01:03.530> then<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.650> put<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> around<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:06.270> corners

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and then we put it around all corners

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.350 
and then we put it around all corners
and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.110> down<00:01:07.380> seems<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and then down seems to and then when the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600 
and then down seems to and then when the
metal<00:01:09.600> flashing<00:01:10.020> gets<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.189> gets

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
metal flashing gets put on it also gets

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.100 
metal flashing gets put on it also gets
caught<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> double<00:01:12.600> seal

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
caught so you have a double seal

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.960 
caught so you have a double seal
actually<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> triple<00:01:14.340> seal<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
actually it's a triple seal because you

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
actually it's a triple seal because you
have<00:01:15.090> caulking<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> flashing<00:01:16.200> cause<00:01:16.710> cold

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
have caulking on the flashing cause cold

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
have caulking on the flashing cause cold
caulking<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> top<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> material<00:01:18.270> then

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
caulking on the top of the material then

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.830 
caulking on the top of the material then
the<00:01:18.780> material<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.259> actually<00:01:19.590> hot<00:01:20.159> asphalt

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
the material is actually hot asphalt

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
the material is actually hot asphalt
right<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.380> bricks<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> very

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
right to the bricks so you have a very

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.330 
right to the bricks so you have a very
good<00:01:23.880> water<00:01:24.450> seal<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.530> water<00:01:25.740> cannot<00:01:26.070> fall

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
good water seal so water cannot fall

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.370 
good water seal so water cannot fall
into<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> flashing<00:01:27.119> details<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.080> let's<00:01:28.259> take

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
into the flashing details so let's take

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.660 
into the flashing details so let's take
a<00:01:28.439> look<00:01:28.560> at<00:01:28.740> edges<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> typical

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
a look at edges so here is a typical

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.969 
a look at edges so here is a typical
edge<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> roof<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> called<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
edge on a roof what is called as a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.219 
edge on a roof what is called as a
canted<00:01:35.610> edge<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.360> all<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.689> means<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
canted edge and all that means is it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.830 
canted edge and all that means is it
goes<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.829> over<00:01:38.220> other<00:01:39.060> types<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.509> edges

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
goes up and over other types of edges

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.039 
goes up and over other types of edges
are<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.740> also<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.450> parapet<00:01:42.450> wall<00:01:42.750> edge

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
are you can also get a parapet wall edge

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
are you can also get a parapet wall edge
which<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.619> small<00:01:43.950> wall<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.909> take<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
which is a small wall or you take the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
which is a small wall or you take the
material<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> wall<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
material up the wall and then a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
material up the wall and then a
secondary<00:01:47.310> material<00:01:47.820> goes<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.360> over

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
secondary material goes up and over

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
secondary material goes up and over
before<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.079> put<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> metal<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
before you put the metal on but this is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
before you put the metal on but this is
your<00:01:50.790> regular<00:01:51.000> canted<00:01:51.720> edge<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> building

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
your regular canted edge on a building

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.920 
your regular canted edge on a building
and<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.030> take<00:01:54.240> two<00:01:54.479> plies<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and what we do is we take two plies of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
and what we do is we take two plies of
material<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> filled<00:01:55.829> area<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.939> two

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
material in the filled area and then two

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
material in the filled area and then two
plies<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.810> our<00:01:57.930> edge<00:01:58.170> detail<00:01:58.770> material<00:01:59.250> which

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
plies of our edge detail material which

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.100 
plies of our edge detail material which
is<00:01:59.490> either<00:01:59.610> modified<00:02:00.180> bitumen<00:02:00.390> or<00:02:00.750> our

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
edge and the reason why we go over the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
edge and the reason why we go over the
edge<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:07.140> companies<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:07.920> go<00:02:08.310> over<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
edge some companies do not go over the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.059 
edge some companies do not go over the
edge<00:02:08.879> we've<00:02:09.750> found<00:02:10.110> over<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.500> years<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.830> if

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
edge we've found over the years that if

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.979 
edge we've found over the years that if
you<00:02:11.220> ever<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.670> sewer<00:02:12.030> back<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.629> where<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
you ever get a sewer back up where the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.750 
you ever get a sewer back up where the
drains<00:02:13.319> can

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
drains can

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.290 
drains can
drain<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.700> actual<00:02:16.700> roof<00:02:16.909> system

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
drain and then the actual roof system

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.050 
drain and then the actual roof system
fills<00:02:17.540> up<00:02:17.690> with<00:02:17.720> water<00:02:18.159> if<00:02:19.159> you<00:02:19.459> don't<00:02:19.670> put<00:02:19.940> it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
fills up with water if you don't put it

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.910 
fills up with water if you don't put it
over<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.420> edge<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:21.019> roof<00:02:21.200> system<00:02:21.409> could<00:02:21.739> fill

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
over the edge the roof system could fill

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.830 
over the edge the roof system could fill
up<00:02:22.010> with<00:02:22.069> water<00:02:22.129> if<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.549> stop<00:02:22.790> your<00:02:23.030> edge<00:02:23.269> here

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
up with water if you stop your edge here

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.050 
up with water if you stop your edge here
the<00:02:24.230> water<00:02:24.440> can<00:02:24.680> get<00:02:24.799> in<00:02:24.950> behind<00:02:25.129> it<00:02:25.519> what<00:02:25.940> we

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
the water can get in behind it what we

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.610 
the water can get in behind it what we
do<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.299> we<00:02:26.420> take<00:02:26.629> it<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.080> over<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.470> edge

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
do is we take it up and over the edge

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.670 
do is we take it up and over the edge
then<00:02:28.069> we<00:02:28.190> roofing<00:02:28.670> nail<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:29.030> edges<00:02:29.450> down<00:02:29.690> then

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
then we roofing nail the edges down then

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.289 
then we roofing nail the edges down then
we<00:02:30.799> put<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.069> metal<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:31.670> if<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.879> ever<00:02:32.060> do

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
we put the metal on so if you ever do

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.500 
we put the metal on so if you ever do
get<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.750> water<00:02:33.200> sewer<00:02:33.709> back<00:02:33.950> up<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.879> can<00:02:35.120> fill<00:02:35.360> up

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
get a water sewer back up it can fill up

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.150 
get a water sewer back up it can fill up
and<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.840> falls<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.379> outside<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.099> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
and it falls on the outside of the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.949 
and it falls on the outside of the
building<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.730> cannot<00:02:37.910> get<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.390> inside

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
building and it cannot get to the inside

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.300 
building and it cannot get to the inside
of<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.170> building<00:02:39.349> by<00:02:39.650> doing<00:02:40.010> your<00:02:40.160> edge

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
of the building by doing your edge

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.630 
of the building by doing your edge
details<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.090> way<00:02:42.129> so<00:02:43.129> this<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.400> what<00:02:43.549> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
details this way so this is what the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.900 
details this way so this is what the
roof<00:02:43.819> looks<00:02:44.120> like<00:02:44.530> after<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.769> top<00:02:46.220> layer<00:02:46.610> of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
roof looks like after the top layer of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.360 
roof looks like after the top layer of
the<00:02:47.180> polyester<00:02:47.720> has<00:02:48.200> been<00:02:48.440> flood<00:02:48.769> coated<00:02:49.220> as

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the polyester has been flood coated as

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.050 
the polyester has been flood coated as
you<00:02:49.849> can<00:02:50.030> see<00:02:50.269> it's<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.110> one-piece<00:02:52.060> seamless

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
you can see it's a one-piece seamless

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.099 
you can see it's a one-piece seamless
hot<00:02:53.660> asphalt<00:02:53.930> roof<00:02:54.590> system<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.720> way<00:02:56.750> from

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
hot asphalt roof system all the way from

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.699 
hot asphalt roof system all the way from
here<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.549> end<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:59.840> are<00:02:59.870> no<00:03:00.170> detectable

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
here to the end there are no detectable

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.580 
here to the end there are no detectable
seams<00:03:01.160> in<00:03:01.459> our<00:03:01.579> membrane<00:03:02.120> because<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.290> flood

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
seams in our membrane because the flood

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.250 
seams in our membrane because the flood
coat<00:03:03.890> encapsulate<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.000> top<00:03:05.239> layer<00:03:05.599> of<00:03:05.870> the

coat encapsulate the top layer of the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.069 
coat encapsulate the top layer of the
polyester<00:03:06.819> absorbs<00:03:07.819> into<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.180> polyester<00:03:08.660> and

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
polyester absorbs into the polyester and

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.369 
polyester absorbs into the polyester and
then<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.739> seams<00:03:10.040> disappear<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:12.109> is<00:03:12.230> what

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
then the seams disappear so this is what

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.020 
then the seams disappear so this is what
it<00:03:12.500> looks<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:12.859> after<00:03:13.519> we're<00:03:13.700> done<00:03:13.879> the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
it looks like after we're done the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.270 
it looks like after we're done the
install<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.750> reinforcement<00:03:15.319> plies<00:03:15.680> and

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
install of the reinforcement plies and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.030 
install of the reinforcement plies and
we're<00:03:16.430> just<00:03:16.640> about<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:17.030> gravel<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.769> roof

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
we're just about to gravel the roof

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.539 
we're just about to gravel the roof
system<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.380> here<00:03:21.530> we<00:03:21.680> have<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.980> graveling

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
system so here we have the graveling

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.550 
system so here we have the graveling
crew<00:03:22.819> down<00:03:23.090> on<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.450> ground<00:03:23.720> loading<00:03:24.230> up<00:03:24.380> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
crew down on the ground loading up the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.520 
crew down on the ground loading up the
concrete<00:03:25.450> dispenser<00:03:26.450> buckets<00:03:26.870> make<00:03:27.500> a

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
concrete dispenser buckets make a

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.830 
concrete dispenser buckets make a
dispense<00:03:28.040> gravel<00:03:28.700> -<00:03:28.940> it's<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.450> middle<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
dispense gravel - it's the middle of the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.860 
dispense gravel - it's the middle of the
winter<00:03:30.019> time<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.500> we<00:03:30.620> have<00:03:30.739> one<00:03:31.090> man<00:03:32.090> heating

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
winter time so we have one man heating

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.509 
winter time so we have one man heating
the<00:03:32.989> gravel<00:03:33.530> because<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.010> gravel<00:03:34.400> has<00:03:34.459> been

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
the gravel because the gravel has been

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.759 
the gravel because the gravel has been
delivered<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.329> few<00:03:35.569> days<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.500> pretty

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
delivered for a few days it's pretty

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.099 
delivered for a few days it's pretty
much<00:03:36.889> frozen<00:03:37.459> solid<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.329> they<00:03:38.450> use<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:38.630> propane

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
much frozen solid so they use a propane

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.809 
much frozen solid so they use a propane
torch<00:03:39.489> who<00:03:40.489> heats<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.940> gravel<00:03:41.419> the<00:03:42.349> ramrod

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.879 
torch who heats the gravel the ramrod
driver<00:03:43.819> then<00:03:44.120> drives<00:03:44.480> into<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.840> gravel<00:03:45.109> lifts

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
driver then drives into the gravel lifts

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.979 
driver then drives into the gravel lifts
the<00:03:45.980> gravel<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.430> puts<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.120> into<00:03:47.269> these<00:03:47.480> gravel

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
the gravel up puts it into these gravel

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.449 
the gravel up puts it into these gravel
dispensers<00:03:48.560> which<00:03:48.799> are<00:03:48.950> actually<00:03:49.310> just

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
dispensers which are actually just

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.759 
dispensers which are actually just
concrete<00:03:49.910> dispensing<00:03:50.569> buckets<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.169> then<00:03:51.620> the

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
concrete dispensing buckets and then the

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.250 
concrete dispensing buckets and then the
crane<00:03:52.069> our<00:03:52.880> crane<00:03:53.209> takes<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.660> up<00:03:53.780> onto<00:03:53.989> the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
crane our crane takes it up onto the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.199 
crane our crane takes it up onto the
roof<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:55.160> I'll<00:03:55.310> take<00:03:55.549> you<00:03:55.669> up<00:03:55.790> on<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.060> roof

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
roof and I'll take you up on the roof

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.729 
roof and I'll take you up on the roof
now<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.690> I'll<00:03:56.780> show<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.019> how<00:03:57.230> we<00:03:57.290> dispense

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
now and I'll show you how we dispense

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.670 
now and I'll show you how we dispense
the<00:03:57.919> gravel<00:03:58.250> into<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.459> wheel<00:03:58.579> barrels<00:03:59.680> so

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
the gravel into the wheel barrels so

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.500 
the gravel into the wheel barrels so
this<00:04:00.829> is<00:04:00.980> how<00:04:01.099> we<00:04:01.160> empty<00:04:01.639> the<00:04:01.760> gravel<00:04:02.150> up<00:04:02.299> on

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
this is how we empty the gravel up on

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.479 
this is how we empty the gravel up on
the<00:04:02.660> roof

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
the roof

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.710 
the roof
concrete<00:04:04.489> bucket<00:04:04.819> filled<00:04:05.030> with<00:04:05.180> gravel<00:04:05.389> gets

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
concrete bucket filled with gravel gets

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.839 
concrete bucket filled with gravel gets
sent<00:04:05.959> up<00:04:06.079> onto<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.530> roof<00:04:06.739> they<00:04:07.340> then<00:04:07.549> pull

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
sent up onto the roof they then pull

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.879 
sent up onto the roof they then pull
that<00:04:08.030> handle<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.569> that<00:04:08.780> releases<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.349> gravel

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
that handle and that releases the gravel

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.210 
that handle and that releases the gravel
into<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.699> wheel<00:04:10.879> barrel<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.620> each<00:04:12.949> concrete

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
into the wheel barrel so each concrete

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.099 
into the wheel barrel so each concrete
bucket<00:04:13.790> does<00:04:13.970> three<00:04:14.239> or<00:04:14.329> four<00:04:14.510> wheelbarrows

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
bucket does three or four wheelbarrows

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.920 
bucket does three or four wheelbarrows
full<00:04:15.139> and<00:04:15.940> as<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.090> can<00:04:17.209> see<00:04:17.359> just<00:04:17.539> pulls<00:04:17.810> the

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
full and as you can see just pulls the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.270 
full and as you can see just pulls the
handle<00:04:18.199> the<00:04:18.289> gravel<00:04:18.590> comes<00:04:18.769> out<00:04:18.919> they<00:04:19.070> fill

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
handle the gravel comes out they fill

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.289 
handle the gravel comes out they fill
the<00:04:19.370> wheel<00:04:19.519> barrel<00:04:19.820> they<00:04:19.910> take<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.150> wheel

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
the wheel barrel they take the wheel

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.940 
the wheel barrel they take the wheel
barrel<00:04:20.599> of<00:04:20.690> gravel<00:04:21.019> over<00:04:21.199> to<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.620> person

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
barrel of gravel over to the person

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.560 
barrel of gravel over to the person
that's<00:04:22.070> spreading<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.580> gravel<00:04:22.909> out<00:04:23.030> then

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
that's spreading the gravel out then

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.270 
that's spreading the gravel out then
they<00:04:23.719> spread<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.169> gravel<00:04:24.469> out<00:04:24.590> onto<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.099> roof

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
they spread the gravel out onto the roof

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.540 
they spread the gravel out onto the roof
system

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
system

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.950 
system
so<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.700> a<00:04:27.760> pretty<00:04:27.970> simple<00:04:28.330> procedure<00:04:28.480> we

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
so it's a pretty simple procedure we

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.720 
so it's a pretty simple procedure we
bring<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.260> wheel<00:04:29.470> barrels<00:04:29.950> over<00:04:30.130> from<00:04:30.580> the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
bring the wheel barrels over from the

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.270 
bring the wheel barrels over from the
concrete<00:04:31.210> bucket<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.290> gravel<00:04:32.860> spreaders

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
concrete bucket to the gravel spreaders

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.880 
concrete bucket to the gravel spreaders
they<00:04:33.490> dump<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.240> wheelbarrows<00:04:34.870> out<00:04:35.110> into

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
they dump the wheelbarrows out into

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.150 
they dump the wheelbarrows out into
piles<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.490> then<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.760> spreader<00:04:37.410> he<00:04:38.410> pushes<00:04:39.010> it

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
piles and then the spreader he pushes it

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160 
piles and then the spreader he pushes it
around<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.640> roof<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.880> make<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.210> uniform<00:04:40.870> layer

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
around the roof to make a uniform layer

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.720 
around the roof to make a uniform layer
of<00:04:41.350> gravel<00:04:41.830> which<00:04:41.950> makes<00:04:42.190> an<00:04:42.370> excellent

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
of gravel which makes an excellent

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.970 
of gravel which makes an excellent
sunscreen<00:04:43.570> so<00:04:44.170> let's<00:04:44.350> take<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:44.590> look<00:04:44.770> at<00:04:44.890> the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
sunscreen so let's take a look at the

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.000 
sunscreen so let's take a look at the
roof<00:04:45.160> after<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.780> has<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.140> gravel<00:04:47.530> sunscreen

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
roof after it has the gravel sunscreen

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.480 
roof after it has the gravel sunscreen
applied<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:50.350> here<00:04:50.500> you<00:04:50.620> can<00:04:50.740> see<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:51.040> gravel

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
applied so here you can see the gravel

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.130 
applied so here you can see the gravel
has<00:04:51.610> been<00:04:51.670> installed<00:04:52.150> onto<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.660> roof<00:04:52.840> system

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
has been installed onto the roof system

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.460 
has been installed onto the roof system
now<00:04:53.440> this<00:04:53.680> is<00:04:53.860> your<00:04:54.270> traditional<00:04:55.270> grep<00:04:56.140> pea

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
now this is your traditional grep pea

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.090 
bright white marble option we get the
marble<00:05:21.220> mind<00:05:21.730> for<00:05:22.570> us<00:05:22.600> out<00:05:23.260> of<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.500> Mara<00:05:23.710> mine

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
marble mind for us out of the Mara mine

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.160 
marble mind for us out of the Mara mine
and<00:05:24.310> it's<00:05:24.430> cut<00:05:24.670> and<00:05:24.910> shaved<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.480> size<00:05:25.690> for<00:05:26.020> our

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
and it's cut and shaved to size for our

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.340 
and it's cut and shaved to size for our
tuff<00:05:26.380> roof<00:05:26.590> applications<00:05:27.310> and<00:05:27.550> we<00:05:28.320> install<00:05:29.320> it

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
tuff roof applications and we install it

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.110 
tuff roof applications and we install it
just<00:05:29.530> like<00:05:29.860> we<00:05:30.010> do<00:05:30.130> pea<00:05:30.340> gravel<00:05:30.550> pour<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.030> over

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
just like we do pea gravel pour it over

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.360 
just like we do pea gravel pour it over
the<00:05:31.270> roof<00:05:31.570> system<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.830> those<00:05:33.010> two<00:05:33.250> other

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
the roof system so those two other

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.460 
the roof system so those two other
options<00:05:33.640> with<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.270> bright<00:05:34.480> white<00:05:34.660> marble<00:05:35.290> it

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
options with the bright white marble it

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.860 
options with the bright white marble it
has<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.740> very<00:05:36.190> high<00:05:36.430> reflectivity<00:05:36.910> too<00:05:37.570> so<00:05:37.780> if

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
has a very high reflectivity too so if

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.590 
has a very high reflectivity too so if
you're<00:05:37.990> looking<00:05:38.110> for<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.440> higher<00:05:38.710> reflectivity

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
you're looking for a higher reflectivity

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.930 
you're looking for a higher reflectivity
then<00:05:40.600> traditional<00:05:41.230> gravel<00:05:42.070> we<00:05:42.490> have<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:42.790> two

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
then traditional gravel we have the two

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.480 
then traditional gravel we have the two
other<00:05:42.970> options<00:05:43.390> for<00:05:43.960> sunscreens<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:44.950> then<00:05:45.370> if

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
other options for sunscreens and then if

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.880 
other options for sunscreens and then if
you<00:05:45.610> go<00:05:45.760> with<00:05:45.970> say<00:05:46.390> a<00:05:46.419> tio<00:05:46.720> coat<00:05:47.140> you<00:05:47.530> can<00:05:47.560> also

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
you go with say a tio coat you can also

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.620 
you go with say a tio coat you can also
get<00:05:48.160> government<00:05:48.700> rebates<00:05:48.880> back<00:05:49.360> for

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
get government rebates back for

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.510 
get government rebates back for
reflectivity<00:05:50.169> and<00:05:50.470> the<00:05:50.890> Toronto<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.400> Ontario

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
reflectivity and the Toronto and Ontario

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.820 
reflectivity and the Toronto and Ontario
area<00:05:52.240> so<00:05:52.570> this<00:05:53.080> is<00:05:53.260> the<00:05:53.440> traditional

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
area so this is the traditional

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.070 
area so this is the traditional
sunscreen<00:05:54.160> so<00:05:55.000> let's<00:05:55.150> go<00:05:55.270> take<00:05:55.510> a<00:05:55.540> look<00:05:55.750> at<00:05:55.870> the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
sunscreen so let's go take a look at the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.900 
sunscreen so let's go take a look at the
the<00:05:56.320> guys<00:05:56.470> installing<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.280> actual<00:05:57.669> edge

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
the guys installing the actual edge

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.130 
the guys installing the actual edge
flashings<00:05:58.780> now<00:06:00.360> so<00:06:01.360> here<00:06:01.540> we<00:06:01.660> have<00:06:01.810> one<00:06:01.960> of<00:06:02.050> our

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
flashings now so here we have one of our

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.870 
flashings now so here we have one of our
metal<00:06:02.380> mechanics<00:06:02.950> installing<00:06:03.430> the<00:06:03.520> metal

also<00:06:07.870> put<00:06:08.169> the<00:06:08.260> metal<00:06:08.500> on<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.650> walls<00:06:08.950> or<00:06:09.370> vent

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
also put the metal on the walls or vent

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.790 
also put the metal on the walls or vent
boxes<00:06:10.270> there<00:06:10.390> anywhere<00:06:10.690> we<00:06:10.750> have<00:06:10.960> a<00:06:11.110> vertical

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800

metal<00:06:14.169> flashing<00:06:14.470> on<00:06:14.830> now<00:06:16.080> what<00:06:17.080> happens<00:06:17.410> with

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
metal flashing on now what happens with

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.409 
metal flashing on now what happens with
the<00:06:17.680> roofing<00:06:18.130> is<00:06:18.340> that<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.640> roofers<00:06:19.030> come<00:06:19.270> in

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
the roofing is that the roofers come in

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.060 
the roofing is that the roofers come in
and<00:06:19.600> they<00:06:19.720> paint<00:06:20.050> a<00:06:20.169> picture<00:06:20.320> with<00:06:20.680> doing<00:06:20.950> the

roof these guys come in and they frame

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.080 
roof these guys come in and they frame
the<00:06:23.290> picture<00:06:23.620> the<00:06:24.100> metal<00:06:24.490> work<00:06:24.700> is<00:06:24.910> all

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
the picture the metal work is all

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.740 
the picture the metal work is all
cosmetic<00:06:25.720> it's<00:06:26.080> never<00:06:26.530> to<00:06:26.770> be<00:06:26.919> relied<00:06:27.310> on<00:06:27.340> as<00:06:28.210> a

cosmetic it's never to be relied on as a
waterproof<00:06:29.500> ER<00:06:29.680> it<00:06:30.280> just<00:06:30.640> gets<00:06:30.850> put<00:06:31.060> around

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
waterproof ER it just gets put around

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.630 
waterproof ER it just gets put around
the<00:06:31.450> edges<00:06:31.870> to<00:06:32.080> make<00:06:32.230> the<00:06:32.500> edges<00:06:33.040> look<00:06:33.340> nice

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
the edges to make the edges look nice

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.219 
the edges to make the edges look nice
because<00:06:34.090> if<00:06:34.270> you<00:06:34.360> err<00:06:34.450> just<00:06:34.510> leave<00:06:34.900> the<00:06:35.050> roof

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
because if you err just leave the roof

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.800 
because if you err just leave the roof
over<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.590> edge<00:06:35.710> doesn't<00:06:36.250> look<00:06:36.430> very<00:06:36.460> nice<00:06:36.910> but

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
over the edge doesn't look very nice but

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.080 
over the edge doesn't look very nice but
we<00:06:38.160> employ<00:06:39.160> the<00:06:39.460> most

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090

put a lot of hard work into our ruse we
don't<00:06:51.940> want<00:06:52.150> to<00:06:52.240> put<00:06:52.389> on<00:06:52.510> metal<00:06:52.900> at<00:06:52.990> the<00:06:53.110> very

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
don't want to put on metal at the very

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.780 
don't want to put on metal at the very
end<00:06:53.500> that<00:06:53.590> doesn't<00:06:53.770> look<00:06:54.070> nice<00:06:54.370> and<00:06:54.610> I'm
