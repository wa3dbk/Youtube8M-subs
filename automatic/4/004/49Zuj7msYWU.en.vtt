I bring it in just a hair and then I
make<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.230> almost<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:40.980> not<00:00:41.070> quite<00:00:41.129> square

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
make it almost but not quite square

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.510

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
that would take care of the body I came

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
that would take care of the body I came
in<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.100> bit<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.199> see

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
in just a little bit so now you can see

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.090 
in just a little bit so now you can see
me<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.770> another<00:00:55.800> corner<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.690> clip<00:00:57.690> it<00:01:01.100> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
me do it on another corner I clip it and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:23.460 
me do it on another corner I clip it and
as<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.879> come<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.300> see<00:01:04.049> how<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.229> pulled<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.100> welt<00:01:05.580> in

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.110 

I<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.090> lot<00:01:25.330> of<00:01:25.740> employees<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.640> one<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.030> the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
I have a lot of employees and one of the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.400 
I have a lot of employees and one of the
things<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.510> I've<00:01:28.600> learned<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.260> that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
things that I've learned is is that

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.860 
things that I've learned is is that
precision<00:01:29.830> makes<00:01:30.790> everything<00:01:31.150> look<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.660> same

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
precision makes everything look the same

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.470 
precision makes everything look the same
and<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.140> put<00:01:35.530> all<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.370> your<00:01:36.940> corners

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
and so if you put all of your corners

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and so if you put all of your corners
the<00:01:37.630> same<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:39.310> helps<00:01:40.020> everybody's<00:01:41.020> pillows

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
the same it helps everybody's pillows

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.490 
the same it helps everybody's pillows
look<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.830> same<00:01:42.040> if<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:43.120> always<00:01:43.600> use<00:01:43.930> 1<00:01:44.320> and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
look the same if you always use 1 and

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.830 
look the same if you always use 1 and
3/4<00:01:45.010> inch<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:45.880> always<00:01:46.120> have<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.300> half<00:01:46.600> inch

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
3/4 inch you always have a half inch

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.420 
3/4 inch you always have a half inch
seam<00:01:47.110> allowance<00:01:47.140> unless<00:01:47.980> of<00:01:48.100> course<00:01:48.130> you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
seam allowance unless of course you

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:56.609 
seam allowance unless of course you
change<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.660> size<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:50.050> your<00:01:50.110> welt<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:56.500> you

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
change the size of your welt and if you

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.070 
change the size of your welt and if you
have<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.830> problem<00:01:57.160> with<00:01:57.460> it<00:01:57.670> pulling<00:01:58.180> up<00:01:58.330> as<00:01:58.630> you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
have a problem with it pulling up as you

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.980 
have a problem with it pulling up as you
stitch<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.340> can't<00:02:00.700> pull<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.420> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.859 
stitch it and you can't pull the the
gathers<00:02:02.410> out<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.890> your<00:02:03.010> face<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:04.750> I've

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
gathers out of your face what I've

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.230 
gathers out of your face what I've
learned<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.350> do<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.710> is<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.040> put<00:02:06.610> my<00:02:06.729> finger

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
learned to do is is to put my finger

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.499 
learned to do is is to put my finger
under<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:08.170> welt<00:02:08.380> cord<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.729> give<00:02:10.090> yourself

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
under the welt cord and give yourself

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.850 
under the welt cord and give yourself
just<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.869> little<00:02:11.140> extra<00:02:12.000> give<00:02:13.000> there<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.830> I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
just a little extra give there but I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.240 
just a little extra give there but I
have<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> tendency<00:02:15.280> instead<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:15.910> doing<00:02:16.120> that

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
have a tendency instead of doing that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.800 
have a tendency instead of doing that
can<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.370> see<00:02:18.610> how<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.850> have<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.480> little<00:02:19.630> bit

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
can you see how I have just a little bit

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.650 
can you see how I have just a little bit
of<00:02:19.900> an<00:02:19.990> arch<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.380> my<00:02:20.500> wall<00:02:20.709> court<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.450> hold<00:02:22.450> it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
of an arch in my wall court I hold it

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.400 
of an arch in my wall court I hold it
with<00:02:22.810> one<00:02:22.840> hand<00:02:23.020> i<00:02:23.440> smoosh<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:23.950> down<00:02:24.130> with<00:02:24.400> it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
with one hand i smoosh it down with it

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.990 
with one hand i smoosh it down with it
and<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.740> will<00:02:26.890> do<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.070> exact<00:02:27.459> same<00:02:27.489> thing

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
and that will do the exact same thing

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.280 
and that will do the exact same thing
the<00:02:29.760> key<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.300> do<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> same<00:02:32.019> way

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
the key is is to do it the same way

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.280 
the key is is to do it the same way
every<00:02:32.590> time

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.440 

so<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.189> basically<00:02:42.610> about<00:02:42.849> putting<00:02:43.360> an

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
so this is basically about putting an

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.619 
so this is basically about putting an
invisible<00:02:43.989> zipper<00:02:44.019> in<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.680> pillow<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.629> thought

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
invisible zipper in a pillow I thought

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.780 
invisible zipper in a pillow I thought
you<00:02:46.750> might<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.140> see<00:02:47.500> how<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.129> put<00:02:48.579> welt

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
you might like to see how I put welt

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.030 
you might like to see how I put welt
cord<00:02:48.879> onto<00:02:49.450> now<00:02:49.959> see<00:02:50.140> I'm<00:02:50.290> going<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.709> came

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
cord onto now see I'm going to I came

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.710 
cord onto now see I'm going to I came
around<00:02:51.159> the<00:02:51.310> corner<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:52.150> I'm<00:02:52.299> going<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.540> put

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
around the corner now I'm going to put
