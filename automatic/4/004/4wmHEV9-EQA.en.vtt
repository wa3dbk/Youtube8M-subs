blueprint of what we'll be producing
from<00:00:34.210> that<00:00:34.329> point<00:00:34.539> forward<00:00:34.809> the<00:00:36.120> next<00:00:37.120> stage

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:37.479 
from that point forward the next stage

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.660 
from that point forward the next stage
is<00:00:37.839> rough<00:00:38.319> animation<00:00:38.979> and<00:00:39.219> this<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.429> where<00:00:39.579> the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
is rough animation and this is where the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.369 
is rough animation and this is where the
characters<00:00:39.969> really<00:00:40.179> come<00:00:40.420> into<00:00:40.569> life<00:00:40.749> at<00:00:41.139> this

here we are final color we we kind of

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.270 
here we are final color we we kind of
consider<00:01:46.870> this<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.380> be<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.680> icing<00:01:47.920> on<00:01:48.220> the
