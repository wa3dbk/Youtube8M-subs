00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone with you sled in this video I 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.940
 tell you how to install damage 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.099
 panel for world of tanks 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 now literally two seconds in short 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.820
 I'll tell you what the damage panel is and for 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.370
 what does it need in another way still damage 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.699
 the panel is called the damage panel then 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.710
 there she shows who shot me 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.430
 what opponent what projectile how many 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.740
 caused you damage and also shows 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.090
 damaged your module then there is well 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.039
 A very important thing is a reference to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.590
 download panel damage any absolutely 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.780
 not all different will be in the description 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.640
 this video can go download 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.500
 any damage you like panel a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.940
 now let's go to install i 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.680
 I will show you how this whole thing is needed 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.149
 install that is just how you downloaded 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.950
 Damage panel go to the sample folder 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.960
 different again I repeat 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.809
 Downloaded an example of three options 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 and we need to go into that is go 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.199
 name home panel you decide 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.170
 so what you want to put 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.149
 we go name and here we have 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.579
 folders in English that's important 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.830
 i.e. folder spark all panels have 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.200
 it becomes absolutely equally can 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 be just a gulbi script 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.530
 maybe three folders well in general you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.510
 we need these folders in English 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.119
 that is, for the time being, I am postponing it in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 Now we find the side on the desktop 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.119
 label world of tanks 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.390
 click on it with the right mouse button 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.710
 Next, select the file location 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.939
 go here we got into the folder with 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.040
 installed game 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.070
 now we need daddy times mods 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.110
 go in and now it is very important 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.909
 there is a damage panel setting on each 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.430
 new patch needs to be installed naturally 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.210
 need to re-install in the current version 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.290
 packs of suit example by rank 095 means 095 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.450
 if 096 means 096 and so on in general 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.790
 go in the folder with the numbers so go 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.590
 here from you china there is a fashion then here 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.420
 you better have different mods folders 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.340
 if there are no other mods yet 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.740
 then nothing will mean 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 purely now we select here what you 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.170
 downloaded the damage panel you want 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.320
 to establish 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.920
 2 daddy well, how many will click there 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.600
 insert it here press it all 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.660
