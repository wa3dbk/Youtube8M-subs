00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.350
 floods storm raising 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.050
 climate change is already happening 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.880
 changing the face of our planet 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.659
 the whims of time are no longer 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.039
 an exception 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.039
 they are becoming the norm 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.720
 the ice of our globe is being 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.420
 dissolving and this will change everything 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.660
 the seas rise and could 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.190
 submerge cities millions of people 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.930
 they could die 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.350
 all coastal areas and will suffer the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350
 consequences 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.450
 it is inevitable we must resign ourselves to 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.730
 lose areas in close proximity now 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.210
 we will try to understand what's there 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.250
 true 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.600
 global warming and 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.600
 melting of the polar ice caps 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.440
 we observed that not only i 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.480
 glaciers are melting due 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.580
 of the increase in temperature aima 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.070
 that are flowing more quickly from the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.320
 center of the continent towards the ocean and 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.420
 the icebergs are forming at one 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.800
 speed two or three times greater than 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.800
 just five six years ago 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.330
 every day from this glacier yes 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 off 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.860
 which would be sufficient to replenish 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.210
 fresh water in a city like new 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.040
 york for a whole year in almost all 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.350
 greenland glaciers south of the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.890
 Arctic circle this phenomenon has suffered 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.890
 acceleration 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.200
 their merger is not at all unusual the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.060
 edges melt continuously but of 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.030
 usually the loss is offset 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.340
 the amount of snow that falls on the snow 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.280
 is consolidated going to form new 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.470
 ice so the glacier increases 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.110
 in the most elevated areas melting at 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.930
 edges scientists define 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.020
 mass balance glaciers accumulate 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.730
 as much ice as they lose this 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.709
 natural balance keeps the shell 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.380
 stable glacial sea levels 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.830
 under control over the last 10,000 years 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.080
 this has always been the case 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.840
 remained stable but now that balance 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.310
 and twisted the ice lost at the edges 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.940
 and much more than what you do 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.739
 form at high altitude every year the island loses 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.300
 20 percent more mass than that 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.300
 to how much it accumulates with the snowfalls 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.650
 if we continue at this rate like 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.930
 shows this scale we will lose 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.780
 even more mass if we found out that 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.580
 just what is happening at 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.950
 moment we are losing about 200 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.710
 cubic kilometers 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.690
 we can afford it we continue to 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.850
 this rhythm the polar cap of 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.440
 Greenland will lose a certain amount each year 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.830
 quantity of mass if the level of 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.350
 oceans will grow you must to carry out 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.050
 a more detailed study NASA has 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.940
 installed a gps system to monitor 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.240
 the altitude of the glaciers and to control and 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.110
 the loss of volume what they have 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.000
 discovered it left them open-mouthed i 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.960
 glaciers are melting at one 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.910
 speed never seen 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.910
 they're literally slipping into your hand 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.490
 in recent years when we have 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.199
 the temperatures recorded extremely 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.080
 accelerated casting with or not 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.240
 10 percent but 5 eighty 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.090
 percent 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.979
 in the summer of 1985 the glaciers did 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.729
 they moved towards the sea at just 6 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.729
 kilometers per year 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.819
 in the summer of 2003 we moved to 12 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.819
 kilometers per year 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.840
 it is clear that the process is going on 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.520
 accelerating 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.770
 these formations move towards the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.550
 oceans much more quickly 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.699
 the reason explains it is physics 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.259
 the effect of thawing water 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.360
 if you place an ice block on 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.280
 a dry surface will move 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.699
 very slowly or will not move has 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.699
 done 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.890
 but when the ice starts at 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.570
 melt the water creeps between the 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.660
 block and the surface with an effect 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.350
 lubricant ice can move 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.350
 much faster 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.620
 this is exactly what is happening 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.599
 unwavering average temperatures more 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.930
 hot are causing the melting of the 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.879
 glaciers at the top and at the edges on 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.710
 surface large puddles of are formed 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.389
 thaw water 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.180
 but the glaciers are characterized by 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:09.150
 huge crevasses and water channels 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.490
 thawed penetrates these cracks 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.530
 going to gather in depth 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.659
 here it lubricates the point of attachment between the 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.819
 glacier the soil reducing the 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.590
 section that keeps it anchored to the ground e 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:24.099
 thus speeding up the slip to 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.979
 the sea and this is not good at all 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:29.850
 the phenomenon is enormous the loss of 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.350
 Ice doubles 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.300
 station believes that for the human race 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.220
 this acceleration of the slip 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.130
 of steels towards the sea have 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.260
 catastrophic implications if 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.180
 the rising of the seas of the last 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.870
 ten years was more or less than a 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:52.750
 centrist and this increase among the 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:55.480
 last 5 10 years has doubled in the past 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.000
 continues to double ten year domains 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.250
 from here to a century the phenomenon 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 will affect most of the coasts of the 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:06.250
 planet the idea if greenland does 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.410
 will melt completely will release 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.710
 enough water to raise all the 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.640
 oceans of the earth of seven meters 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.919
 until recently scientists 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.980
 they believed this was the scenario 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:20.500
 worst they were wrong 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.620
 Greenland has a lot of ice but 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:27.600
 it is not the only one present on the planet 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.600
 here there are 2 million cubic meters 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.250
 but the antarctica norms that continent 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:37.450
 located at the south pole it contains eleven 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:40.090
 times so much scientists thought that 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.160
 there were no problems with the huge masses 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.440
 of Antarctic ice had a 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.050
 balanced mass balance the 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.660
 continent is huge mountainous and cold 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.430
 should guarantee rainfall 

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:55.060
 enough to counterbalance the 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.920
 border fusion this in theory and is 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.920
 so that has gone over the last 10,000 

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.020
 years 

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.890
 then in 2002 it is proved that 

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.890
 the balance is broken
