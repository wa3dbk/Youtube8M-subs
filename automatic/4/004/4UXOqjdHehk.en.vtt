00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.670
 Chaly began a shot exactly such a word 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.210
 comes to mind first at the mention of 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.950
 this game 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.650
 his plays really flew in 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.290
 gamers mind like a bullet, few as 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.460
 gave and I including from yubisoft something 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.029
 like why 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 enough to remember the first headlights edge 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.180
 the most beautiful is probably the best 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.369
 graphics for a shooter won over that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 the moment of all who happened to see 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.390
 who does not have to listen about 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 the beauties of the island where 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.520
 wander in the first part with the words more 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.650
 lucky awesome juicy pictures 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.990
 bright colors of the jungle striking beauty 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.270
 water spectacular shootout and 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.610
 unbelievable my enemies it was all on 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.070
 languages ​​of all fans of shooters year of release 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 headlights edge well for many the game was 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.060
 perfect to exactly one moment in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.310
 the moment of appearance of incomprehensible monsters 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.270
 changing and and frustration also not 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.550
 bypassed 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 incomprehensible kind of baboons at one time 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.290
 completely repelled the desire to continue playing 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.570
 the game lost its wax in a matter of 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.060
 minutes in the hope that it will be better further 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.920
 I continued to play or was waiting for me wild 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.150
 disappointment all that awaited me and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.880
 many other players 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.420
 armored freaks mutants who on 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.270
 shoulder 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.950
 guns flew either huge bazookas 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.500
 and maybe both 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.810
 with their appearance and I am the headlights edge 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.030
 broke off finally and big drops 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.830
 never touched and in general they forgot 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.560
 and if she remembered something with longing and 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.110
 the disappointment of the second part is not 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.119
 waited and did not even watch him therefore 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.030
 after the release of the game for my part was not 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.770
 absolutely no gestures but 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.020
 years have passed and the headlights already have to think 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.119
 forgot and here on you the news that came out 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.890
 third part in curiosity and excitement with 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.350
 the parties of the players who called him 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.229
 made me go read reviews a 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.299
 then and watch the trailer and frankly 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.820
 say such a surprise mixed with 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.799
 admiration and hope and my face long ago 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.740
 already unconditionally not seen as 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.840
 most play me crazy 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.170
 impressed and cost her only to go out i didn't 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.729
 began to pull in order to test it 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.619
 rapture catch express it was 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.560
 amazingly incredibly bright outfit 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.359
 Emotion food fountain and squeak on which I 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.990
 only it has been able to in the first ten 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.880
 minutes of play 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.190
 all this I still remember with 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.980
 by some special feeling almost 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.760
 no one expected this and me 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.940
 including 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.100
 and so what is actually the case and the case in 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.230
 a simple company of friends 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.970
 customers in which there were three brothers 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.160
 acrobat goes on vacation 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.530
 meaning that called for bombanut 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.900
 complete paradise islands have taken with 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.500
 open arms in the same way 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.390
 as well as local beaches, clubs and their parties 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.250
 however, it was not then decided to please 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.320
 yourself skydiving our gallant 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.540
 the company eventually lands in not very 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.240
 a good place right on the island where 1 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.760
 the apartment was set up by local pirates to them then 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.130
 our friends are caught but you are so 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.900
 already you know but anyway 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.670
 was but one of these guys in our 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.590
 protagonist jason eyebrows 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.050
 manages to escape from the captivity of the local 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.170
 vaasa leader not without the help of his brother 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.780
 of course and then miraculously surviving to get to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.850
 local aborigines, they also saw 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.620
 salvation jason sign committing decides 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.600
 take him to yourself make a warrior and 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.060
 together with him defeat you and his people 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.670
 thereby beating the island back to your 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.500
 possession in the first thoughts were that 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.090
 developers creating the first two games 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.120
 recorded everything that caused discontent 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.940
 into the players to enter the games and get rid of 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.980
 this in the third part taking real 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.750
 life and human problems 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.460
 also human relations growth 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.010
 personality difficulty of choice and acceptance 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.110
 decisions and putting it all on the altar 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.030
 pretty simple plot of what exactly 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.920
 due to its simplicity in understanding and 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.210
 appears before us so alive 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.440
 hereby the developers hit the mark 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.570
 perhaps the game is practically 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.940
 ideal for your own ideas for your 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.160
 foundations and supply whether it was possible to make 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.990
 Better if you do not find fault with the little things 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.850
 game mechanics perhaps try 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.190
 do better could be fatal and 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.110
 only you spoiled the ideal not 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.780
 exists and must always be remembered 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.280
 this when evaluating games talking about gameplay 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.560
 It is worth saying that the developers are here 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.930
 tried their best by combining different 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.270
 approaches taking better from 1 2 parts 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.299
 putting vigorous and plot in scenery 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.270
 open world we move through the plot and 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.250
 between miss 7 if they are not related and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.840
 with a limited amount of time 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.699
 we can't go study 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.770
 island when she is an outpost for a couple 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.840
 kilometers totally object isn't it 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.539
 we can devote ourselves to learning 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.090
 the beauties of the island and cutting out the appropriate 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.430
 bandyuganov hair more 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.650
 island research is a useful thing so 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.599
 as it should on its way and warrior 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.139
 in rio named word skills tree 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.759
 paws 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.190
 each of which means ours 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.990
 raising the rank of war we can not 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.930
 only get experience and pump well 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.009
 and ease your life on the island 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.050
 to help her help us various 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.639
 upgrades weapon covers more 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.099
 spacious backpacks wallets and 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.500
 medical bags of medicine and so on 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.509
 to get it all to us like 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.370
 This warrior and hunters need 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.409
 to hunt for the skins of animals and 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.909
 in the evenings around the fire to sew new ones 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.729
 backpacks and bags 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:16.550
 cough and and other stuff other and this 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.319
 I must say very useful thing so 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.000
 for example, if you don’t do this and don’t 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.830
 sew a pair of weapon covers 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.780
 Jason can never wear himself 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.099
 more than one weapon and it should be 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.460
 admit to such a game too 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.319
 hardcore everything else travel 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.479
 through the jungle will give us the opportunity to score 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.610
 herbs from which we can later 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.840
 cook yourself healing potions that 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.789
 also greatly affected 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.310
 our local life 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.349
 island visiting the same local towers we 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.169
 open treasure map 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:47.599
 as well as important places of herbs and other things that 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.759
 anybody knocks us and comes in handy 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.590
 for opening higher to gun stores in 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.449
 the result becomes free for us than 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.789
 more rigs openly more weapons 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.110
 we can take for free 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.880
 frankly money while playing i 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.620
 almost did not spend anything 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.469
 only if on ammunition before 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.360
 some important mission on the atmosphere 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.219
 also plays the fact that the island lives its 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.069
 life predators prey on herbivores 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:11.930
 will hunt both those and others 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.090
 others are wrapped around or from wild beasts 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.620
 or from the local aborigines and all this 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.599
 happens in parallel with our 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.880
 my wanderings in the bushes in search of the right 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:22.370
 grass stuck in the affairs of others or not 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.409
 it all depends on you however confess 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.889
 sometimes wandering around the island in search of 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.169
 need to 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.879
 their animal skins may bore a little 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.620
 not very much like these 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.960
 adventures of jason and talk you 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.460
 plainly low and if it's all in Skyrim 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.080
 perceived as something normal in 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.139
 order of things here it is really 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.969
 at some point may podnadoest but 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.889
 here everyone can decide how much they 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:45.229
 take time to ferment like that 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.689
 because nothing prevents to take a couple 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.340
 side quests that are there let 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:51.740
 and rather monotonous release 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.389
 outpost kill some beast deliver 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.909
 medication on point for a certain time 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.800
 and the like and if you get tired and it 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:00.139
 you can always go back to the main plot 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.870
 A branch that pleases almost every 2 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.819
 mission or characters or wards 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.229
 protagonist from native plants 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.569
 which periodically have to 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.770
 watch 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:11.629
 I would also like a kind word 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.340
 note the elaboration of characters 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.650
 all the main characters here are pretty 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.740
 charismatic unlike ordinary 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.210
 thugs who are generally all on one person 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.039
 Interesting are worthy of their attention in 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.319
 each of them has its own background 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.629
 which you can always read in the magazine 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.789
 humor is also not the latest 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:30.409
 component of this game let him and 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:32.900
 peeps more in descriptions 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:34.879
 characters of animals and other things and other things 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.069
 what to say about the voice acting here she 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:38.839

 Russian guys just bowing legs 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:53.090

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.560
 best games released last year with 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:58.810

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.810
