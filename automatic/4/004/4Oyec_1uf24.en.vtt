 [music] 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.610
 Good morning, I am Lyudmila old-timer 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.200
 Today we will do with you unusual 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.330
 flower for this we need quite 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.330
 a little time and very simple 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.029
 tools and materials 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:21.119
 take a knitting needle visual ordinary piece 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.539
 wire and scotch come and fix 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.130
 our wire on the needle for those who know how 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.790
 knit it does not make any 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.000
 labor well, what's the basis of knitting 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.000
 [music] 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.239
 and the principle of knitting 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.150
 recruit 24 loops 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.460
 but recruited loosely from small 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.440
 gaps so that then when we 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.870
 filmed we had a curve such an edge then 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.330
 there you see I do not collect loops close 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.610
 each other then move instead 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.690
 left 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.690
 then i'm just moving 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.710
 I need a quantity 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.710
 here's the telly now I'm strings right here 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 tying up 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.350
 we cut off the thread 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.550
 now we remove the scotch and handle together 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.550
 we take our loops off the knitting needles 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.580
 right 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.380
 back words should be inside 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.690
 now here 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.570
 need to do so assemble our 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.660
 miniature flower to the pigtail which 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.350
 there was a smooth edge outside 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:08.800
 flower petal 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.800
 Christmas trees like this 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.159
 let it go 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.829
 6-apb streets we wind the thread to be 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:21.010
 green stalk 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:24.280
 for our brooch we need 6 of these 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.220
 blanks principle of making leaf 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.409
 here is the same as petals only than 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.010
 the difference we used for the flower 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.629
 round needle and here we use 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.390
 two centimeters can be any 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:43.200
 ticker use suitable 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.489
 the size will be different just fasten 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.230
 some put it a small set 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.400
 loops 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.230
 as well as sleeping only as early as 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.230
 sleep use our stocking 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.050
 that is enough 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:08.680
 up 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:08.680
 design no cup code which we knit 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.010
 remove layer 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.150
 and together with the hook loops remove with 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.340
 our stock so that 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.239
 shelves turned 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.239
 in the middle 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.250
 do not rush gently 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.550
 now forms 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.470
 leaf to smooth edge was on 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.940
 rose leaf 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:47.670
 rounded loops seemed inside 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.040
 I fold the wire into blanks 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.420
 we add 6 and ready stamens can and 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.880
 itself produce and can be for 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.460
 artificially 100 to purchase such and they 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.950
 we must enter just between ours 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.580
 flowers in a flower blossoms in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:10.100
 whose stamens are out 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.100
 now we fasten stamens with threads 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.150
 we get for such unusual flowers 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.590
 You can think up the name yourself. 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.590
 dating and success 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.610
