00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
quite detailed more so than just about

where<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.080> still<00:01:10.350> look<00:01:10.590> good<00:01:10.830> even<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
where they still look good even to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.149 
where they still look good even to
modernize<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.840> 3d<00:01:13.200> models<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.650> levels<00:01:13.979> here

modernize the 3d models and levels here

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.890 
modernize the 3d models and levels here
look<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.490> good<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.850> any<00:01:15.030> scene<00:01:15.360> today

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
look as good as any scene today

look as good as any scene today
sure<00:01:16.409> modern<00:01:16.950> graphics<00:01:17.400> may<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.610> sharper<00:01:18.150> with

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
sure modern graphics may be sharper with

sure modern graphics may be sharper with
slightly<00:01:18.659> better<00:01:18.840> textures<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:19.920> will

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
slightly better textures but they will

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.940 
slightly better textures but they will
still<00:01:20.310> look<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.820> much<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.060> this

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
still look pretty much like this

still look pretty much like this
gameplay<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.479> first-person

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
shooter as one would expect but there is
more<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.840> than<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.110> shoot<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.950> times

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
more to do than just shoot and at times

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.499 
more to do than just shoot and at times
there<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.460> other<00:01:29.700> ways<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.150> dispatching

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
enemies than just shooting them you get

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
enemies than just shooting them you get
a<00:01:32.579> knife<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.329> perform<00:01:33.630> stealth<00:01:34.079> back

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
