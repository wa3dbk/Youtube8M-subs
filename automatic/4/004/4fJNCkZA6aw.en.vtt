00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.450
 gambling presents 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.230
 how many years ago did everyone do big 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.480
 m. m. 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.880
 and now everyone is doing session 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.520
 multiplayer games like lowdown 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.190
 artplay and thieves come on kings still 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.010
 climb the light and they are in their own good but 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.140
 who play all this online games 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.890
 need strong community not from 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.100
 communities 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.860
 no games such games are bound to be something 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.680
 what collects and binds the public some 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.640
 powerful gameplay idea content and 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.890
 the dialogues 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.680
 something that said plain text 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.680
 would the rest of the games not need ours better 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 price 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.340
 to take a titanfall she's fine with a point 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 view design basics carefully 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.200
 thoughtful thriller where everything is extreme 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 neat and harmonious but it is almost not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.729
 leaves reason to return plot 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.680
 the campaign is rudimentary and very fast 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.259
 yourself and erased by you interesting discoveries 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.780
 little community shrank to quite 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.789
 sad sizes there is an opinion that after 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.899
 have a good start, many have returned to 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.000
 multiplayer hello 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.820
 and call of duty or gone over to 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.729
 destiny but considering extremely successful 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.830
 mechanics with furs are very similar to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.140
 priming before something is incommensurable 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.140
 more for example before tytanfall 2 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.550
 further comes the flow of dota's heirs 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.720
 which this year has abated somewhat 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.730
 not gone anywhere 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.970
 really needed among these games 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.100
 It turned out only with the may creators tramps 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.680
 ascent peace be upon him rigged 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.640
 classic rules moba games under the action 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.340
 third person 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.250
 It turned out brightly and does not look like anything 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.890
 because it was not clear demand 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.320
 how's it going to go on market close 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.260
 play several similar games at once 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.110
 Difficult but for now smite in popularity 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.110
 stably supports dota2 or gaflat 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.020
 other similar games are still 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.660
 overcomes the crisis of self-determination and their 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.610
 fate is not understood down gate let's say not 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.680
 managed and already decided to close 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.580
 February 2015 have vainglory for ah uoz 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.040
 similar trouble 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.930
 she looks amazing she's perfect 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.360
 optimized and in general for all 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.730
 featured this is a model game only here 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.050
 it's not clear why to play it on 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.600
 tablets and phones 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.120
 despite the relatively small card 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.730
 vainglory slow and heavy 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.740
 match out and drag on up to half an hour and 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.959
 more so don't even hope that 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.440
 get a quick lunch 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.050
 break 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.570
 it is fixable but for now things like 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.930
 solstice and rain fit in mobile 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.150
 vainglory format is not among portable 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.910
 sociologist also note world of tanks 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.350
 blitz but you can't tell a lot about them 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.090
 mobile phone tanks 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.090
 very good and. 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.930
 and the main session game in 2014 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.760
 unequivocally hartstone we doubted 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.430
 it at the beginning of the year when the blizzard 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.069
 has not yet established a stream of updates and meta 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.590
 the game stagnated everyone played the same 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.169
 same decks with the same cards 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.329
 but a great update came first 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.030
 Scrum himself sleep just recently 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.729
 a huge set of cards goblins and dwarves and 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.550
 play and watch the games again became 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.259
 interesting this observational moment 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.440
 by the way no less important 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.330
 hearthstone proved to be good 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.340
 eSports discipline and 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.949
 an entertaining spectacle of the viewers account over 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.110
 you steadily go steadily on tens of thousands 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.720
 on the next well- known idea 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.990
 blizzard again built not that huge 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.780
 and prosperous hearthstone has all that 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.139
 need community content serious 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:56.150
 pro-scene this game is uniquely serious and 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:05:00.289
 long session online game of the year 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.289
 hearthstone heroes of warcraft
