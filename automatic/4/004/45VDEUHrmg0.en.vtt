00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:04.729
 vv gt3 protects 3 was a great challenge 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.919
 we do not know exactly how you want to stay 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:10.719
 south great people 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.129
 We worked this project 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.669
 very 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.669
 very large band studio work as of all production 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.710
 Hey, may it be 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.800
 it was very gratifying 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.359
 was one of those 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 hard work 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.239
 menezes one day and you saw everything with a puzzle 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.410
 but when it all came together 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.230
 I left it almost a thematic work 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.060
 speaks of the various types of fighting figueirense that we all face 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.980
 day to day 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
 the inner pathways to the outer pathways 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.060
 we want 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.420
 the transvestite of the music of poetry and sung composition 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.670
 express 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.160
 the way we would stay 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.140
 it is us 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.770
 we deal with losses 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.450
 I did everything and we tried. 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.660
 bringing the stage 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.470
 placing lights 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.120
 placing south 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.520
 scenography to this scenario of war 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.010
 but also have a word 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.760
 something that I can really change my style I can change people's hearts 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.120
 was this project is called current and films 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.540
 something that was born in our heart 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.530
 not a conversation 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.970
 in which friends 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.200
 is today 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.660
 we can see all this result all this work 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.480
 but the result that has a truth 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.440
 we intend to show in an artistic way 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.120
 that's true 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.980
 that we know we live 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.980
 and it was then 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.470
 we gave 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 a cool little round for several places 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.010
 several 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.820
 points that we found interesting to 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.480
 such dvd format 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.819
 ef 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.459
 When did you arrive at the plant? 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.829
 its realization later 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.049
 We always today 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.869
 we reached the conclusion 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.859
 to the location 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.859
 This was very remarkable for us 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.699
 could perfectly 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.219
 chemical proof 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.679
 When you arrived at the plant 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.500
 the proposal is this 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.639
 on here 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.639
 he felt involved by the digitimes 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.499
 here not simply see the probable ones 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.559
 the non-European leader surveyed 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.069
 around him he was part of that 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.279
 everything was the postwar scenario 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.279
 I think it's sugarcane marked nothing. 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.859
 other 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.679
 approach that we can also 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:09.449
 is the concept of profit of this vader 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.879
 experienced fall in field 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.689
 the meaning of messages 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.689
 in fact it was the message sung songs that people 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.549
 I was talking about various types of land 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.529
 for example 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.859
 after the war that is the main message title of the other 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.959
 Candy had to lose 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.399
 it was 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.399
 is a song that really speaks of the war between the brothers 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.509
 there are also other 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.079
 another kind of war as 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.599
 previous tucker that spiritual thing 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.449
 How do you say we have to continue 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.049
 and there you go I think 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.510
 goes from each and from the message to him is feeling the way that it has 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.969
 you feel the way you are working on that person's life. 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.069
 somehow 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.219
 I think this concept of the show 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.319
 provided an understanding 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.429
 the public 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:02.630
 of messages 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.489
 I think it went over a bit 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.510
 only AIDS 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.019
 of word 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:07.950
 I Think 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.950
 the study that will make a leap 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.759
 one of the things I liked the most 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.439
 in this project called after the war 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:22.330
 this is because it deals exactly with our greatest weakness the weakness of our people 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:27.340
 we deliver to the whole world saying that we are one face of our body 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.460
 in fact we are not 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.580
 I think we portrayed this. 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.580
 It's us, I'm not with the daughter, in order for her to be assured. 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.530
 wound that wanted to bleed detached if you really 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.669
 infection why if we are the people 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.069
 in which we should be a little more united world why do not we 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.999
 we produce fruits of it 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.370
 so I believe that 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.749
 this solution after the war, what we 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:57.650
 they deliver themselves through studies and projects 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.010
 is that we really need to open our eyes to see that many 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.630
 times the rights to the photo book and what we need to wake up early 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.280
 accounts 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.009
 We have to set an example.
