this<00:00:29.519> case<00:00:29.760> had<00:00:29.970> some<00:00:30.179> pretty<00:00:30.420> big<00:00:30.720> issues

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
this case had some pretty big issues

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
this case had some pretty big issues
even<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:33.059> prefers<00:00:33.510> putting<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
even when I was just prefers putting it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.910 
even when I was just prefers putting it
on<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.880> normally<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.510> take<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.649> similar

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
on so normally you take this is similar

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
on so normally you take this is similar
to<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.309> folio<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:39.390> use<00:00:39.540> right<00:00:39.750> guys

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to a folio that you would use right guys

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.889 
to a folio that you would use right guys
so<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> go<00:00:40.950> ahead<00:00:41.160> put<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.940> flip

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
so you go ahead put it on and you flip

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.010 
so you go ahead put it on and you flip
from<00:00:43.110> left<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:44.539> well<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.719> turn<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
from left to right well when you turn it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.299 
from left to right well when you turn it
around<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> cut<00:00:49.289> out<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> speakers<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
around the cut out for the speakers and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.520 
around the cut out for the speakers and
the<00:00:50.370> camera<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> reversed<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.170> say<00:00:52.500> okay

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the camera is reversed so I say okay

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.260 
the camera is reversed so I say okay
well<00:00:53.039> flip<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.120> around<00:00:55.489> but<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:56.879> cases

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
well flip it around but what other cases

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.429 
well flip it around but what other cases
like<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:59.660> what<00:01:00.660> other<00:01:00.809> case<00:01:01.199> flips<00:01:03.439> from

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
like that what other case flips from

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.429 
like that what other case flips from
right<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.799> left<00:01:05.420> pretty<00:01:06.420> weird<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.409> sure

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
right to left pretty weird now I'm sure

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.320 
right to left pretty weird now I'm sure
poet<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.220> claim<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.580> that's<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> way

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
poet can claim that that's just the way

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.170 
poet can claim that that's just the way
that<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.630> built<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.850> hopefully<00:01:11.850> this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that they built it but hopefully this

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.530 
that they built it but hopefully this
case<00:01:12.479> has<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> second<00:01:13.560> revision<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:15.150> fixes

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
case has a second revision that fixes

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.230 
case has a second revision that fixes
that<00:01:15.689> issue<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.820> use<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.119> like

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
that issue so now if we just use it like

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.830 
that issue so now if we just use it like
that<00:01:18.450> well<00:01:19.320> that's<00:01:19.530> pretty<00:01:19.680> weird<00:01:20.479> but<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that well that's pretty weird but the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
that well that's pretty weird but the
folio<00:01:22.500> does<00:01:22.860> work<00:01:23.189> find<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:25.290> top<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> case

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
folio does work find the top of the case

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
folio does work find the top of the case
is<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> very<00:01:26.909> soft<00:01:27.240> kind<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.229> wish<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.619> feel

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
is a very soft kind of wish you feel

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
is a very soft kind of wish you feel
that<00:01:29.100> could<00:01:29.250> probably<00:01:29.520> add<00:01:30.090> some<00:01:30.479> protection

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that could probably add some protection

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.859 
that could probably add some protection
and<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> top<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.689> some

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and on the top right here we see some

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.730 
and on the top right here we see some
poetic<00:01:34.110> branding<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.750> also<00:01:36.750> noticed<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.350> just

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
poetic branding I also noticed that just

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100 
poetic branding I also noticed that just
when<00:01:37.860> holding<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> putting<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
when holding and putting this into a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.469 
when holding and putting this into a
folio<00:01:40.590> position<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.000> piece<00:01:42.329> right

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
folio position that this piece right

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.230 
folio position that this piece right
here<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.869> awfully<00:01:43.409> long<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.210> if

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
here is awfully long now I don't know if

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.969 
here is awfully long now I don't know if
that's<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> way<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.049> did<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that's just the way they did it but it

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
that's just the way they did it but it
seems<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.430> there's<00:01:47.640> some<00:01:47.820> extra<00:01:48.149> piece<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
seems like there's some extra piece that

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.749 
seems like there's some extra piece that
doesn't<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.250> need<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:52.759> after

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
doesn't really need to be there after

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
doesn't really need to be there after
using<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.450> case<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> lot<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.200> pulling<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> in

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
using this case a lot and pulling it in

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.310 
using this case a lot and pulling it in
and<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.310> pocket<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.780> hard<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and out of my pocket it's really hard to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.920 
and out of my pocket it's really hard to
get<00:01:58.530> used<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.240> flipping<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.360> from<00:02:00.630> left<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
get used to flipping this from left to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.469 
get used to flipping this from left to
right<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.520> again<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:03.030> think<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
right and again I really think that this

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.139 
right and again I really think that this
is<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.689> big<00:02:04.020> issue<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.670> something<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.060> I'm

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
is a big issue and something that I'm

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.760 
is a big issue and something that I'm
not<00:02:06.180> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> get<00:02:06.780> used<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.530> piece

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
not going to get used to this piece

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.680 
not going to get used to this piece
right<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.009> also<00:02:08.310> does<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.509> way

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
right here also does get in in the way

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
right here also does get in in the way
when<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.020> using<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:11.340> hand

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
when I using this with one hand

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
when I using this with one hand
using<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.480> your<00:02:12.629> right<00:02:12.810> hand<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.200> actually

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
using with your right hand it actually

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.759 
using with your right hand it actually
kind<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.010> gives<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.060> good<00:02:15.420> grip<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:16.470> when

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
kind of gives you a good grip but when

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.470 
kind of gives you a good grip but when
using<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.400> with<00:02:17.640> your<00:02:17.760> left<00:02:17.910> hand<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
using this with your left hand it is

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.110 
using this with your left hand it is
quite<00:02:18.780> annoying<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:20.129> top<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.550> case<00:02:20.760> looks

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
quite annoying the top of the case looks

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.720 
quite annoying the top of the case looks
quite<00:02:21.450> awkward<00:02:21.800> when<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.459> closed

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
quite awkward when this is in a closed

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.490 
quite awkward when this is in a closed
position<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.200> piece

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
position as you can see that this piece

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.580 
position as you can see that this piece
goes<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.099> way<00:02:26.400> over<00:02:26.760> here<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.349> this<00:02:28.349> side

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
goes all the way over here and this side

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550 
goes all the way over here and this side
is<00:02:28.670> somewhat<00:02:29.670> exposed<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:30.690> really<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.349> it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
is somewhat exposed not really but it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.400 
is somewhat exposed not really but it
looks<00:02:31.799> really<00:02:32.099> weird<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.660> viewing<00:02:33.930> angle

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
looks really weird the viewing angle

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.500 
looks really weird the viewing angle
luckily<00:02:35.250> there<00:02:35.489> isn't<00:02:35.790> anything<00:02:36.000> wrong<00:02:36.299> with

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
luckily there isn't anything wrong with

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.479 
luckily there isn't anything wrong with
that<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.379> overall<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.920> seems<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that but overall it seems like that

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.009 
that but overall it seems like that
there<00:02:38.610> has<00:02:38.700> been<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.879> lot<00:02:39.209> wrong<00:02:39.599> with<00:02:39.870> this

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
there has been a lot wrong with this

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.530 
there has been a lot wrong with this
case<00:02:40.549> something<00:02:41.549> awkward<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.060> did<00:02:42.330> notice

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
case something awkward that I did notice

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.449 
case something awkward that I did notice
is<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> image<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.830> amazon<00:02:44.250> web

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
is that in the image on the amazon web

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.100 
is that in the image on the amazon web
page<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.480> does<00:02:45.750> show<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.079> case<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:48.110> angle

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
page it does show the case in a angle

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.360 
page it does show the case in a angle
like<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:50.540> which<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.810> built<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.290> be<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:53.250> it

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
like this which it is built to be but it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.089 
like this which it is built to be but it
is<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:54.120> course<00:02:54.390> really<00:02:54.690> awkward<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.920> just

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
is of course really awkward and I just

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.460 
is of course really awkward and I just
don't<00:02:56.310> get<00:02:56.430> why<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.700> was<00:02:56.819> made<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.180> this

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
don't get why it was made like this

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.449 
don't get why it was made like this
overall<00:02:58.470> if<00:02:58.680> you're<00:02:58.799> just<00:02:58.920> looking<00:02:59.040> for

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
overall if you're just looking for

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.920 
overall if you're just looking for
something<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.030> hold<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.720> off<00:03:00.900> until

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
something to hold you off until

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.110 
something to hold you off until
something<00:03:01.680> better<00:03:01.799> comes<00:03:02.069> out<00:03:02.310> then<00:03:02.940> this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
something better comes out then this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.869 
something better comes out then this
case<00:03:03.360> probably<00:03:03.629> is<00:03:03.989> for<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:05.280> folio<00:03:05.579> works

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
case probably is for you the folio works

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.619 
case probably is for you the folio works
fine<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.390> everything<00:03:07.200> else<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.650> pretty<00:03:07.950> mad

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
fine and everything else is pretty mad

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.819 
fine and everything else is pretty mad
there<00:03:09.629> isn't<00:03:09.870> really<00:03:09.930> anything<00:03:10.230> great<00:03:10.620> about

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
there isn't really anything great about

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.860 
there isn't really anything great about
this<00:03:11.010> case<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.579> that's<00:03:12.120> why<00:03:12.299> I'm<00:03:12.360> giving<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
this case and that's why I'm giving it a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.710 
this case and that's why I'm giving it a
two-star<00:03:13.260> review<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.760> case<00:03:14.970> itself<00:03:15.329> seems

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
two-star review the case itself seems

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.960 
two-star review the case itself seems
flip-flopped<00:03:16.380> like<00:03:17.190> there<00:03:17.370> really<00:03:17.549> isn't

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
flip-flopped like there really isn't

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.940 
flip-flopped like there really isn't
anything<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.139> do<00:03:19.380> other<00:03:19.590> than<00:03:19.709> the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
anything that this can do other than the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.240 
anything that this can do other than the
folio<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:21.060> again<00:03:21.269> for<00:03:21.900> 895<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:22.980> good

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
folio but again for 895 that is a good

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.550 
folio but again for 895 that is a good
