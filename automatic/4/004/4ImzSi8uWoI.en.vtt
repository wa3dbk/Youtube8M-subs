00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 All right, I came back with another video today. 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.390
 I'm going to review a product for 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.340
 skin preparation I'll tell you 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.630
 whenever I really like 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.660
 I'll talk to you about it today. 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.150
 the basis of revlon that this here the rule 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.920
 did not paste stay so is the rule in 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 Colo stay my color to a kiss her 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.660
 as the other bases have 30 ml 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.670
 it also has a protection factor of 6 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.590
 which is low but I do not care because 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 just pass a sunscreen 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.630
 my version this base that has several 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.780
 versions for normal skin have to 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.239
 dry skin and has oily mixed skin 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.730
 my version for oily mixed skin that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 she is more adamant that she helps herself 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.450
 hold the oil a little longer already 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.059
 I used this base a lot this is my 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.219
 second glass is and always bought the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.309
 boutique rigidity because the price is very 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.670
 is an average of $ 9 each. 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.500
 base there and here in Brazil I think 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.390
 it costs an average of 70 reais in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.489
 some stores and feel it is possible 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 find it too I think it's a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.150
 excellent this base has an excellent 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.820
 cost benefit because it has a 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.070
 incredible quality and the price is cool 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.110
 Do you know but before you say a little more? 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.080
 about her I'll apply on my skin 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.119
 so you can see the difference is there 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 I talk a little more with you 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.409
 So my skin is here, I'm 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.490
 no base stations in corrective or 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.110
 anything 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.110
 I have many marches 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.479
 then I'll apply and then I'll come back 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.270
 talk to you a little something 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 what size is it does not have is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.180
 valve field then it is like the base 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.530
 the fixed studio of the brand that comes this way 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.320
 open 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.000
 this is a negative point but it is so in the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.700
 In the end I do not care 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.950
 have this basis even though it does not have the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.479
 The bank knows I think even 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.479
 reward and topical water 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.410
 so I finished applying base I passed 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:45.440
 a lipstick and I did not pass then nor collective 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:47.569
 and my skin stayed like this I really like it 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.420
 Because she has it, she 's very 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.580
 Tough you know I never stayed the 24 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.130
 hours talking that on the packaging 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.700
 but it is a base that is very resistant to 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.769
 heat is resistant to oily skin know 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.290
 I really like her so it 's 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.660
 excellent attachment it does not come out with 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.180
 that's the way we wash the face 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.720
 only with soap that is not a soap and yes 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.610
 is probably the skin that goes 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.420
 continue on base then you know if I 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.190
 pass 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.780
 You know that yellow shampoo from johnson? 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.739
 I always say I like to wash the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.530
 face with him 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.989
 so this base did not just go out with that 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.850
 shampoo or she comes out with makeup remover 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.400
 the people passing from a client to her 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.810
 out or that soap makeup remover 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.850
 of that said berenice 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.549
 so it would be a very strong base 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.410
 even so I really like her with 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.600
 passing the hours I feel that my 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.860
 skin continues makeup table does not come out 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.320
 easily 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.200
 this is a very positive point for me is 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.209
 she has and if it were to compare the 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.579
 law is much like the studio 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.220
 kids make up the main difference to 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.260
 me value is the same price is the story 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.720
 It's a lot more expensive than her but I 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.530
 I think the product quality is the 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.299
 same 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.150
 if you were to choose between this 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.400
 This would be a difficult question. 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.560
 I really like her, she's very much into it too. 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.739
 resistant and it is much cheaper 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.269
 know is a base of high coverage is well 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.100
 thick dense 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.900
 I do not know if you noticed but when I 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.750
 I put her on the mother's grace she did not 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.729
 even though it is a liquid base. 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.220
 she does not choose easily is well 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.020
 thick to use if on a daily basis I like 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.120
 to use her I like to spend a 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.330
 very thin layer because I think she 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.580
 owes well to the skin 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.650
 looks very masked knows 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.229
 do not look that much 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.680
 base so I like to spend her as 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.840
 hands or using 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.580
 Sponge belize also that I think it is 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.229
 a more natural finish 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.210
 When I step is the brush when I 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.340
 I show you she gets heavier. 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.400
 because I think it concentrates more product 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.740
 so it looks more appealing if 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.199
 a basic aspect, I think I should 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.879
 and excellent because the skin gets 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.919
 really beautiful gets lots of 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.990
 cover so it covers all 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.509
 imperfections without cover very nice 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.159
 even then I think that's when you know with 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.830
 the event party I think it pays 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.050
 walkway with intensity between the skin 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.669
 and the mayor's hair, but on a daily basis 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.469
 I really prefer to spend with the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.719
 fingers or with the wife to stay 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:18.090
 natural and the best that it lasts a lot in 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:20.639
 skin even she holds the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.590
 curiosity but she just like any 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.210
 another foundation it does not work miracles then 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.969
 with the passing of the oil 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.039
 appears yes or white with the four 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.569
 lines appear 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.219
 so it's not a factor that 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.560
 bother because most of the databases 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.509
 It happens that way that I look the same 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.979
 is the value and quality of the product 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.120
 For me it's a product that is super 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.550
 approved 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.620
 I really love to use even Indian 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.659
 very technical and lives in a warm place 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.270
 for a hot day for those who like a 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:51.120
 skin well covered for those who like a 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.710
 base that has good fixing know and also 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.259
 for those who have oily skin 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.240
 so this is it - quick review today 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.979
 I wanted to talk a little bit more about this 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.919
 base I think there are many girls who 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.330
 already know her so I had not yet 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.190
 talked about it here in the channel that 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.509
 was without the way had finished 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.669
 So how do I buy another one now? 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.930
 I really wanted to tell you so. 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.400
 for those who have the opportunity to 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.000
 buy because I think it's really worth 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.500
 feather 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.289
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.330
 review and indication of the product if 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.000
 Do you already use this base you like or do you 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.590
