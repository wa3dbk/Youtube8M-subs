they're<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.770> to<00:03:05.860> be<00:03:06.540> modifying<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:09.400> way

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
they're going to be modifying the way

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.240 
they're going to be modifying the way
that<00:03:09.790> runes<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:11.020> a<00:03:11.050> chance<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.620> do<00:03:11.830> things

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
that runes have a chance to do things

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.920 
that runes have a chance to do things
right<00:03:12.550> so<00:03:13.560> what<00:03:14.560> they<00:03:14.680> said<00:03:14.920> is<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:16.510> example

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
right so what they said is for example

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.070 
right so what they said is for example
the<00:03:17.680> current<00:03:18.040> six-room<00:03:18.460> bonus<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:19.240> root<00:03:19.960> of

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
nightmare provides five percent chance

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.570 
nightmare provides five percent chance

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
to cause fear when hit the five percent

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.650 
to cause fear when hit the five percent
chance<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:25.000> hard<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.360> rely<00:03:25.600> on<00:03:25.630> in<00:03:25.870> pvp<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:27.660> WVW

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
chance is hard to rely on in pvp and WVW

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.110 
chance is hard to rely on in pvp and WVW
which<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.930> world<00:03:29.170> vs<00:03:29.530> world<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.520> they<00:03:30.700> felt<00:03:30.970> it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
which is world vs world so they felt it

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.420 
which is world vs world so they felt it
needed<00:03:31.330> updating<00:03:32.050> their<00:03:32.890> drastically

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430
