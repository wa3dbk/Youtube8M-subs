00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.080 
way by actually if you look at these
that<00:02:19.630> will<00:02:19.750> actually<00:02:19.870> fit<00:02:20.260> inside<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.890> here

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.430 

so<00:02:25.090> either<00:02:25.360> way<00:02:25.510> around<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.170> will<00:02:26.260> sit

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
so either way around it it will sit

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.930 
so either way around it it will sit
inside<00:02:26.710> so<00:02:26.950> if<00:02:27.100> we<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.340> go<00:02:27.460> ahead<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.760> place

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
inside so if we just go ahead and place

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.310 
inside so if we just go ahead and place
the<00:02:28.180> top<00:02:29.080> cap<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.420> then<00:02:31.930> place<00:02:32.140> this

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
the top cap on and then place this

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.730 
the top cap on and then place this
inside<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:34.900> if<00:02:34.960> it<00:02:35.110> nicely<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.560> sits

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
inside and see if it nicely just sits

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.600 
inside and see if it nicely just sits
inside<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:39.660> there<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:40.810> go<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.610> then

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
inside like that there we go and then

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.370 
inside like that there we go and then
all<00:02:42.760> its<00:02:42.970> case<00:02:43.209> are<00:02:43.360> doing<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.870> placing<00:02:44.140> our

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
all its case are doing is placing our

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.370 
all its case are doing is placing our
top<00:02:44.560> mount<00:02:44.770> Bush<00:02:44.920> on<00:02:45.070> top<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:46.050> just<00:02:47.050> altered

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
top mount Bush on top and just altered

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.850 
top mount Bush on top and just altered
that<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.340> your<00:02:48.520> entire<00:02:48.820> struct<00:02:49.650> ready<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.740> get

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
that is your entire struct ready to get

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.730 
that is your entire struct ready to get
straight<00:02:51.040> into<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.280> car<00:02:52.080> now<00:02:53.080> over<00:02:53.470> here<00:02:53.590> I've
