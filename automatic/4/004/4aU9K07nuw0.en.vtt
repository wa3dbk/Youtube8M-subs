that's what the growth rings show is

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.080 
that's what the growth rings show is
that<00:04:55.530> something<00:04:56.040> has<00:04:56.190> happened<00:04:56.580> different<00:04:56.970> in

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
that something has happened different in

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.150 
that something has happened different in
that<00:04:57.120> horse's<00:04:57.660> life<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.650> you<00:04:58.710> don't<00:04:58.950> want

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
that horse's life so you don't want

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.920 
that horse's life so you don't want
evenly<00:04:59.670> spaced<00:04:59.970> out<00:05:00.150> lines<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.660> also

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
evenly spaced out lines and you also

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.610 
evenly spaced out lines and you also
don't<00:05:01.140> want<00:05:01.380> them<00:05:02.090> very<00:05:03.090> pronounced<00:05:03.990> because

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
don't want them very pronounced because

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.680 
don't want them very pronounced because
then<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.130> get<00:05:05.340> into<00:05:05.460> fever<00:05:06.150> rings<00:05:06.420> and

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
then you get into fever rings and

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.510 
then you get into fever rings and
founder<00:05:07.110> rings<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.800> think<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.130> lot<00:05:08.490> of

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
founder rings and I think a lot of

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.600 
founder rings and I think a lot of
artists<00:05:08.940> do<00:05:09.030> horizontal<00:05:09.540> ones<00:05:10.010> just<00:05:11.010> they

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
artists do horizontal ones just they

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.030 
artists do horizontal ones just they
make<00:05:11.790> them<00:05:11.970> too<00:05:12.530> pronounced<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.650> they<00:05:13.740> stand

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
make them too pronounced and they stand

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.100 
make them too pronounced and they stand
out<00:05:14.190> too<00:05:14.400> much<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.790> it<00:05:15.000> doesn't<00:05:15.360> really<00:05:15.810> look

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
out too much and it doesn't really look

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.250
