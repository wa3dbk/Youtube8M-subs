00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
pretty straightforward and that's kind

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.160 
pretty straightforward and that's kind
of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> reason<00:00:57.420> why<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.930> didn't<00:00:58.109> take

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
too much time to break it down the first

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.459 
too much time to break it down the first
time<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.300> there's<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.020> nothing<00:01:01.140> hidden

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
time because there's one nothing hidden

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.229 
time because there's one nothing hidden
there's<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.770> couple<00:01:01.949> things<00:01:02.370> hidden<00:01:02.640> which<00:01:03.149> I

just<00:01:35.549> isn't<00:01:36.150> fun<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:38.009> very<00:01:38.159> far<00:01:38.430> right

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
just isn't fun so the very far right

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
just isn't fun so the very far right
character<00:01:39.000> looks<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.420> Dempsey<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.869> he<00:01:40.259> is

much<00:01:40.590> younger<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.490> why<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:42.150> look

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
much younger and that's why they look

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.389 
much younger and that's why they look
different<00:01:42.450> or<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:43.079> look<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.320> alex<00:01:44.220> mason

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.559 
he does look like a Japanese person and
that<00:02:42.269> is<00:02:42.420> clearly<00:02:42.900> Tokyo<00:02:43.409> so<00:02:43.709> um<00:02:44.639> the<00:02:45.150> next<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
that is clearly Tokyo so um the next a

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.449 
that is clearly Tokyo so um the next a
little<00:02:46.470> video<00:02:46.590> I'll<00:02:46.769> be<00:02:46.799> showing<00:02:46.889> you<00:02:47.129> guys<00:02:47.189> is

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
little video I'll be showing you guys is

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.309 
little video I'll be showing you guys is
of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.819> trenches<00:02:48.269> now<00:02:48.599> I<00:02:48.629> think<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.019> was<00:02:49.169> right

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
of the trenches now I think I was right

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.890 
of the trenches now I think I was right
with<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> Verdun<00:02:49.950> France<00:02:50.340> theory<00:02:50.790> because<00:02:51.540> um

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
with the Verdun France theory because um

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.250 
with the Verdun France theory because um
in<00:02:52.650> Verdun<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:54.060> actual<00:02:54.389> event<00:02:54.629> was<00:02:54.989> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
in Verdun the actual event was the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.649 
in Verdun the actual event was the
Germans<00:02:56.040> entered<00:02:56.189> the<00:02:56.489> entered<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> trenches

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
Germans entered the entered the trenches

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.929 
Germans entered the entered the trenches
at<00:02:57.780> Hill<00:02:57.900> 344<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:59.189> is<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.430> little<00:02:59.760> bit<00:02:59.879> of

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
at Hill 344 and this is a little bit of

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.030 
at Hill 344 and this is a little bit of
gameplay<00:03:00.299> plus<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.109> giant<00:03:01.439> metal<00:03:01.650> man<00:03:01.829> um

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
gameplay plus the giant metal man um

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.039 
gameplay plus the giant metal man um
it's<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.120> little<00:03:03.299> bit<00:03:03.389> of<00:03:03.480> gameplay<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:04.609> um<00:03:06.049> you

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
it's a little bit of gameplay of um you

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.209 
it's a little bit of gameplay of um you
know<00:03:07.169> metal<00:03:07.469> man<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.829> running<00:03:07.889> through<00:03:08.159> the

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
know metal man and running through the

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.440 
know metal man and running through the
trenches<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.730> let's<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.090> into<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.329> and

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
trenches so let's get into that and

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.250 
trenches so let's get into that and
we'll<00:03:09.599> talk<00:03:09.750> about

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.470 

so<00:03:15.980> basically<00:03:16.280> guys<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.670> mean<00:03:16.849> here's<00:03:17.150> Verdun

a lot of mud being flowing all over the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.259 
a lot of mud being flowing all over the
place<00:03:21.739> it's<00:03:21.950> raining<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.519> then<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:22.819> see<00:03:23.000> the

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
place it's raining and then we see the

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.539 
place it's raining and then we see the
metal<00:03:23.569> man<00:03:23.750> now<00:03:24.200> treyarch<00:03:24.739> they<00:03:25.099> literally

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
metal man now treyarch they literally

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.360 
metal man now treyarch they literally
took<00:03:25.849> huge<00:03:26.720> metal<00:03:26.989> man<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.409> they<00:03:28.010> made<00:03:28.220> him

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
took huge metal man and they made him

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.220 
took huge metal man and they made him
it's<00:03:29.030> not<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.540> figure<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.810> speech<00:03:29.870> this

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
it's not just a figure of speech this

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.100 
it's not just a figure of speech this
guy<00:03:30.319> is<00:03:30.470> huge<00:03:31.069> so<00:03:31.790> everybody's<00:03:32.540> going<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.720> put

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
guy is huge so everybody's going to put

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.960 
guy is huge so everybody's going to put
the<00:03:33.200> final<00:03:33.379> image<00:03:33.560> up<00:03:33.829> of<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.190> zombie<00:03:34.549> which

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
the final image up of the zombie which

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.670 
the final image up of the zombie which
is<00:03:35.000> kind<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.540> hidden<00:03:35.780> in<00:03:35.959> freeze<00:03:36.200> frame<00:03:36.470> I'll

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
is kind of hidden in freeze frame I'll

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.110 
is kind of hidden in freeze frame I'll
talk<00:03:37.040> about<00:03:37.099> that<00:03:37.250> quick<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.610> then<00:03:37.730> I'll<00:03:37.819> wrap

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
talk about that quick and then I'll wrap

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.390 
talk about that quick and then I'll wrap
up<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:38.360> video<00:03:38.590> now<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.650> reason<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.129> image

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
up this video now the reason this image

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.619 
up this video now the reason this image
is<00:03:40.519> smallest<00:03:40.849> because<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.090> rendered<00:03:41.329> it

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
is smallest because I rendered it

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.199 
is smallest because I rendered it
because<00:03:42.319> if<00:03:42.530> one<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:42.950> images<00:03:43.159> were<00:03:43.519> the

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
because if one of the images were the

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.640 
because if one of the images were the
rage<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.599> original<00:03:45.079> size<00:03:45.260> they're<00:03:45.500> too

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
rage of the original size they're too

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.390 
rage of the original size they're too
big<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:46.040> fit<00:03:46.579> into<00:03:46.790> my<00:03:47.620> editing<00:03:48.620> software<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.190> I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
big to fit into my editing software so I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.770 
big to fit into my editing software so I
just<00:03:49.760> turn<00:03:49.879> it<00:03:49.940> down<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.090> little<00:03:50.269> bit<00:03:50.450> but<00:03:50.629> there

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
just turn it down a little bit but there

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.330 
just turn it down a little bit but there
are<00:03:50.870> four<00:03:51.140> images<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.950> put<00:03:52.129> it<00:03:52.220> together

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
are four images and I put it together

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.699 
are four images and I put it together
and<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.819> looks<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:53.329> a<00:03:53.540> zombie<00:03:53.569> so<00:03:54.079> he's<00:03:54.200> what

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
and it looks like a zombie so he's what

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.770 
and it looks like a zombie so he's what
is<00:03:54.799> his<00:03:54.950> on<00:03:55.069> be<00:03:55.190> his<00:03:55.459> head's<00:03:55.700> cracked<00:03:55.879> open<00:03:56.209> his

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
is his on be his head's cracked open his

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.619 
is his on be his head's cracked open his
foot<00:03:57.200> is<00:03:57.409> basically<00:03:58.129> cut<00:03:58.370> off<00:03:58.549> um<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.450> he's

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
foot is basically cut off um and he's

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.449 
foot is basically cut off um and he's
just<00:03:59.810> strapped<00:04:00.319> down<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:01.010> this<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.370> the

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
just strapped down so is this in the

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.039 
just strapped down so is this in the
doctors<00:04:01.790> quarters<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.269> Cheyenne<00:04:02.540> Enuma<00:04:02.930> is

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
doctors quarters in Cheyenne Enuma is

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.559 
doctors quarters in Cheyenne Enuma is
this<00:04:03.470> some<00:04:03.650> kind<00:04:03.889> of<00:04:03.950> hint<00:04:04.220> as<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.459> where<00:04:04.909> the

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
this some kind of hint as to where the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.930 
this some kind of hint as to where the
first<00:04:05.810> experiment<00:04:06.139> started<00:04:06.680> um<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:07.340> think<00:04:07.400> that

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
first experiment started um I think that

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.059 
first experiment started um I think that
the<00:04:08.060> zombie<00:04:08.359> has<00:04:08.720> no<00:04:08.930> relevance<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.799> story

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
the zombie has no relevance to the story

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.289 
the zombie has no relevance to the story
at<00:04:10.129> all<00:04:10.190> i<00:04:10.250> don't<00:04:10.370> think<00:04:10.730> anyone<00:04:10.970> cares<00:04:11.090> about

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
at all i don't think anyone cares about

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.750 
at all i don't think anyone cares about
him<00:04:11.450> but<00:04:12.049> it's<00:04:12.319> actually<00:04:12.650> just<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.190> setting

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
him but it's actually just the setting

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.879 
him but it's actually just the setting
of<00:04:13.909> where<00:04:14.030> this<00:04:14.120> is<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.569> when<00:04:15.349> this<00:04:15.470> happened

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
of where this is and when this happened

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.610 
of where this is and when this happened
um<00:04:16.039> why<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.000> he<00:04:17.299> here<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:18.079> this<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.500> first

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
um why is he here and is this the first

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.890 
um why is he here and is this the first
zombie<00:04:18.919> or<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.639> first<00:04:19.880> experiments<00:04:20.479> with<00:04:20.780> the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
zombie or the first experiments with the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.600 
zombie or the first experiments with the
zombie<00:04:21.229> so<00:04:21.410> any<00:04:21.859> guys<00:04:22.010> that's<00:04:22.250> my<00:04:22.310> breakdown
