just want to see the full screen because

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.270 
just want to see the full screen because
we<00:06:10.660> debated<00:06:11.050> about<00:06:11.110> that<00:06:11.380> right<00:06:11.680> right<00:06:12.100> it's

we debated about that right right it's

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.980

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
easier for us to do the full screen it's

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.750 
easier for us to do the full screen it's
actually<00:06:14.320> more<00:06:14.620> time<00:06:14.919> consuming<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.520> do<00:06:15.640> the

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
actually more time consuming to do the

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.520 
actually more time consuming to do the
interactive<00:06:16.210> hub<00:06:16.419> but<00:06:16.960> we<00:06:17.050> feel<00:06:17.230> like<00:06:17.320> it's

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
interactive hub but we feel like it's

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.380 
interactive hub but we feel like it's
just<00:06:17.680> cooler<00:06:17.950> it's<00:06:18.520> kind<00:06:18.730> of<00:06:18.850> like<00:06:18.910> watching<00:06:19.150> a

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390
