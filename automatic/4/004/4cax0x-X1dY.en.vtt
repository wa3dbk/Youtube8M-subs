madness and chaos of dragon bash we've
managed<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.629> data-mine<00:00:07.049> some<00:00:07.770> new<00:00:08.040> arm<00:00:08.309> sets

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
managed to data-mine some new arm sets

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.240 
managed to data-mine some new arm sets
now<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:10.019> models<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.500> these<00:00:10.590> had<00:00:10.830> been<00:00:10.860> data

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
now the models for these had been data

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.770 
now the models for these had been data
mined<00:00:11.490> previously<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.330> they<00:00:12.450> didn't<00:00:12.690> have

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
mined previously but they didn't have

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.959 
mined previously but they didn't have
any<00:00:12.929> textures<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.860> we've<00:00:14.130> got<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> full<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
any textures so we've got the full on a

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.500 
any textures so we've got the full on a
set<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.630> we<00:00:16.170> can<00:00:16.350> say<00:00:16.619> with<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.789> decent<00:00:18.119> amount

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
set and we can say with a decent amount

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.880 
set and we can say with a decent amount
of<00:00:18.570> certainty<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.080> these<00:00:19.500> will<00:00:19.680> be

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
of certainty that these will be

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580 
of certainty that these will be
available<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.820> gem<00:00:21.060> storm<00:00:21.449> such<00:00:21.960> as<00:00:22.199> the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
really cool in my opinion I'm sure quite

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.260 
really cool in my opinion I'm sure quite
a<00:01:44.360> few<00:01:44.540> folk<00:01:44.780> could<00:01:45.170> use<00:01:45.500> those<00:01:45.770> for<00:01:46.270> various

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
a few folk could use those for various

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.080 
a few folk could use those for various
different<00:01:47.630> armor<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.710> themes<00:01:48.920> but<00:01:49.220> got<00:01:50.060> a

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
different armor on the themes but got a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.830 
different armor on the themes but got a
nice<00:01:50.270> huge<00:01:50.990> cog<00:01:51.350> on<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.740> shoulder<00:01:52.070> they're

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
nice huge cog on the shoulder they're

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.960 
nice huge cog on the shoulder they're
quite<00:01:53.840> dangerous<00:01:54.550> so<00:01:55.550> i<00:01:55.610> might<00:01:55.790> get

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
quite dangerous so i might get

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.410 
quite dangerous so i might get
decapitated<00:01:56.240> off<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:56.960> one<00:01:57.280> but<00:01:58.280> once<00:01:59.000> again

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
decapitated off that one but once again

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.350 
decapitated off that one but once again
i'm<00:01:59.630> sure<00:02:00.110> folk<00:02:00.470> could<00:02:00.830> find<00:02:01.130> out<00:02:01.369> or<00:02:01.610> rather

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
i'm sure folk could find out or rather

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.969 
i'm sure folk could find out or rather
use<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.960> individual<00:02:03.440> pieces<00:02:03.650> it's

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
use the individual pieces it's

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.760 
use the individual pieces it's
interesting<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.869> heavyset<00:02:06.320> seems<00:02:06.619> to

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
interesting that the heavyset seems to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.670 
interesting that the heavyset seems to
be<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.100> most<00:02:07.660> revealing<00:02:10.000> strangely<00:02:11.000> but

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
be the most revealing strangely but

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.740 
be the most revealing strangely but
nevermind<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.610> once<00:02:13.820> again<00:02:13.970> I'm<00:02:14.330> guessing

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
nevermind so once again I'm guessing

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.660 
nevermind so once again I'm guessing
these<00:02:14.930> will<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.290> available<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.070> gem<00:02:16.340> store

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
these will be available in a gem store

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.449 
these will be available in a gem store
probably<00:02:17.180> for<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.810> similar<00:02:18.140> amount<00:02:18.459> probably

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
probably for a similar amount probably

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.509 
probably for a similar amount probably
between<00:02:19.580> 500<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.540> 800<00:02:20.810> gems<00:02:21.350> maybe<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.340> could

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
between 500 and 800 gems maybe it could

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.790 
between 500 and 800 gems maybe it could
go<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.700> high<00:02:23.000> they<00:02:23.810> seem<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.050> be<00:02:24.200> liking<00:02:24.320> that

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800
