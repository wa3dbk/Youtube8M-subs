00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
axle obviously they're not going to hurt

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.309 
axle obviously they're not going to hurt
I back<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.040> champion<00:02:15.459> no<00:02:16.170> he's<00:02:17.170> the

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
I back just in the champion no he's the

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.449 
I back just in the champion no he's the
champ<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.650> know<00:02:17.769> what's<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.040> that's<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.430> think

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
champ you know what's and that's I think

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.339 
champ you know what's and that's I think
the<00:02:18.819> way<00:02:19.060> they<00:02:19.180> look<00:02:19.209> at<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.629> he<00:02:19.900> has<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.140> belt

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
the way they look at is he has the belt

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.690 
the way they look at is he has the belt
so<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.620> might<00:02:20.799> as<00:02:20.830> well<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.159> lose<00:02:21.340> because<00:02:21.519> at

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
so we might as well just lose because at

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.130 
so we might as well just lose because at
the<00:02:21.760> end<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.970> day<00:02:22.120> he'll<00:02:22.330> still<00:02:22.540> be<00:02:22.690> champion

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
the end of day he'll still be champion

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.220 
the end of day he'll still be champion
so<00:02:23.830> truth<00:02:24.159> gets<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.580> pin<00:02:24.849> on<00:02:25.120> Curtis<00:02:25.629> axle<00:02:25.989> and

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
so truth gets the pin on Curtis axle and

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.680 
so truth gets the pin on Curtis axle and
then<00:02:27.099> we<00:02:27.310> had<00:02:27.580> reindeer<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.180> verse<00:02:28.330> Kofi

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
Triple H in a match I think this has

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.100 
Triple H in a match I think this has
been<00:04:41.910> built<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.360> point<00:04:43.720> where<00:04:43.840> maybe

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
been built to a point where maybe

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.810 
been built to a point where maybe
getting<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.890> ring<00:04:45.040> with<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.430> Triple<00:04:45.730> H

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
getting in the ring with the Triple H

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.520 
getting in the ring with the Triple H
Big<00:04:46.060> Show<00:04:46.240> matches<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:46.930> it's<00:04:47.080> gonna<00:04:47.260> pay<00:04:47.500> it

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
Big Show matches but it's gonna pay it

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.040 
Big Show matches but it's gonna pay it
off<00:04:47.740> so<00:04:48.040> I<00:04:48.220> guess<00:04:49.000> they're<00:04:49.420> really<00:04:49.690> going<00:04:49.900> all
