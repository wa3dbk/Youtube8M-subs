about<00:03:47.159> which<00:03:47.459> method<00:03:47.819> is<00:03:47.879> better<00:03:48.150> um<00:03:48.419> hey<00:03:49.200> guys

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
about which method is better um hey guys

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.619 
about which method is better um hey guys
there's<00:03:50.189> still<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> mentioned<00:03:51.000> movie<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.540> you

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
there's still a mentioned movie that you

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.240 
there's still a mentioned movie that you
haven't<00:03:51.870> tried<00:03:52.079> that<00:03:52.319> seems<00:03:52.889> like<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.159> would

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
haven't tried that seems like it would

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.129 
haven't tried that seems like it would
totally<00:03:53.430> be<00:03:53.579> up<00:03:53.790> rainbows<00:03:54.090> alley<00:03:54.269> as<00:03:54.569> long<00:03:55.019> as

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
totally be up rainbows alley as long as

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.569 
totally be up rainbows alley as long as
it's<00:03:55.260> official<00:03:55.680> which<00:03:55.859> is<00:03:56.010> highly<00:03:56.430> likely

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
it's official which is highly likely

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.189 
it's official which is highly likely
considering<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.359> movie<00:03:57.599> is<00:03:57.750> apparently

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
considering the movie is apparently

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.869 
considering the movie is apparently
titled<00:03:58.560> history<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.220> Wonderbolts<00:03:59.430> I

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
titled history of the Wonderbolts I

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.219 
titled history of the Wonderbolts I
don't<00:04:00.180> see<00:04:00.299> any<00:04:00.419> reason<00:04:00.750> why<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.870> can't<00:04:00.959> at

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
don't see any reason why you can't at

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.030 
don't see any reason why you can't at
least<00:04:01.260> give<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> try

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
least give that a try

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.430 
least give that a try
so<00:04:02.819> Rainbow<00:04:03.209> Dash<00:04:03.359> gives<00:04:03.599> up<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.900> flies<00:04:04.109> away

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
so Rainbow Dash gives up and flies away

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.869 
so Rainbow Dash gives up and flies away
Twilight<00:04:05.069> tries<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.370> cheer<00:04:05.519> her<00:04:05.579> up<00:04:05.609> and

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
Twilight tries to cheer her up and

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.390 
Twilight tries to cheer her up and
almost<00:04:06.090> gets<00:04:06.389> hit<00:04:06.479> by<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> helicopter<00:04:07.769> which

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
almost gets hit by a helicopter which

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.129 
almost gets hit by a helicopter which
didn't<00:04:09.000> think<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.389> move<00:04:09.569> out<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.959> way<00:04:10.109> of

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
didn't think to move out of the way of

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.250 
didn't think to move out of the way of
Princess<00:04:10.979> Twilight<00:04:11.690> guess<00:04:12.690> helicopters

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
Princess Twilight guess helicopters

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.839 
Princess Twilight guess helicopters
can't<00:04:13.409> turn<00:04:13.560> very<00:04:13.769> well<00:04:13.979> that's<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.609> bit<00:04:14.699> of<00:04:14.790> a

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
can't turn very well that's a bit of a

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:15.289 
can't turn very well that's a bit of a
hazard

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
hazard

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.029 
hazard
so<00:04:15.840> then<00:04:15.989> rainbow<00:04:16.289> shows<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.680> she<00:04:16.859> learns

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
so then rainbow shows that she learns

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.479 
so then rainbow shows that she learns
visually<00:04:17.579> be<00:04:17.729> a<00:04:17.760> multitasking<00:04:18.510> I<00:04:19.130> buy<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.190> I

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
visually be a multitasking I buy it I

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.430 
visually be a multitasking I buy it I
know<00:04:21.090> several<00:04:21.389> people<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.900> do<00:04:22.019> learn<00:04:22.199> like

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
know several people that do learn like

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.960 
know several people that do learn like
that<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.099> makes<00:04:23.280> sense<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.639> Rainbow

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
that and it makes sense that Rainbow

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.610 
that and it makes sense that Rainbow
would<00:04:24.150> learn<00:04:24.300> like<00:04:24.449> this<00:04:24.599> I<00:04:24.840> mean<00:04:25.139> considering

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
would learn like this I mean considering

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.379 
would learn like this I mean considering
her<00:04:25.770> daily<00:04:26.099> life<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.400> having<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.760> be<00:04:26.880> aware<00:04:27.210> of

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
her daily life of having to be aware of

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.089 
her daily life of having to be aware of
everything<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.750> goes<00:04:27.870> on<00:04:28.199> around<00:04:28.320> her<00:04:28.740> she

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
everything that goes on around her she

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.529 
everything that goes on around her she
would<00:04:29.310> have<00:04:29.490> an<00:04:29.580> attention<00:04:29.880> deficit<00:04:30.419> when

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
would have an attention deficit when

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.850 
would have an attention deficit when
she's<00:04:30.690> not<00:04:30.810> doing<00:04:31.080> something<00:04:31.289> that<00:04:31.470> interests

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
she's not doing something that interests

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.070 
she's not doing something that interests
her<00:04:31.949> so<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.880> main<00:04:33.030> six<00:04:33.240> exploit<00:04:33.690> this<00:04:33.870> I'm

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
her so the main six exploit this I'm

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.570 
her so the main six exploit this I'm
rainbow<00:04:34.289> learns<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.680> history<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.130> passes

that's the episode despite some really
cringe-worthy<00:04:42.240> moments<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:42.900> was<00:04:43.080> another

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
is different and we have quite a bit a

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
to talk about that at first I was

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.770

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.510 
hesitant to call the Wonderbolts actual
military<00:04:52.020> because<00:04:52.740> even<00:04:53.099> though<00:04:53.190> they<00:04:53.310> showed

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
military because even though they showed

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.399 
military because even though they showed
row<00:04:53.759> instructor<00:04:54.180> Spitfire<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:55.050> stuff<00:04:55.289> the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
pride was kind of hoping they weren't
