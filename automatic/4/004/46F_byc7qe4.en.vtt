00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.889
 hello welcome are like in this videos 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.780
 I'm going to teach how to peel almonds 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.390
 You can buy almonds with the 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.490
 small shell that we have to remove 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.710
 with this or if not the shell but then 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.470
 under a skin that we will have to 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.210
 know how to remove 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.849
 this piece here we can not remove from a 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.130
 very simple time this skin as we see is 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.480
 very simple and now we are going to teach what 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.539
 first of all it will have all the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.250
 almonds let's do it once we 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.620
 we have removed the hard part of the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.809
 almonds the shell unless the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.210
 we have already bought in this way we see 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.040
 that it is now complicated to remove the skin 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.960
 in fact a little bit of strength and we see how 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.400
 has been broken to remove the skin what 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.070
 we have to do is put the almonds 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.450
 about 30 seconds no more time in water 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.550
 boiling 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.220
 here I am doing it with few 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.840
 examples for us to see and then what 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.160
 we will remove it let it cool and 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 we will see how it is removed very easy 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.539
 and it's been about 30 seconds enough 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 if it's a bit more , nothing happens either 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.790
 now with a spoon how is it for 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.140
 drain the water we remove them with 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.140
 careful not to burn is not 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.130
 and we'll let them cool 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.300
 and basically so that we do not burn ourselves 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.300
 when we remove the skin 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.990
 we already have them all turn off the fire and 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.189
 we wait 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.659
 we have already let them cool and we see that 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.810
 very easily we can remove the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.880
 skin before was very complicated and now 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.460
 It is very easy to remove and this will be perfect 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.470
 for good to give 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.650
 like ourselves in the skin that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.170
 really the skin is not very good for 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.090
 cooking or for what we want is a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.250
 very quick look is done in very little 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.470
 time and we see that the result is very 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.840
 well, so I do not expect anything 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.600
