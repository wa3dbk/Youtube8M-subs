no<00:00:16.280> I'm<00:00:16.580> sorry<00:00:16.910> but<00:00:17.390> Gilbert<00:00:17.600> won't<00:00:17.930> be<00:00:18.020> able

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
no I'm sorry but Gilbert won't be able

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.630 
no I'm sorry but Gilbert won't be able
to<00:00:18.260> play<00:00:18.440> with<00:00:18.620> you<00:00:18.710> boys<00:00:18.920> till<00:00:19.220> later<00:00:19.460> this

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
to play with you boys till later this

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.310 
to play with you boys till later this
afternoon<00:00:22.000> he's<00:00:23.000> doing<00:00:23.330> some<00:00:23.540> work<00:00:23.690> for<00:00:23.720> me

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.920 

Springs<00:00:27.320> I<00:00:28.090> hope<00:00:29.090> I<00:00:29.270> never<00:00:29.420> see<00:00:29.810> another

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
Springs I hope I never see another

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
Springs I hope I never see another
spring<00:00:30.619> as<00:00:30.950> long<00:00:31.279> as<00:00:31.520> I<00:00:31.670> live

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
spring as long as I live

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.250 
spring as long as I live
so<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.700> never<00:00:35.000> want<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.420> see<00:00:35.629> another<00:00:35.750> spring

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
so you never want to see another spring

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.490 
so you never want to see another spring
hey<00:00:36.590> okay<00:00:37.550> mister<00:00:38.000> I'll<00:00:38.360> fix<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.110> you<00:00:39.290> get

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
hey okay mister I'll fix it so you get

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.729 
hey okay mister I'll fix it so you get
that<00:00:39.710> wish<00:00:40.270> who<00:00:41.830> who<00:00:42.830> you<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:44.750> names<00:00:45.020> call<00:00:45.500> me

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
that wish who who you the names call me

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.750 
that wish who who you the names call me
clearly<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.879> spring<00:00:47.180> spike<00:00:47.600> they<00:00:47.870> call<00:00:48.110> me<00:00:48.380> I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
clearly the spring spike they call me I

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.970 
clearly the spring spike they call me I
thought<00:00:49.760> you're<00:00:50.149> wishing<00:00:50.780> well<00:00:51.290> you're<00:00:51.800> gonna

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
thought you're wishing well you're gonna

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.060 
thought you're wishing well you're gonna
get<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:52.460> no<00:00:53.000> more<00:00:53.270> Springs<00:00:53.840> for<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:54.320> from<00:00:54.800> now

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
get it no more Springs for you from now

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:21.090 
get it no more Springs for you from now

can't<00:03:19.060> we<00:03:19.120> call<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> whole<00:03:19.660> thing<00:03:19.690> off<00:03:20.080> isn't

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
can't we call the whole thing off isn't

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.400 
can't we call the whole thing off isn't
there<00:03:21.190> anything<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.580> can<00:03:21.730> do<00:03:21.880> please<00:03:22.260> let<00:03:23.260> me

don't<00:03:32.350> ever<00:03:32.770> make<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.490> wish<00:03:33.790> again

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.530 

you<00:04:09.110> see<00:04:09.320> fellows<00:04:09.710> the<00:04:10.280> scientific<00:04:11.030> principle

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
you see fellows the scientific principle

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.600 
you see fellows the scientific principle
of<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.720> spring<00:04:12.050> is<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.380> absorb<00:04:12.800> energy<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.370> then

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
of a spring is to absorb energy and then

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:21.300 
of a spring is to absorb energy and then
to<00:04:13.790> release<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.300> that's<00:04:14.810> all<00:04:15.050> there<00:04:15.230> is<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.590> it

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:44.220 

too<00:04:22.310> bad<00:04:22.520> Joan<00:04:22.970> yeah

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.290 

nice<00:04:45.230> shot<00:04:46.210> yes<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.480> was<00:04:47.830> what<00:04:48.940> if<00:04:49.940> it<00:04:50.090> wasn't

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
nice shot yes it was what if it wasn't

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.880 
nice shot yes it was what if it wasn't
for<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.600> amount<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:50.960> spring<00:04:51.350> in<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.650> club

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
for the amount of spring in the club

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.800 
for the amount of spring in the club
shaft<00:04:52.190> combined<00:04:53.060> with<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.360> spring<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.750> the

shaft combined with the spring of the
rubber<00:04:54.020> inside<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.590> ball<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:55.280> drive

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
rubber inside the ball that drive

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.760 
rubber inside the ball that drive
wouldn't<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:55.940> gone<00:04:56.030> anywhere<00:04:56.480> at<00:04:56.600> all<00:04:56.770> you

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
wouldn't have gone anywhere at all you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.740 
wouldn't have gone anywhere at all you
see<00:04:57.980> all<00:04:58.220> spring<00:04:58.820> action<00:04:59.030> depends<00:04:59.600> on

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
see all spring action depends on

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.350 
see all spring action depends on
elasticity<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:01.220> ability<00:05:01.670> of<00:05:01.760> material<00:05:02.210> to

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
stop to think about it even the ground

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.580 
stop to think about it even the ground
the<00:05:12.890> earth<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:13.340> like<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.550> huge<00:05:13.880> spring<00:05:14.350> it<00:05:15.350> has

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
the earth is like a huge spring it has

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.340 
the earth is like a huge spring it has
the<00:05:15.770> ability<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.490> absorb<00:05:16.850> a<00:05:17.240> blow<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:17.810> then

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
the ability to absorb a blow and then

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.350 
the ability to absorb a blow and then

transmit the shock from one point to

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.270 
transmit the shock from one point to
another<00:05:20.450> and<00:05:21.140> that's<00:05:21.350> exactly<00:05:21.680> what<00:05:21.950> a<00:05:21.980> spring

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
another and that's exactly what a spring

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.550 
another and that's exactly what a spring
is<00:05:22.430> supposed<00:05:22.730> to<00:05:22.850> do<00:05:23.030> transmit<00:05:23.960> shock<00:05:24.260> from

on with the game you don't realize a

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.100 
on with the game you don't realize a
number<00:05:31.670> of<00:05:31.790> Springs<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:32.300> work<00:05:32.510> for<00:05:32.720> us<00:05:32.750> every
