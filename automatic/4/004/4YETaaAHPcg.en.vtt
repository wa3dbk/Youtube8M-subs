with this what's nice is it harkens back
to<00:00:37.739> an<00:00:37.890> earlier<00:00:38.280> Olympus<00:00:38.760> camera<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.210> might

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
to an earlier Olympus camera you might

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360 
to an earlier Olympus camera you might
remember<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.780> OM<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.110> film<00:00:40.649> command<00:00:41.040> camera

remember the OM one film command camera
really<00:00:41.760> looks<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> lot<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.440> fun

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
really looks a lot like this it was fun

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.470 
really looks a lot like this it was fun
to<00:00:43.829> hold<00:00:43.980> fun<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> use<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> compare

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to hold fun to use and when you compare

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.650 
to hold fun to use and when you compare
the<00:00:45.840> OMD<00:00:48.320> fiery<00:00:49.320> m5<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.789> 5d<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the OMD fiery m5 with the the 5d you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
the OMD fiery m5 with the the 5d you
really<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.170> how<00:00:52.739> much<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.070> save<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.000> by

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
really see how much I save and and by

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
really see how much I save and and by
the<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.750> comparable<00:00:55.170> lenses<00:00:56.059> but

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the way these are comparable lenses but

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
the way these are comparable lenses but
because<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> Micro<00:00:57.870> Four<00:00:58.079> Thirds<00:00:58.109> sensor

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
because it's a Micro Four Thirds sensor

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.060 
because it's a Micro Four Thirds sensor
the<00:00:59.340> smaller<00:00:59.699> lens<00:01:00.090> also<00:01:01.020> makes<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.920> whole

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the smaller lens also makes the whole

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619 
the smaller lens also makes the whole
kit<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.520> lot<00:01:02.789> lighter<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.359> carry<00:01:03.570> your

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
kit a lot lighter you can carry your

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.090 
kit a lot lighter you can carry your
whole<00:01:03.840> camera<00:01:04.199> kit<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> small<00:01:04.559> backpack

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
whole camera kit a small backpack

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.090 
whole camera kit a small backpack
well<00:01:05.580> Olympus<00:01:06.000> has<00:01:06.510> followed<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> om

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
well Olympus has followed up on the om

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.990 
well Olympus has followed up on the om
de<00:01:08.930> m5<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> new<00:01:10.760> Micro<00:01:11.760> Four<00:01:11.970> Thirds

de m5 with a new Micro Four Thirds
camera<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.470> om-d<00:01:14.010> e-m1

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
camera this is it this is the om-d e-m1

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.090 
camera this is it this is the om-d e-m1
so<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.140> confused<00:01:16.439> by<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.650> numbering

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
so don't be confused by the numbering

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.679 
so don't be confused by the numbering
scheme<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.820> backwards<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
scheme they are going backwards of the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.289 
scheme they are going backwards of the
numbering<00:01:18.900> scheme<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.150> probably<00:01:21.150> in

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
numbering scheme but this is probably in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480 
numbering scheme but this is probably in

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
small little flash that will use the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.590 
small little flash that will use the
camera's<00:01:52.619> battery<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.399> also<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.180> full

shooting lots and lots of functionality
let's<00:02:06.360> talk<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.780> what's<00:02:07.079> different

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
let's talk about what's different

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.580 
let's talk about what's different
between<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.640> m5<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> successor<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> em1

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
between the a m5 and a successor the em1

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.890 
between the a m5 and a successor the em1
price<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> same<00:02:11.610> about<00:02:12.150> 1,400<00:02:12.810> bucks

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
price is the same about 1,400 bucks

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.400 
price is the same about 1,400 bucks
although

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
although

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.780 
although
I<00:02:13.470> should<00:02:13.920> mention<00:02:14.040> through<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> end<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I should mention through the end of the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.330 
I should mention through the end of the
month<00:02:14.970> Olympus<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.930> taking<00:02:16.350> $200<00:02:16.980> off<00:02:17.130> this

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
month Olympus is taking $200 off this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.880 
month Olympus is taking $200 off this
em1<00:02:18.060> they're<00:02:18.600> pushing<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.530> sale

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
em1 they're pushing it so it's on sale

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.590 
em1 they're pushing it so it's on sale
so<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.700> might<00:02:20.850> be<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> good<00:02:21.180> time<00:02:21.330> if<00:02:21.450> you're

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
so this might be a good time if you're

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.810 
so this might be a good time if you're
interested<00:02:21.990> micro<00:02:22.260> four-thirds<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.610> the

advantage of micro four-thirds i should

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.990 
advantage of micro four-thirds i should
mention<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.470> interchangeable<00:02:26.190> lenses<00:02:26.520> you

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
mention is interchangeable lenses you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.280 
mention is interchangeable lenses you
can<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.270> Olympus<00:02:27.630> lenses<00:02:27.960> but<00:02:28.050> there<00:02:28.230> are

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
can get Olympus lenses but there are

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.750 
can get Olympus lenses but there are
many<00:02:28.500> other<00:02:28.710> companies<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.160> make<00:02:29.430> micro

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
many other companies that make micro

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.310 
many other companies that make micro
four-thirds<00:02:30.180> lenses<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.600> there's<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.870> very

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
four-thirds lenses so there's a very

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.290 
four-thirds lenses so there's a very
wide<00:02:31.710> range<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:32.190> selections<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.240> the

wide range of selections one of the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.120 
wide range of selections one of the
things<00:02:33.510> Olympus<00:02:33.840> did<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> em1

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
things Olympus did with the em1

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.520 
things Olympus did with the em1
that<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> liked<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> lot<00:02:36.330> there<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.170> two

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that I liked a lot there are two

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.620 
that I liked a lot there are two
focusing<00:02:38.340> styles<00:02:38.790> there's<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.510> know

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
focusing styles there's the you know

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.590 
focusing styles there's the you know
fast<00:02:40.080> micro<00:02:40.860> four-thirds<00:02:41.310> phase<00:02:42.000> focusing

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
fast micro four-thirds phase focusing

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.090 
fast micro four-thirds phase focusing
but<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.750> also<00:02:42.840> has<00:02:43.020> contrast<00:02:43.440> focusing<00:02:43.920> built

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
but it also has contrast focusing built

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800 
but it also has contrast focusing built
in<00:02:44.250> that's<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> want<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.150> use<00:02:45.270> older<00:02:45.570> Four

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
in that's if you want to use older Four

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.800 
in that's if you want to use older Four
Thirds<00:02:46.080> lenses<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:47.340> some<00:02:47.580> cases<00:02:47.850> with

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
Thirds lenses and in some cases with

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.240 
Thirds lenses and in some cases with
continuous<00:02:49.290> focus<00:02:49.560> you'll<00:02:49.710> be<00:02:49.830> able<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.070> use

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
continuous focus you'll be able to use

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.610 
continuous focus you'll be able to use
both<00:02:50.520> that's<00:02:50.940> great<00:02:51.270> very<00:02:51.300> fast<00:02:52.050> focusing<00:02:52.530> on

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
both that's great very fast focusing on

both that's great very fast focusing on

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
where it is notoriously bad I found that

the<00:02:56.400> same<00:02:56.550> thing<00:02:56.790> here<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.720> great<00:02:58.020> lens

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the same thing here but great lens

mirrorless<00:03:22.890> there's<00:03:23.190> no<00:03:23.340> mirror<00:03:23.970> there's<00:03:24.209> no

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
mirrorless there's no mirror there's no

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.990 
mirrorless there's no mirror there's no
prism<00:03:24.810> that's<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> sensor<00:03:25.680> right<00:03:25.830> there<00:03:26.160> and

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
prism that's the sensor right there and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.570 
prism that's the sensor right there and
so<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.390> order<00:03:27.510> for<00:03:27.630> unlike<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> traditional<00:03:28.680> SLR

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
so in order for unlike a traditional SLR

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.160 
so in order for unlike a traditional SLR
which<00:03:29.700> has<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> mirror<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.450> you're<00:03:30.570> looking

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
which has a mirror and you're looking

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.540 
which has a mirror and you're looking

the<00:03:44.370> electronic<00:03:44.820> viewfinder<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.570> get<00:03:45.870> lots

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
the electronic viewfinder you get lots

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.140 
the electronic viewfinder you get lots
of<00:03:46.320> information<00:03:46.620> histograms<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.489> stuff<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.120> I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
of information histograms and stuff so I

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.570 
of information histograms and stuff so I
you<00:03:48.570> know<00:03:48.690> while<00:03:49.140> optically<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.070> doesn't<00:03:50.370> feel

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
you know while optically it doesn't feel

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.240 
you know while optically it doesn't feel
as<00:03:50.640> live<00:03:51.330> perhaps<00:03:51.870> as<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.110> true<00:03:52.680> optical

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250

mirrored<00:03:53.700> camera<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.420> have<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.050> say<00:03:55.260> EVs<00:03:55.890> can<00:03:56.130> do

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
mirrored camera I have to say EVs can do

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.949 
mirrored camera I have to say EVs can do
so<00:03:56.489> much<00:03:56.700> more<00:03:56.730> once<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.150> get<00:03:57.300> used<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.660> them<00:03:57.750> I

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
so much more once you get used to them I

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.360 
so much more once you get used to them I
think<00:03:58.739> you're<00:03:58.830> gonna<00:03:58.920> like<00:03:59.190> it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
think you're gonna like it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.040 
think you're gonna like it
and<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.790> fact<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.630> compact

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
and the fact that this is so compact

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.199 
and the fact that this is so compact
gives<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.620> such<00:04:01.890> great<00:04:02.070> image<00:04:02.459> quality<00:04:02.670> it

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
gives you such great image quality it

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.550 
gives you such great image quality it
has<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> lot<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.900> other<00:04:04.020> features<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.410> I

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
has a lot of the other features that I

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.470 
has a lot of the other features that I
liked<00:04:04.830> about<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.190> OM<00:04:05.489> one<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.850> tiltable

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
liked about the OM one the tiltable

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.090 
liked about the OM one the tiltable
viewfinder<00:04:07.140> that<00:04:07.260> means<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.560> was<00:04:07.650> really<00:04:07.920> easy

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
viewfinder that means it was really easy

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.710 
viewfinder that means it was really easy
for<00:04:08.340> me<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.550> shoot<00:04:08.700> pictures<00:04:08.940> up<00:04:09.270> over<00:04:09.540> my<00:04:09.690> head

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
stealth mode you can operate this like a

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.770 
stealth mode you can operate this like a
roll<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.700> hold<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.000> at<00:04:15.090> your<00:04:15.270> waist<00:04:15.450> and

still see the viewfinder

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.890 
still see the viewfinder
I<00:04:17.310> found<00:04:17.730> that<00:04:17.850> great<00:04:18.090> for<00:04:18.270> taking<00:04:18.480> street

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
I found that great for taking street

better electronic viewfinder I like the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.909 
better electronic viewfinder I like the
fact<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.810> has<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.169> many<00:04:44.260> programmable

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
or is in here they've improved the lens

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.290

the<00:06:00.039> pro<00:06:00.400> side<00:06:00.669> of<00:06:00.910> course<00:06:01.090> this<00:06:01.510> is<00:06:01.660> a<00:06:01.690> 45

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
the pro side of course this is a 45

the pro side of course this is a 45
millimeter<00:06:02.770> lens<00:06:03.010> that's<00:06:03.250> effectively<00:06:03.820> 2x

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
millimeter lens that's effectively 2x

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.180 
millimeter lens that's effectively 2x
because<00:06:04.870> of<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.050> smaller<00:06:05.320> sensor<00:06:05.650> so<00:06:06.039> this

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
because of the smaller sensor so this

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.980 
because of the smaller sensor so this
small<00:06:06.340> lens<00:06:06.760> is<00:06:06.880> actually<00:06:07.150> a<00:06:07.180> 90<00:06:07.600> millimeter

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
small lens is actually a 90 millimeter

millimeter<00:06:11.200> lens<00:06:11.440> is<00:06:11.590> effectively<00:06:12.100> 150<00:06:12.910> so

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
millimeter lens is effectively 150 so

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.540 
millimeter lens is effectively 150 so
you<00:06:13.660> get<00:06:13.870> smaller<00:06:14.229> lenses<00:06:14.620> which<00:06:14.770> give<00:06:14.950> you<00:06:15.070> a

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
you get smaller lenses which give you a

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.000 
you get smaller lenses which give you a

definitely<00:06:18.580> give<00:06:18.700> this<00:06:18.820> a<00:06:18.970> buy<00:06:19.120> especially

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
definitely give this a buy especially

the price of it they're still going to

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.870 
the price of it they're still going to
sell<00:06:24.850> the<00:06:25.590> em5<00:06:26.590> it's<00:06:27.220> a<00:06:27.310> little<00:06:27.520> simpler<00:06:27.850> a

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
sell the em5 it's a little simpler a

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.719 
sell the em5 it's a little simpler a
little<00:06:28.120> easier<00:06:28.479> to<00:06:28.600> use<00:06:28.950> but<00:06:29.950> if<00:06:30.190> you<00:06:30.400> have<00:06:30.580> the

little easier to use but if you have the
