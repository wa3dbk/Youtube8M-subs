all-stars taking on the shield tonight
this<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.410> not<00:00:10.590> supposed<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.040> be<00:00:11.130> an

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
this is not supposed to be an

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.259 
this is not supposed to be an
Elimination<00:00:11.700> Chamber

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
Elimination Chamber

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.150 
Elimination Chamber
it<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.900> just<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.139> glitch<00:00:13.440> chamber<00:00:13.889> from<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
it was just a glitch chamber from the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.440 
it was just a glitch chamber from the
stream<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.700> thought<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:14.940> would<00:00:15.120> keep<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
stream so I thought I would keep the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.630 
stream so I thought I would keep the
video<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.049> also<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.279> an<00:00:17.430> elimination

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
video in it also it's not an elimination

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.689 
video in it also it's not an elimination
tag<00:00:18.210> team<00:00:18.240> match<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.840> some<00:00:19.020> reason<00:00:19.670> when<00:00:20.670> I

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
tag team match for some reason when I

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.250 
tag team match for some reason when I
was<00:00:20.850> making<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.210> earlier<00:00:21.600> predictions<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
was making my earlier predictions I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.769 
was making my earlier predictions I
thought<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.100> was<00:00:23.340> an<00:00:23.550> elimination<00:00:24.510> tag

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
thought that this was an elimination tag

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.200 
thought that this was an elimination tag
match<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.310> why<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.090> an

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
match so that's why it's in an

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.810 
match so that's why it's in an
Elimination<00:00:27.720> Chamber<00:00:27.900> tag<00:00:28.289> match<00:00:28.529> now<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
Elimination Chamber tag match now I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.730 
Elimination Chamber tag match now I
think<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.630> match<00:00:30.840> deserves<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
think this match deserves to be in a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.819 
think this match deserves to be in a
cage<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.309> chamber<00:00:33.320> however<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.410> don't<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.620> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
cage a chamber however I don't think it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.620 
cage a chamber however I don't think it
will<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.370> they'll<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
will be and they'll just do a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.990 
will be and they'll just do a
straight-up<00:00:37.020> 3v3

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
straight-up 3v3

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
straight-up 3v3
Elimination<00:00:39.000> Chamber<00:00:39.239> which<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.629> feel<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
Elimination Chamber which I feel is a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
Elimination Chamber which I feel is a
huge<00:00:40.230> disappointment<00:00:40.640> but<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> same<00:00:42.120> time

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
huge disappointment but at the same time

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.000 
huge disappointment but at the same time
if<00:00:42.690> they're<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:42.930> doing<00:00:43.200> eliminations<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
if they're not doing eliminations it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310 
if they're not doing eliminations it
makes<00:00:44.309> perfect<00:00:44.789> sense<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.719> thing<00:00:46.170> is

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
makes perfect sense now the thing is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
makes perfect sense now the thing is
John<00:00:46.680> Cena<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> rustle<00:00:47.910> mania

you know they're kind of becoming

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.140 
you know they're kind of becoming
hopefully<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:38.400> don't<00:01:38.549> become<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> season

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
hopefully they don't become a season

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.950 
against the Superstars and the company
they<00:01:44.280> start<00:01:44.549> losing<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.450> want<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
they start losing and I don't want to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
they start losing and I don't want to
see<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.200> happen<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.950> shield<00:01:47.250> have

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
see that happen I think the shield have

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.399 
see that happen I think the shield have
a<00:01:47.490> lot<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> potential<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
a lot of potential here and I think the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.270 
a lot of potential here and I think the
shield<00:01:49.649> should<00:01:49.920> go<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.799> either<00:01:52.799> pin

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
shield should go in and either pin

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.630 
shield should go in and either pin
Sheamus<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> win<00:01:54.299> when<00:01:54.990> John<00:01:55.920> Cena<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
Sheamus and win when John Cena and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
Sheamus and win when John Cena and
Ryback<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> picture<00:01:57.719> which

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
Ryback are out of the picture which

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.429 
Ryback are out of the picture which
would<00:01:58.860> make<00:01:59.040> perfect<00:01:59.460> sense<00:01:59.640> or<00:02:00.259> win<00:02:01.259> by

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
would make perfect sense or win by

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.310 
would make perfect sense or win by
disqualification<00:02:02.840> where<00:02:03.840> they<00:02:04.170> eventually

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
disqualification where they eventually

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.740 
disqualification where they eventually
go<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.860> weapons<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.520> think<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> best

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
go get weapons I think that's the best

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.639 
go get weapons I think that's the best
course<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.200> action<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.860> for<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:09.690> shield<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
course of action here for the shield to

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.559 
course of action here for the shield to

to<00:02:37.680> see<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.010> happen<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.640> sure<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.569> hell<00:02:39.810> hope

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
to see that happen I sure as hell hope

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.710 
to see that happen I sure as hell hope
it<00:02:40.319> doesn't<00:02:40.530> happen<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.510> finally<00:02:42.510> Dean

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720

Ambrose<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.380> finally<00:02:44.090> on<00:02:45.090> out<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.900> his<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.920> don't

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
Ambrose is finally on out of his I don't

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.920

glitch<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.470> now<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.700> think<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.150> best<00:02:51.300> way<00:02:51.480> for

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
glitch was now I think the best way for

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.530 
glitch was now I think the best way for
this<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.050> happen<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.709> have<00:02:53.540> somebody

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
this is to happen is to have somebody

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.570 
this is to happen is to have somebody
possibly<00:02:55.170> interfere<00:02:55.440> maybe<00:02:55.800> Ryback<00:02:56.310> comes

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
possibly interfere maybe Ryback comes

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.449 
possibly interfere maybe Ryback comes
out<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:56.910> Ryback<00:02:57.140> Goldberg<00:02:58.140> not<00:02:58.680> Goldberg<00:02:59.190> ma

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
out now Ryback Goldberg not Goldberg ma

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.770 
out now Ryback Goldberg not Goldberg ma
I<00:02:59.489> keep<00:02:59.730> thinking<00:02:59.970> Goldberg<00:03:00.330> right<00:03:00.600> bags

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
I keep thinking Goldberg right bags

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.380 
I keep thinking Goldberg right bags

along<00:03:21.030> those<00:03:21.090> lines<00:03:21.440> maybe<00:03:22.440> they<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.709> use<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
along those lines maybe they just use a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.160 
along those lines maybe they just use a
weapon<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.970> problem<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.720> being<00:03:24.989> one<00:03:25.140> of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
weapon the problem is this being one of

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.340 
weapon the problem is this being one of
the<00:03:25.320> big<00:03:25.500> main<00:03:25.769> events<00:03:26.190> sort<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.269> think<00:03:27.989> it

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
the big main events sort of I think it

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.110 
the big main events sort of I think it
needs<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.620> go<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.860> for<00:03:29.280> at<00:03:29.340> least<00:03:29.430> 15<00:03:29.910> minutes

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
needs to go on for at least 15 minutes

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.660 
needs to go on for at least 15 minutes
and<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:31.350> do<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.769> you're<00:03:31.980> gonna<00:03:32.130> need<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.519> make

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and to do that you're gonna need to make

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.949 
and to do that you're gonna need to make
it<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.060> know<00:03:33.150> pretty<00:03:33.390> creative<00:03:33.750> and

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
it you know pretty creative and

I love the new guys but in a straight-up
match<00:03:44.940> here<00:03:45.620> they<00:03:46.620> would<00:03:46.739> never<00:03:46.920> win

match here they would never win

Ryback<00:03:49.680> versus<00:03:50.370> Seth<00:03:50.940> Rollins<00:03:51.120> no<00:03:51.600> Dean

Ryback versus Seth Rollins no Dean
Ambrose<00:03:52.709> versus<00:03:53.010> Sheamus<00:03:53.250> maybe<00:03:53.760> maybe<00:03:54.480> Dean

Ambrose cuz I really like Dean Ambrose
but<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.820> think<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.720> honest<00:03:58.049> answer<00:03:58.230> here<00:03:58.620> is

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
but I think the honest answer here is

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.620 
but I think the honest answer here is
either<00:04:00.090> shield<00:04:00.600> wins<00:04:00.900> by<00:04:01.109> pin<00:04:01.140> extremists<00:04:02.040> or

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
either shield wins by pin extremists or

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.870 
either shield wins by pin extremists or
team<00:04:03.630> double<00:04:03.900> W<00:04:04.140> wins<00:04:04.320> by<00:04:04.470> DQ<00:04:04.859> either<00:04:05.070> way<00:04:05.340> if

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
team double W wins by DQ either way if

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.420 
team double W wins by DQ either way if
say<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:07.260> could<00:04:07.410> get<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> victory<00:04:07.980> on<00:04:08.100> Sheamus

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
say they could get a victory on Sheamus

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.330 
say they could get a victory on Sheamus
I<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:08.850> would<00:04:09.269> expect<00:04:09.810> John<00:04:10.680> Cena<00:04:11.070> no<00:04:11.190> matter

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
I I would expect John Cena no matter

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.250 
I I would expect John Cena no matter
what<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.820> end<00:04:11.970> up<00:04:12.090> looking<00:04:12.269> strong<00:04:12.780> at<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.109> end

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
what to end up looking strong at the end

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.259 
what to end up looking strong at the end
of<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.440> match<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:13.769> maybe<00:04:14.010> he<00:04:14.250> F<00:04:14.400> use<00:04:14.670> everybody

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
of the match so maybe he F use everybody

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.020 
of the match so maybe he F use everybody
or<00:04:15.769> he<00:04:16.769> does<00:04:16.979> something<00:04:17.370> because<00:04:17.519> he's<00:04:17.669> got<00:04:17.880> to

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.940 
or he does something because he's got to
be<00:04:18.090> on<00:04:18.120> his<00:04:18.329> feet<00:04:18.510> standing<00:04:19.019> pointing<00:04:19.769> at<00:04:19.859> the

pay-per-views got to look strong for the
rock<00:04:23.909> in<00:04:24.150> my<00:04:24.270> opinion<00:04:24.659> that's<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.960> only<00:04:25.260> way
