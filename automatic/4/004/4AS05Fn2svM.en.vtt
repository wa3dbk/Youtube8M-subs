00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 ever imagined a bird over 12 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720
 meters 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.400
 an overland animal of more than 18 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.880
 meters in length 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.609
 hum the website hype science is recently 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.980
 made a subject with the most 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
 terrifying that have already existed here in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 earth I've separated some that I prefer 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.640
 to call the mythical species that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.760
 lived here on earth 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.120
 good let's start by the sea the kingdoms 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.030
 health the targets are basically the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.890
 giant lizards living in the sea and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 they ate the sharks 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 well this does not scare yet and if I say 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.079
 for you guys that these commas in quotation marks 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.600
 dinosaurs that lived here in the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.610
 land was the size of a bus and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.860
 even buses that maybe you take pre 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 school work yes this bus that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.820
 you find on the street they had this 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.539
 size they will simply eat the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 sharks 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.699
 they basically swallowed the sharks 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.700
 without chewing they did not use the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.280
 teeth to eat that shark 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.250
 they could have liked to eat any 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.799
 kind of thing even ate the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.560
 plessiosaurs I think that's how it is 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.930
 pronounced as necessary 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.220
 basically the ness monster that the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.810
 people you know today is not a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 monster of ness was a species that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.960
 live here on earth 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.360
 these alves players is basically this 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.460
 type of monster and such 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.979
 I would like to eat these species now. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.200
 Do you imagine that kind of thing, my dear? 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.570
 God do you imagine a fight in your 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.509
 front of two species of this size 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.850
 face that we love ours that bizarre 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.680
 It would be and time at the same time if you 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.530
 do not die with this kind of thing but 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.720
 it would be time for the seas we go to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.299
 the skies to the sky 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.060
 a bird with more than 12 meters of 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.960
 lengths of the end of its 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.240
 your race 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.610
 basically one end to the other open 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.899
 with its wings spread reached 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.799
 basically 12 meters long 12 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.170
 meters 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.119
 he had more than four meters 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.129
 length and height 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.690
 scientists believe that because of the 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.690
 study they believe that 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.220
 the bird could walk on earth 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.410
 galloping like a horse using the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.190
 your feet, I think it's called 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.540
 bird's feet is one that to me 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.180
 I think it's part of the past and finally 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.070
 Renew with that on earth there is to be able 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.680
 take their victims because he does not 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.660
 be able to fly with them if he killed 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.220
 someone for example a dinosaur who 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.900
 was a little smaller than him he did not 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.060
 could fly because of his size 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.340
 which was very heavy and also of the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.140
 victim that he ended up killing then he 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.740
 he walked on the earth he carried 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.410
 Earth 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.840
 this victim galloping like a horse 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.990
 Can you have a notion he had? 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.180
 it is basically a height of 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.250
 a giraffe you've seen a giraffe 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.680
 near a zoo thing of the sort 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.510
 because then he had exactly that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.900
 size of giraffe neck there from the end 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.050
 even the giraffe's paw is the size of this 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.600
 bird in time 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.040
 now we're going through the earth we've already passed 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.620
 by the sea by the sky 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.320
 now it's the turn of the land 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.209
 called dael gift I think so 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.010
 pronounce in Portuguese 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.580
 it basically means what this 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.709
 name is literally destroying teeth 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.959
 By then you can already imagine what 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.170
 he did was he was the size of a 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.080
 rhino was half buffalo and half 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.150
 Leopard imagines that Ugly Critter was and 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.670
 he would kill everything he could 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.670
 find to eat so he is 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.070
 Bahia is basically an egg among 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.440
 of the pigs that we have today in 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.540
 day here on earth that are tiny 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.900
 compared to a bug of this size 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.280
 size of the old rhinoceros 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.550
 This crap should be scary. 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.340
 same but now we go with the last one and 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.310
 best of all in my opinion this 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.970
 here is the largest terrestrial predator that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.220
 earth has had even it appears naked 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.860
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.890
 in the cearÃ¡ xxi park one he calls himself 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.980
 spinosaurus had basically 18 meters 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.580
 about a little 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.220
 huh 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.610
 he loves you he had jaws and god 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.540
 a crocodile that when opened 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.990
 they reached more or less 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.840
 the five meters of open length 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.740
 imagine a mouth of that size 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.370
 eating face do not recreate jurassic park 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.470
 in real life the recline do not know if you want 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.540
 end humanity on your back 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.400
 he had a candle that looked like that of 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.530
 boats like you see in the picture 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.540
 in which it appears in a direct 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.490
 nowadays and would get 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.890
 it basically existed today. 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.690
 they recreated from max park he would 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.580
 able to eat an entire building 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.730
 to bury an entire building you imagine 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.340
 18 meters long in front of you 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.890
 Dude then I could not 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.230
 I can not imagine such a bug 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.590
 size type you see a movie all in one 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.230
 photo or something like that is something that ok 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.240
 beauty is one thing you really think 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.360
 Imagine you come close to one 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.180
 building looks up well see whoa 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.430
 there was life here on earth that kind of 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.210
 creature here on earth who had more 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.890
 less the size of a building is 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.320
 Bizarre old man I say building obviously 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.660
 there are much higher buildings but 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.590
 Definitely 18 meters long 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.990
 face is something very much is absurd of 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.810
 High now you imagine that one day here 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.190
 on earth had life so is it 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.290
 practically impossible to imagine 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.250
 one day imagine if this was not 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.680
 extinct 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.870
 Maybe we could live with that. 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.180
 kind of dinosaur might not even see 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.550
 why would not they let the being 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.430
 human race to survive and people 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.130
 would have to be there to turn 30 in order to 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.260
 to be able to stay alive in mei more or less 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.050
 juraci part of life steven spielberg 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.150
 be an absurd idea in what is the park 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.830
 of the dinosaurs and cursed 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.390
 Thank you for philippines. 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.460
 that burned like to sign up 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.410
 on the channel for the next videos I 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.570
 not attend to be drawn 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.000
 seaworld a lot of people correcting me video 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.890
 The word get out is the same 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.720

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.640
 tarso's name today I did not watch 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.020
 Attentive to this guy I basically think 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.510
 I 'm leaving tomorrow if I'm not mistaken. 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.490
 watching on Saturday I'm recording in 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.220

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.230
 Dude I want to watch this movie, I 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.360
 I can not in 3d

 what do i wear glasses watch in 3d for 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.990
 who wears glasses is practically 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.170
 impossible guy then have to watch 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.020

 I like you, thank you so much for 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.770
 all the support that you w 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.410
 was to think our life was a 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:07.660
 alternative reality created by extra 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:09.880
 existing land leaving behind just 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.140
 catching me thinking of something arrives 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.140
 a crazy theory
