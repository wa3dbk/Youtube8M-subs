century but it's been 21 years and I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.790 
century but it's been 21 years and I
believe<00:00:32.790> God<00:00:33.300> wants<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.870> more<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.350> I

believe God wants to do more and I

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.540 
believe God wants to do more and I
believe<00:00:35.010> there's<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> whole<00:00:35.399> generation

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550

believe there's a whole generation
arising<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> part<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
arising that was not a part of that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
arising that was not a part of that
particular<00:00:38.430> move<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.000> God<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.510> broke<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:39.960> in

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
particular move of God that broke out in

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
sin and God's righteousness and I need

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200 
sin and God's righteousness and I need
his<00:01:18.360> righteousness<00:01:18.840> that's<00:01:19.830> typical<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
his righteousness that's typical of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
his righteousness that's typical of
almost<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.720> revivals<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> past<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
almost all revivals in the past and I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.320 
almost all revivals in the past and I
think<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.340> typical<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> one

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
think it would be typical of the one

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
think it would be typical of the one
that's<00:01:24.540> coming<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.590> another<00:01:25.830> thing<00:01:25.950> is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
that's coming I think another thing is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.569 
that's coming I think another thing is
it'll<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.670> extremely<00:01:27.229> connected<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it'll be extremely connected to the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.890 
it'll be extremely connected to the
gifts<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> Holy<00:01:30.270> Spirit<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
gifts of the Holy Spirit and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.830 
gifts of the Holy Spirit and
particularly<00:01:31.740> God's<00:01:32.700> heart<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.329> healing<00:01:33.570> I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
particularly God's heart for healing I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
particularly God's heart for healing I
believe<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.799> coming<00:01:35.369> revival<00:01:35.909> will<00:01:36.000> be

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
believe that this coming revival will be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
believe that this coming revival will be
like<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.869> revival<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> mid<00:01:37.740> nineteen

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
like the the revival of the mid nineteen

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.060 
like the the revival of the mid nineteen
mid<00:01:38.520> 20th<00:01:38.880> century<00:01:39.079> that<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.290> focused<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.829> lot

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
mid 20th century that was focused a lot

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
mid 20th century that was focused a lot
on<00:01:41.280> healing<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.270> believe<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
on healing I believe that that will be a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.310 
on healing I believe that that will be a
part<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.280> believe<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
part of it I believe that it will be a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.530 
part of it I believe that it will be a
time<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> Welsh<00:01:47.880> revival<00:01:48.149> there

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
time like in the Welsh revival there

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
time like in the Welsh revival there
will<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.689> great<00:01:49.259> worship<00:01:49.619> happening<00:01:50.520> because

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
will be great worship happening because

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880 
will be great worship happening because
this<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.000> kind<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.329> characteristic<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> great

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
this is kind of characteristic of great

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.980 
this is kind of characteristic of great
revivals<00:01:53.369> many<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.820> them<00:01:53.939> were<00:01:54.360> characterized

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
revivals many of them were characterized

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.429 
revivals many of them were characterized
by<00:01:55.140> testimony<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.570> worship<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
by testimony and and worship like the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.490 
by testimony and and worship like the
Welsh<00:01:58.619> revival<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.369> I<00:02:00.000> believe<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:01.170> there's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
Welsh revival and I believe that there's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.170 
Welsh revival and I believe that there's
going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:03.270> returning<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.340> solid

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
going to be a a returning to a solid

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.930 
going to be a a returning to a solid
preaching<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> Bible<00:02:07.619> preaching<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
preaching of the Bible preaching of the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.369 
preaching of the Bible preaching of the
word<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.190> be

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
word and it's going to be

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.039 
word and it's going to be
restoring<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.189> doctrines<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.720> early

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
restoring to the doctrines of the early

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.270 
restoring to the doctrines of the early
church<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.610> doctrines<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.569> think

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
church and to the doctrines that I think

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.170 
church and to the doctrines that I think
are<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:21.060> some<00:02:21.420> ways<00:02:21.950> not<00:02:22.950> seen<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.640> important

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
are in some ways not seen as important

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.030 
are in some ways not seen as important
and<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.750> believe<00:02:24.989> God<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.379> going<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.709> restore

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and I believe God is going to restore

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.130 
and I believe God is going to restore
this<00:02:26.790> sense<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.329> we<00:02:27.480> got<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:27.810> line<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.110> with

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
this sense have we got to line up with

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.960 
this sense have we got to line up with
the<00:02:28.319> word<00:02:28.439> of<00:02:28.560> God<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.370> believe<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:29.879> going

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
the word of God so I believe it's going

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.020 
the word of God so I believe it's going
to<00:02:30.030> be<00:02:30.120> biblical<00:02:30.329> it's<00:02:30.840> going<00:02:31.109> to<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:32.030> preceded

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
to be biblical it's going to be preceded

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.809 
to be biblical it's going to be preceded
by<00:02:33.060> prayer<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:34.140> going<00:02:34.409> to<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.819> characterized

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
by prayer it's going to be characterized

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.270 
by prayer it's going to be characterized
by<00:02:35.970> worship<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.780> testimony<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.590> there<00:02:38.159> will

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
by worship and testimony and there will

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.220 
by worship and testimony and there will
be<00:02:38.310> power<00:02:38.849> there'll<00:02:39.359> be<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.480> lot<00:02:39.689> so<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.989> gifts

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
be power there'll be a lot so the gifts

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.319 
be power there'll be a lot so the gifts
the<00:02:40.319> Holy<00:02:40.470> Spirit<00:02:40.890> happening<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.579> they'll<00:02:42.090> be

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
the Holy Spirit happening and they'll be

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.300 
the Holy Spirit happening and they'll be
so<00:02:42.659> many<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> believe<00:02:43.170> it's<00:02:43.349> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
so many I believe it's going to be the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.940 
so many I believe it's going to be the
second<00:02:44.760> part<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.659> prophecy<00:02:46.290> given<00:02:46.319> in<00:02:46.829> a

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
second part of the prophecy given in a

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.759 
second part of the prophecy given in a
mid-80s<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.420> there<00:02:48.629> was<00:02:48.750> great<00:02:48.900> revival

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
mid-80s that there was great revival

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.190 
mid-80s that there was great revival
coming<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:51.120> would<00:02:51.269> be<00:02:51.389> in<00:02:51.480> two<00:02:51.720> waves<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
coming and it would be in two waves the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.289 
coming and it would be in two waves the
first<00:02:52.440> wave<00:02:52.650> would<00:02:52.859> be<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.549> church<00:02:53.940> for

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
first wave would be to the church for

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.000 
first wave would be to the church for
renewal<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.079> I<00:02:55.200> believe<00:02:55.409> that<00:02:55.440> happened<00:02:55.889> in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
renewal and I believe that happened in

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.589 
renewal and I believe that happened in
the<00:02:56.720> night<00:02:57.720> mid<00:02:58.079> 90s<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.680> into<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.099> early

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
the night mid 90s and into the early

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.050 
the night mid 90s and into the early
2000s<00:03:00.599> then<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.590> said<00:03:01.799> there'd<00:03:02.040> be<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> pause

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
2000s then it said there'd be a pause

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.539 
2000s then it said there'd be a pause
and<00:03:03.450> then<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.989> being<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.500> second<00:03:05.040> wave<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
and then to being the second wave of the

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.879 
and then to being the second wave of the
same<00:03:05.879> revival<00:03:06.629> would<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:07.079> be<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.439> much<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
same revival would not be so much to the

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.129 
same revival would not be so much to the
church<00:03:08.189> for<00:03:08.730> renewal<00:03:09.180> but<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.720> would<00:03:09.840> be<00:03:09.959> to

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
church for renewal but it would be to

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.509 
church for renewal but it would be to
the<00:03:10.260> streets<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:10.920> would<00:03:11.010> be<00:03:11.099> an<00:03:11.189> in

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
the streets and it would be an in

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.970 
the streets and it would be an in
gathering<00:03:12.359> or<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> harvest<00:03:13.079> of<00:03:13.230> lost<00:03:13.409> souls<00:03:13.650> I

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
gathering or a harvest of lost souls I

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.890 
gathering or a harvest of lost souls I
believe<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.849> we're<00:03:14.939> on<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.090> precipice<00:03:15.480> of

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
believe that we're on the precipice of

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.650 
believe that we're on the precipice of
that<00:03:16.319> wave<00:03:16.620> hitting<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.730> world<00:03:17.940> right<00:03:18.389> now

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
that wave hitting the world right now

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.539 
that wave hitting the world right now
that's<00:03:19.379> what<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.160> going<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.400> look

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
that's what I think it's going to look

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.420 
that's what I think it's going to look
like

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.699 

I<00:03:25.459> think<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.700> future<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.959> Bible<00:03:28.409> is<00:03:28.469> going

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
I think in the future the Bible is going

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.759 
I think in the future the Bible is going
to<00:03:28.799> bring<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.010> us<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.519> depth<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:30.090> passion<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.930> an

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
to bring to us a depth a passion a an

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.099 
to bring to us a depth a passion a an
extreme<00:03:32.370> level<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.939> joy<00:03:33.150> like<00:03:33.569> we've<00:03:33.930> never

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
extreme level of joy like we've never

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.559 
extreme level of joy like we've never
dreamed<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.620> before<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.370> we're<00:03:36.359> going<00:03:36.540> to

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
dreamed of before and we're going to

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.690 
dreamed of before and we're going to
have<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> love<00:03:37.140> for<00:03:37.170> righteousness<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:38.159> passion

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
have a love for righteousness a passion
