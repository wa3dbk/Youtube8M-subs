00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
Maxx I saw it for $15 but I only knew

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.109 
Maxx I saw it for $15 but I only knew
that<00:01:19.509> after<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.020> fact<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.340> let<00:01:21.880> me<00:01:22.030> go<00:01:23.020> around

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that after the fact so let me go around

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.760 
that after the fact so let me go around
here<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.590> can<00:01:26.800> see

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.350 

and<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.869> assembly<00:01:33.259> was<00:01:33.439> pretty<00:01:33.680> easy<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:35.210> is

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
and the assembly was pretty easy this is

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.800 
and the assembly was pretty easy this is
a<00:01:35.390> sticky<00:01:35.750> note<00:01:35.869> by<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.229> way<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:38.450> assembly

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
a sticky note by the way the assembly

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.179 
a sticky note by the way the assembly
was<00:01:38.930> pretty<00:01:39.200> easy<00:01:39.439> it's<00:01:39.740> really<00:01:39.979> just<00:01:42.189> two

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
was pretty easy it's really just two

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.859 
was pretty easy it's really just two
screws<00:01:43.640> on<00:01:43.820> each<00:01:43.939> side<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:44.420> you'll<00:01:44.600> need<00:01:44.810> a

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
screws on each side but you'll need a

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.820 
screws on each side but you'll need a
drill<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.880> actually<00:01:47.360> drill<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.840> holes<00:01:48.080> and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
drill to actually drill the holes and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.279 
drill to actually drill the holes and
then<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:50.000> put<00:01:50.479> in<00:01:50.659> one<00:01:51.289> of<00:01:51.409> those<00:01:51.850> plastic

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
then you put in one of those plastic

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.730 
then you put in one of those plastic
fasteners<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:56.479> hammer<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.500> hammer

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
fasteners and you hammer and you hammer

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.770 
fasteners and you hammer and you hammer
it<00:01:58.009> in<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.429> it<00:01:58.670> sticks<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.210> drywall

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
it in so that it sticks to the drywall

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.809 
it in so that it sticks to the drywall
but<00:02:00.649> basically<00:02:02.830> let<00:02:03.830> me<00:02:03.950> show<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.429> you<00:02:04.580> like

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
but basically let me show it to you like

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.249 
but basically let me show it to you like
this<00:02:05.060> again

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.350 

so<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.009> could<00:02:10.159> get<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.369> complete<00:02:10.849> picture<00:02:11.090> of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
so you could get a complete picture of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.809 
so you could get a complete picture of
just<00:02:11.840> how<00:02:12.080> wide<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:13.040> actually<00:02:13.549> is

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.979 

and<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:22.560> that's<00:02:22.860> it

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
and really that's it

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:40.000 
and really that's it
let<00:02:24.989> me<00:02:25.140> go<00:02:25.349> right<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.879> can<00:02:26.939> see

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:33.140 
hopefully you can tell or maybe not try
to<00:03:18.900> get<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> good<00:03:19.410> angle<00:03:24.350> alright<00:03:25.350> so

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.809 

okay<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:33.959> actually<00:03:34.080> hard<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.769> get<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.250> good

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
okay it's actually hard to get a good

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.839 
okay it's actually hard to get a good
angle<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.810> how<00:03:37.379> much<00:03:37.590> space<00:03:37.920> there<00:03:38.400> actually

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
angle of how much space there actually

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:46.430 
angle of how much space there actually
is<00:03:39.000> now<00:03:39.239> but<00:03:40.549> it's<00:03:41.549> quite<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.819> bit<00:03:41.909> so<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:45.510> would

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
is now but it's quite a bit so I would

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.569 
is now but it's quite a bit so I would

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.410 

pretty<00:03:53.579> pretty<00:03:54.060> worth<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.750> money

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420
