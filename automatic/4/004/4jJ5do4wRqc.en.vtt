this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.860> tooth<00:00:02.100> number<00:00:02.340> three<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.720> we're

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
this is tooth number three and we're

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.930 
this is tooth number three and we're
doing<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:05.060> zirconium<00:00:06.680> only<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:08.490> tooth<00:00:08.700> behind

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
doing a zirconium only the tooth behind

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.990 
doing a zirconium only the tooth behind
it<00:00:09.330> tooth<00:00:09.540> number<00:00:09.870> two<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.410> had<00:00:10.590> an<00:00:10.740> e<00:00:10.980> Max<00:00:11.250> or

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
it tooth number two is had an e Max or

lithium<00:00:12.360> die<00:00:12.599> silicon<00:00:13.049> omlie<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.160> difference

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
lithium die silicon omlie the difference

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.400 
lithium die silicon omlie the difference
is<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.299> don't<00:00:15.330> need<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.929> remove<00:00:16.230> as

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
is is that you don't need to remove as

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.109 
is is that you don't need to remove as
much<00:00:16.560> tooth<00:00:16.890> structure<00:00:17.430> with<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> zirconium

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
much tooth structure with a zirconium

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.029 
much tooth structure with a zirconium
and<00:00:18.770> that<00:00:19.770> they<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:20.279> very<00:00:20.310> retentive<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
and that they are very retentive and

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.740 
and that they are very retentive and
very<00:00:23.039> difficult<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:23.880> off<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> matter<00:00:24.600> of

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
very difficult to get off as a matter of

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.560 
very difficult to get off as a matter of
fact<00:00:25.519> therefore<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.789> don't<00:00:26.910> need<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.269> remove

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
fact therefore you don't need to remove

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.950 
fact therefore you don't need to remove
as<00:00:27.750> much<00:00:27.930> tooth<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:29.359> you're<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
as much tooth and you're just going to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.940 
as much tooth and you're just going to

interproximal area so that the onlay
will<00:00:42.390> touch<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.050> teeth<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.360> no

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
will touch the teeth and have no

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
will touch the teeth and have no
difficulty<00:00:46.020> seating<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.430> that

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
difficulty seating you can see that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.970 
difficulty seating you can see that
there's<00:00:47.789> some<00:00:47.969> incipient<00:00:48.660> decay<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.800> we're

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
there's some incipient decay that we're

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.029 
there's some incipient decay that we're
removing<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.050> crack<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
removing and you can see the crack that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
removing and you can see the crack that
was<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.850> lingual<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.570> went<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> way

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
was on the lingual that went all the way

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.130 
was on the lingual that went all the way
out<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> buckle<00:00:56.129> when<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.180> little

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
out to the buckle when that little

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.290 
out to the buckle when that little
filling<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.649> done<00:00:58.890> working<00:00:59.670> now<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
filling was done working now on the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.179 
filling was done working now on the
mesial<00:01:00.539> aspect<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.390> removing<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:04.189> contact

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
mesial aspect and removing the contact

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.870 
mesial aspect and removing the contact
area<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.840> complete<00:01:07.290> contact<00:01:08.040> will<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.580> in

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
area so the complete contact will be in

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.590 
area so the complete contact will be in
the<00:01:09.000> restoration<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.950> allow<00:01:11.250> us<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
the restoration that will allow us to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.170 
the restoration that will allow us to
seat<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> very<00:01:13.020> nicely<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
seat it very nicely and this is a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
seat it very nicely and this is a
disposable<00:01:15.960> diamond<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:18.290> allows<00:01:19.290> us<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
disposable diamond that allows us to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.550 
disposable diamond that allows us to
have<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> thickness<00:01:21.020> for<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
have a little bit of thickness for the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.069 
have a little bit of thickness for the
zirconium<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:27.770> just<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.340> light<00:01:30.240> chamfer

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
zirconium and just a very light chamfer

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:41.020 
zirconium and just a very light chamfer
on<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.500> buccal<00:01:31.860> area<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.570> continue<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
on the buccal area and we continue to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.270 
on the buccal area and we continue to
remove<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.780> interproximal<00:01:43.259> area<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.189> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
remove it the interproximal area and you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
remove it the interproximal area and you
can<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.820> both<00:01:45.000> areas<00:01:45.479> are<00:01:45.720> completely

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
can see that both areas are completely

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
can see that both areas are completely
done<00:01:46.490> there<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> nice<00:01:48.659> surface<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.549> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
done there is a nice surface so that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.010 
done there is a nice surface so that
there's<00:01:51.000> no<00:01:51.240> extra<00:01:52.310> areas<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.729> would<00:01:54.000> have

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.130 

hang<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.200> when<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.560> place<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.040> crown<00:01:59.250> and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
hang up when we place the crown and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.830 
hang up when we place the crown and
we'll<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.320> able<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:03.090> regular

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
we'll be able to do this with a regular

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.679 
we'll be able to do this with a regular
leading<00:02:04.439> cement<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.060> doesn't<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.659> be

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
leading cement and it doesn't need to be

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.650 
leading cement and it doesn't need to be
bonded<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:08.129> should<00:02:08.459> last<00:02:08.670> for<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> long<00:02:09.360> long

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
bonded it should last for a long long

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.839 
bonded it should last for a long long
time<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.440> can't<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:10.920> also<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> little<00:02:11.580> crack
