00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.850
 you have never stopped to think about changes 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.460
 you need the videogame saga of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.020
 pokemon are already many years that have 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.760
 passed since the first one came out and 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.230
 generations each 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.870
 the editions have been improving every time 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.060
 more today is we rpg 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.480
 three dimensions with more than 700 pokemon 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.020
 and with 18 elementary types or good 19 if 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.880
 you want to add this 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.470
 about a month ago I asked for twitter 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.060
 opinions means that the slope does not 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.560
 I'm not bad in fact I've compiled a 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.280
 couple of them for this video so 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.690
 let's go to it 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.940
 welcome to what they are in my opinion 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.040
 the changes that the saga of 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.450
 pokemon video games along with some 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.860
 others that although they are not so important 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.330
 and that can become very 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.330
 interesting forward 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.650
 and the one of lesser or greater importance as well 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.120
 that I would like to start with some 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.560
 simple and brief changes but that your 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.840
 once they were very requested among the 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.640
 fans I've decided to start with it 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.870
 possible to omit the capture tutorial 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.670
 that is presented in each of the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.290
 pokemon eggs specifically to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.970
 start of our adventure normally 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.800
 a relatively important character the 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.870
 plot does not usually explain how to capture 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.700
 pokemon which as is obvious think 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.170
 has all the sense of the world there 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.550
 keep in mind that anyone 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.050
 to debut as a coach in a 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.300
 determined game of the saga should 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.650
 know the basics and one of 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.990
 the fundamentals is knowing how to catch 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.640
 pokemon notwithstanding an option if one 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 when asked if you know how to do it 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.990
 wrong of course we would not come 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.720
 and be able to forget hidden machines and the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.130
 need a removes movements for 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.900
 who does not know these are characters 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.580
 introduced in the second generation 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.909
 present in all pokémon games 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.740
 from pokemon gold silver and crystal 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.090
 the hidden machines or m2 are objects 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.710
 that allow other pokemon to be made 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.450
 learn an essential movement 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.100
 to be able to advance in history since 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.900
 are necessary to reach new 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 places or overcome obstacles in the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.340
 I walk the problem of these movements 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.290
 is that you can not remove them from your 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.210
 pokemon manually the only way is 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.200
 with the help of the kit to movements that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.450
 It also stands at a point 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.920
 relatively far from the map to which 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.630
 usually you can only arrive at a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.700
 once we've got six or seven 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.649
 gym medals forcing us in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.330
 certain way to carry 5 pokemon plus one 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.610
 of slave to use m2 in our 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.380
 team there are people who see better 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.239
 simply carry different types of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.739
 objects that help us destroy rocks 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.739
 your portal trees like less 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.920
 that it is possible to see the points of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.200
 effort directly from the data of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.730
 our pokémon for those who do not know 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.530
 the effort points are 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.150
 statistics present and individually 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.580
 in each and every one of the pokemon 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.799
 existing stress points more 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.049
 known as that name from 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.519
 for values ​​in English indicate the effort 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.830
 invested in strengthening each of the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.599
 combat characteristics these 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.220
 characteristics are neither more nor less than 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.959
 the health points attack and defense 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.209
 physical attack and special defense and 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.829
 speed the effort points are 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.540
 one of the main data to have in 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.980
 account when training pokemon and 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.720
 that determine the level of each 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.519
 combat feature of the pokemon in 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.650
 comparison with the rest of individuals 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.359
 of the same species therefore they are 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.780
 indispensable for pokemon that we go 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.370
 to use in competition or similar 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.840
 but now well how do you get points 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.520
 of effort 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.470
 the answer is weakening pokemon 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.930
 enemies in combat whether they are wild or 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.890
 of coaches of the game itself 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.420
 depending on the kind of pokemon that 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.670
 we have won we will be awarded 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.319
 points of effort or others is to say yes 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.970
 we weaken for example I doubt a 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.739
 pokémon that stands out for its high defense 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.790
 Physics is awarded to all pokemon 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.250
 of our team that have participated 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.900
 in the fight against said youtube a 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.850
 amount of x of effort points that 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.280
 will increase the physical defense of our 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.319
 pokémon the maximum of uve is that you can 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.030
 to reach a pokemon is 510 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.890
 but these have to be divided 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.470
 between different pokemon statistics 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.970
 reaching a maximum of 252 in each 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.320
 and to know when we have arrived that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.150
 number we have to talk to different 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.739
 n fish of the game to give us 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.110
 clues or just tell us 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.069
 for this reason I see more cash that is 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.069
 possible to visualize them 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.410
 one of the most recurrent demands of 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.260
 the most veteran fans is the choice of 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.300
 difficulty before starting the game in 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.440
 pokemon xe and for example the introduction was 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.970
 possibility to change the language 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.530
 regardless of where it has been 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.930
 obtained the game but and a choice of 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.820
 difficulty the game would present two 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.980
 options the first one we would call it 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.720
 normal or standard and the second difficult 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.300
 simply with more levels pokemon 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.920
 tall and with a smarter daughter a 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.570
 black and white pokemon 2 thanks to the 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.160
 exo teselia function is allowed 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.260
 change the difficulty in a normal way to 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.820
 easy mode or challenge mode being this 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.440
 last the most complicated but only 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.240
 after beating the champion which 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.590
 it's not exactly what you want but 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.970
 Well I think this is one of the few 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.310
 changes that included in the video that 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.570
 have the probability of seeing the light 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.810
 I think there is someone who does not try this 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.810
 added 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.500
 place the main camera in third 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.420
 person is to say behind the character 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.640
 games like grand theft auto 'red dead 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.380
 redemption are clear examples from 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.030
 of the fifth generation in certain 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.830
 moments of the game the camera changes to 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.390
 third person for example when 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.880
 we went to the deck of the réal teselia 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.680
 while we travel in this but with the 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.480
 arrival of the sixth generation this is 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.250
 started to carry out much more and it's 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.480
 that now with the graph 3 of the camera 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.920
 in the third person, it is very convenient 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.430
 more than it seems in previous 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.900
 editions is something more of opinion and in 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.270
 reality surely everyone will stay 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.130
 constant camera changes but it's very 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.750
 possible that in the future when pokemon 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.610
 has been released on consoles like wii or 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.610
 this is how you see it 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.380
 as everyone knows the little more 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.860
 wild animals only appear in certain 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.210
 areas grass high caves sea la 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.130
 randomness is one of the factors 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.570
 key when looking for pokemon every 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.700
 one has its probability of 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.780
 appearance from species with percentages 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.780
 tiny until 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.970
 when playing dragon that is a very video game 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.139
 similar to pokemon you realize how 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.510
 the monsters manifest 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.250
 directly on the map, imagine something 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.780
 well in pokemon along with the option that 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.000
 we discussed before the camera in third 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.889
 single person with the images of dragon 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.600
 quest you can already get an idea of what 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.040
 I want to say yes I know it is 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.270
 quite impossible that this is over 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.919
 carrying out not to lose the 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.500
 tradition and in any case to not 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.449
 invite that game or something like that at the end 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.590
 and after all it's a very good idea me from 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.720
 Then I would agree to 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.460
 change it but the tradition said 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.750
 it began unquestionably to think they have it in 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.750
 an altar in every videogame saga 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.330
 the pokemon fights are the main 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.490
 transcendent motive why the saga 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.650
 it makes sense almost everything 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.879
 revolves around them knowing the 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.499
 Battle concept is one of the 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:31.289
 fundamental elements and we should know 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:33.569
 that these are done in shifts but and 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.069
 if the combats were in real time I 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.360
 I mean that everyone hits how and 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.860
 when do you want depending on your 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.689
 good skill in principle 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.370
 it would completely revolutionize the beta 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.779
 gain making him lose all the game that 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.059
 has actually so probably 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:47.279
 that do not run into that a game 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:49.439
 turns but thinking about what the game 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:50.990
 regards everything much faster frantic 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:53.490
 and more fun for the public 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.169
 maybe something more hybrid would fit a lot 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.729
 better able to choose between what types of 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.710
 combat if they want to play when looking for a 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.539
 online battle for example 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.039
 final fantasy among other changes a 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:04.110
 classic turn mode for something more 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:05.729
 varied in what the sector of 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.259
 video games is concerned this has been one 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.569
 of the biggest debates of the past 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.699
 years would somehow destroy this the 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.069
 Pokemon saga would make it more fun and 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.930
 entertaining for the players for me 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.639
 Of course, if you give me a choice between 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.860
 all the changes are incorporated before 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:21.270
 commented or only this last one would not hesitate 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.840
 in letting the mechanics of fighting 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.580
 turn he stayed 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.770
 this option is the most interesting and 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.460
 debatable has seemed to me now only 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.460
 is your criterion
