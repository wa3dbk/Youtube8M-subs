00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
what other people think to the problem

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.460 
what other people think to the problem
is<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.340> burst<00:00:43.120> fires<00:00:43.660> extremely<00:00:44.260> slowly

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
is that the burst fires extremely slowly

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.220 
is that the burst fires extremely slowly
and<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.800> time<00:00:45.040> between<00:00:45.280> bursts<00:00:45.910> is<00:00:46.240> really

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
and the time between bursts is really

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.110 
and the time between bursts is really
really<00:00:47.380> long<00:00:47.620> compared<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.580> you<00:00:48.790> know<00:00:48.820> other

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120

things in advanced warfare is I feel

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.640 
things in advanced warfare is I feel
like<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.529> lot<00:02:20.889> of<00:02:21.310> there's<00:02:21.849> no<00:02:22.150> gun<00:02:22.650> that's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
like a lot of there's no gun that's

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.710 
like a lot of there's no gun that's
really<00:02:24.639> really<00:02:24.939> well<00:02:25.209> okay

really really well okay
not<00:02:25.930> true<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.500> lot<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.040> guns<00:02:27.250> are

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
not true but a lot of the guns are

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.490 
not true but a lot of the guns are
actually<00:02:27.820> you<00:02:28.090> know<00:02:28.210> not<00:02:28.720> similar<00:02:29.260> but

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
actually you know not similar but

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
granted you will you know be it a little

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.560 
granted you will you know be it a little
bit<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.520> disadvantage<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.210> it's<00:02:52.390> not

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
bit of a disadvantage but it's not

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.990 
bit of a disadvantage but it's not
impossible<00:02:52.870> which<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.680> really<00:02:53.890> good<00:02:54.130> however

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
impossible which is really good however

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.760 
impossible which is really good however
one<00:02:55.480> thing<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:56.200> bad<00:02:56.530> about

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
one thing that is really bad about

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.710 
one thing that is really bad about
advanced<00:02:57.190> warfare<00:02:57.490> that<00:02:57.640> they<00:02:57.790> didn't<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.570> as

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
advanced warfare that they didn't do as

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.510 
advanced warfare that they didn't do as
well<00:02:58.750> as<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:59.050> think<00:02:59.230> they<00:02:59.320> could<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.800> the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
well as I think they could have is the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.300 
well as I think they could have is the
balance<00:03:00.970> between<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.540> gun<00:03:01.959> classes<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.160> by

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
balance between the gun classes and by

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.560 
balance between the gun classes and by
that<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.490> mean<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.820> know<00:03:03.910> assault<00:03:04.240> rifles

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
that I mean you know assault rifles

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.920 
that I mean you know assault rifles

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
verse SMG zor snipers so the assault

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.050 
verse SMG zor snipers so the assault
rifles<00:03:08.290> are<00:03:08.440> clearly<00:03:08.830> like<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.940> know

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060

best class of gun in advanced warfare

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.750 
best class of gun in advanced warfare
and<00:03:13.240> that's<00:03:14.050> not<00:03:14.620> that's<00:03:14.920> not<00:03:15.130> necessarily<00:03:15.670> a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
and that's not that's not necessarily a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.070 
and that's not that's not necessarily a
good<00:03:15.820> thing<00:03:15.880> typically<00:03:16.330> assault<00:03:16.660> rifles<00:03:16.930> are

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
good thing typically assault rifles are

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.900 
good thing typically assault rifles are
usually<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.410> best<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:17.860> not<00:03:18.130> really<00:03:18.459> by<00:03:18.670> this

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
usually the best but not really by this

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.940 
usually the best but not really by this
much<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.270> a<00:03:19.360> margin<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.870> mean<00:03:20.020> I<00:03:20.170> think<00:03:20.860> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
much of a margin I mean I think the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.590 
much of a margin I mean I think the
assault<00:03:21.160> rifles<00:03:21.430> are<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.730> best<00:03:21.940> by<00:03:22.120> far<00:03:22.150> you

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
assault rifles are the best by far you

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.270 
assault rifles are the best by far you
know<00:03:22.720> it's<00:03:22.990> it's<00:03:23.200> honestly<00:03:23.709> ridiculous<00:03:23.860> I

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
know it's it's honestly ridiculous I

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.690 
know it's it's honestly ridiculous I
mean<00:03:24.310> most<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.330> SMGs<00:03:25.870> are<00:03:26.050> really<00:03:26.500> bad<00:03:27.310> at

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
mean most of the SMGs are really bad at

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.190 
mean most of the SMGs are really bad at
what<00:03:28.240> they're<00:03:28.390> supposed<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.810> be<00:03:28.930> good<00:03:29.050> at

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
what they're supposed to be good at

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.500 
what they're supposed to be good at
which<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.680> know<00:03:29.709> close<00:03:30.070> range<00:03:30.430> high<00:03:31.239> fire

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
which is you know close range high fire

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.509 
which is you know close range high fire
rate<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:32.019> little<00:03:32.380> kind<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.769> low<00:03:32.860> damage<00:03:33.070> but<00:03:33.400> you

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
rate a little kind of low damage but you

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.890 
rate a little kind of low damage but you
should<00:03:33.670> be<00:03:33.760> able<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.060> overpower<00:03:34.390> an<00:03:34.660> assault

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
should be able to overpower an assault

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.680 
should be able to overpower an assault
rifle<00:03:34.930> at<00:03:35.170> close<00:03:35.350> range<00:03:35.880> however<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.390> can't

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
rifle at close range however you can't

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.390 
rifle at close range however you can't
because<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.230> damage<00:03:38.560> on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.769> SMGs<00:03:39.190> is

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
because the damage on the SMGs is

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.479 
because the damage on the SMGs is
absolutely<00:03:40.269> terrible<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:41.170> range<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:42.340> much

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
absolutely terrible the range is so much

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.070 
absolutely terrible the range is so much
so<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.700> even<00:03:42.850> at<00:03:43.150> close<00:03:43.300> range<00:03:43.690> you'll<00:03:43.870> find

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
so that even at close range you'll find

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.420 
so that even at close range you'll find
yourself<00:03:44.170> getting<00:03:44.500> more<00:03:44.769> hit<00:03:44.920> markers<00:03:45.250> with

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
yourself getting more hit markers with

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.770 
yourself getting more hit markers with
them<00:03:45.610> than<00:03:45.850> you<00:03:46.090> know<00:03:46.180> an<00:03:46.330> assault<00:03:46.750> rifle

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
them than you know an assault rifle

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.070 
them than you know an assault rifle
which<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.340> ridiculous<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.489> mean<00:03:48.640> it's<00:03:49.570> it's<00:03:49.900> on

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
which is ridiculous I mean it's it's on

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.050 
which is ridiculous I mean it's it's on
it's<00:03:50.290> really<00:03:50.470> bad<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:50.800> think<00:03:51.010> they<00:03:51.400> need<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.700> fix

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
it's really bad I think they need to fix

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.270 
it's really bad I think they need to fix
that<00:03:52.150> about<00:03:52.540> advanced<00:03:52.810> warfare<00:03:53.110> is<00:03:53.320> buff<00:03:54.100> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
that about advanced warfare is buff the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.880 
that about advanced warfare is buff the
SMGs<00:03:54.790> or<00:03:55.000> nerf<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.540> assault<00:03:55.930> rifles<00:03:56.290> I'd<00:03:56.650> say

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
SMGs or nerf the assault rifles I'd say

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.560 
SMGs or nerf the assault rifles I'd say
buff<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.250> SMGs<00:03:57.670> because<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.030> assault<00:03:58.299> rifles

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
buff the SMGs because the assault rifles

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.479 
buff the SMGs because the assault rifles
are<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.959> know<00:03:59.080> but<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.860> think<00:04:00.040> they're<00:04:00.160> good<00:04:00.370> as

are you know but I think they're good as

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.650 
are you know but I think they're good as
they<00:04:00.610> are<00:04:00.640> they're<00:04:00.970> just<00:04:01.090> way<00:04:01.269> better<00:04:01.450> than

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
they are they're just way better than

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.900 
they are they're just way better than
everything<00:04:01.870> else<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.290> mean<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:03.040> snipers<00:04:03.549> like
