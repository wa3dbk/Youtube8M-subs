00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
512k a JPEG file which will pull down

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.450 
512k a JPEG file which will pull down
here<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.650> second<00:01:23.900> as<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
here in a second as you can see this is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.649 
here in a second as you can see this is
a<00:01:26.490> little<00:01:26.729> difficult<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
a little difficult to do with the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.870 
a little difficult to do with the
controller<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> camera<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.759> can

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
controller in the camera but as you can

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.080 
controller in the camera but as you can
see<00:01:30.150> over<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:32.180> there<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.869> choose<00:01:34.409> file<00:01:35.090> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
see over here there is a choose file to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.780 
see over here there is a choose file to
upload<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.840> knock<00:01:37.530> 512k<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.640> was

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
upload to knock 512k so this was

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
upload to knock 512k so this was
something<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.270> interested<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.079> but

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
something I was really interested in but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.399 
something I was really interested in but
when<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> hit<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> says<00:01:42.150> data<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:43.020> supported

nature I would imagine Sony is going to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.679 
nature I would imagine Sony is going to
add<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> road<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.939> may<00:02:00.299> revisit

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
add this down the road so we may revisit

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.840 
add this down the road so we may revisit
this<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.409> another<00:02:01.680> video<00:02:02.009> maybe<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.520> year<00:02:02.670> from

man we're maybe along with the
PlayStation<00:03:14.580> Eye<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.240> new<00:03:15.360> camera<00:03:15.810> we<00:03:16.350> could

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
PlayStation Eye the new camera we could

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.530 
PlayStation Eye the new camera we could
possibly<00:03:17.010> even<00:03:17.130> create<00:03:17.490> some<00:03:17.670> content<00:03:17.820> and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
possibly even create some content and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.390 
possibly even create some content and
get<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.020> up<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.560> 512<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.190> could<00:03:20.310> be

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
get it up to the 512 that could be

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.730 
get it up to the 512 that could be
viewed<00:03:20.640> from<00:03:20.670> there<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.290> we'll<00:03:22.290> see<00:03:22.440> how<00:03:22.620> this

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
viewed from there so we'll see how this

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.470 
viewed from there so we'll see how this
progresses<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.580> we<00:03:23.820> may<00:03:23.940> come<00:03:24.120> back<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.390> this

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
progresses and we may come back to this

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.870 
progresses and we may come back to this
one<00:03:24.630> but<00:03:24.690> for<00:03:24.960> now<00:03:25.400> just<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.610> everything
