00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.669 
on the side and the ubisoft logo i'm
assuming<00:01:29.329> that<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.689> game<00:01:29.899> hasn't<00:01:30.289> been<00:01:30.469> rated

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
assuming that the game hasn't been rated

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.609 
assuming that the game hasn't been rated
yet<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.249> when<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.819> finally<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.299> i<00:01:32.590> have<00:01:33.590> a

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
yet and when it finally is i have a

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.289 
yet and when it finally is i have a
really<00:01:33.979> good<00:01:34.310> suspicion<00:01:34.819> that<00:01:34.999> it's<00:01:35.179> probably

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
really good suspicion that it's probably

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.300 
really good suspicion that it's probably
going<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:35.600> be<00:01:35.659> an<00:01:35.780> R<00:01:35.959> rating<00:01:36.409> considering<00:01:37.189> all

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310
