00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.890
 if you were worried that the version of mass effect 2 on playstation 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.579
 3 was the shortest or with least extensive and calm details 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.640
 since the playstation 3 disc has all the downloadable content 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.410
 Playstation 3 will offer the most complete version of the game to date today 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.740
 the engine has been revised in order to use the technology of the 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.000
 playstation 3 so if you look closely you can notice that blacks are 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.310
 they see more black and sharper textures but you probably think 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.070
 that looks strong and bright 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.500
 by putting the two versions side by side it shows that the ps3 scenes looks 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.680
 best 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.670
 to compensate for the fact that ps3 users will not be able to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.590
 experience the first game of the microsoft series owns the rights of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.100
 bioware publication has creative 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.700
 interspersed between the opening scene of the game and the screen of 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 character customization is an interactive comic book background story 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980
 what this means is our 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.020
 the shepherd tells the story of the first most effective against a backdrop of 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.670
 the images provided by boats 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.770
 the work of art is clean and beautiful but do not expect the characters to 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.259
 they look nothing like their comic counterparts especially w rex ​​whose 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.920
 face seems more crushed than usual 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.430
 during intoxications history of approximately 15 minutes duration 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.050
 will have to make some key decisions that come into play in the second 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.410
 part and end 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.680
 who lives 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.850
 who dies 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.840
 who do you want to connect with 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.070
 these are important questions that only you can answer 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.300
 in general the comic section is well done but overlooked 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.390
 some parts of the story that spend a considerable amount of time in 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.280
 the original game as the corian an old plant with powers of control 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.880
 mentally as well as someone who played the first game eight times is 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.259
 hard not to feel that this comic is an easy button 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:28.509
 after all it is always guaranteed that the ability to separate speech was 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:33.109
 loud enough to talk wrc below sucre to emotional tout 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:33.859
 inevitable 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.229
 but another person can do the same without the effort 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:41.249
 that something that should have been considered for the xbox version and should 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.859
 be included in mass effect 3 to help people who have not played 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.479
 the previous titles in terms of game mass effect 2 works like the 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.480
 most of his verses ds3 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.060
 you attach and shoot with it one and r1 and koné m 2 and r2 you can go to your 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.430
 arsenal and biotic technology options there are also some 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.050
 differences that most people will not realize is that piracy 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.569
 Minigames have been simplified 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.889
 during the main missions with a sense of urgency like the tutorial 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.179
 introductory and mini-games to open safes or terminals have been 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.659
 eliminated but they are still intact in the most leisurely area 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.769
 more effects was 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.979
 two of the best games in 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:26.479
 so it's a welcome addition to the great ps3 library but there's no 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.649
 forget that mass effect 3 will be released on playstation 3 at the same time as xbox 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.609
 360
