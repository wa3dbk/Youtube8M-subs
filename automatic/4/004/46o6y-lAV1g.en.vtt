00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.420 
so how do we diagnose if our horse has
got<00:04:45.969> ulcers<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:47.259> clinical<00:04:47.680> signs<00:04:47.919> as<00:04:48.189> we've

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
got ulcers the clinical signs as we've

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.879 
got ulcers the clinical signs as we've
seen<00:04:48.669> can<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.330> suggestive<00:04:49.990> of<00:04:50.080> ulcers<00:04:50.530> but<00:04:50.770> are

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
seen can be suggestive of ulcers but are

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.879 
seen can be suggestive of ulcers but are
not<00:04:51.069> specific<00:04:52.139> response<00:04:53.139> to<00:04:53.319> treatment<00:04:53.800> is

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
not specific response to treatment is

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.980 
not specific response to treatment is
useful<00:04:54.310> if<00:04:54.550> we<00:04:54.610> treat<00:04:54.969> them<00:04:55.120> with<00:04:55.599> ulcer

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
useful if we treat them with ulcer

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.140 
useful if we treat them with ulcer
treatment<00:04:56.439> and<00:04:56.560> they<00:04:57.069> respond<00:04:57.550> maybe<00:04:57.909> they

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
treatment and they respond maybe they

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.749 
treatment and they respond maybe they
had<00:04:58.330> ulcers<00:04:58.860> laboratory<00:04:59.860> tests<00:05:00.189> may<00:05:00.370> reveal

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
had ulcers laboratory tests may reveal

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.969 
had ulcers laboratory tests may reveal
occasionally<00:05:01.389> a<00:05:01.419> mild<00:05:01.719> anemia<00:05:02.199> but<00:05:02.770> that

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
occasionally a mild anemia but that

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.409 
occasionally a mild anemia but that
could<00:05:03.219> be<00:05:03.310> associated<00:05:03.580> with<00:05:03.969> any<00:05:04.240> other

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
could be associated with any other

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.350 
could be associated with any other
condition<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:05.110> definitive<00:05:05.919> diagnosis<00:05:06.879> is<00:05:07.120> made

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
condition a definitive diagnosis is made

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.200 
condition a definitive diagnosis is made
by<00:05:07.689> gastroscopy<00:05:08.439> here<00:05:09.340> we<00:05:09.460> use<00:05:09.639> a<00:05:09.669> gastro

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
by gastroscopy here we use a gastro

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.080 
by gastroscopy here we use a gastro
scope<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.780> three<00:05:11.439> metre<00:05:11.650> long<00:05:11.919> tube<00:05:12.639> that<00:05:12.669> has

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
scope a three metre long tube that has

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.879 
scope a three metre long tube that has
passed<00:05:13.330> through<00:05:13.539> the<00:05:13.719> nose<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:14.319> down<00:05:14.680> into

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
passed through the nose and down into

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.269 
passed through the nose and down into
the<00:05:14.979> stomach<00:05:16.169> similar<00:05:17.169> to<00:05:17.289> this<00:05:17.439> where<00:05:17.949> we<00:05:18.099> can

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:18.279 
the stomach similar to this where we can

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.339 
the stomach similar to this where we can
visualize<00:05:18.759> what<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.449> happening<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:20.110> the

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
visualize what is happening in the

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.360 
visualize what is happening in the
stomach

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.629 

so<00:05:24.270> how<00:05:24.419> do<00:05:24.480> we<00:05:24.660> treat<00:05:24.900> ulcers<00:05:25.110> at<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.250> moment

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
so how do we treat ulcers at the moment

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.670 
so how do we treat ulcers at the moment
the<00:05:26.910> gold<00:05:27.360> standard<00:05:27.840> in<00:05:27.990> treatment<00:05:28.440> is<00:05:28.650> a

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
the gold standard in treatment is a

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.220 
the gold standard in treatment is a
product<00:05:29.100> called<00:05:29.160> omeprazole<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.199> a

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
product called omeprazole this is a

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.860 
product called omeprazole this is a
proton<00:05:31.680> pump<00:05:32.010> inhibitor<00:05:32.550> that<00:05:33.090> heals<00:05:33.360> ulcers

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
proton pump inhibitor that heals ulcers

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.140 
proton pump inhibitor that heals ulcers
as<00:05:34.020> well<00:05:34.050> as<00:05:34.380> preventing<00:05:34.860> them<00:05:35.010> in<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:35.910> past

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
as well as preventing them in the past

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.409 
as well as preventing them in the past
most<00:05:36.600> of<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.960> drugs<00:05:37.260> were<00:05:37.830> able<00:05:38.220> to<00:05:38.419> prevent

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
most of the drugs were able to prevent

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.659 
most of the drugs were able to prevent
them<00:05:39.690> but<00:05:39.990> they<00:05:40.110> didn't<00:05:40.410> heal<00:05:40.590> them<00:05:40.770> it<00:05:41.490> is

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
them but they didn't heal them it is

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.969 
them but they didn't heal them it is
given<00:05:41.940> once<00:05:42.120> daily<00:05:42.449> and<00:05:42.840> is<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.530> treatment<00:05:43.949> of

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
given once daily and is the treatment of

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.390 
given once daily and is the treatment of
choice<00:05:44.220> for<00:05:44.280> most<00:05:44.699> veterinarians

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.879 

so<00:05:49.210> what<00:05:49.360> can<00:05:49.540> we<00:05:49.600> do<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:50.080> try<00:05:50.290> and<00:05:50.320> prevent<00:05:50.710> the

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
so what can we do to try and prevent the

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.640 
so what can we do to try and prevent the
horse<00:05:51.070> getting<00:05:51.400> ulcers<00:05:52.080> firstly<00:05:53.080> avoid<00:05:53.380> long

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
horse getting ulcers firstly avoid long

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.680 
horse getting ulcers firstly avoid long
periods<00:05:54.100> without<00:05:54.280> food<00:05:54.490> so<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.449> empty

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
periods without food so the empty

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.570 
periods without food so the empty
stomach<00:05:56.139> is<00:05:56.260> not<00:05:56.440> exposed<00:05:56.889> to<00:05:56.979> high<00:05:57.160> levels<00:05:57.520> of

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
stomach is not exposed to high levels of

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.439 
stomach is not exposed to high levels of
acid<00:05:58.080> feed<00:05:59.080> frequent<00:05:59.560> small<00:05:59.830> meals<00:06:00.419> feed<00:06:01.419> a

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
acid feed frequent small meals feed a

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.219 
acid feed frequent small meals feed a
bleep<00:06:01.840> hey<00:06:02.050> if<00:06:02.889> the<00:06:03.250> feed<00:06:03.460> is<00:06:03.610> withheld<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.930> pH

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
bleep hey if the feed is withheld the pH

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.409 
bleep hey if the feed is withheld the pH
in<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.470> stomach<00:06:05.590> drops<00:06:06.160> to<00:06:06.430> 2<00:06:06.639> in<00:06:06.910> 21<00:06:07.389> hours

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
in the stomach drops to 2 in 21 hours

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.730 
in the stomach drops to 2 in 21 hours
and<00:06:07.990> this<00:06:08.889> causes<00:06:09.190> ulcers<00:06:09.699> I<00:06:10.380> like<00:06:11.380> to<00:06:11.530> place

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
and this causes ulcers I like to place

for this is he has continual grazing and

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.980 
for this is he has continual grazing and
always<00:06:48.669> has<00:06:48.970> something<00:06:49.240> in<00:06:49.479> his<00:06:49.600> stomach

you can still exercise a horse with
