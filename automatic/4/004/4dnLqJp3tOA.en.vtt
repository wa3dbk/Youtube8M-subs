little bit of a tap and then you're

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.549 
little bit of a tap and then you're
ready<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> go<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> use<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:37.050> side<00:00:37.260> for

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
ready to go you can use one side for

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.920 
ready to go you can use one side for
each<00:00:37.680> eye<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.790> with<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> press

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
each eye so with this you want to press

each eye so with this you want to press
and<00:00:40.200> roll<00:00:40.590> onto<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.309> eyelid<00:00:43.100> go<00:00:44.100> ahead<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and roll onto the eyelid go ahead and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
and roll onto the eyelid go ahead and
soften<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.120> go<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.270> towards<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
soften it as you go up towards the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
soften it as you go up towards the
crease<00:00:46.170> contour<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> want<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> place<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
crease contour so you want to place the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.520 
crease contour so you want to place the
product<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.289> start

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
product down and then you can start

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.410 
product down and then you can start
blending<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.039> through

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.329 

the<00:00:53.420> idea<00:00:53.719> with<00:00:53.929> these<00:00:54.109> is<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.499> just<00:00:54.710> do<00:00:54.890> one

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
the idea with these is to just do one

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.090 
the idea with these is to just do one
sweep<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.239> it's<00:00:56.359> not<00:00:56.510> about<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:57.170> lot<00:00:57.620> of<00:00:57.769> crease

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
sweep so it's not about a lot of crease

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.430 
sweep so it's not about a lot of crease
work<00:00:58.429> it's<00:00:59.149> just<00:00:59.210> about<00:00:59.539> putting<00:00:59.839> one<00:01:00.170> color

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
work it's just about putting one color

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.680 
work it's just about putting one color
all<00:01:00.739> over<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:01.309> can<00:01:01.640> use<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.030> brush<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:02.659> apply

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
all over you can use a brush to apply

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.689 
all over you can use a brush to apply
the<00:01:03.019> deeper<00:01:03.440> colors<00:01:03.799> into<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.159> crease<00:01:04.430> that's

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
the deeper colors into the crease that's

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.999 
the deeper colors into the crease that's
fine<00:01:04.970> see<00:01:05.930> how<00:01:06.140> pretty<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.439> is<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:06.920> that's

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
fine see how pretty that is and that's

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.279 
fine see how pretty that is and that's
just<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.280> nice<00:01:07.490> soft<00:01:07.790> gold<00:01:08.149> tone<00:01:08.450> what<00:01:09.200> I'm
