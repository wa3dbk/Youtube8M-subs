00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello I am of creations that varies and today 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.980
 you teach to make an envelope 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:20.710
 braid or cross 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.520
 materials pencil scissors compass rule and 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.550
 cardboard or fa 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.940
 now I'm going to teach you to do the heart 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.880
 braided with our molds 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.880
 first we fold a leaf in half 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.790
 we keep our speech sheet closed 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:47.629
 and we measure with the 9 centimeter rule 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.320
 long and 9 centimeters wide the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.770
 we mark in half that is guided in the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:00.940
 rule by 4.5 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:03.490
 and in that we put the compass 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 and we do it one 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.780
 a half circle 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.910
 if you did not have a compass you can grab 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.500
 a cup and grab its outline for 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.500
 do in half a circle 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.410
 after having done this we are going to 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.300
 measure every inch and a half to make 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.300
 the lines that would be 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.080
 one and a half three 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:49.790
 in four and a half the 6 and the 7 and see me 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.790
 we also measure it below 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.630
 and after having it half for both 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.200
 sides we are going to join the points to make 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.200
 the lines 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.319
 then we cut the whole figure and 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.379
 we started to cut out each of the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.370
 we cut lines from start 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:22.129
 here through the line drawn on 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.129
 passing it by one or two millimeters 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.010
 A) Yes 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.670
 and so you would have to set the bucket 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.239
 take out another one like these to save 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.239
 the heart 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.710
 Now I 'm going to teach you how to interweave 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.370
 the heart 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.510
 it's simple first take one of your 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.100
 parts 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.730
 speak in the front line and talk 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.500
 then to the mine others also take their 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.500
 first line foundation 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.420
 and that's how it has to be 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.690
 now with this we just put him 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.690
 we open 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.440
 and we put the second 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.510
 if you have to go intertwining 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.510
 below and also above 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.940
 now what we see more this if it is not 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.260
 and so we continue to complete the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.019
 first line 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.400
 so we have our first 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:11.010
 row now we go for the second well 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.739
 with the first row we put it through 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.010
 under the second one we are going to put the 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.850
 up that is taking the first you 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.230
 expected we opened it 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.230
 we put this 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.110
 we have to see that here it is 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.110
 below and this aggravates above 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.879
 and now 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.879
 instead of being above the bbva 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.400
 so you can already see them intertwined and so on 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.600
 they are following each of the lines 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.700
 and varying 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.220
 if one goes over the other one will go by 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.620
 below and so 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.370
 and that's how our list is 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.120
 I already plaited card to decorate it 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.380
 I put two hearts in fort and I put him 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.320
 very bright 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:25.200
 this is an envelope so you can put it 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:29.280
 you want a chocolate 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.620
 and a card like this that is the 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.310
 three-dimensional can be found in 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.310
 our channel 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.610
 and that's how it's ready 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.610
