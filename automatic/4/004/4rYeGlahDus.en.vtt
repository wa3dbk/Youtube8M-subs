00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that of course but you know 3300 pounds

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979 
that of course but you know 3300 pounds
for<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> car<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> v8<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.300> ton<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> safety

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
for a car with a v8 with a ton of safety

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.959 
for a car with a v8 with a ton of safety
features<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.649> that's<00:00:41.219> really<00:00:41.520> comfortable

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
features with that's really comfortable

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.790 
features with that's really comfortable
you<00:00:42.149> know<00:00:42.239> power<00:00:42.660> adjusted<00:00:43.200> seats<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you know power adjusted seats all that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.010 
you know power adjusted seats all that
good<00:00:43.980> stuff<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.460> would<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.180> call<00:00:45.390> heavy<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.899> all

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
good stuff I would not call heavy at all

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.420 
good stuff I would not call heavy at all
so<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> definitely<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
so I definitely don't think that the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.250 
so I definitely don't think that the
Corvette<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.420> classified<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> heavy

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
Corvette can be classified as a heavy

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
Corvette can be classified as a heavy
car<00:00:49.530> especially<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.100> some<00:00:50.309> sports<00:00:50.579> cars

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
car especially when some sports cars

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.040 
car especially when some sports cars
these<00:00:50.910> days<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.270> getting<00:00:51.480> well<00:00:51.660> into<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
these days are getting well into the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.799 
these days are getting well into the
upper<00:00:52.649> 3000<00:00:53.370> 4000<00:00:54.030> pound<00:00:54.210> range<00:00:54.449> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
upper 3000 4000 pound range so

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
upper 3000 4000 pound range so
definitely<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.829> heavy<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.670> on

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
definitely not heavy and then going on

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.279 
definitely not heavy and then going on
with<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.030> same<00:00:57.270> thing<00:00:57.480> some<00:00:57.719> people<00:00:57.989> say<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
with that same thing some people say the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.990 
with that same thing some people say the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
burbling along I've known plenty of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.090 
burbling along I've known plenty of
people<00:01:17.670> who<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.270> 27<00:01:18.750> 28<00:01:19.200> close<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.830> 30

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
people who get like 27 28 close to 30

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399 
people who get like 27 28 close to 30
miles<00:01:20.460> per<00:01:20.549> gallon<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:20.939> those<00:01:21.090> cars<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:22.320> know

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
miles per gallon in those cars you know

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.690 
miles per gallon in those cars you know
because<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.220> light<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
because they are pretty light and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280 
because they are pretty light and
they're<00:01:23.939> aerodynamic<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.840> doesn't<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
they're aerodynamic so it doesn't take a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.929 
they're aerodynamic so it doesn't take a
whole<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.680> power<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> keep<00:01:26.400> them<00:01:26.700> moving

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
whole lot of power to keep them moving

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.630 
whole lot of power to keep them moving
so<00:01:27.720> yeah<00:01:28.140> definitely<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.369> pretty<00:01:29.520> good

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
so yeah definitely they get pretty good

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.219 
so yeah definitely they get pretty good
gas<00:01:29.880> mileage<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.329> well<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> type<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.110> car

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
gas mileage as well for the type of car

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
gas mileage as well for the type of car
that<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.979> drive<00:01:32.250> reasonably<00:01:33.060> so

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that they are if you drive reasonably so

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.840 
that they are if you drive reasonably so
that's<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> keyword<00:01:33.840> driving<00:01:34.380> reasonably

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
that's the keyword driving reasonably

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.100 
that's the keyword driving reasonably
but<00:01:35.850> another<00:01:36.119> thing<00:01:36.329> though<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> tough

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
but another thing though this is a tough

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
but another thing though this is a tough
one<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> toughest<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.159> kind<00:01:38.640> of

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
one this was the toughest one kind of

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
one this was the toughest one kind of
for<00:01:38.939> me<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.119> address<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
for me to address and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.990 
for me to address and
is<00:01:40.440> that<00:01:40.710> people<00:01:41.220> say<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> Corvette<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is that people say the Corvette is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.780 
is that people say the Corvette is
poorly<00:01:42.750> built<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.770> would<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.640> are

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
poorly built and I would not there are

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
poorly built and I would not there are
definitely<00:01:45.210> some<00:01:45.390> years<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> Corvette

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
definitely some years but the Corvette

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
definitely some years but the Corvette
was<00:01:46.230> poorly<00:01:46.470> built<00:01:46.710> don't<00:01:47.010> get<00:01:47.100> me<00:01:47.190> wrong<00:01:47.220> but

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
was poorly built don't get me wrong but

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.480 
was poorly built don't get me wrong but
I<00:01:47.910> would<00:01:48.270> say<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.480> more<00:01:48.840> often<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.890> cheaply

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
I would say that more often it's cheaply

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
I would say that more often it's cheaply
built<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.120> so<00:01:51.300> than<00:01:51.480> poorly<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.080> what<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> mean

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
built or so than poorly and what I mean

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
built or so than poorly and what I mean
by<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.650> you<00:01:52.800> take<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> c5<00:01:53.400> Corvette<00:01:53.640> for

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
by that you take the c5 Corvette for

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480 
by that you take the c5 Corvette for
example<00:01:54.480> there<00:01:55.170> are<00:01:55.310> thousands<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.370> them

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
example there are thousands of them

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
example there are thousands of them
running<00:01:56.700> around<00:01:56.880> still<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.330> his<00:01:57.450> day<00:01:57.600> people

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
running around still of his day people

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.930 
running around still of his day people
use<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.440> track<00:01:58.770> cars<00:01:59.100> people<00:01:59.370> mod<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
use them as track cars people mod the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.640 
use them as track cars people mod the
crap<00:02:00.330> out<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.990> beat<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> crap<00:02:01.470> out

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
crap out of them and beat the crap out

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.469 
crap out of them and beat the crap out
of<00:02:01.680> them<00:02:01.920> outlast<00:02:02.520> engines<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.240> most

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
of them outlast engines are the most

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.210 
of them outlast engines are the most
swapped<00:02:03.840> engine<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> reason<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.010> it's

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
swapped engine for a reason because it's

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.710 
swapped engine for a reason because it's
a<00:02:05.280> great<00:02:05.490> power<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:06.120> Corvettes

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
a great power not that that's Corvettes

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.870 
a great power not that that's Corvettes
specifically<00:02:07.260> but<00:02:07.440> it's<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.100> great<00:02:08.250> powertrain

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
specifically but it's a great powertrain

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.450 
specifically but it's a great powertrain
and<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.530> are<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.740> tons<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.370> them

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
and you know there are just tons of them

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.650 
and you know there are just tons of them
driving<00:02:11.670> around<00:02:11.850> people<00:02:12.150> using<00:02:12.390> his<00:02:12.480> track

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
driving around people using his track

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.000 
driving around people using his track
cars<00:02:12.930> again<00:02:13.140> they<00:02:13.260> beat<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> crap<00:02:13.800> out<00:02:13.980> of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
cars again they beat the crap out of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.710 
cars again they beat the crap out of
them<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.340> they<00:02:14.400> last<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.090> there's<00:02:15.240> plenty<00:02:15.690> of

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
them and they last and there's plenty of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.840 
them and they last and there's plenty of
Corvettes<00:02:16.530> driving<00:02:16.920> around<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.250> well<00:02:17.550> over

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
Corvettes driving around with well over

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.190 
Corvettes driving around with well over
a<00:02:17.880> hundred<00:02:18.000> thousand<00:02:18.510> miles<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:18.870> them<00:02:19.080> with

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
a hundred thousand miles on them with

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.890 
a hundred thousand miles on them with
very<00:02:19.410> little<00:02:19.650> problems<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.370> but<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.390> interior

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
very little problems so but the interior

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.210 
very little problems so but the interior
was<00:02:22.080> really<00:02:22.380> cheap<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:22.950> were<00:02:23.040> some

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
was really cheap and there were some

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.530 
was really cheap and there were some
things<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.459> were<00:02:23.610> cheap<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.060> would<00:02:24.330> say

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
things that were cheap so I would say

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.510 
things that were cheap so I would say
that<00:02:24.570> more<00:02:25.260> often<00:02:25.470> than<00:02:25.800> not<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.130> Corvette<00:02:26.490> is

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that more often than not the Corvette is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.850 
that more often than not the Corvette is
just<00:02:26.820> cheaply<00:02:27.209> made<00:02:27.660> rather<00:02:28.290> than<00:02:28.530> poorly

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
just cheaply made rather than poorly

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.190 
just cheaply made rather than poorly
made<00:02:29.160> if<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.430> makes<00:02:29.610> any<00:02:29.730> sense<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
made if that makes any sense and the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170 
made if that makes any sense and the
number<00:02:31.470> four<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> lot<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.640> times<00:02:32.790> people<00:02:33.090> say

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
number four is a lot of times people say

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.210 
number four is a lot of times people say
the<00:02:33.300> Corvette<00:02:33.600> has<00:02:33.810> terrible<00:02:34.290> resale<00:02:34.770> value

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220

look at a clean c5 even in early or Saar

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.140 
look at a clean c5 even in early or Saar
c6<00:03:29.989> in<00:03:30.170> 2005<00:03:30.920> you're<00:03:31.670> still<00:03:31.910> going<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.060> pay

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
c6 in 2005 you're still going to pay

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.550 
c6 in 2005 you're still going to pay
upwards<00:03:32.569> of<00:03:32.900> twenty<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.290> twenty<00:03:33.530> five

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
upwards of twenty to twenty five

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.020 
upwards of twenty to twenty five
thousand<00:03:34.129> and<00:03:34.220> then<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.400> course<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.700> goes<00:03:34.819> on

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
thousand and then of course it goes on

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.940 
thousand and then of course it goes on
from<00:03:35.180> there<00:03:35.450> but<00:03:35.629> I<00:03:36.410> would<00:03:36.650> say<00:03:36.799> they

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
from there but I would say they

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.410 
from there but I would say they
definitely<00:03:37.340> hold<00:03:37.519> their<00:03:37.640> value<00:03:37.670> pretty<00:03:38.150> well

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
definitely hold their value pretty well

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.690

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
and you know if you keep them clean and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.860 
and you know if you keep them clean and
keep<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:40.970> miles<00:03:41.180> off<00:03:41.390> of<00:03:41.599> them

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
keep the miles off of them

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.630 
keep the miles off of them
you<00:03:42.110> really<00:03:42.349> don't<00:03:42.440> depreciate<00:03:42.769> that<00:03:43.159> fast<00:03:43.400> I

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
you really don't depreciate that fast I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.979 
you really don't depreciate that fast I
mean<00:03:43.790> they<00:03:43.909> they<00:03:43.940> oh<00:03:44.120> they<00:03:44.209> definitely<00:03:44.540> hold

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
their value over some years again just

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.920 
their value over some years again just
one<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.209> those<00:03:47.269> things<00:03:47.510> where<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.720> kind<00:03:47.870> of

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
one of those things where it kind of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.809 
one of those things where it kind of
depends<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:48.349> what<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.620> do<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.010> car<00:03:49.160> then

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
depends on what you do to the car then

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.580 
depends on what you do to the car then
the<00:03:49.970> last<00:03:50.150> thing<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.510> this<00:03:50.780> is<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.110> this<00:03:51.410> is

the biggest one

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.900 
the biggest one
people<00:03:53.359> say<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.319> Corvette<00:03:54.739> handles<00:03:55.310> poorly

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
and this is a lot of you know the same

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.860 
and this is a lot of you know the same
type<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.010> flack<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.549> Mustangs<00:03:59.000> get<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.810> that

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
kind of thing and it's not that they

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.949 
kind of thing and it's not that they
handle<00:04:01.910> bad<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.239> Corvettes<00:04:02.599> have<00:04:02.720> never

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
handle bad the Corvettes have never

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.259 
handle bad the Corvettes have never
really<00:04:03.260> handled<00:04:03.650> bad<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.459> course<00:04:04.670> older<00:04:05.060> ones

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.030 
really handled bad of course older ones
it<00:04:05.420> gets<00:04:05.569> worse<00:04:05.780> as<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.109> go<00:04:06.260> back<00:04:06.500> farther<00:04:06.799> but

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
it gets worse as you go back farther but

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.500 
it gets worse as you go back farther but
that's<00:04:07.190> like<00:04:07.340> every<00:04:07.609> car<00:04:07.790> right<00:04:08.000> every<00:04:08.269> car

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
that's like every car right every car

the previous generation generally
handled<00:04:10.310> worse<00:04:10.459> than<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.849> current

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
handled worse than the current

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.390 
handled worse than the current
generation<00:04:11.690> but<00:04:11.870> Corvettes<00:04:12.829> it's<00:04:13.069> not<00:04:13.250> that
