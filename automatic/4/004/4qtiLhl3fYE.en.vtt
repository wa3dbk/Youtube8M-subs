00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to have a compass just for general

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.740 
to have a compass just for general
navigation<00:01:28.890> general<00:01:29.790> direction<00:01:29.970> there's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
navigation general direction there's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.270 
navigation general direction there's
lots<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.020> things<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:32.159> the

like<00:02:13.459> 5<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.780> Brunton<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.380> arc-15<00:02:16.370> so

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
like 5 and the Brunton to arc-15 so

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.610 
like 5 and the Brunton to arc-15 so
we're<00:02:16.970> going<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.120> take<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> closer<00:02:17.630> look<00:02:17.780> so

plotting routes and things like that on

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.070 
plotting routes and things like that on
a<00:02:30.560> map<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.489> has<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.730> little<00:02:32.120> scale<00:02:32.540> here<00:02:32.930> in

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
a map it has a little scale here in

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.040 
a map it has a little scale here in
inches<00:02:33.650> also<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.340> millimeters<00:02:35.030> there<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:35.510> has

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
inches also in millimeters there it has

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.559 
inches also in millimeters there it has
a<00:02:36.080> little<00:02:36.530> magnified<00:02:37.190> section<00:02:38.030> there<00:02:38.209> for

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
a little magnified section there for

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.170 
a little magnified section there for
reading<00:02:39.080> smaller<00:02:40.010> things<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> map<00:02:40.940> which

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
reading smaller things on a map which

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.240 
reading smaller things on a map which
does<00:02:41.450> actually<00:02:41.660> come<00:02:42.019> in<00:02:42.170> quite<00:02:42.709> handy

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
does actually come in quite handy

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.190 
does actually come in quite handy
now<00:02:43.640> both<00:02:43.819> compasses<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.690> true<00:02:44.840> arc<00:02:44.989> line

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
now both compasses in the true arc line

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.350 
now both compasses in the true arc line
have<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.560> global<00:02:46.100> needle<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.180> nice

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
have the global needle so it's a nice

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.440 
have the global needle so it's a nice
and<00:02:47.630> easy<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.470> read<00:02:48.680> needle<00:02:49.310> now<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.090> compass

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
and easy to read needle now this compass

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.479 
and easy to read needle now this compass
also<00:02:50.750> has<00:02:50.930> declination<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:52.130> if<00:02:52.250> you're<00:02:52.370> not

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
also has declination so if you're not

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.979 
also has declination so if you're not
familiar<00:02:52.610> with<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:53.120> basically<00:02:53.750> what<00:02:53.959> that

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
familiar with that basically what that

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.110 
familiar with that basically what that
is<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:54.680> an<00:02:54.830> offset<00:02:55.310> for<00:02:55.519> different<00:02:55.850> parts

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
is is it's an offset for different parts

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.640 
is is it's an offset for different parts
of<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.390> world<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.410> set<00:02:57.620> that

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
of the world and you can set that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.589 
of the world and you can set that
accordingly<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.489> then<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.760> will<00:02:58.910> make<00:02:59.090> your

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
accordingly and then it will make your

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.140 
accordingly and then it will make your
coordinates<00:03:00.230> read<00:03:00.500> more<00:03:00.769> true<00:03:01.099> now<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.910> true

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
coordinates read more true now the true

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.089 
coordinates read more true now the true
arc<00:03:02.299> 5<00:03:02.480> has<00:03:02.810> what<00:03:03.019> they<00:03:03.140> call<00:03:03.170> tool<00:03:03.680> free

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
arc 5 has what they call tool free

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.430 
arc 5 has what they call tool free
declination<00:03:04.760> setting<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:05.870> basically<00:03:06.349> it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
declination setting so basically it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.630 
declination setting so basically it
allows<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.799> set<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.130> declination

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
allows you to set the declination

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.690 
allows you to set the declination
without<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.660> use<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.200> tool<00:03:09.380> now<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.459> a

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
without the use of a tool now that is a

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.000 
without the use of a tool now that is a
cool<00:03:11.120> feature<00:03:11.330> however<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.349> kind<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.799> hard

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
cool feature however it is kind of hard

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.350 
cool feature however it is kind of hard
to<00:03:13.099> get<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.459> hang<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.670> setting<00:03:14.239> the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
to get the hang of setting the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.449 
to get the hang of setting the
declination<00:03:14.860> because<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:15.950> have<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.190> spin

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
declination because you have to spin

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.580 
declination because you have to spin
this<00:03:16.640> inner<00:03:16.880> dial<00:03:17.180> here<00:03:17.480> now<00:03:17.900> fortunately<00:03:18.350> you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
this inner dial here now fortunately you

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.289 
this inner dial here now fortunately you
really<00:03:18.829> only<00:03:18.980> have<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.190> set<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.549> once<00:03:19.760> for<00:03:20.180> the

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
really only have to set it once for the

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.840 
really only have to set it once for the
location<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.930> you're<00:03:21.140> in<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.530> then<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.670> also

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
location that you're in and then it also

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.720 
location that you're in and then it also
comes<00:03:23.060> with<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:24.019> nice<00:03:24.380> long<00:03:24.769> lanyard<00:03:25.489> which

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
comes with a nice long lanyard which

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.150 
comes with a nice long lanyard which
again<00:03:26.000> it's<00:03:26.540> very<00:03:26.870> easy<00:03:27.109> to<00:03:27.320> read<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.739> very

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
again it's very easy to read and very

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.520 
again it's very easy to read and very
nice<00:03:28.459> looking<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.060> very<00:03:29.870> lightweight<00:03:30.140> and

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
nice looking and very lightweight and

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.940 
nice looking and very lightweight and
rugged<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.000> do<00:03:32.209> like<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.750> two<00:03:32.900> r5<00:03:33.319> for<00:03:33.920> a

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
rugged so I do like the two r5 for a

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.620 
rugged so I do like the two r5 for a
simple<00:03:34.459> compass<00:03:34.819> that<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.180> can<00:03:35.329> take<00:03:35.480> with

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
simple compass that you can take with

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.390 
simple compass that you can take with
you<00:03:35.870> no<00:03:36.260> matter<00:03:36.470> where<00:03:36.739> you're<00:03:36.920> going<00:03:37.220> it's

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
you no matter where you're going it's

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.610 
you no matter where you're going it's
always<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.730> good<00:03:37.910> idea<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.450> have<00:03:38.630> at<00:03:39.109> least<00:03:39.170> one

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
always a good idea to have at least one

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.340 
always a good idea to have at least one
compass<00:03:40.010> on<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.940> at<00:03:41.239> all<00:03:41.269> times<00:03:41.480> when<00:03:42.200> you're

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
compass on you at all times when you're

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.220 
compass on you at all times when you're
in<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.650> woods<00:03:42.829> or<00:03:43.100> in<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.819> new<00:03:43.970> area<00:03:44.239> now<00:03:45.109> they

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
in the woods or in a new area now they

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.160 
in the woods or in a new area now they
also<00:03:45.380> sent<00:03:45.739> out<00:03:45.889> their<00:03:46.190> two<00:03:46.760> arc-15<00:03:47.510> which<00:03:48.019> is

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
also sent out their two arc-15 which is

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.110 
also sent out their two arc-15 which is
similar<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.889> five<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.430> has<00:03:49.639> the<00:03:49.940> nice

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
similar to the five it has the nice

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.960 
similar to the five it has the nice
large<00:03:50.870> base<00:03:51.290> plate<00:03:51.590> here<00:03:51.859> has<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.489> magnifying

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
large base plate here has the magnifying

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.349 
large base plate here has the magnifying
map<00:03:53.959> spot<00:03:54.530> has<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.400> different<00:03:55.609> markings<00:03:56.150> on

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
map spot has the different markings on

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.199 
map spot has the different markings on
the<00:03:57.109> base<00:03:57.260> plate<00:03:57.500> as<00:03:57.769> well<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.850> difference<00:03:59.120> is

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
the base plate as well the difference is

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.699 
the base plate as well the difference is
with<00:03:59.389> this<00:03:59.540> one<00:03:59.750> are<00:03:59.930> obviously<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.560> has<00:04:00.680> a

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
with this one are obviously it has a

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.620 
with this one are obviously it has a
mirror<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.280> really<00:04:01.850> like<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.180> because<00:04:02.239> it's

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
mirror I really like that because it's

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.180 
mirror I really like that because it's
multi-purpose<00:04:02.989> not<00:04:03.530> only<00:04:03.680> can<00:04:03.829> you<00:04:03.920> use<00:04:03.980> it

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
multi-purpose not only can you use it

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.819 
multi-purpose not only can you use it
for<00:04:04.220> signaling<00:04:07.720> but<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.900> can<00:04:09.049> use<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.709> look

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
for signaling but you can use it to look

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.680 
for signaling but you can use it to look
at<00:04:09.950> yourself<00:04:10.340> in<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.519> mirror<00:04:10.609> maybe<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.569> know

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
at yourself in the mirror maybe you know

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.690 
at yourself in the mirror maybe you know
you<00:04:11.750> have<00:04:11.989> something<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.500> your<00:04:12.590> eye<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:13.069> mirror

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
you have something in your eye a mirror

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.970 
you have something in your eye a mirror
comes<00:04:13.940> in<00:04:14.120> really<00:04:14.299> handy<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:15.560> course<00:04:15.769> for

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
comes in really handy and of course for

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.699 
comes in really handy and of course for
our<00:04:16.039> survival<00:04:16.310> kits<00:04:16.639> we<00:04:16.789> all<00:04:16.910> want<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.209> carry

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
our survival kits we all want to carry

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.440 
our survival kits we all want to carry
you<00:04:18.709> know<00:04:18.829> some<00:04:19.250> way<00:04:19.430> of<00:04:19.639> signaling<00:04:19.880> others

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
you know some way of signaling others

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.360 
you know some way of signaling others
and<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:20.810> signal<00:04:21.139> mirror<00:04:21.260> works<00:04:21.620> great<00:04:21.919> so<00:04:22.340> I

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
and a signal mirror works great so I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.210 
and a signal mirror works great so I
find<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.760> these<00:04:23.020> these<00:04:24.020> mirrors<00:04:24.440> inside<00:04:24.890> the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
find that these these mirrors inside the

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.900 
find that these these mirrors inside the
brunt<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:25.580> compasses<00:04:26.060> work

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
brunt and compasses work

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.020 
brunt and compasses work
excellent<00:04:27.420> for<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.470> also<00:04:28.650> has<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.310> bubble

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
excellent for that it also has a bubble

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.820 
excellent for that it also has a bubble
level<00:04:30.300> here<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.780> make<00:04:30.960> sure<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.290> your<00:04:31.470> level

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
level here to make sure that your level

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.980 
level here to make sure that your level
has<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.580> same<00:04:32.790> global<00:04:33.060> needle<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:33.630> then<00:04:33.720> this

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
has the same global needle and then this

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.990 
has the same global needle and then this
one<00:04:34.200> also<00:04:34.230> has<00:04:34.740> rare<00:04:35.040> earth<00:04:35.220> magnets<00:04:35.760> in<00:04:35.880> it

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
one also has rare earth magnets in it

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.420 
one also has rare earth magnets in it
which<00:04:36.480> help<00:04:36.780> eliminate<00:04:37.110> interference<00:04:37.470> I'm

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
which help eliminate interference I'm

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.520 
which help eliminate interference I'm
going<00:04:38.670> to<00:04:38.730> be<00:04:38.820> doing<00:04:39.090> some<00:04:39.480> tutorials<00:04:39.840> on<00:04:40.230> how

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
going to be doing some tutorials on how

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.100 
going to be doing some tutorials on how
to<00:04:40.560> use<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.830> compass<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.580> how<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:43.080> know

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
to use a compass and how to you know

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.720 
to use a compass and how to you know
plot<00:04:43.440> coordinates<00:04:43.920> on<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.100> map<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.550> things

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
plot coordinates on a map and things

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.250 
plot coordinates on a map and things
like<00:04:44.910> that<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.330> one<00:04:45.720> of<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> things<00:04:46.080> that

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
like that and one of the things that

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.870 
like that and one of the things that
you'll<00:04:46.380> find<00:04:46.680> is<00:04:46.890> that<00:04:46.920> you<00:04:47.130> want<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.490> hold<00:04:47.700> it

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
you'll find is that you want to hold it

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.930 
you'll find is that you want to hold it
away<00:04:48.540> from<00:04:48.900> your<00:04:49.050> body<00:04:49.310> down<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.670> know<00:04:50.790> at

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
away from your body down you know at

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.750 
away from your body down you know at
about<00:04:50.970> waist<00:04:51.540> high<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:53.040> make<00:04:53.490> sure<00:04:53.640> that

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
about waist high and make sure that

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.850 
about waist high and make sure that
you're<00:04:53.910> not<00:04:54.060> getting<00:04:54.450> any<00:04:54.750> interference<00:04:55.590> from

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
you're not getting any interference from

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.280 
you're not getting any interference from
electronics<00:04:56.520> or<00:04:56.670> any<00:04:57.030> metal<00:04:57.600> objects<00:04:58.110> like

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
electronics or any metal objects like

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.780 
electronics or any metal objects like
your<00:04:58.470> belt<00:04:58.650> buckle<00:04:59.010> and<00:04:59.190> things<00:04:59.580> like<00:04:59.730> that

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
your belt buckle and things like that

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.060 
your belt buckle and things like that
and<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.480> rare<00:05:00.690> earth<00:05:00.900> magnets<00:05:01.410> in<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.920> true

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
and the rare earth magnets in the true

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.150 
and the rare earth magnets in the true
arc-15<00:05:02.670> help<00:05:03.210> avoid<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.710> this<00:05:04.830> one<00:05:05.010> is

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
arc-15 help avoid that so this one is

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.150 
arc-15 help avoid that so this one is
also<00:05:05.370> magnified<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.600> compass<00:05:06.900> dial<00:05:07.160> so

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
also magnified on the compass dial so

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.670 
also magnified on the compass dial so
again<00:05:08.400> very<00:05:08.610> nice-looking<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.930> very<00:05:10.260> easy<00:05:10.560> to

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
again very nice-looking and very easy to

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.010 
again very nice-looking and very easy to
read<00:05:10.950> and<00:05:11.220> quite<00:05:12.060> rugged<00:05:12.360> especially<00:05:12.900> when

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
read and quite rugged especially when

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.780 
read and quite rugged especially when
you<00:05:13.110> close<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.560> case<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:14.580> know<00:05:14.670> I've<00:05:14.760> been

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
you close the case you know I've been

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.400 
you close the case you know I've been
carrying<00:05:15.120> this<00:05:15.300> in<00:05:15.510> my<00:05:15.750> pack<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.020> in<00:05:16.320> my

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
carrying this in my pack and in my

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.710 
carrying this in my pack and in my
pocket<00:05:16.770> for<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:16.980> while<00:05:17.100> now<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:18.090> think<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.570> is

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
pocket for a while now and I think it is

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.500 
pocket for a while now and I think it is
really<00:05:19.080> durable<00:05:19.380> and<00:05:19.770> will<00:05:20.280> hold<00:05:20.430> up<00:05:20.640> so<00:05:20.880> this

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
really durable and will hold up so this

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.480 
really durable and will hold up so this
one<00:05:21.690> has<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.110> same<00:05:22.320> goofy<00:05:22.800> declination

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
one has the same goofy declination

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.060 
one has the same goofy declination
setting<00:05:24.030> although<00:05:24.420> it<00:05:24.630> is<00:05:24.780> tool<00:05:25.080> free<00:05:25.500> you

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
setting although it is tool free you

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.940 
setting although it is tool free you
kind<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.370> have<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.670> hold<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:28.410> main<00:05:28.650> ring

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
kind of have to hold the the main ring

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.830 
kind of have to hold the the main ring
with<00:05:29.190> your<00:05:29.310> fingers<00:05:29.640> here<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.060> then<00:05:30.180> spin<00:05:30.600> the

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
with your fingers here and then spin the

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.350 
with your fingers here and then spin the
inside<00:05:31.260> set<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.770> declination<00:05:32.220> not<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.180> easy

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
inside set the declination not that easy

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.940 
inside set the declination not that easy
to<00:05:33.480> do<00:05:33.690> but<00:05:33.930> fortunately<00:05:34.290> you<00:05:34.440> really<00:05:34.770> only

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
to do but fortunately you really only

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.710 
to do but fortunately you really only
have<00:05:35.040> to<00:05:35.220> do<00:05:35.460> it<00:05:35.490> once<00:05:35.850> but<00:05:36.090> that<00:05:36.600> would<00:05:36.690> be

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
have to do it once but that would be

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.170 
have to do it once but that would be
nice<00:05:36.960> if<00:05:37.110> it<00:05:37.170> was<00:05:37.230> a<00:05:37.410> little<00:05:37.740> easier<00:05:37.920> but<00:05:38.850> again

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
nice if it was a little easier but again

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.630 
nice if it was a little easier but again
it's<00:05:39.420> tool<00:05:39.720> free<00:05:40.140> so<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:41.130> do<00:05:41.340> it<00:05:41.490> on

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
it's tool free so that you can do it on

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.940 
it's tool free so that you can do it on
the<00:05:41.820> go<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.630> two<00:05:42.750> arc-15<00:05:43.260> also<00:05:43.620> has<00:05:43.800> the

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
the go the two arc-15 also has the

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.990 
the go the two arc-15 also has the
inclination<00:05:46.190> elevation<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.430> angle<00:05:47.910> of

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
inclination elevation and angle of

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.960 
inclination elevation and angle of
elevation<00:05:48.380> again<00:05:49.380> good<00:05:49.710> for<00:05:49.919> if<00:05:50.370> you're<00:05:50.550> in<00:05:50.730> an

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
elevation again good for if you're in an

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.110 
elevation again good for if you're in an
avalanche<00:05:51.360> or<00:05:51.660> risk<00:05:51.870> zone<00:05:52.290> it<00:05:53.160> snaps<00:05:53.580> nicely

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
avalanche or risk zone it snaps nicely

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.780 
avalanche or risk zone it snaps nicely
shut<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.600> then<00:05:55.320> of<00:05:55.440> course<00:05:55.680> comes<00:05:56.160> with<00:05:56.400> a

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
shut and then of course comes with a

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.510 
shut and then of course comes with a
lanyard<00:05:57.120> as<00:05:57.450> well<00:05:57.630> so<00:05:58.560> guys<00:05:58.710> even<00:05:59.070> in<00:05:59.220> its<00:05:59.370> most

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
lanyard as well so guys even in its most

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.700 
lanyard as well so guys even in its most
basic<00:05:59.640> form<00:06:00.030> just<00:06:00.810> being<00:06:01.020> able<00:06:01.080> to<00:06:01.200> tell<00:06:01.410> north

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
basic form just being able to tell north

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.010 
basic form just being able to tell north
south<00:06:02.010> east<00:06:02.280> and<00:06:02.610> west<00:06:02.640> is<00:06:03.060> very<00:06:03.510> handy<00:06:03.900> when

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
south east and west is very handy when

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.570 
south east and west is very handy when
you're<00:06:04.169> heading<00:06:04.380> out<00:06:04.620> on<00:06:04.830> a<00:06:04.860> new<00:06:05.100> trail<00:06:05.370> for

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
you're heading out on a new trail for

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.330 
you're heading out on a new trail for
example<00:06:05.970> when<00:06:06.419> you're<00:06:06.570> at<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.810> trailhead<00:06:07.340> get

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
example when you're at the trailhead get

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.980 
example when you're at the trailhead get
your<00:06:08.520> bearings<00:06:08.910> get<00:06:09.240> your<00:06:09.390> direction<00:06:09.690> and

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
your bearings get your direction and

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.390 
your bearings get your direction and
then<00:06:10.290> you<00:06:10.320> know<00:06:10.560> you<00:06:10.620> always<00:06:10.890> have<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.250> head

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
then you know you always have to head

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.060 
then you know you always have to head
back<00:06:11.669> that<00:06:11.940> direction<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:12.930> get<00:06:13.080> back<00:06:13.440> where

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
back that direction to get back where

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.950 
back that direction to get back where
you<00:06:14.190> came<00:06:14.310> from<00:06:14.370> now<00:06:14.730> again<00:06:14.970> I'm<00:06:15.419> going<00:06:15.690> to<00:06:15.810> do

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
you came from now again I'm going to do

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.230 
you came from now again I'm going to do
some<00:06:16.169> tutorials<00:06:16.440> on<00:06:16.860> you<00:06:17.520> know<00:06:17.610> basic<00:06:18.060> and

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
some tutorials on you know basic and

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.170 
some tutorials on you know basic and
more<00:06:18.570> advanced<00:06:19.110> use<00:06:19.560> of<00:06:19.590> a<00:06:19.950> compass<00:06:20.310> so<00:06:20.520> stay

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
more advanced use of a compass so stay

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.510 
more advanced use of a compass so stay
tuned<00:06:21.419> for<00:06:21.780> those<00:06:21.930> videos<00:06:22.200> so<00:06:23.010> I<00:06:23.040> really<00:06:23.340> like

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
tuned for those videos so I really like

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.250 
tuned for those videos so I really like
the<00:06:23.730> true<00:06:23.940> arc<00:06:24.120> series<00:06:24.480> from<00:06:24.720> Brunton<00:06:25.080> whether

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
the true arc series from Brunton whether

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.530 
the true arc series from Brunton whether
you<00:06:25.410> just<00:06:25.590> need<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.980> basic<00:06:26.460> compass<00:06:26.850> for<00:06:27.210> your

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
you just need a basic compass for your

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.380 
you just need a basic compass for your
survival<00:06:27.990> kit<00:06:28.140> or<00:06:28.590> pack<00:06:29.040> or<00:06:29.280> a<00:06:29.340> little<00:06:30.210> more

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
survival kit or pack or a little more

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.200 
survival kit or pack or a little more
advanced<00:06:30.990> compass<00:06:31.740> I<00:06:31.980> really<00:06:32.730> like<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:33.030> true

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
advanced compass I really like the true

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.360 
advanced compass I really like the true
arc<00:06:33.360> 15<00:06:33.810> because<00:06:34.140> it<00:06:34.260> is<00:06:34.380> so<00:06:34.590> multi-purpose<00:06:35.250> of

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
arc 15 because it is so multi-purpose of

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.190 
arc 15 because it is so multi-purpose of
course<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.760> does<00:06:35.910> serve<00:06:36.150> as<00:06:36.330> a<00:06:36.360> compass<00:06:36.630> but

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
course it does serve as a compass but

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.380 
course it does serve as a compass but
you<00:06:37.350> also<00:06:37.560> have<00:06:37.890> that<00:06:37.919> mirror<00:06:38.490> for<00:06:38.910> signaling

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
you also have that mirror for signaling

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.170 
you also have that mirror for signaling
or

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
or

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.719 
or
if<00:06:40.419> you<00:06:40.509> have<00:06:40.690> something<00:06:40.960> on<00:06:41.350> your<00:06:41.949> face<00:06:42.310> or<00:06:42.550> in

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
if you have something on your face or in

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.550 
if you have something on your face or in
your<00:06:42.880> eyes<00:06:43.060> which<00:06:43.690> believe<00:06:44.020> it<00:06:44.050> or<00:06:44.169> not<00:06:44.320> I<00:06:44.380> do

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
your eyes which believe it or not I do

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.290 
your eyes which believe it or not I do
get<00:06:44.889> things<00:06:45.100> in<00:06:45.220> my<00:06:45.310> eyes<00:06:45.490> and<00:06:45.759> the<00:06:46.060> mirror

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
get things in my eyes and the mirror

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.270 
get things in my eyes and the mirror
comes<00:06:46.509> in<00:06:46.810> very<00:06:47.320> handy<00:06:47.470> and<00:06:47.949> it's<00:06:48.070> nice<00:06:48.250> to

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
comes in very handy and it's nice to

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.650
