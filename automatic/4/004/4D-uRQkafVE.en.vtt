00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 in case the phone looks in the field 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.319
 passes away 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.190
 and there, quiet people 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.060
 in today's video brings gameplay 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.310
 colossal colossal futuristically 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.470
 extremely weak gave a field of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.470
 leaving almost the pope has an enemy the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.300
 Fuck roberto aquino na cosa is already the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 third instance to record this video but 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.710
 it's going to be this video anyway in the cloud 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.610
 I am already 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.829
 advancing another gameplay 2013 then 2013 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.989
 so we 've already seen too much for 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.340
 fact of being in the son of a bitch hub 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.110
 on the knife 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.420
 I've already been a big year because I 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.449
 stay at the game's image database 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.590
 so now it will be like this if you do not 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.780
 liked 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.520
 simply close the video do not lie 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 I was watching that it's going to be 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.229
 interesting to see what he's talking about 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.750
 that I play inserts hardcore right? 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.390
 now that I've found out that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.689
 are much more fun 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.540
 normal brains because they give a 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.450
 more freedom than other modes do not 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.790
 they say that here you do not stay 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.549
 on the map is that you are not on the map 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.189
 for example when I'm walking and not 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.189
 was exported or something like that I did not 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.680
 I appear on the map of the enemies what gives 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.229
 a fucking advantage if it's a sniper 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.200
 something like that but it also contains 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.930
 some cons such as I think 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.979
 it is said that the offended fire activated 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.579
 and disabled 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.350
 Sorry to talk is activated, right? 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.939
 and hence can cause the West to kill someone 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.520
 from your team, right? 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.600
 that's right you do not have some points in 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.689
 The way I'm recording here play 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.299
 I do not live then I intend to do it without 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.369
 no cut and I already had to turn off the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.759
 phone because of the phone 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.440
 Look in the field, die. 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.380
 I had almost the phone cable 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.820
 that people were fucking calling 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.520
 When you start recording everyone, I 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.360
 you know this problem that the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.640
 software channel is a lot of people wanting 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.380
 to screw the channel is much is much bigger 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.520
 focus is to do what nÃ© 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.820
 and told talking on the hardcore server he 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.330
 give you this freedom so assault 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.280
 garbage method of rescuing pecaria edit 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.880
 this freedom rope with the other modes 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.930
 nec not give is very strange because it is 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.480
 very good and one of the good things too 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.670
 here for you that is a sniper you 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.550
 When you kill, you do not appear in the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.560
 map for example does not give that classic 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.640
 cameras in which shows where the enemy 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.680
 it is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.450
 This is a very good thing if you are 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.570
 in the inter is a very bad thing 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.630
 When you have to deal with cameras, right? 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.070
 but then you will have to use it totally 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.260
 your net instinct 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.400
 if you, for example, dominate the rock of 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.220
 China 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.490
 You're not going to suffer any problem, right? 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.520
 you will you will speak and you will 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.490
 see the direction from where the bullet came from and you 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.690
 will not have that kind of problem and I 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.810
 I think this is one of the top 12 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.840
 parties so remember to know you 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.800
 can you have this freedom so giba 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.850
 to play 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.630
 if no one bothering you I think I 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.280
 I think it's very good, Celso Roth, I'm running. 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.770
 I recommend you play 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.750
 a lot of people play and also some of the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.440
 things also that changes in the brain record 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.850
 and it's a map you can see there in the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.850
 right corner below 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.470
 do not have no do not have that one 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.430
 The classic thing is that they do not 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.110
 numbers showing how many bullets 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.600
 Do you have etc? 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.180
 these things that all by suspension of 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.940
 schutter has no more here 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.880
 i and you already have to know more to give 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.310
 the bullets for me that always stayed 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.020
 carrying a loaded or been called 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.040
 that I have spent only one bullet of the 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.979
 fish 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.750
 This is very interesting , he died there. 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.790
 It's very interesting because you do not have 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.680
 what a worry you know 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.900
 one of the tips is whenever you kill the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.110
 enemy and you have a time of 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.840
 rest you carry pharma because 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.300
 otherwise you can get hurt 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.780
 follow the advice boards is very 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.420
 interesting plans I think something 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.660
 boring too that is engraved 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.320
 if we had one, we would have to 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.260
 fright 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.960
 if there was an enemy there a friend of mine 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.480
 that I would have died he would have whored 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.920
 he would have died because of the 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.580
 cold of this fire 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.630
 then it is one of those that if it is one of the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.150
 bad right 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.150
 if you do many fire drills in one 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.300
 You may start each 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.000
 it is clear that these measures are 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.420
 made to stay the guys that stay 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.260
 avacalhando that was killing his friends 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.180
 so on purpose but if for 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:29.840
 You too, in this case too. 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.840
 be very careful, let's take some 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.620
 where the watch 50% is something 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.070
 opa opa 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:46.590
 So it's basic, it's our base, so it's 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:51.960
 basically this is the cons and the 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.700
 positive which is now showing how 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.940
 you can 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.070
 As you can enter they are not for 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.560
 you get into Serbian ratko is very 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:07.490
 easy only you have to do is go in 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:10.350
 multiplayer brain and you will tighten the 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.920
 directional the right that the analog 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.140
 chopp filter and keep the 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.170
 filters here you will look select the 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:23.400
 game mode you want conquest ranch 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.740
 TechNet wiggle squad code rush and 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.380
 which you like can be seen in the 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.630
 business can select everyone on the ball and 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.690
 like 15 out mexico this part of the 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.730
 elected officers met on some maps here with 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.620
 aqsiq the map of love is that love is 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.990
 that the boat would not be 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.560
 So you just got a workout in the 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.020
 check in 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.700
 You'll look into the retreats. 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.860
 But I would like to play in the 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.650
 athletic said one meter will teach 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.810
 medical practice here and in the modes will have 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.440
 have the modes will be so not radical 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.830
 not think you will clear standard 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.860
 check the last option will kick hardcore 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:05.370
 in the ranking is said will put and s of

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.630
 Usually, it's going to stay there. 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.210
