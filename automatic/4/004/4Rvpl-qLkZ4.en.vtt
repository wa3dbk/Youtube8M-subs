00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.460
 well I had I have my face ready with 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.290
 corrective basis and all because we are going to 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.059
 start with the eyes and I'm putting a 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.320
 clear corrector to adhere 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.320
 very much with my shadows 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.340
 and then I'm going to take this bronzer 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.660
 process in taking a shade matte coffee and 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.640
 I'm going to use it with a brush 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.920
 blur in the fold we are not going to 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.300
 blur very very well 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.010
 It does not matter if we go through labor to 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.690
 mobile then we'll go later 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.730
 do it so the idea is like dialing 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.730
 more than anything and blur it very well give 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:00.280
 then a shadow william and kate like 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.280
 clarita put on the bone to illuminate 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.430
 and then with a brush or a paintbrush 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.020
 black pencil 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.520
 I hope we believe and we will do as if 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.140
 we were going to delineate it but that does not have 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.450
 to be too neat because 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.980
 just then accuse him to blur and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.600
 we're also going to mark a little bit like that in 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.850
 the corner because we're going to make a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.850
 kind of smoked but not so intense 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.250
 and then with a black shadow a little bit 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.680
 and a flat brush we're going to take and 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.780
 let's start to blur that line 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.060
 what we did with the black pencil we're going to 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.009
 go carrying it up and in the corner 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.590
 we're also going to blur a little bit with 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.630
 this same brush but the important thing is 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.610
 that we do not get along as we do everything 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.810
 that is done to the other end but 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.810
 only on the corner 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.990
 and good that I want to show you that with 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.460
 this 15 we are going to try to blur 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.080
 as much as I can as much as we can 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.910
 although it is not that this is an end of the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.260
 to blur later on what 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.270
 we are going to do but as this one has more 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.270
 accuracy is a little bit easier 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.720
 and then we will take the color again 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.280
 Bronzer oozes fried coffee and we're going to 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.290
 pass with the brush to blur by 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.790
 all over the mobile eyelid and also 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.530
 where we had already put for 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.370
 finish blurring this motto that 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.760
 which is so intense 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.760
 Y 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.130
 again with the black pencil we are going to 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.900
 delineate the lower eyelid 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.940
 Pauline also takes them as in the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.010
 water line but I'm not going to do it 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.500
 because my eye is not as big as 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.630
 from her then I can make a pencil 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.370
 clear for the water line so that 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.710
 I am present that I was much more 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.720
 big in my eyes and good with it 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.300
 bold color let's blur this 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.900
 line I only did it until half of my 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.900
 eyelid 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.920
 and with the same tanner or coffee 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.720
 I put at the beginning I will pass it already 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.420
 tear to finish you from 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.420
 blur and that does not look so strong 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.300
 we go to the mascara I'm going to put those 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.580
 up from below as always but 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.620
 you can still pass the apparent of the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.820
 false eyelashes then it does not matter 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.820
 so they remain super long 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.099
 and I'm going to use these very bushy 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.890
 because Pauline usually wear eyelashes 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.950
 well very very giants and good I'm going to 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.989
 use this light color to put it 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.280
 in the lacrimal and give it a little 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.280
 luminosity to my eyes 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.680
 You can touch up my face and I told you 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.050
 I was sitting but I could touch up on its own 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.360
 same as umbrellas and my 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.830
 suggested and I needed to outline the nose 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.880
 then then do now also with 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.880
 a turning bronzer 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.460
 for me the same use this lipstick 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.740
 that since maturation and I love 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.660
 the download all the characters the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.800
 description and I like it a lot because with 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.230
 I feel like I can get them 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.580
 draw delineate and others is like 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.090
 advance because then I will put over 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.090
 other 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 l 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.289
 and now I'm going to use this which is the 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.030
 carmine tone that is beautiful and therefore this 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.740
 will give me as that touch because more 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.050
 bright I'm going to take a little bit of 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.030
 flush illuminator that I put right now and 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.040
 he's going to put it in his nose in the arch of 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:00.630
 Cupid and a little bit of my comfort 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.390
 and finally with the liquid eyeliner 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.160
 I'm going to pass it through my eyelashes 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.020
 above as to cover us and suddenly 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.090
 some imperfection to hit him 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.980
 the false eyelashes but let's do 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.960
 garden tail or nothing just like that 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.180
 like a thin line so it does not 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.500
 is for us to be more neat and 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.810
 Well, you see, I'm running like that because 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.820
 they are super super long 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.560
 and the historical gestures of the result of 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.850
 makeup remember that it is simply 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.400
 an inspiration I'm not saying that 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.990
 it was equal to her makeup and a lot 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.280
 unless I pretend to look like her 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.169
 for nothing is simply an inspiration 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.150
 I hope you like it in this kind of 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.830
 videos maybe and give a like can 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.050
 be let me know in the comments 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.970
 and also call me on my social networks 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.310
 because his age also published many 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.510
 little things and you wrote my channel to me 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.280
 they are not yet 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.000
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.000
 in the next 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.110
 Y
