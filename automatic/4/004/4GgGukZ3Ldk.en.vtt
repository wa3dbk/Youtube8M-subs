I<00:00:37.110> love<00:00:37.739> en<00:00:38.040> ville<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.670> um<00:00:39.270> film<00:00:39.899> Idol<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> I'm

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
I love en ville but um film Idol and I'm

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.860 
I love en ville but um film Idol and I'm
pretty<00:00:41.160> sure<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> same<00:00:41.820> thing<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.480> my

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
pretty sure it's the same thing and my

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.900 
pretty sure it's the same thing and my
theory<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.860> take<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.250> now<00:00:44.460> then

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
theory is that if we take this now then

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.360 
theory is that if we take this now then
Woking<00:00:45.329> them<00:00:45.450> over<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.800> sure<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.160> won't

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
Woking them over and for sure we won't

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.610 
Woking them over and for sure we won't
have<00:00:47.550> cramps<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.350> good

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
have cramps this is gonna be good

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.330 
have cramps this is gonna be good
maximum<00:00:50.370> strength<00:00:50.570> menstral<00:00:51.570> relief<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:56.190> we

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
maximum strength menstral relief so we

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
maximum strength menstral relief so we
were<00:00:56.430> supposed<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.090> guest<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:58.350> this
