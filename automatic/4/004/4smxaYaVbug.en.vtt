future use of this application and this

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.830 
future use of this application and this
was<00:01:43.079> an<00:01:43.200> app<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.619> won't<00:01:43.860> say<00:01:44.509> was<00:01:45.509> pretty

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
was an app that I won't say was pretty

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.639 
was an app that I won't say was pretty
much<00:01:46.049> dead<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.590> me<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> end<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:48.000> 2013

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
much dead to me as of the end of 2013

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.560 
much dead to me as of the end of 2013
but<00:01:49.649> very<00:01:50.070> close<00:01:50.490> because<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.240> no<00:01:51.390> longer

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
but very close because it was no longer

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.560 
but very close because it was no longer
functional<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.590> note<00:01:52.829> -<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:54.270> was<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
functional with my note - and this was a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.889 
functional with my note - and this was a
go-to<00:01:55.610> application<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.880> me<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> regular

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
go-to application for me on a regular

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.670 
go-to application for me on a regular
basis<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> huge<00:01:59.969> update<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
basis so this is a huge update and I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
basis so this is a huge update and I
really<00:02:02.040> wanted<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.060> sooner<00:02:03.659> for

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
really wanted to get to it sooner for

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.690 
really wanted to get to it sooner for
all<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.290> because<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> critical<00:02:05.340> one

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
all of you because it is a critical one

the palm of your hand and of course you
wouldn't<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:28.830> want<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.190> hold<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.690> while

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
wouldn't really want to hold this while

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.290 
wouldn't really want to hold this while

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
using it as a hotspot because it is

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.290 
using it as a hotspot because it is

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
devices by the way a big advantage of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
devices by the way a big advantage of
using<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> Wi-Fi<00:02:45.180> rather<00:02:45.930> than<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.830> wired

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
using the Wi-Fi rather than going wired

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.690 
using the Wi-Fi rather than going wired
it<00:02:48.420> really<00:02:48.960> does<00:02:49.320> start<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.770> heat<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:50.070> even

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
it really does start to heat up even

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.890 
it really does start to heat up even
though<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.910> does<00:02:51.060> have<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.420> advantage<00:02:51.510> of

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
though it does have the advantage of

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.690 
though it does have the advantage of
that<00:02:51.990> plastic<00:02:52.620> build<00:02:52.890> unlike<00:02:53.310> some<00:02:53.550> other

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that plastic build unlike some other

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.350 
that plastic build unlike some other

the<00:03:26.610> hotspot<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.450> general<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.770> this<00:03:29.010> will

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
the hotspot in general and this will

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.020 
the hotspot in general and this will
allow<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.420> essentially<00:03:31.350> sidestep<00:03:32.030> paying

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
charge one for utilizing data you are

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.990 
charge one for utilizing data you are
already<00:03:39.420> paying<00:03:39.900> for<00:03:40.140> which<00:03:41.130> still<00:03:41.580> makes<00:03:41.820> no

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
already paying for which still makes no

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000 
already paying for which still makes no
sense<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.450> me<00:03:42.480> but<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:43.110> still<00:03:43.350> standard

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
sense to me but it's still standard

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.880 
sense to me but it's still standard
practice<00:03:44.550> for<00:03:44.959> much<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.470> industry

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890
