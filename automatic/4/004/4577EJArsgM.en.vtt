00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.059

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:45.519
 clear lacquer and colored lacquer which you 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.559

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.940
 I already covered my fingers with clear varnish 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.159

 will need regular liquid for 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.299
 removing varnish I have to write to the reaper 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.720
 with at work use acetone 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.930
 I will also use liquid here 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.000

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.060

 snowflake disk numbered m11 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.400

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:53.670
 wool to have had a major order 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:06.189

00:02:43.190 --> 00:03:00.610
 so much well soak the picture 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:03:00.610
