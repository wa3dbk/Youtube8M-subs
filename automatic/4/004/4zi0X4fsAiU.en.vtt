just rotate that mask around until you
get<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> appropriate<00:01:07.979> spot<00:01:08.609> when<00:01:08.819> the

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:08.999 
get to the appropriate spot when the

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:11.660 
get to the appropriate spot when the
controller<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.659> vibrating<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:10.560> about<00:01:10.950> here

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
controller is vibrating right about here

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.429 
controller is vibrating right about here
there<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:11.999> traces<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> white<00:01:12.779> paint<00:01:13.139> on<00:01:13.289> the

noble birth so that is the first relic
that<00:01:21.090> we're<00:01:21.329> gonna<00:01:21.450> snatch<00:01:21.779> up<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.139> this<00:01:22.289> video

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that we're gonna snatch up in this video

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.139 
that we're gonna snatch up in this video
it<00:01:22.829> took<00:01:22.950> me<00:01:23.099> a<00:01:23.130> second<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.609> get<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.969> right

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
it took me a second to get to the right

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.449 
it took me a second to get to the right
spot<00:01:24.389> so<00:01:24.779> it<00:01:24.869> might<00:01:24.959> take<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.349> a<00:01:25.380> minute<00:01:25.590> but

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459 
spot so it might take you a minute but

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.760 
spot so it might take you a minute but
you<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:26.909> eventually<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.079> angle<00:01:28.499> it<00:01:28.590> right

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you know eventually just angle it right

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.929 
you know eventually just angle it right
and<00:01:28.889> you'll<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.609> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.880> see

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and you'll get it so as you can see

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.239 
and you'll get it so as you can see
that's<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.929> out<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> three<00:01:31.469> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.099> where

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
that's one out of three this is where

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.309 
that's one out of three this is where
we're<00:01:32.399> at<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.789> map<00:01:32.819> so<00:01:33.719> just<00:01:33.929> proceed

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
we're at on the map so just proceed

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.629 
we're at on the map so just proceed
where<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> was<00:01:34.859> out<00:01:35.039> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.249> just<00:01:35.369> follow

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
where I was out you know just follow

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:36.529 
where I was out you know just follow
along<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.179> should<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.359> pretty

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
along and it should be pretty

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.959 
along and it should be pretty
straightforward<00:01:36.689> red<00:01:37.609> you<00:01:38.609> know<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.819> leave

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
straightforward red you know we leave

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.879 
straightforward red you know we leave
the<00:01:39.240> damn<00:01:39.389> campfire<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.409> make<00:01:40.649> our<00:01:40.859> way

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
the damn campfire and just make our way

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.359 
the damn campfire and just make our way
over<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.829> where<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> first

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
over here so that's where the first

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.339

Japanese noh theater I think it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.100 
Japanese noh theater I think it
represents<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.569> demon<00:03:36.959> or<00:03:37.410> Oni<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.690> as<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.959> can

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
represents a demon or Oni so as you can

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.290

it<00:03:42.720> in<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:42.930> direction<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.220> voila<00:03:45.620> there's<00:03:46.620> a

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
it in this direction and voila there's a

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.770 
it in this direction and voila there's a
price<00:03:46.920> tag<00:03:47.160> looks<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.450> one<00:03:48.629> is<00:03:48.750> a
