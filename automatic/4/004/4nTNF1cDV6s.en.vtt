we<00:02:29.560> get<00:02:29.830> 3,000<00:02:30.730> gallons<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.450> water<00:02:31.720> for<00:02:32.020> every

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
we get 3,000 gallons of water for every

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.310 
we get 3,000 gallons of water for every
inch<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.650> rain<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.209> same<00:02:34.570> equipment

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
inch of rain it's the same equipment

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.460 
inch of rain it's the same equipment
that<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.890> would<00:02:36.100> use<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.760> water<00:02:37.120> well<00:02:37.470> it's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that you would use for a water well it's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.410 
that you would use for a water well it's
not<00:02:38.770> rocket<00:02:39.100> science<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:39.940> pretty<00:02:40.180> basic

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
not rocket science it's pretty basic

not rocket science it's pretty basic
stuff<00:02:40.720> there's<00:02:41.560> nothing<00:02:41.830> like<00:02:42.190> rainwater<00:02:42.550> I

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
stuff there's nothing like rainwater I

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.330 
stuff there's nothing like rainwater I
tell<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.390> once<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.780> use<00:02:44.140> rainwater<00:02:44.560> even

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
tell you once you use rainwater even

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.070 
tell you once you use rainwater even

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
compared to austin city water you won't

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.440 
compared to austin city water you won't
want<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.470> use<00:02:50.680> anything<00:02:51.040> else<00:02:51.400> that's<00:02:52.300> just

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
want to use anything else that's just

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.270 
want to use anything else that's just
regular<00:02:52.840> tap<00:02:53.050> water<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.590> looks<00:02:53.800> really<00:02:54.010> good

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
regular tap water it looks really good

2004 well it is basically just a drop of

2004 well it is basically just a drop of
water<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:20.200> tends<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.920> coalesce<00:03:21.400> around<00:03:21.580> small

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060

dust particles in the atmosphere and

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.360 
dust particles in the atmosphere and
grow<00:03:25.450> until<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.410> rains<00:03:27.280> out<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.930> it'll<00:03:28.930> have

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
grow until it rains out and it'll have

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.970 
grow until it rains out and it'll have
dissolved<00:03:30.370> constituents<00:03:31.320> there<00:03:32.320> are<00:03:32.500> minut

aerosol<00:03:33.580> particles<00:03:34.150> an<00:03:34.530> aerosol<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.739> a<00:03:35.890> very

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
aerosol particles an aerosol is a very

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.310 
aerosol particles an aerosol is a very
tiny<00:03:36.459> drop<00:03:36.820> or<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.120> very<00:03:37.269> tiny<00:03:37.480> dust<00:03:37.780> particle

tiny drop or a very tiny dust particle

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.470 
tiny drop or a very tiny dust particle
that<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.640> kept<00:03:39.880> in<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.150> year<00:03:40.299> because

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
that it just kept in the year because

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.880 
that it just kept in the year because
they're<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:40.840> light<00:03:41.080> they<00:03:41.110> don't<00:03:41.470> settle<00:03:41.769> down

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
they're so light they don't settle down

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.420 
they're so light they don't settle down
and<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.970> rain<00:03:43.150> actually<00:03:43.480> collects<00:03:44.430> this

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
and so the rain actually collects this

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.690 
and so the rain actually collects this
material<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:46.750> its<00:03:46.989> droplets<00:03:47.500> we<00:03:48.310> took<00:03:48.519> the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
material in its droplets we took the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.280 
material in its droplets we took the
little<00:03:48.880> raindrop<00:03:49.330> values<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.989> reverse

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
little raindrop values and reverse

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.650 
little raindrop values and reverse
osmosis<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:51.430> little<00:03:51.730> particle<00:03:52.209> around<00:03:52.510> the

osmosis the little particle around the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.660 
osmosis the little particle around the
raindrop<00:03:53.080> we<00:03:54.040> removed<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:55.650> well<00:03:56.670> they

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
raindrop we removed that well they

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:05.860 
raindrop we removed that well they
didn't

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870

one<00:04:10.210> hot<00:04:10.480> day<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:11.050> was<00:04:11.650> leaving<00:04:12.310> work<00:04:12.760> after<00:04:13.240> I

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
one hot day I was leaving work after I

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.120 
one hot day I was leaving work after I
ran<00:04:13.480> out<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.720> water<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:14.200> go<00:04:14.319> home<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.800> get<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:14.950> new

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
ran out of water to go home to get a new

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.610 
ran out of water to go home to get a new
bottle<00:04:15.400> of<00:04:15.610> water<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.930> thought<00:04:17.170> well<00:04:17.410> hell

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
bottle of water and I thought well hell

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.470 
bottle of water and I thought well hell
I<00:04:17.769> should<00:04:17.799> bottle<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:18.459> stuff<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:19.030> now<00:04:19.420> we

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
I should bottle this stuff and now we

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.260 
I should bottle this stuff and now we
have<00:04:19.739> we<00:04:20.739> have<00:04:20.829> another<00:04:21.100> avenue<00:04:21.820> for<00:04:21.850> tank

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
have we have another avenue for tank

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.200 
have we have another avenue for tank
town<00:04:22.510> bottled<00:04:23.320> water<00:04:23.550> help<00:04:24.550> people<00:04:24.910> collect

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
town bottled water help people collect

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.650 
town bottled water help people collect
water<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:26.169> we're<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.800> hold<00:04:26.950> on<00:04:27.130> rainwater

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
water so we're just a hold on rainwater

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.990 
water so we're just a hold on rainwater
you<00:04:28.660> can't<00:04:29.020> get<00:04:29.350> better<00:04:29.560> water<00:04:29.890> water<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.850> in

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
you can't get better water water is in

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.790 
you can't get better water water is in
its<00:04:31.120> purest<00:04:31.480> form<00:04:31.690> before<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.440> hits<00:04:32.620> the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
its purest form before it hits the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.310 
its purest form before it hits the
ground<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.340> that<00:04:33.910> just<00:04:34.210> makes<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.810> huge

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
ground and that just makes a huge

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.130 
ground and that just makes a huge
difference<00:04:35.890> some<00:04:36.850> people<00:04:37.180> say<00:04:37.419> that<00:04:37.450> you've

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
difference some people say that you've

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.230 
difference some people say that you've
got<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.530> have<00:04:38.710> when<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.340> drink<00:04:39.640> water<00:04:39.910> it's

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
got to have when you drink water it's

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.730 
got to have when you drink water it's
got<00:04:40.419> to<00:04:40.510> have<00:04:40.630> stuff<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.169> because<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.530> need

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
got to have stuff in it because you need

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.060 
got to have stuff in it because you need
the<00:04:41.860> minerals<00:04:42.370> well<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.870> is<00:04:44.080> so<00:04:44.380> wrong<00:04:44.680> you

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
the minerals well that is so wrong you

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.460 
the minerals well that is so wrong you
should<00:04:45.640> drink<00:04:45.820> water<00:04:46.120> for<00:04:46.480> what's<00:04:46.720> not<00:04:47.020> in<00:04:47.260> it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
should drink water for what's not in it

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.409 
should drink water for what's not in it
all<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.220> water<00:04:48.370> from<00:04:48.430> our<00:04:48.640> aquifers<00:04:49.150> like<00:04:49.300> the

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
all the water from our aquifers like the

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.880 
all the water from our aquifers like the
Edwards<00:04:49.690> Aquifer<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.380> indeed<00:04:50.620> from<00:04:50.740> the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
Edwards Aquifer and indeed from the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.940 
Edwards Aquifer and indeed from the
Colorado<00:04:51.100> River<00:04:51.520> is<00:04:51.850> rainwater<00:04:52.810> it's<00:04:53.680> just

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
Colorado River is rainwater it's just

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.920 
Colorado River is rainwater it's just
had<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.100> longer<00:04:54.370> time<00:04:54.700> to<00:04:54.730> flow<00:04:55.570> through<00:04:55.810> the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
had a longer time to flow through the

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.159 
had a longer time to flow through the
soil<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.620> solve<00:04:57.430> more<00:04:57.760> mineral<00:04:58.240> constituents

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
soil to solve more mineral constituents

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.560 
soil to solve more mineral constituents
and<00:04:59.350> so<00:05:00.280> it'd<00:05:00.400> be<00:05:00.430> more<00:05:00.700> saline<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.270> if<00:05:01.360> you<00:05:01.450> go

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
and so it'd be more saline and if you go

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.470 
and so it'd be more saline and if you go
to<00:05:01.660> some<00:05:01.990> places<00:05:02.370> where<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.910> water<00:05:04.090> is<00:05:04.210> very

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
to some places where the water is very

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.080 
to some places where the water is very
old<00:05:04.810> its<00:05:05.260> or<00:05:05.560> it's<00:05:06.490> going<00:05:06.640> through<00:05:06.820> a<00:05:06.880> certain

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
old its or it's going through a certain

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.610 
old its or it's going through a certain
type<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.390> rock<00:05:07.750> like<00:05:08.020> what's<00:05:08.230> going<00:05:08.470> through

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
type of rock like what's going through

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.740 
type of rock like what's going through
rock<00:05:08.830> salt<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.340> becomes<00:05:09.669> very<00:05:09.790> salty<00:05:10.270> of<00:05:10.510> too

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
rock salt it becomes very salty of too

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.560 
rock salt it becomes very salty of too
salty<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.169> drink<00:05:11.560> by<00:05:12.280> our<00:05:12.430> health<00:05:13.060> standards

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
salty to drink by our health standards

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.290 
salty to drink by our health standards
that<00:05:13.720> we<00:05:13.870> have<00:05:13.960> set<00:05:14.430> there's<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:15.729> little<00:05:15.760> fresh

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
that we have set there's so little fresh

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.780 
that we have set there's so little fresh
water<00:05:16.570> on<00:05:16.810> this<00:05:16.900> planet<00:05:17.260> since<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.250> Colorado

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
water on this planet since the Colorado

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.060 
water on this planet since the Colorado
River<00:05:19.060> doesn't<00:05:19.660> flow<00:05:20.169> to<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.470> ocean<00:05:20.890> or<00:05:21.010> the

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
River doesn't flow to the ocean or the

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.219 
River doesn't flow to the ocean or the
Gulf<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.370> Mexico<00:05:21.880> anymore<00:05:22.390> around<00:05:22.720> there<00:05:22.930> and

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
Gulf of Mexico anymore around there and

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.960 
Gulf of Mexico anymore around there and
I'll<00:05:23.470> get<00:05:23.650> any<00:05:23.830> more<00:05:23.979> diluted<00:05:24.400> water<00:05:24.669> and

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
I'll get any more diluted water and

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.760 
I'll get any more diluted water and
that's<00:05:25.630> what's<00:05:25.900> happening<00:05:26.320> we're<00:05:26.530> getting

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
that's what's happening we're getting

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.250 
that's what's happening we're getting
big<00:05:27.220> dead<00:05:27.669> zones<00:05:27.970> in<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.300> ocean<00:05:28.660> because<00:05:29.050> of

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
big dead zones in the ocean because of

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.950 
big dead zones in the ocean because of
no<00:05:29.890> fresh<00:05:30.190> water<00:05:30.220> what<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.360> make<00:05:31.510> people<00:05:31.690> get

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
no fresh water what to make people get

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.080 
no fresh water what to make people get
too<00:05:32.110> much<00:05:32.290> pollution<00:05:32.650> we're<00:05:33.400> sucking<00:05:33.790> water

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
too much pollution we're sucking water

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.540 
too much pollution we're sucking water
out<00:05:34.270> of<00:05:34.390> out<00:05:34.840> of<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.050> aquifers<00:05:35.800> faster<00:05:36.280> than<00:05:36.460> I

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
out of out of the aquifers faster than I

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.690 
out of out of the aquifers faster than I
can<00:05:36.580> recharge<00:05:37.210> so<00:05:38.140> rainwater<00:05:38.650> in<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.250> future

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
can recharge so rainwater in the future

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.630 
can recharge so rainwater in the future
will<00:05:40.120> be<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:41.080> only<00:05:41.290> bottled<00:05:41.950> water<00:05:42.190> you<00:05:42.460> can

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
will be the only bottled water you can

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.700 
will be the only bottled water you can
get<00:05:42.880> it's<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:43.479> resource<00:05:44.040> it's<00:05:46.500> well<00:05:47.500> basically

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
get it's a resource it's well basically

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.409 
get it's a resource it's well basically
free<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.430> have<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.729> get<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:48.910> collection

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
free you have to get a collection

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.390 
free you have to get a collection
service<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:49.990> system<00:05:50.470> for<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:50.770> but<00:05:51.280> it's

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
service a system for it but it's

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.180 
service a system for it but it's
something<00:05:51.580> we<00:05:51.789> should<00:05:52.000> be<00:05:52.030> using<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:53.470> I<00:05:53.979> think

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
something we should be using and I think

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.350 
something we should be using and I think
we're<00:05:54.280> going<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.460> see<00:05:54.520> more<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:54.880> it<00:05:55.120> in<00:05:55.150> the

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
we're going to see more of it in the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.240 
we're going to see more of it in the
future<00:05:55.510> if<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:56.380> tell<00:05:56.650> somebody<00:05:56.919> it's

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
future if you tell somebody it's

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.100 
future if you tell somebody it's
rainwater<00:05:57.820> they<00:05:58.090> say<00:05:58.270> yeah<00:05:58.510> right

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
rainwater they say yeah right

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.310 
rainwater they say yeah right
you<00:05:59.200> know<00:05:59.290> they<00:05:59.980> don't<00:06:00.130> really<00:06:00.400> believe<00:06:00.850> it

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
you know they don't really believe it

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.200 
you know they don't really believe it
because<00:06:02.320> they<00:06:02.740> they<00:06:03.100> hear<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.490> stories<00:06:03.940> how

because they they hear the stories how
most<00:06:05.170> of<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.530> bottled<00:06:05.920> water<00:06:06.130> is<00:06:06.340> just<00:06:06.520> tap

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
most of the bottled water is just tap

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.210 
most of the bottled water is just tap
water<00:06:07.150> that<00:06:07.480> somebody<00:06:08.350> put<00:06:08.560> in<00:06:08.710> a<00:06:08.800> bottle<00:06:09.160> and

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
put a name on it Richards is pure

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.380 
put a name on it Richards is pure
rainwater<00:06:12.670> and<00:06:12.910> it's<00:06:13.780> highly<00:06:14.110> treated<00:06:14.860> and

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
rainwater and it's highly treated and

rainwater and it's highly treated and
purified<00:06:16.390> I<00:06:16.750> mean<00:06:17.650> rainwater<00:06:18.070> to<00:06:18.220> need

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
purified I mean rainwater to need

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.480 
purified I mean rainwater to need
purifying<00:06:19.090> but<00:06:19.420> he<00:06:19.650> purifies<00:06:20.650> it<00:06:20.680> to<00:06:21.160> the<00:06:21.280> end

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490

purifying but he purifies it to the end
everybody's<00:06:22.210> interested<00:06:22.720> in<00:06:22.870> this<00:06:22.990> rain

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
everybody's interested in this rain

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.440 
everybody's interested in this rain
water<00:06:23.440> or<00:06:23.620> not<00:06:23.770> because<00:06:24.040> it's<00:06:24.430> you<00:06:25.270> know<00:06:25.300> it's

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
water or not because it's you know it's

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.330 
water or not because it's you know it's
so<00:06:25.750> precious<00:06:26.050> I<00:06:26.500> just<00:06:26.770> started<00:06:27.070> to<00:06:27.160> think

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
so precious I just started to think

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.050 
so precious I just started to think
about<00:06:27.810> with<00:06:28.810> rain<00:06:29.050> water<00:06:29.280> that's<00:06:30.280> totally<00:06:30.790> you

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
about with rain water that's totally you

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.210
