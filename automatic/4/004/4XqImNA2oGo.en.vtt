driven<00:00:10.530> them<00:00:10.740> yet<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.250> going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> be

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
driven them yet so this is going to be

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.400 
driven them yet so this is going to be
the<00:00:11.670> first<00:00:11.969> time<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.269> ever<00:00:12.599> drive<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.200> them

anyway let's uh let's get into the sim
kind<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.760> excited<00:00:36.149> about<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.540> I've<00:00:36.899> heard<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
kind of excited about this I've heard a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.959 
kind of excited about this I've heard a
lot<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.829> good<00:00:37.980> things<00:00:38.250> I've<00:00:38.460> been<00:00:38.489> waiting

months to finally you know have all this
stuff<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> amps<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.750> transducers<00:00:43.260> I've

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
stuff have the amps and transducers I've

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
stuff have the amps and transducers I've
pushed<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> buttons<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.079> Tsim<00:00:46.469> vibe<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.950> like

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
pushed the buttons in Tsim vibe to like

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.729 
pushed the buttons in Tsim vibe to like
feel<00:00:47.399> each<00:00:47.610> area<00:00:47.969> vibrate<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> rears<00:00:49.469> feel

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
feel each area vibrate the rears feel

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
feel each area vibrate the rears feel
really<00:00:50.039> separate<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.969> Front's<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.390> kind<00:00:51.570> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
really separate the Front's are kind of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
really separate the Front's are kind of
close<00:00:51.809> together<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.410> that's<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.920> really

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
close together but that's all really

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
close together but that's all really
boxed<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.480> need<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> maybe

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
boxed in so I think I just need to maybe

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
boxed in so I think I just need to maybe
redesign<00:00:55.680> my<00:00:55.800> rig<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> bit<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.879> better

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
redesign my rig a bit to get a better

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.990 
redesign my rig a bit to get a better
feeling<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.649> definitely<00:00:59.309> feel<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
feeling but I can definitely feel it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.369 
feeling but I can definitely feel it
there<00:01:00.180> there's<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> difference<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.199> not

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
there there's a difference it's just not

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.630 
there there's a difference it's just not
as<00:01:02.390> acute<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> difference<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.379> rears<00:01:05.040> so

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
as acute of a difference as the rears so

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.830 
as acute of a difference as the rears so
I'm<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.090> sure<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.270> I've<00:01:06.510> got<00:01:06.540> my

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
I didn't know if I expected that to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.770 
I didn't know if I expected that to
happen<00:02:28.519> it's<00:02:28.819> definitely<00:02:29.239> not<00:02:29.300> like<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.540> three

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
happen it's definitely not like a three

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.949 
happen it's definitely not like a three
degree<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.200> freedom<00:02:30.880> rig<00:02:31.880> but<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
degree of freedom rig but the like the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.100 
degree of freedom rig but the like the
fact<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.349> I<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:33.650> feel<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.280> much<00:02:34.900> it's<00:02:35.900> almost

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
fact that I can feel so much it's almost

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.729 
fact that I can feel so much it's almost
like<00:02:36.440> my<00:02:36.970> steering<00:02:37.970> doesn't<00:02:38.540> exist<00:02:39.140> like

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
like my steering doesn't exist like

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.210 
like my steering doesn't exist like
there's<00:02:39.980> nothing<00:02:40.430> there<00:02:42.610> it's<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:44.090> all<00:02:44.269> the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
there's nothing there it's just all the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.110 
there's nothing there it's just all the
the<00:02:46.220> rig<00:02:46.489> itself<00:02:47.980> that's<00:02:48.980> making<00:02:49.459> noise<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.940> can

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
the rig itself that's making noise I can

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.180 
the rig itself that's making noise I can
feel<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.630> engine<00:02:50.780> kinda<00:02:51.319> in<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.620> back<00:02:51.650> more

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
feel the engine kinda in the back more

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.309 
feel the engine kinda in the back more
than<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.370> front<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.849> don't<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.209> if<00:02:53.450> SCIM<00:02:54.110> vibe

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
than the front I don't know if SCIM vibe

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.630 
than the front I don't know if SCIM vibe
picked<00:02:54.590> up<00:02:54.709> on<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.069> that's<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.310> default

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
picked up on that if that's the default

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.960 
picked up on that if that's the default
or<00:02:55.970> it's<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:57.500> nature<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.459> current

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.800 
bumps this is I felt everything just on
the<00:04:25.110> left<00:04:25.350> side<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.800> car<00:04:26.010> there<00:04:26.280> where

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
the left side of the car there where

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.970 
the left side of the car there where
where<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.870> was<00:04:27.990> vibrating<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.650> was<00:04:28.740> worried

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
where it was vibrating I was worried

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.590 
where it was vibrating I was worried
about<00:04:29.040> my<00:04:29.190> transducers<00:04:29.970> being<00:04:30.180> too<00:04:30.390> close

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
about my transducers being too close

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.180 
about my transducers being too close
together<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.230> not<00:04:31.350> being<00:04:31.530> able<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.800> make<00:04:32.010> that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
together and not being able to make that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.430 
together and not being able to make that
distinction<00:04:32.640> and<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.510> fact<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:33.840> my<00:04:34.020> rig<00:04:34.260> is

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
distinction and the fact that my rig is

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.240 
distinction and the fact that my rig is
so<00:04:34.650> solidly<00:04:35.160> built<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:36.860> thought<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:37.890> might<00:04:38.130> have

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
so solidly built I thought I might have

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.780 
so solidly built I thought I might have
to<00:04:38.340> have<00:04:38.520> sort<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.060> some<00:04:39.270> zones<00:04:39.980> 400<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.520> crash

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790
