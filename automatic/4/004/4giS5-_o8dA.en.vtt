00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.510
 hello very good everyone here jofre 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.549
 commenting and well I bring them the way 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.740
 online of this aspect for many I 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.390
 I've asked to see how it looks and nothing 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.310
 first thing we're going to do is a student 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.410
 well at least it's not that it's too far 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.840
 are typical of the shooter, not the 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.540
 campaign mode a standby mode a mode 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.099
 of claire classes with your skills 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.710
 complete you are unlocking as you go 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.119
 advancing the levels and little more the 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.340
 weapons, there are some that are good 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.630
 others with more backward movement and others with 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.270
 least of all 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.750
 one is that they surprise and that is the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.520
 simply host more than the same 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.960
 once before starting the game 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.700
 we choose our class 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.870
 predetermined that we can get up to 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.239
 5 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.770
 Well, we started our game yes 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.140
 very well they know what to do especially 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.970
 with a new fight little by little from the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.310
 that is going to come 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.520
 talma corner people waiting for you like 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.520
 now 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.480
 if a corner after getting married 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.630
 die a model and keep dying and 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.460
 follow 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.040
 I commit suicide 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.690
 for good to keep dying and so 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.430
 unquestionably all this is when you 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.810
 realize one thing look what they are 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.650
 making your teammates 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.970
 campear keep changing 7 champion 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.229
 blatantly that 's what they are 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.270
 doing in during the whole game 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.700
 then so you realize that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.550
 you go for the enemies and kill one 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.840
 and you say you hit for being killed one and 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.880
 such look look look where I hope they kill you 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.679
 that's what I see and good follow 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.350
 killing people because you like them with the 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.300
 game but good they are there rapping and 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.619
 follow if you follow and continue do not kill yourself 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.090
 nobody but they keep you have a 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.189
 shot from to take for ass 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.630
 and good to realize that you stay in 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.859
 a corner camping you too 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.219
 doing what they are doing 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.890
 them and that's when you get a game 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.220
 half decent and I say half decent 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.229
 because it's waiting and waiting and waiting 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.110
 be from a corner that will pass year because 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.500
 is what makes you and is what you are forced 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.660
 to do at all times and in all places 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 this must have been the longest streak 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.610
 I have done in two hours 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.020
 the truth that the game looks good 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.120
 cooperative after I realized you 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.860
 only played to what is the duel for 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.210
 equipment the other modes by the I have 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.400
 to go unlocking with time 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.710
 I suppose it will have other modes because the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.960
 way to play other things and they will be 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.520
 well I guess when you have goals not 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.060
 that enemies have a goal 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.250
 but as everything is as well as what 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.110
 I'm seeing now , that's what I'm 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.740
 enjoying myself now of this game is 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.880
 null 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.070
 surely null you come weight because 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.430
 because it is that if this is what it is 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.310
 the paradise of the campero this is orgy 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.860
 camper and land is already a pass 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.750
 last is that it comes to such form 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.420
 mine that uncle has not moved in all 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.650
 the game that is up there has not been 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.800
 moved throughout the game of that 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.180
 zone and it's like for above and still 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.230
 over 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.489
 more there and it kills you the connection here it 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.879
 much much much good note 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.709
 to other things the responsos sometimes 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.329
 pretty bad more than anything because 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.609
 you always go out in an area during a 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.409
 time another thing that I like 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.420
 very much and that is what you are going to see now 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.480
 do not hear a noise is that in the middle of 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.209
 heading there is a sandstorm what 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.099
 which radar becomes cloudy and you lose the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.750
 visual contact of the enemies if you 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.069
 It costs a little more to walk because the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.400
 Uncle has with forced movements 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.769
 it's a pass, it's not a pioneer in this, 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.930
 that the one charter 3 as you know also 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.749
 he implanted what is in the online mode 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.760
 that is middle of nowhere because there is a 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:01.370
 storm was quite interesting and 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.590
 quite understood as it gives you a 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.470
 pause do not give a half break of the game 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.780
 in the middle of the action 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.350
 after playing a couple of hours the way 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.110
 online I realized that they are what it is 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.870
 be crouched all the time and when 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.579
 see someone go by can teach him and 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.190
 have the luck to kill him because as 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.050
 does not see the senses around and silver me 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.920
 already leaving aside neither side connection 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.930
 I guess that will be why not also my 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.250
 little skill to command none frame 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.380
 that I am 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.320
 the radar is not that it works very 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.580
 well and what is the ways to catch 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.360
 for example the zip line that you wear 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.610
 before committing suicide and that had given 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.860
 to the button there was no button to put me 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.740
 the zip line and if you move more next 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.430
 a next platform that happens that does not 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.980
 it worked 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.090
 I do not know if Mojo is problem I do not think 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.800
 that is command problem because 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.840
 works perfectly so that equal 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.470
 there are little bushes in the game takes from 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.760
 control then the game is not not that 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.890
 have the kinematics very 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.490
 spectacular nor way to play be 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.740
 very much but I think it rewards too much 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.040
 the people who know the maps and the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.960
 people who play many hours 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.400
 and because he has better skills 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.380
 detect and those that we started by the 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.900
 truth is we have a very bad time that happens to 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.850
 I think it's fucking mother but people 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.730
 which starts then also likes it from time 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.800
 in when it kills not and always not so much 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.050
 frustration not at the beginning and good 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.640
 much greater already in fact that what a 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.620
 see how in online mode and here I 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.590
 I bring here you can see it for me I do not 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.660
 I do not like to change a lot 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.640
 ways to move and the shape of the 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.650
 enemies that came to you and too 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.990
 champion I do not like I like it more the sack 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.150
 and well I guess it will be all via 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.800
 I train the thing I was taken like the 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.510
 favorite would be very much and if they want 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.370
 see another game world because nothing 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.210
 say it comment and do not be 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.479
 next video goodbye 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.479
