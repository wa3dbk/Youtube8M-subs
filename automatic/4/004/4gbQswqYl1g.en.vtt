so<00:00:12.350> today<00:00:12.920> we're<00:00:13.160> gonna<00:00:13.220> look<00:00:13.490> at<00:00:13.820> one<00:00:14.210> of<00:00:14.330> the

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
so today we're gonna look at one of the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.270 
so today we're gonna look at one of the
reasons<00:00:14.840> I'm<00:00:15.350> big<00:00:15.860> fan<00:00:16.219> of<00:00:16.490> Rockwell<00:00:17.300> cubes

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
reasons I'm big fan of Rockwell cubes

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.910 
reasons I'm big fan of Rockwell cubes
people<00:00:19.280> have<00:00:19.400> asked<00:00:19.700> me<00:00:19.820> why<00:00:20.270> or<00:00:20.870> what<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:21.620> use

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
people have asked me why or what I use

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.700 
people have asked me why or what I use
to<00:00:21.950> plant<00:00:22.850> my<00:00:23.060> seed<00:00:23.360> starts<00:00:23.960> what's<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.500> best

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
to plant my seed starts what's the best

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.570 
to plant my seed starts what's the best
thing<00:00:24.860> to<00:00:24.920> use<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:26.560> why<00:00:27.560> I<00:00:27.590> use<00:00:27.860> them<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:28.340> I'm

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
thing to use and why I use them so I'm

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.070 
thing to use and why I use them so I'm
just<00:00:28.700> gonna<00:00:28.789> have<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.060> quick<00:00:29.270> video<00:00:29.690> to<00:00:30.050> show

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
just gonna have a quick video to show

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.000 
just gonna have a quick video to show
you<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:31.400> prism<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:32.180> their<00:00:33.110> little<00:00:33.320> cons<00:00:33.650> from

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
you the prism and their little cons from

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.290 
you the prism and their little cons from
using<00:00:34.310> Rockwell<00:00:36.520> so<00:00:37.520> first<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:37.910> all<00:00:38.000> let's

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
using Rockwell so first of all let's

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.840 
using Rockwell so first of all let's
just<00:00:38.390> clarify<00:00:38.720> I've<00:00:39.440> been<00:00:39.739> working<00:00:40.550> on<00:00:40.670> with

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
just clarify I've been working on with

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.970 
just clarify I've been working on with
the<00:00:40.910> hydroponics<00:00:41.570> for<00:00:41.930> around<00:00:42.170> about<00:00:42.440> 4<00:00:42.739> years

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
the hydroponics for around about 4 years

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.360 
the hydroponics for around about 4 years
now

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
now

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.750 
now
I've<00:00:44.060> tried<00:00:44.300> lots<00:00:44.570> of<00:00:44.750> different<00:00:45.079> things<00:00:45.320> and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
I've tried lots of different things and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.610 
I've tried lots of different things and
the<00:00:46.760> images<00:00:47.300> you're<00:00:47.450> watching<00:00:47.870> right<00:00:48.050> now<00:00:48.079> are

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
the images you're watching right now are

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.840 
the images you're watching right now are
my<00:00:49.100> successes<00:00:49.610> using<00:00:50.450> rockwool<00:00:50.809> cubes<00:00:50.840> so

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
my successes using rockwool cubes so

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.000 
my successes using rockwool cubes so
although<00:00:52.850> I'm<00:00:53.270> not<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.780> greatest<00:00:54.410> authority

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
although I'm not the greatest authority

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.490 
although I'm not the greatest authority
on<00:00:55.040> hydroponics<00:00:55.850> these<00:00:56.360> are<00:00:56.600> my<00:00:56.780> successes

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
on hydroponics these are my successes

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.400 
on hydroponics these are my successes
and<00:00:57.680> my<00:00:57.950> stories<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.180> just<00:00:59.899> take<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.079> into

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
and my stories so just take that into

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.930 
and my stories so just take that into
account<00:01:00.440> when<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:01.250> watch<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.700> video

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.570 

number<00:01:04.660> one<00:01:04.870> what<00:01:05.650> is<00:01:05.680> Rockwall<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.340> what<00:01:06.460> is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
number one what is Rockwall and what is

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.080 
number one what is Rockwall and what is
it<00:01:06.730> properties<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:08.320> Rockwall<00:01:08.800> is<00:01:09.130> basically

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
it properties now Rockwall is basically

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.570 
it properties now Rockwall is basically
what<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.510> says<00:01:10.750> on<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:10.990> tin<00:01:11.229> it's<00:01:12.070> actually

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
what it says on the tin it's actually

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.880 
what it says on the tin it's actually
rock<00:01:12.850> that's<00:01:13.180> been<00:01:13.270> heated<00:01:13.660> to<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.410> very<00:01:14.500> high

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
rock that's been heated to a very high

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.280 
rock that's been heated to a very high
temperature<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.670> then<00:01:16.150> spun<00:01:16.630> out<00:01:16.780> into<00:01:17.170> the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
temperature and then spun out into the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.250 
temperature and then spun out into the
consistency<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.250> wall<00:01:19.060> much<00:01:19.510> like<00:01:19.720> candy

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
consistency of wall much like candy

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.000 
consistency of wall much like candy
floss<00:01:21.270> now<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.690> properties<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.320> rock<00:01:23.800> will

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
floss now the properties of rock will

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.430 
floss now the properties of rock will
make<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.580> such<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.820> great<00:01:26.340> starter<00:01:27.340> and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
make it such a great starter and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.400 
make it such a great starter and
stabilizer<00:01:29.440> for<00:01:30.310> hydroponics<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.869> it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
stabilizer for hydroponics is it it

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.090 
stabilizer for hydroponics is it it
basically<00:01:32.979> has<00:01:33.369> two<00:01:34.119> properties<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.590> ability

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
basically has two properties the ability

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.320 
basically has two properties the ability
to<00:01:36.340> hold<00:01:36.880> moisture<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.630> wick<00:01:38.080> moisture<00:01:38.290> and

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
to hold moisture and wick moisture and

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.719 
to hold moisture and wick moisture and
the<00:01:40.330> abilities<00:01:40.810> are<00:01:40.930> all<00:01:41.020> sold<00:01:41.320> air<00:01:41.680> in<00:01:42.100> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
the abilities are all sold air in the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.420 
the abilities are all sold air in the
same<00:01:42.970> space<00:01:43.560> which<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.710> really<00:01:44.740> really

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
same space which is really really

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.940 
same space which is really really
important<00:01:46.090> when<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.990> starting<00:01:47.410> seeds<00:01:47.680> or

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
important when you starting seeds or

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.700 
important when you starting seeds or
growing<00:01:48.280> any<00:01:48.490> sort<00:01:48.789> of<00:01:48.820> plants<00:01:49.240> one<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.560> don't

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
growing any sort of plants one you don't

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.560 
growing any sort of plants one you don't
want<00:01:50.920> something<00:01:51.160> that's<00:01:51.520> gonna<00:01:52.060> hold<00:01:52.270> too

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
want something that's gonna hold too

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.359 
want something that's gonna hold too
much<00:01:52.750> water<00:01:53.020> not<00:01:53.470> enough<00:01:53.500> air<00:01:53.979> because<00:01:54.250> she's

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
much water not enough air because she's

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.430 
much water not enough air because she's
gonna<00:01:54.490> drown<00:01:54.729> your<00:01:54.970> plants<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:56.289> don't

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
gonna drown your plants and you don't

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.719 
gonna drown your plants and you don't
want<00:01:56.560> something<00:01:56.740> with<00:01:56.950> too<00:01:57.130> much<00:01:57.250> air<00:01:57.520> and

want something with too much air and

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.130 
want something with too much air and
enough<00:01:58.000> water<00:01:58.240> because<00:01:58.570> they're<00:01:58.720> gonna<00:01:58.840> dry

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
enough water because they're gonna dry

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.560

property<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.170> doing<00:02:02.530> both<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.950> those<00:02:04.649> number

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
property of doing both of those number

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.240 
property of doing both of those number
two<00:02:05.830> ease<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.340> use<00:02:07.709> rockwool<00:02:08.709> cubes<00:02:08.740> are<00:02:09.099> very

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
two ease of use rockwool cubes are very

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.750 
two ease of use rockwool cubes are very
easy<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.550> use<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:10.569> pre<00:02:10.990> soak<00:02:11.290> them<00:02:11.640> before<00:02:12.640> you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
easy to use you pre soak them before you

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.780 
easy to use you pre soak them before you
use<00:02:12.790> them<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:14.560> put<00:02:14.920> them<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.160> tray<00:02:15.310> of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
use them I just put them in a tray of

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.610 
use them I just put them in a tray of
water<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.420> allows<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.720> moisture<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.230> wake<00:02:17.440> up

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
water it allows the moisture to wake up

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.230 
water it allows the moisture to wake up
into<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.720> rock<00:02:19.900> wall<00:02:20.140> cube<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:22.000> don't

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
into the rock wall cube and you don't

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.030
