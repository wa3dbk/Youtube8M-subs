meet<00:00:09.889> the<00:00:10.190> air<00:00:10.370> pod<00:00:11.200> it<00:00:12.200> has<00:00:12.500> only<00:00:12.650> three

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
meet the air pod it has only three

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.150 
meet the air pod it has only three
wheels<00:00:13.480> two<00:00:14.480> doors<00:00:14.840> and<00:00:15.200> doesn't<00:00:15.769> even<00:00:15.920> have<00:00:16.130> a

wheels two doors and doesn't even have a
steering<00:00:16.640> wheel<00:00:16.810> but<00:00:17.810> its<00:00:17.990> creators<00:00:18.529> think

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
steering wheel but its creators think

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.679 
steering wheel but its creators think
this<00:00:19.160> could<00:00:19.640> be<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:19.790> future<00:00:20.330> of<00:00:20.360> urban

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
this could be the future of urban

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.319 
this could be the future of urban
transportation<00:00:24.279> okay<00:00:25.279> so<00:00:25.340> this<00:00:25.849> is<00:00:26.090> the

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
transportation okay so this is the

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.630 
transportation okay so this is the
airport<00:00:26.899> and<00:00:27.169> I've<00:00:27.290> just<00:00:27.529> ran<00:00:27.950> it<00:00:28.099> for<00:00:28.399> a<00:00:28.460> while

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
airport and I've just ran it for a while

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.810 
airport and I've just ran it for a while
and<00:00:29.529> as<00:00:30.529> you've<00:00:30.739> seen<00:00:30.860> it's<00:00:30.980> very<00:00:31.160> giant<00:00:31.700> and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
and as you've seen it's very giant and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.060 
and as you've seen it's very giant and
you<00:00:32.419> can<00:00:32.540> see<00:00:32.660> there<00:00:32.809> is<00:00:32.870> no<00:00:33.110> driving<00:00:33.770> wheel

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
you can see there is no driving wheel

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.410 
you can see there is no driving wheel
just<00:00:34.370> a<00:00:34.550> joystick<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.090> it's<00:00:35.239> very

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
just a joystick and it's very

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.180 
just a joystick and it's very
comfortable<00:00:35.930> because<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:36.170> are<00:00:36.320> liking<00:00:36.559> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
very simply it is just using the air we

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.000 
very simply it is just using the air we
just<00:01:40.000> compressed<00:01:40.390> into<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.690> tank<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.110> then<00:01:41.920> we

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
just compressed into a tank and then we

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.530 
just compressed into a tank and then we
use<00:01:42.160> this<00:01:42.340> compressed<00:01:42.760> air<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.090> move<00:01:43.270> some

use renewable energy to compress the air

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.030 
use renewable energy to compress the air
if<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.540> use<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> wind<00:02:39.110> turbine<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.709> compress

if you use a wind turbine to compress

if you use a wind turbine to compress
the<00:02:40.190> air<00:02:40.220> then<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.060> emission<00:02:41.209> will<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.630> quite

we<00:02:45.860> know<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.160> today<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.519> drive<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.850> car<00:02:47.060> into

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
we know that today to drive a car into

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.520 
we know that today to drive a car into
the<00:02:47.360> city<00:02:47.600> we<00:02:47.720> don't<00:02:47.870> need<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.080> lot<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.319> power

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the city we don't need a lot of power

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.680 
the city we don't need a lot of power
and<00:02:48.709> this<00:02:49.549> is<00:02:49.730> why<00:02:49.819> we<00:02:49.970> are<00:02:50.000> using<00:02:50.090> compressed

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
and this is why we are using compressed

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.710 
and this is why we are using compressed
air<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.580> behind<00:02:52.580> all<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.239> very

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
air and behind all this there is a very

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.530 
air and behind all this there is a very
simple<00:02:54.670> technology<00:02:55.670> so<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.269> be<00:02:56.420> very

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
simple technology so it can be very

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.910 
simple technology so it can be very
durable<00:02:56.890> efficient<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.239> ecological

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920
