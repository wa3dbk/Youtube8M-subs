what's happening we can be you know the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850

and<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> think<00:01:06.650> this<00:01:07.650> would<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.280> somewhat<00:01:09.270> true

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and I think this would be somewhat true

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
and I think this would be somewhat true

money<00:03:42.130> in<00:03:42.370> more<00:03:43.090> than<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.420> budgets<00:03:43.750> they<00:03:43.900> gave
