00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.960
 metallica of 2012 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.379
 let's use a control oil 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.000
 of type 20 w 50 how to use this 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.000
 Two liter bottle to pour oil 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:26.060
 to see how it's done here we have 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.460
 this from here to the cut to an order 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.400
 of liters let's remove the screw that 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.160
 it's down here 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.489
 exactly the screw in die 11 16 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.050
 because we do not have a die 17 then 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.910
 it depends on how you put it with the side 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.829
 then and if it is that we have if we do not go 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.329
 to use americas keys we are going to 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.949
 make it good the first thing that has to be done 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.800
 to do is put in its right place 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.300
 almost under the screw we're going to do 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.519
 put one while to put the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.290
 hand and unscrew leader we have it to 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.050
 point to leave points to be loose 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.910
 let's move the tray for this side 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.769
 to be able to drop everything while being tedious 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.610
 but then once you do it before 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.610
 grab practice 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.369
 here it would be a little bit the screw that 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.280
 I wanted to hold the camera in a while 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.820
 grab the screw 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.820
 do not 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.899
 and it already comes out with the hand we hope not 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.549
 stain the many everything although here is 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.740
 very important to take care of the orientation of the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.509
 bit that comes out a filter is not 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.509
 between the spring this reaches to see 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.200
 and it continues to drain 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.900
 It's our little filter that we have 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.100
 take care 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.100
 clean also very well 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.150
 this spring we also have to 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.270
 look after 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.829
 Do not miss us 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.909
 once we have our things 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.909
 neat and clean 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.689
 our ties our resort in our 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.159
 stopper we will continue to put them for 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.590
 then put the oil on the part of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.630
 up the oil is going to put on this 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.190
 part once and put the cap 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.539
 below but here we are going to put 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.220
 our in grace the top part 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.080
 then we have nothing to cover 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.540
 our con icomos kid of the art res 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.870
 down and then our filter was going 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.870
 up 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.050
 well here already after struggling a 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.590
 little with the spring then everything 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.590
 putting what 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.709
 good and in this part after having 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.480
 cleaned the entire area here from the 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.250
 nut all the leftovers of oil that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.510
 they were outside and we cleaned well all 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.489
 together back and we will proceed to 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.840
 pour the liter of oil then in this 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.690
 part let's grab a piece of paper 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.310
 we are going to open the oil with this not 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.860
 had to cut out we 're going to use the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.860
 Funnel here is very accurate 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.700
 and show our oil 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.720
 ah 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.830
 i 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.360
 you do not have to already have our 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.360
 cover this was accurate 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.099
 in this way we conclude this 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.099
 video I hope you have served 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.270
 ah
