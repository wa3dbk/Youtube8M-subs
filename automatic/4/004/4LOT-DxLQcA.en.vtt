00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.140
 hello friends today youtube them 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.299
 I will teach how to complete the 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.160
 hey missions fight him back very 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.930
 quick and easy plus they can 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.940
 choose in which mission to play as a 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.609
 Sometimes it takes us a bit to finish 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.530
 the game the slowest way is that you 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.220
 you play it and you pass it the other way is 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.560
 the one that I'm going to teach you 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.779
 besides that it is completed in level 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 normal and heroic in legendary level not 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.840
 I finished it but I passed them to you 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.840
 Advances of what I've already gone through 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.660
 first they will have to have halo installed 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.700
 on your computer and if you do not have it 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.650
 I leave a link in the description of the video 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.040
 to download it and play it fast and 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.040
 easy 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.990
 then you will have to download the file 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.120
 of the levels the link also I leave it 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.290
 in the description of the video I do not 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.290
 I do because I already have it 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.290
 once you have downloaded the file 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.520
 they unzip the password I leave it in 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.520
 the description of the video 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.250
 now the folder that you got the copies 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.610
 in the my game folder and delete the one 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.610
 you had 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.840
 Now you can open the halo game 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.700
 your computer to play the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.890
 levels as you see in the profiles you 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.140
 find in heroic normal mode and 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.060
 legendary just choose the one you want 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.899
 play and you can play the level and the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.899
 mission you want 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.049
 I recommend you play it all yourself 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.049
 but that's your decision 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.170
 I search 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.170
