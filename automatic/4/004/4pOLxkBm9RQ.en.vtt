00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
and it's hard especially this year they

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.350 
and it's hard especially this year they
were<00:00:32.980> playing<00:00:33.219> probably<00:00:33.520> five<00:00:33.879> or<00:00:33.910> six<00:00:34.059> days

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
out seven most of the year so it's

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.069

at<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:50.970> end<00:04:51.000> which<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.590> rather<00:04:52.590> if<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:52.890> can

say you've took full power in but you

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.050
