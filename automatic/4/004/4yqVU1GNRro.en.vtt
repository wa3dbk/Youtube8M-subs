if your smaller plant is looking a

if your smaller plant is looking a
little<00:00:33.390> bit<00:00:33.480> purple<00:00:33.899> underneath<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.530> leaves

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.819 
each of these three spaces you want
nitrogen<00:01:44.729> phosphorus<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.390> potassium<00:01:45.829> in

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.740 
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in
combination<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.909> your<00:01:48.030> liquid<00:01:48.180> fertilizer

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
combination with your liquid fertilizer

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.510 
combination with your liquid fertilizer
so<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> wouldn't<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.009> pure<00:01:50.220> kelp

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
so I wouldn't really use the pure kelp

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.230 
so I wouldn't really use the pure kelp
in<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.820> case

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
in this case

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.620 
in this case
now<00:01:51.960> here's<00:01:52.170> an<00:01:52.320> organic<00:01:53.180> product<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.479> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
now here's an organic product this is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.109 
now here's an organic product this is
made<00:01:54.810> from<00:01:55.079> beet<00:01:55.619> juice<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:57.000> not

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
made from beet juice and you're not

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.340 
made from beet juice and you're not
going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.390> able<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
going to be able to see it but this is a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
going to be able to see it but this is a
six<00:01:58.740> zero<00:01:59.340> zero<00:01:59.790> or<00:01:59.880> nine<00:02:00.270> zero<00:02:00.570> zero<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.810> can't

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
six zero zero or nine zero zero I can't

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.600 
six zero zero or nine zero zero I can't
remember<00:02:01.140> off<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.380> top<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.680> my<00:02:01.890> head<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.460> all

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
remember off the top of my head but all

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
remember off the top of my head but all
this<00:02:02.729> has<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.090> nitrogen<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.780> don't<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.439> want

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this has is nitrogen you don't just want

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
this has is nitrogen you don't just want
nitrogen<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.579> definitely<00:02:06.060> want<00:02:06.240> nitrogen

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
nitrogen you definitely want nitrogen

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.869 
nitrogen you definitely want nitrogen
and<00:02:06.930> phosphorus<00:02:07.710> because<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.459> phosphorus

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and phosphorus because the phosphorus

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.760 
and phosphorus because the phosphorus
will<00:02:09.060> help<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> root<00:02:09.720> growth<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.560> this

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
will help with the root growth now this

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.410 
will help with the root growth now this
is<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.220> organic<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.750> case<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
is not organic in the case of

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.390 
is not organic in the case of
seedlings<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.560> don't<00:02:14.680> mind<00:02:15.130> using

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
seedlings like this I don't mind using

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.940 
seedlings like this I don't mind using
inorganic<00:02:16.360> fertilizer<00:02:17.319> or<00:02:17.620> stuff<00:02:17.920> that's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
inorganic fertilizer or stuff that's

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.640 
inorganic fertilizer or stuff that's
man-made<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:19.180> plants<00:02:19.599> do<00:02:19.840> not<00:02:20.110> know<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
man-made your plants do not know the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.250 
man-made your plants do not know the
difference<00:02:21.120> okay<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:22.480> sort<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.870> mental

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
difference okay so it's sort of a mental

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.410 
difference okay so it's sort of a mental
thing<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.800> if<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.069> only<00:02:24.220> want<00:02:24.459> organic<00:02:24.910> look

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
thing is if you only want organic look

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.150 
thing is if you only want organic look
for<00:02:25.630> an<00:02:25.720> organic<00:02:26.110> product<00:02:26.349> fish<00:02:26.800> emulsion

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
for an organic product fish emulsion

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.920 
for an organic product fish emulsion
would<00:02:27.489> work<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.239> I'm<00:02:28.390> not<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.720> use<00:02:28.810> it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
would work but I'm not going to use it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.660 
would work but I'm not going to use it
in<00:02:29.020> my<00:02:29.110> house<00:02:29.290> because<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.800> smells<00:02:30.100> badly<00:02:30.370> I'll

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
in my house because it smells badly I'll

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.190 
in my house because it smells badly I'll
definitely<00:02:31.060> use<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.390> my<00:02:31.480> greenhouse<00:02:31.780> or

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
definitely use it in my greenhouse or

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.800 
definitely use it in my greenhouse or
out<00:02:32.319> my<00:02:32.500> garden<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.459> indoors<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.420> one<00:02:34.630> has<00:02:34.780> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
out my garden so indoors this one has a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.470 
out my garden so indoors this one has a
nice<00:02:36.030> mix<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.480> main<00:02:38.370> fertilizers<00:02:39.370> for<00:02:40.300> for

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
nice mix of the main fertilizers for for

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.570 
nice mix of the main fertilizers for for
nitrogen<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.200> then<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.319> 16<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:41.980> 18<00:02:42.130> for

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
nitrogen and then a 16 and 18 for

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.199 
nitrogen and then a 16 and 18 for
potassium<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.360> for<00:02:44.110> phosphorus<00:02:44.940> again<00:02:45.940> this

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
potassium and for phosphorus again this

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.580 
potassium and for phosphorus again this
would<00:02:46.390> be<00:02:46.510> half<00:02:46.690> strength<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.500> going

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
would be half strength so this is going

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.320 
would be half strength so this is going
to<00:02:47.650> be<00:02:47.739> like<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> two<00:02:48.190> eight<00:02:48.370> four<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.880> it's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
to be like a two eight four and it's

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.539 
to be like a two eight four and it's
okay<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.989> middle<00:02:50.170> number<00:02:50.410> for<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.220> root

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
okay if the middle number for the root

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.890 
okay if the middle number for the root
development<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.209> phosphorus<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.840> a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
development for the phosphorus is a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.809 
development for the phosphorus is a
little<00:02:53.260> bit<00:02:53.380> higher<00:02:53.560> than<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.860> nitrogen<00:02:54.130> but

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
little bit higher than the nitrogen but

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.610 
little bit higher than the nitrogen but
you<00:02:54.970> want<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.239> cover<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.840> basis<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:56.410> all<00:02:56.590> of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you want to cover the basis for all of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.979 
you want to cover the basis for all of
it<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> really<00:02:58.090> really<00:02:58.600> good

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.729 
it and this is a really really good
liquid<00:02:59.950> fertilizer<00:03:00.430> with<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.209> number<00:03:01.660> 1416<00:03:02.590> it

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
liquid fertilizer with a number 1416 it

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.870 
liquid fertilizer with a number 1416 it
you<00:03:02.860> don't<00:03:03.010> need<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.250> look<00:03:03.370> for<00:03:03.549> Peter's

but you're looking more for numbers that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.780 
but you're looking more for numbers that
are<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.870> know<00:03:08.019> four<00:03:08.350> sixteen<00:03:08.860> eight<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.670> know

nitrogen<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.600> that's<00:03:25.750> too<00:03:26.019> high<00:03:26.230> but<00:03:26.769> again<00:03:27.010> I

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
nitrogen and that's too high but again I

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.860 
nitrogen and that's too high but again I
would<00:03:27.280> use<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.549> at<00:03:27.730> half-strength<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:28.810> it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
would use this at half-strength so it

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.319 
would use this at half-strength so it
would<00:03:29.019> be<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.200> twelve<00:03:29.560> for<00:03:30.070> eight<00:03:30.700> fertilizer

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
would be a twelve for eight fertilizer

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.210 
would be a twelve for eight fertilizer
and<00:03:31.480> again<00:03:31.810> those<00:03:32.380> three<00:03:32.680> numbers<00:03:32.829> I'm<00:03:33.100> not

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
and again those three numbers I'm not

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.710 
and again those three numbers I'm not
going<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.459> tell<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.790> exactly<00:03:34.239> what<00:03:34.450> they<00:03:34.600> have

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
going to tell you exactly what they have

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.900 
going to tell you exactly what they have
to<00:03:34.870> be<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.200> don't<00:03:35.280> really<00:03:36.280> know<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.489> be<00:03:36.700> honest

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
to be I don't really know to be honest

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.120 
to be I don't really know to be honest
with<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.239> everybody<00:03:38.170> will<00:03:38.470> have<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.709> different

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
with you everybody will have a different

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.949 
with you everybody will have a different
opinion<00:03:39.220> but<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.820> want<00:03:40.060> all<00:03:40.239> three<00:03:40.780> numbers

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
opinion but you want all three numbers

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.620 
opinion but you want all three numbers
represented<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.549> want<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.060> use<00:03:43.299> any

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
represented and you want to use any

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.710 
represented and you want to use any
product<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.560> choose<00:03:44.590> at<00:03:45.220> half-strength<00:03:46.060> you

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
product you choose at half-strength you

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.360 
product you choose at half-strength you
can<00:03:46.959> damage<00:03:47.200> your<00:03:47.470> plants<00:03:47.620> if<00:03:48.010> you're<00:03:48.160> using

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
can damage your plants if you're using

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.490 
can damage your plants if you're using
too<00:03:48.640> much<00:03:48.820> fertilizer<00:03:49.060> at<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:50.200> point

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
too much fertilizer at this point

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.759 
too much fertilizer at this point
there's<00:03:50.739> no<00:03:50.920> rain<00:03:51.190> coming<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:51.820> there's<00:03:52.359> little

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
there's no rain coming in there's little

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.550 
there's no rain coming in there's little
areas<00:03:53.769> for<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.310> soil<00:03:54.820> so<00:03:55.350> concentrations<00:03:56.350> of

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
areas for the soil so concentrations of

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.559 
areas for the soil so concentrations of
fertilizer<00:03:57.040> can<00:03:57.519> harm<00:03:57.850> your<00:03:58.030> plants<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.450> they

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
fertilizer can harm your plants and they

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.690 
fertilizer can harm your plants and they
just<00:03:58.840> don't<00:03:59.049> need<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.500> so<00:03:59.650> anyway<00:04:00.459> these<00:04:00.640> are

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
just don't need it so anyway these are

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.970 
just don't need it so anyway these are
some<00:04:01.000> options<00:04:01.390> for<00:04:01.810> taking<00:04:02.350> care<00:04:02.709> of<00:04:02.769> your

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
quickly somewhere between this size of a

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.300 
quickly somewhere between this size of a
tomato<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:08.019> this<00:04:08.560> size<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.950> your<00:04:09.069> tomato

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
use a half-strength liquid fertilizer

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.840 
use a half-strength liquid fertilizer
that<00:04:16.229> represents<00:04:17.229> nitrogen<00:04:17.919> phosphorus<00:04:18.669> and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
that represents nitrogen phosphorus and

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.690 
that represents nitrogen phosphorus and
potassium<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:20.229> numbers<00:04:20.590> hope<00:04:21.580> you
