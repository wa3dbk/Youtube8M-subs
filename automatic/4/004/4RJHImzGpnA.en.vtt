this<00:00:02.060> is<00:00:02.210> our<00:00:02.330> second<00:00:02.659> video<00:00:02.780> of<00:00:02.960> Rob<00:00:03.260> the

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:03.409 
this is our second video of Rob the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:05.860 
this is our second video of Rob the
robot<00:00:03.770> working<00:00:04.299> we're<00:00:05.299> going<00:00:05.450> to<00:00:05.509> show<00:00:05.660> right

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
robot working we're going to show right

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.809 
robot working we're going to show right
now<00:00:05.900> him<00:00:06.290> in<00:00:06.410> action<00:00:06.830> we<00:00:07.040> chose<00:00:07.250> level<00:00:07.609> 4

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:07.819 
now him in action we chose level 4

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.970 
now him in action we chose level 4
because<00:00:08.090> it<00:00:08.210> shows<00:00:08.420> Rob<00:00:08.809> just<00:00:09.170> full<00:00:09.380> potential

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
because it shows Rob just full potential

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.009 
because it shows Rob just full potential
many<00:00:10.639> people<00:00:10.969> have<00:00:11.090> an<00:00:11.210> idea<00:00:11.330> of<00:00:11.570> how<00:00:11.780> Rob

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
many people have an idea of how Rob

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.660 
many people have an idea of how Rob
works<00:00:12.349> but<00:00:12.620> don't<00:00:12.830> really<00:00:13.099> know

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
works but don't really know

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.060 
works but don't really know
-<00:00:14.000> what<00:00:14.179> full<00:00:14.360> extent<00:00:14.780> he<00:00:14.990> goes<00:00:15.500> to<00:00:15.710> town<00:00:16.009> on

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
- what full extent he goes to town on

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.800 
- what full extent he goes to town on
this<00:00:16.369> gyro<00:00:16.640> so<00:00:17.000> we're<00:00:17.510> going<00:00:17.630> to<00:00:17.690> show<00:00:17.779> you

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
this gyro so we're going to show you

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:31.060 
this gyro so we're going to show you
right<00:00:18.020> now<00:00:28.390> get<00:00:29.390> our<00:00:29.539> little<00:00:29.720> point<00:00:30.080> here<00:00:30.439> not

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
right now get our little point here not

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.780 
right now get our little point here not
really<00:00:31.189> relevant<00:00:33.160> not<00:00:34.160> for<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.399> test<00:00:34.610> anyway

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
really relevant not for the test anyway

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.430 
really relevant not for the test anyway
you<00:00:35.210> do<00:00:35.329> need<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.570> collect<00:00:35.840> those<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.140> win<00:00:36.260> the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
you do need to collect those to win the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.400 
you do need to collect those to win the
level<00:00:37.329> all<00:00:38.329> right<00:00:38.570> now<00:00:38.809> here's<00:00:39.050> where<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.260> gets

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
level all right now here's where it gets

00:00:39.410 --> 00:01:26.230 
level all right now here's where it gets
interesting<00:00:39.469> here<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:40.370> go<00:00:40.520> Rob<00:00:40.820> goes

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:39.060 

here's<00:01:27.240> where<00:01:27.480> it<00:01:27.540> gets<00:01:27.690> interesting

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.719 

if<00:01:39.520> they're<00:01:39.850> getting<00:01:40.090> been<00:01:40.540> well

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
if they're getting been well

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:52.070 
if they're getting been well
lift<00:01:43.729> her<00:01:43.939> off

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080 

this<00:01:53.080> is<00:01:53.230> really<00:01:53.440> happening<00:01:53.910> we're<00:01:54.910> pretty

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
this is really happening we're pretty

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.000 
this is really happening we're pretty
baffled<00:01:55.750> with<00:01:55.870> this<00:01:56.020> when<00:01:56.230> we<00:01:56.320> first<00:01:56.560> saw<00:01:56.740> it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
baffled with this when we first saw it

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:14.550 
baffled with this when we first saw it
Nintendo<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:57.670> pretty<00:01:58.150> wild<00:02:13.200> gyro<00:02:14.200> spinning

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
Nintendo it's pretty wild gyro spinning

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.850 
Nintendo it's pretty wild gyro spinning
freely<00:02:14.770> by<00:02:15.070> itself<00:02:16.170> back<00:02:17.170> over<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.530> grab<00:02:17.710> the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
freely by itself back over to grab the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.470 
freely by itself back over to grab the
other<00:02:17.980> one<00:02:18.070> you're<00:02:18.970> going<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.180> need<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.360> do

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
other one you're going to need to do

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.000 
other one you're going to need to do

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
this to be able to open all of the gates

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.980 
this to be able to open all of the gates
and<00:02:21.340> some<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> levels<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.480> fourth<00:02:22.690> level

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
and some of the levels the fourth level

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.360 
and some of the levels the fourth level
is<00:02:23.020> actually<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.500> first<00:02:23.650> level<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.190> shows

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
is actually the first level that shows

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.840 
is actually the first level that shows
you<00:02:24.580> having<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.000> do<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:26.400> yeah<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.820> a

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
you having to do this yeah do it in a

you having to do this yeah do it in a
timely<00:02:28.210> manner<00:02:28.390> because<00:02:28.690> obviously<00:02:28.900> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
timely manner because obviously that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.410 
timely manner because obviously that
gyro<00:02:30.280> over<00:02:30.580> there's<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:33.370> much<00:02:33.520> time<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:34.210> day

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
gyro over there's so much time this day

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:45.460 
gyro over there's so much time this day
is<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.690> pretty<00:02:34.930> well<00:02:35.820> surprise

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.899 

and<00:02:46.610> down<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.000> next<00:02:48.180> button<00:02:49.670> releases<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
and down on the next button releases the

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.720 
and down on the next button releases the
blue<00:02:51.090> tube<00:02:51.329> on<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.780> screen<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:53.129> now<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.370> can

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
blue tube on the screen and now you can

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.630 
blue tube on the screen and now you can
go<00:02:53.939> through<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.870> that's<00:03:01.079> it<00:03:01.379> that's<00:03:02.129> how<00:03:02.340> Rob

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
go through and that's it that's how Rob

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.759 
go through and that's it that's how Rob
works<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.689> can<00:03:03.720> see<00:03:03.989> still<00:03:04.349> spindle
