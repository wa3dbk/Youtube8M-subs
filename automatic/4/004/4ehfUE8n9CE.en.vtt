when<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.700> look<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.150> spinner<00:00:18.630> cell<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.230> was

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
when you look at it spinner cell one was

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.440 
when you look at it spinner cell one was
a<00:00:19.740> benchmark<00:00:20.430> when<00:00:20.790> it<00:00:20.910> came<00:00:21.060> out<00:00:21.090> and

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
a benchmark when it came out and

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.350 
a benchmark when it came out and
splinter<00:00:21.869> cell<00:00:22.080> 3<00:00:22.439> was<00:00:22.980> probably<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.000> best

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
splinter cell 3 was probably the best

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.960 
splinter cell 3 was probably the best
looking<00:00:24.660> game<00:00:25.079> of<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:25.950> last<00:00:26.220> generation<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
looking game of the last generation of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.179 
looking game of the last generation of
consoles<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> was<00:00:28.200> extremely<00:00:28.710> important

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
consoles so it was extremely important

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.880 
consoles so it was extremely important
for<00:00:29.250> us<00:00:29.520> that<00:00:29.550> when<00:00:30.059> we<00:00:30.090> released<00:00:30.720> our<00:00:30.989> spinner

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
for us that when we released our spinner

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
for us that when we released our spinner
cell<00:00:32.130> conviction<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.390> came<00:00:33.600> out<00:00:33.780> as

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
cell conviction that it came out as

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.580 
cell conviction that it came out as
strong<00:00:35.570> we<00:00:36.570> came<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> bunch<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.380> things

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
strong we came up with a bunch of things

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.740 
strong we came up with a bunch of things
that<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:38.219> super<00:00:38.820> interesting<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> first

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that are super interesting so the first

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.810 
that are super interesting so the first
thing<00:00:39.839> that<00:00:40.019> we<00:00:40.109> have<00:00:40.219> is<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.519> called

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
thing that we have is what we called

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
thing that we have is what we called
Project<00:00:42.690> deck<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.140> basically<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.649> we're

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
Project deck so basically what we're

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400 
Project deck so basically what we're
doing<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.160> we're<00:00:44.399> integrating<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
doing is we're integrating in the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.169 
doing is we're integrating in the
environment<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.249> objectives<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> were

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
environment the objectives that were

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.229 
environment the objectives that were
giving<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> player<00:00:49.789> will<00:00:50.789> actually<00:00:51.120> be

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
giving to the player will actually be

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.700 
giving to the player will actually be
telling<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> what's<00:00:51.989> happening<00:00:52.109> or<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
telling you what's happening or the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
telling you what's happening or the
information<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.339> wanted<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> know<00:00:53.850> we'll<00:00:54.600> be

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
information you wanted to know we'll be

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.739 
information you wanted to know we'll be
seeing<00:00:55.339> flashbacks<00:00:56.339> where<00:00:56.879> things<00:00:57.210> projected

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
seeing flashbacks where things projected

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.569 
seeing flashbacks where things projected
on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> walls<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> will<00:00:58.530> explain<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
on the walls that will explain that so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.979 
on the walls that will explain that so
everything<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.390> integrated<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
everything is integrated in the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.110 
everything is integrated in the
environment<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.890> allows<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:02.640> tell

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
environment and it allows you to tell

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
environment and it allows you to tell
the<00:01:03.269> story<00:01:03.539> without<00:01:03.960> taking<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:04.980> control

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the story without taking the control

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.660 
the story without taking the control
from<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> player<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.920> sign<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.190> thinking

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
from the player so what sign is thinking

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.920 
from the player so what sign is thinking
what's<00:01:08.820> happening<00:01:09.180> somewhere<00:01:09.390> else<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
what's happening somewhere else in the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
what's happening somewhere else in the
world<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.530> displayed<00:01:11.070> while<00:01:11.340> you're

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
damaged system so the more you beat up

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.630 
damaged system so the more you beat up
the<00:02:01.930> guy<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.320> get<00:02:02.470> information<00:02:02.770> while<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
the guy to get information while the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.100 
the guy to get information while the
more<00:02:03.850> he's<00:02:03.970> gonna<00:02:04.119> it's<00:02:04.509> going<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.750> show<00:02:04.899> like

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
more he's gonna it's going to show like

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.380 
more he's gonna it's going to show like
he's<00:02:05.560> beaten<00:02:05.860> up<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:09.220> gets<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.670> little<00:02:09.880> violent

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
he's beaten up it gets a little violent

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.040 
he's beaten up it gets a little violent
but<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.170> gets<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.500> job<00:02:11.560> done<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:13.720> wanted<00:02:14.020> to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
but it gets the job done we wanted to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.660 
but it gets the job done we wanted to
have<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.320> unity<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.860> time<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.400> location

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
have a unity of time and location

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.580 
have a unity of time and location
because<00:02:16.270> we<00:02:16.390> find<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:17.110> makes<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.440> all

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
because we find that that makes it all

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.380 
because we find that that makes it all
more<00:02:17.650> personal<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.280> players<00:02:18.640> it's<00:02:19.150> more

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
more personal for players it's more

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.150 
more personal for players it's more
interesting<00:02:19.720> story<00:02:20.170> wise<00:02:20.380> because<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
interesting story wise because the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.699 
interesting story wise because the
events<00:02:21.580> are<00:02:21.730> unfolding<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:22.630> lot<00:02:22.780> faster<00:02:23.050> so

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
events are unfolding a lot faster so

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.250 
events are unfolding a lot faster so
Washington<00:02:24.220> was<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> very<00:02:24.790> interesting

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
Washington was a very interesting

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.930 
Washington was a very interesting
location<00:02:26.260> for<00:02:26.500> us<00:02:26.620> because<00:02:26.830> obviously<00:02:27.100> it's

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
location for us because obviously it's

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.910 
location for us because obviously it's
that<00:02:28.239> it's<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.540> heart<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.200> United<00:02:29.890> States

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
that it's the heart of the United States

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.880 
that it's the heart of the United States
it's<00:02:30.880> also<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.420> very<00:02:31.570> interesting<00:02:32.380> location

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
it's also a very interesting location

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.430 
it's also a very interesting location
for<00:02:33.340> Sam<00:02:33.489> Fisher<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.150> was<00:02:34.360> working<00:02:34.690> for<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.989> US

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
for Sam Fisher it was working for the US

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.949 
for Sam Fisher it was working for the US
government<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.610> idea<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.360> Sam<00:02:37.660> is

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
government the idea that the Sam is

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.289 
government the idea that the Sam is
facing<00:02:38.680> his<00:02:39.360> former<00:02:40.530> agency<00:02:41.530> home<00:02:42.280> was<00:02:43.090> very

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
facing his former agency home was very

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.360 
facing his former agency home was very
interesting<00:02:43.720> from<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.019> character<00:02:44.860> perspective

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
interesting from a character perspective

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.789 
interesting from a character perspective
we<00:02:46.299> took<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.600> lot<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.780> risk<00:02:47.080> when<00:02:47.350> we<00:02:47.470> approached

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
we took a lot of risk when we approached

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.590 
we took a lot of risk when we approached
the<00:02:48.100> design<00:02:48.489> for<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.850> we<00:02:49.030> came<00:02:49.299> up<00:02:49.330> with<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
the design for this we came up with a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.229 
the design for this we came up with a
whole<00:02:49.900> bunch<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.950> new<00:02:51.160> design<00:02:51.640> elements<00:02:52.120> that

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
whole bunch of new design elements that

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.240 
whole bunch of new design elements that
have<00:02:52.420> never<00:02:52.690> been<00:02:52.930> done<00:02:53.170> before<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.799> any<00:02:54.040> other

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
game and the day that all those elements

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.820 
game and the day that all those elements
came<00:02:57.280> together<00:02:57.459> was<00:02:57.820> fascinating<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:59.019> finally

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
came together was fascinating it finally
