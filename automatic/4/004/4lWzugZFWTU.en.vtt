 east of the beatles, hidden behind the polder landscape 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.339
 the lights by children 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.640
 multiple companies 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.329
 located on the kerkweg 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.329
 the PVV is not the throat 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.860
 the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.980
 to have the church building back 78 in use 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.440
 not in the booklet for life 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 an extended to a train silent 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.889
 what in the sixties 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:51.100
 several years ago 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.440
 the flood 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.499
 they are 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.499
 a new design 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 if you made a modern one 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.590
 I've gotten it now 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.590
 the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.220
 Analyst Stephanie van Weeren from PeterCam One of them is a bit of a real one 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.800
 reinforcement 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 fortunately already in the church since 88 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.420
 it is a very tough job 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.610
 beautiful sounds and great to also sing the vocals here 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.610
 I have to be able to guide 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.070
 it is quite difficult to play a profession 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 and you must have some knowledge of the alcohol backlog 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.180
 so we could now know that it is built overtime that you have them 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.640
 picked up from 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 a good way of not knowing what it is all about 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 appear less good 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:16.760
 in the 88th integration and michael is built to be built from dam 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.229
 broadcast in which 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.859
 it was a little finger in four 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.379
 instruments and that it is a so-called but the street already mentioned 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.689
 and organist is altez backlog once again guest were so recognized and 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.369
 We are going to see if a child is going to pay 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.069
 maybe a kind 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.019
 and maintains old van dam organ that has done the service 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.349
 until one when I 10 53 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.349
 it was of course the flood disaster and also in this church 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.189
 in addition to being flooded with water 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.049
 postage had suffered a lot of damage 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.839
 and immediately 69 a plan was made donated crash flood disaster 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.709
 this is a console of axes 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.799
 from a Christian church in Nieuwendijk it fulfills alcohol too 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.869
 are cyclists 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:22.809
 forest you see too 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.869
 69 it has come to be a different setup 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.579
 it already has an early recognition chapter 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.519
 sit now or miss 6 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.709
 Viennese game table sit between the retreat 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.709

 and not so has 23 speaking registers 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.949
 for this reason 6 have the fishermen 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.909
 from main work 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.929
 and these inner drives from top to bottom are registers of the pedal 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.519
 in the outer row the voices are the fishermen of the former 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.819
 and the couples 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.279
 with a trimmer land 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.699
 for getting rid of it 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.710
 special to the organ 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.710
 is the jam at the counter 3 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.240
 very handy them is also special for a very bar a bullet 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.430
 very powerful 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.559
 and is however 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.559
 to be seen as unique to the eye 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.870
 it will be a lot of balls in nieuwendijk is really very bar alcohol 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.180
 it is still there in original condition you can also get a bit embarrassing the colors 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.889
 bright colors 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.029
 the green 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:01.629
 besi work 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.629
 because that is possible in relatives Lampard Northern 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.270
 look here earlier in a retrospect of the south of footballer ever with on the 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.020
 foreground 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.009
 that there is not a second behind it 8 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.110
 the bulls 16s this tommeke can through the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.349
 that she herself has voted 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.069
 and I just heard that there is a d 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.069
 of the next 8 have not been real 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.259
 let's just ask 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.569
 the nerves in its way 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.569
 the sound is nice and tight now 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.050
 one of the solutions that said it is what suits her 4 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.219
 after the changing taste they are counsel for sound clinton nerds 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.159
 marilyn the church is yet to have done that the sound is just still stuck 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.689
 69

 the customer must be given 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.719
 we are very happy to be home yet a particularly worried one 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.759
 the 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.419
 weird 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.129
 the 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.770
 he decided the committee 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.589
 the country needs the search 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:31.199
 and really wanted to see a beautiful new profession listened to 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.199
