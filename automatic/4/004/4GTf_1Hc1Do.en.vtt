00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.320
 Love is part of a contact with my 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 ecology has always been focused on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.180
 environmental issues and in the sequence 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.100
 my pain from theft lends itself to 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.980
 cellulose for energy for those who never 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.740
 charcoal it lends itself to various uses 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.230
 artifacts to replace wood I 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.380
 I started my idea of ​​replacing 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.630
 and I came thinking about doing this 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.640
 replacement with the same pliable part 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.950
 just that I was not learning my 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.440
 life that not all architects nor 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.500
 all people are willing to do 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.720
 the construction with plump wood then 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 hence also the desire to transform 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.550
 on other products are jackets 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.230
 floors and we have been working for 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.340
 bamboo has become a big business for 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.340
 Can we plant bamboo? 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.459
 I met, let's use in Colombia with 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.680
 400 years exploration are producing 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.810
 still in China there are records of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.989
 bombs with two thousand years of existence 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.299
 then it's one thing is infinite once 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.190
 planted you never need to replant 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.379
 and you can make infinite cuts a 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.360
 once a year once every 18 months 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.580
 can cut his hand in the same place 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.290
 so this makes bamboo wood the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.650
 the fastest way and the most 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.650
 sustainable 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.130
 on one 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.510
 all the sides almost in the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.290
 building they burn a lot 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.030
 carbon off wood and we have a 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.200
 zero carbon balance material 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.390
 when you build something of 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.550
 bamboo when you cut a bamboo treats 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.800
 he does not end up ever more equal 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.730
 to the one inside a piece of furniture or in the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.980
 immobile 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.260
 Are you there mobilizing a carbon that 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.230
 out of the atmosphere was the globe group with 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.180
 the photosynthesis and then was immobilized 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.950
 for a human being then you have a 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.450
 the carbon cycle as opposed to the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.090
 people do today that is to get the oil 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.860
 burn the oil and 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.430
 playing in the atmosphere is heating the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.430
 planet climate 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.320
 we alone account for 57% of the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.990
 carbon emissions is a lot to use 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.970
 sustainable materials to work with 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.980
 low- impact energy materials and 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.630
 low carbon footprint is a 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.340
 responsibility all the builder 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.050
 architects of brazil 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.180
 only people are waking up to 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.160
 So I'm thinking about saving 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.950
 energy that is important lighting 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.170
 natural such a thing of ventilation 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 to lower the temperature all this is 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.700
 very important but the materials that 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.650
 deconstructs and effective hard carlos has 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.019
 which also turn into 13 cents 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.269
 of very concrete ash and it is very 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.090
 and little has been done so that these 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.769
 materials would spend less energy then 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.590
 the bangu par excellence 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.150
 it offers all this with the provision 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.400
 Divine, people go there and cut the loin. 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.200
 revolts people when he comes back 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.600
 You can sequestering carbon in 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.460
 infinitely we put this 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.070
 wonderful graceful and wonderful stuff 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.660
 grandson of the work and now we are here with 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.240
 industrial projects to transform a 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.150
 Way way this deck who knows 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.640
 you can think of bamboo with some 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.120
 specific schools and it can become a 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.120
 way 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.699
 within the architecture and design 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.979
 the butt for many years and he 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.229
 was seen as a fragile material with 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.090
 problem material so i know 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.740
 countless places that began to 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.540
 working with bamboo to sell furniture 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.389
 of cane had several 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.100
 problems with the bug and the drill there 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.540
 stopped working on knowledge 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.430
 architects who started working with 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.020
 bamboo and stopped working with the 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.970
 music to fix a problem 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.190
 put fire on the work the bamboo was not 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.400
 properly hydrated and the goal is over 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.169
 burning the movie then it's if the people 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.270
 look back the use of culture 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.340
 bamboo within the concessions 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.770
 we will realize that bamboo is bad 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.790
 seen then and when I started to work 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.169
 with bamboo 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.729
 the first thing I did was deal 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.070
 in a scientifically appropriate manner 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.000
 provided that they gave me the conditions of 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.000
 construction guarantee 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:05.800
 the Brazilian likes the bank thinks it's beautiful 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.600
 only afraid like the treatment I 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.669
 get the guarantee and then 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.699
 guarantee getting out for the best 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.040
 architects these guys are at the top of the 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.240
 chain of architecture so you or all 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.160
 world looks at them 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.560
 as these guys are the years 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.690
 are very strict and rigorous with 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.030
 their work pattern are known to 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.650
 that the other architects begin to 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.419
 understand that it will respect the 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.220
 the new players are arriving the 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.840
 people are leaving college now 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.639
 because they are still working in the 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.870
 last years the prefecture then with the 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.000
 head facing the 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.560
 sustainability are not too greedy 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.750
 sustainable materials are 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.430
 feeling it in their souls because it is 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.440
 clear to a young person here to 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.940
 50 years old she will be alive and she has 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.389
 start to make the transformation of the 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.389
 world now
