00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
start collecting the maple sap most of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.060 
start collecting the maple sap most of
the<00:00:44.250> snow<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.610> melted<00:00:45.000> off<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.450> able<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
the snow is melted off so I'm able to

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.220 
the snow is melted off so I'm able to
use<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> wagon<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:48.180> pull<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> jugs<00:00:48.809> back<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
use the wagon to pull the jugs back and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.410 
use the wagon to pull the jugs back and
forth<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.430> I'm<00:00:50.520> doing<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> little<00:00:51.239> bit

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
forth so I'm doing this a little bit

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.970 
forth so I'm doing this a little bit
differently<00:00:51.780> than<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.110> did<00:00:52.170> before<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
differently than I did before with the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.290 
differently than I did before with the
buckets<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.000> putting<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
buckets I'm going to be putting the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
buckets I'm going to be putting the
buckets<00:00:54.629> under<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> taps<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.430> don't

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
buckets under the taps so that I don't

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
buckets under the taps so that I don't
lose<00:00:56.730> any<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.030> SAP<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> bring<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> five

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
lose any the SAP and bring in the five

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.069 
lose any the SAP and bring in the five
gallon<00:00:58.410> jugs<00:00:58.829> back<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.730> tank<00:01:00.079> stay

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
gallon jugs back here to my tank stay

00:01:01.079 --> 00:03:49.170 
gallon jugs back here to my tank stay
with<00:01:01.230> me<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:02.100> some<00:01:02.309> fun

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.850 

all<00:03:50.180> right<00:03:50.330> guys<00:03:50.510> this<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:51.110> where<00:03:51.260> we're<00:03:51.470> at<00:03:51.500> so

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
all right guys this is where we're at so

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.750 
all right guys this is where we're at so
far<00:03:52.040> with<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> SAP<00:03:53.530> this<00:03:54.530> bar<00:03:54.860> right<00:03:55.190> here<00:03:55.220> is

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
far with the SAP this bar right here is

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.850 
far with the SAP this bar right here is
the<00:03:56.150> 60<00:03:56.540> gallon<00:03:56.930> mark<00:03:57.170> for<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:57.530> container

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
the 60 gallon mark for this container

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.430 
the 60 gallon mark for this container
and<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.250> below<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.180> next<00:03:59.510> bar<00:03:59.690> up<00:03:59.900> this<00:04:00.260> is

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
and just below this next bar up this is

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.770 
and just below this next bar up this is
the<00:04:00.560> 90<00:04:00.920> gallon<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:01.670> we're<00:04:02.300> somewhere<00:04:02.599> between

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
the 90 gallon so we're somewhere between

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.320 
the 90 gallon so we're somewhere between
60<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.470> 90<00:04:03.680> gallons<00:04:04.250> I'm<00:04:04.400> guessing<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:05.239> know

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
60 and 90 gallons I'm guessing you know

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.449 
60 and 90 gallons I'm guessing you know
because<00:04:05.599> we're<00:04:05.750> we<00:04:06.050> have<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.650> on<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.800> we<00:04:07.310> have

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
because we're we have it on a we have

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.370 
because we're we have it on a we have
the<00:04:07.610> tow<00:04:07.760> on<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:07.970> slope<00:04:08.300> I'm<00:04:08.540> guessing<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.290> be

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
the tow on a slope I'm guessing to be

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.850 
the tow on a slope I'm guessing to be
right<00:04:09.590> around<00:04:09.680> 75<00:04:10.310> gallons<00:04:10.700> of<00:04:10.790> sap<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.239> far

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
right around 75 gallons of sap so far

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.500 
right around 75 gallons of sap so far
once<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:12.980> get<00:04:13.130> some<00:04:13.280> more<00:04:13.400> SAP<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:13.910> here<00:04:14.180> then

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
once I get some more SAP in here then

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.750 
once I get some more SAP in here then
we'll<00:04:14.660> start<00:04:14.870> evaporating<00:04:15.739> this<00:04:16.280> down<00:04:16.489> and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
we'll start evaporating this down and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.849 
we'll start evaporating this down and
making<00:04:16.910> maple<00:04:17.329> syrup<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.780> maple<00:04:18.049> candy<00:04:18.350> I'll
