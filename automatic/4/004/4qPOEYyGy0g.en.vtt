00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.350
 hi to all viewers and my followers 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.519
 channel like the one I asked tell 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.509
 how to make a grave spin magicians 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.580
 can make a player only possessing 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.270
 possessing five special asterisks 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.730
 receptions 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.529
 Ie for example Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 this is done very simply as shown 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.230
 on the screen you need to hold 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.859
 lt while doing this you should not move on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.510
 the place should stand that is well here so 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.820
 here stand while moving 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 make a circular right stick 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.809
 and oh not that right circular stick 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.270
 and down left stick sharply while doing so 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.449
 you can also pinch up 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.850
 there is a back and up like this 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.440
 this is called mages bisping on 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.180
 first glance seems very hard and 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.750
 inefficient but actually this thing 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 very effective of the only negative 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 what does a player only do with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 five stars unfortunately and on the go 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.070
 it can not be done that is when a player 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.430
 on the go and you can not do it 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.040
 magic spin is very easy to do here 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.530
 You can top as shown in the screen 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.130
 there are two options there are 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.360
 not over really very efficient 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:39.299
 and I advise you this was my des pins 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:43.110
 short lesson'll show near the well, 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:48.149
 how close here so here is how it looks 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.020
 here it is very easy to do 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.899
 it seems to me very one of the most simple 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.729
 screws if you turn that is 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.439
 a little zaddit and how to do it 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.320
 zadroty view 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.149
 video skills sometimes seem like they are 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.280
 something unreal is actually doing 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.260
 they will learn a couple of these tricks and make them 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.370
 Well, so he wants to teach and then do 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:22.290
 cool videos while doing this very 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.960
 beautiful and it seems that something is unreal 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 they are doing playing against the bots in fact 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.600
 You can play quietly Timati them in 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.360
