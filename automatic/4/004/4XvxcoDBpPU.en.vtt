on the BK let's put the ranch I'm always
a<00:04:34.980> little<00:04:35.040> sketchy<00:04:35.430> about<00:04:35.700> this<00:04:35.910> ranch<00:04:36.150> it's

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
a little sketchy about this ranch it's

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.070 
a little sketchy about this ranch it's
like<00:04:37.170> homemade<00:04:37.590> or<00:04:37.980> home<00:04:38.340> packaged<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.270> I

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
like homemade or home packaged and I

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.050 
like homemade or home packaged and I
don't<00:04:40.890> know<00:04:40.950> if<00:04:41.010> they<00:04:41.130> always<00:04:41.760> keep<00:04:41.910> it

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
don't know if they always keep it

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.970 
don't know if they always keep it
refrigerated<00:04:42.150> or<00:04:42.690> not<00:04:42.960> what<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.530> deal<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.920> but

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
refrigerated or not what the deal is but

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.880 
refrigerated or not what the deal is but
I<00:04:44.790> mean<00:04:45.540> it<00:04:45.720> never<00:04:45.870> got<00:04:46.050> me<00:04:46.230> sick<00:04:46.440> or<00:04:46.620> nothing

I mean it never got me sick or nothing

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.830 
I mean it never got me sick or nothing
