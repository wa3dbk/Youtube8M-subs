 qatar sounds and the few specialists at 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.130
 post marcelo bielsa retains its 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.920
 composition with three defenders 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.240

 alexandria and in the eleven holder 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 just like ayew payet him is in 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.010
 substitute revenge on the side of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.969
 montpellier 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.110
 rookie of the week lukasz barrios 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.510
 the paraguayan is to align everything under 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.290
 the eyes of michel platini for this 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.410
 first at the velodrome stadium and the 50,000 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.399
 spectators here have almost been showered 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.129
 by the error of dja djedje the parry of 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.440
 mandanda before stambouli saves them 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.760
 Olympians the Marseillais do not have 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.420
 in this early game 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.309
 the block to the HÃ©raultais posed 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.019
 huge problems the long balloon to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.270
 destination anthony mounier who is 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.720
 not in an offside position and while 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.260
 touched the old eagle comes deceive 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.659
 steve mandanda a lobed balloon that leaves 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.680
 marble marcelo bielsa no position 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.930
 off game you see it with this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.180
 revealing and then it's a delight 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.939
 while touching everything in dexterity 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.460
 the goalkeeper could only 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.119
 see the damage 1 goal to 0 for 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.610
 montpellier 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.560
 after only 20 minutes of play the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.810
 Marseille have struggled to 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.430
 provide standards situations before the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.670
 geoffrey jourdren's goal born on the contrary 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.350
 the proteges of loulou nicollin are 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.490
 very close to doubling the little bet 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.320
 before the break 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.509
 it's once again stambouli who 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.430
 had got a good situation 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.320
 so the enclosure is beautiful is all my 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.990
 life but you have to settle small 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.780
 lawn problems 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.450
 President 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.810
 better and women see in any case in 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.630
 second period the Marseilles 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.259
 still stammering their football and getting 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.530
 put at the request of certain contracts 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.910
 Montpellier look at this defense 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.830
 who is completely shot the ball 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.110
 in the feet of anthony mounier for 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.069
 morgane censures the conclusion as to the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.650
 Parade in the 69th minute of play 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.500
 montpellier leads 2 goals to 0 and what 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.690
 work of the Montpellier of anthony 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.290
 mounier author of a goal and a pass 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.700
 decisive and then morgan samson the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.060
 more than push the ball into the goal 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.570
 empty 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.360
 it is made marcelo bielsa is not done 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.310
 not feel the Marseilles who led 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.080
 three buses in front of bastia the week 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.310
 last and who saw the Corsican 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.340
 go back to 3 goals everywhere 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.760
 there the situation of andrÃ©-pierre gignac 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.160
 will not change anything on the contrary 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.050
 can read to go to exploit the least 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.250
 breaches and that's morgane samson who is 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.570
 near to score the third goal 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.489
 a last chance to go 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.489
 montpellier with them the hook of 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.829
 camara on morel but who removes a 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.239
 little bit of his typing 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.489
 marcelo bielsa says to himself that there is inevitably 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.680
 marseille job that had already 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.500
 let slip 24 points the season 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.090
 last begins at the velodrome Year 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.150
 his sons and three from the second 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.150
 day
