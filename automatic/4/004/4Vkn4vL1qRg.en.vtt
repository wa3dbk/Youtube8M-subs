Reef DBMS comin at you with a pre-soak
deadrock<00:00:06.570> suggestion<00:00:07.490> we<00:00:08.490> took<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.759> scale<00:00:09.210> and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
deadrock suggestion we took a scale and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.860 
deadrock suggestion we took a scale and
took<00:00:10.350> some<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.740> our<00:00:10.890> new<00:00:11.670> deadrock<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.599> just

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
took some of our new deadrock that just

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.919 
took some of our new deadrock that just
arrived<00:00:13.260> and<00:00:13.620> weighed<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.030> two<00:00:15.030> identical

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
arrived and weighed out two identical

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.960 
arrived and weighed out two identical
quantities<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.189> we<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.489> run<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.669> little<00:00:17.880> test

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
quantities so we can run a little test

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.390 
quantities so we can run a little test
to<00:00:18.359> show<00:00:18.659> you<00:00:18.720> why<00:00:18.989> we<00:00:19.019> recommend<00:00:19.400> pre-soaking

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
to show you why we recommend pre-soaking

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.909 
to show you why we recommend pre-soaking
your<00:00:20.789> deadrock<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.810> least<00:00:22.019> two<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.890> three

days
we<00:00:24.179> took<00:00:24.449> three<00:00:25.199> sterile<00:00:26.029> canning<00:00:27.029> quart<00:00:27.329> jars

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
we took three sterile canning quart jars

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.200 
we took three sterile canning quart jars
and<00:00:27.979> two<00:00:28.979> of<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> jars<00:00:29.460> who<00:00:29.669> measured<00:00:30.029> out

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and two of the jars who measured out

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.960 
and two of the jars who measured out
brand<00:00:30.869> new<00:00:31.189> deadrock<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.610> had<00:00:32.730> just

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
brand new deadrock that we had just

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.920 
brand new deadrock that we had just
bought<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:34.080> exact<00:00:34.740> same<00:00:35.060> weight<00:00:36.060> and<00:00:36.330> put

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
bought the exact same weight and put

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.750 
bought the exact same weight and put
them<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.770> third<00:00:38.010> jar<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.670> the

them in the third jar there in the
middle<00:00:39.030> we're<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:40.080> kind

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
middle we're just going to use as kind

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.710 
middle we're just going to use as kind
of<00:00:40.650> a<00:00:40.740> control<00:00:41.220> and<00:00:41.520> we're<00:00:42.060> gonna<00:00:42.150> fill<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
of a control and we're gonna fill the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.400 
of a control and we're gonna fill the
jars<00:00:43.400> one<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.520> them<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:45.150> salt<00:00:45.810> water<00:00:46.110> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
jars one of them with salt water that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.010 
jars one of them with salt water that
we've<00:00:46.770> tested<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.640> no<00:00:48.120> phosphate<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.900> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
we've tested and has no phosphate in it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.790 
we've tested and has no phosphate in it
and<00:00:49.520> it's<00:00:50.520> fresh<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.510> made<00:00:51.810> up<00:00:52.080> we're

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and it's fresh and just made up we're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.940 
and it's fresh and just made up we're
gonna<00:00:52.920> test<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.030> other<00:00:54.450> jar<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.320> ro/di

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
gonna test the other jar with ro/di

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.190 
gonna test the other jar with ro/di
water<00:00:56.130> which<00:00:56.730> has<00:00:56.940> no<00:00:57.150> phosphate<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
water which has no phosphate in it and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200 
water which has no phosphate in it and
then<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.040> course<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.430> middle<00:00:59.670> jar<00:00:59.820> we're<00:01:00.060> just

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
then of course the middle jar we're just

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.630 
then of course the middle jar we're just
going<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.390> fill<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.630> ro/di<00:01:01.440> water

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
going to fill with ro/di water

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.800 
going to fill with ro/di water
throughout<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> whole<00:01:02.970> entire<00:01:03.270> experiment

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
throughout the whole entire experiment

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.200 
throughout the whole entire experiment
and<00:01:04.140> test<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.589> several<00:01:04.949> times<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:06.149> make

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and test it several times just to make

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
and test it several times just to make
sure<00:01:06.539> that<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.200> know<00:01:07.319> we<00:01:07.890> don't<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.249> you<00:01:08.490> know

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
sure that you know we don't get you know

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
sure that you know we don't get you know
any<00:01:08.939> phosphate<00:01:09.600> contaminant<00:01:10.289> from<00:01:10.469> the<00:01:10.590> metal

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
any phosphate contaminant from the metal

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.730 
any phosphate contaminant from the metal
lids<00:01:11.130> rings<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.789> jars<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:13.049> basically<00:01:13.499> what

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
lids rings or jars so basically what

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.529 
lids rings or jars so basically what
we're<00:01:13.890> doing<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.219> is<00:01:14.850> showing<00:01:15.270> why<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
we're doing here is showing why you

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.080 
we're doing here is showing why you
should<00:01:16.020> soak<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:17.069> dead<00:01:17.280> Rock<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.850> three

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
should soak your dead Rock for three

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270 
should soak your dead Rock for three
days<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.439> you'll<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.950> at<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
days because as you'll see you at the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.789 
days because as you'll see you at the
end<00:01:20.399> of<00:01:20.490> three<00:01:20.670> days<00:01:20.819> the<00:01:21.600> water<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:22.530> have

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
end of three days the water will have

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.069 
end of three days the water will have
phosphate<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.789> it<00:01:23.969> that's<00:01:24.240> leached<00:01:24.569> out<00:01:24.780> from

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
phosphate in it that's leached out from

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.109 
phosphate in it that's leached out from
the<00:01:25.590> dead<00:01:25.770> Rock<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.520> good<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.819> get<00:01:26.969> rid

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the dead Rock and it's good to get rid

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.239 
the dead Rock and it's good to get rid
of<00:01:27.149> that<00:01:27.329> before<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.840> start<00:01:28.409> putting<00:01:29.130> this

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
of that before you start putting this

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.629 
of that before you start putting this
rock<00:01:29.549> into<00:01:29.939> your<00:01:30.240> tank<00:01:30.889> because<00:01:31.889> obviously<00:01:32.100> if

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
rock into your tank because obviously if

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.910 
rock into your tank because obviously if
it's<00:01:32.819> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.209> dead<00:01:33.389> Rock<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:34.200> coming<00:01:34.679> out<00:01:34.799> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's on the dead Rock or coming out of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.559 
it's on the dead Rock or coming out of
the<00:01:34.979> dead<00:01:35.159> Rock<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.639> it's<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:35.999> tank<00:01:36.240> it's

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
the dead Rock and it's in your tank it's

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.709 
the dead Rock and it's in your tank it's
probably<00:01:36.959> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.139> grow<00:01:37.229> some<00:01:37.499> algae<00:01:37.889> so

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
probably going to grow some algae so

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.699 
probably going to grow some algae so
there<00:01:39.719> are<00:01:39.840> two<00:01:39.959> different<00:01:40.259> methods<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.649> doing

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
there are two different methods of doing

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.319 
there are two different methods of doing
this<00:01:41.009> some<00:01:41.219> people<00:01:41.340> say<00:01:41.670> we'll<00:01:41.819> just<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:42.179> our

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
this some people say we'll just use our

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.099 
this some people say we'll just use our
ODI<00:01:42.630> water

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
ODI water

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.319 
ODI water
some<00:01:43.770> people<00:01:44.069> say<00:01:44.249> use<00:01:44.490> fresh<00:01:44.789> salt<00:01:45.090> water

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
some people say use fresh salt water

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.449 
some people say use fresh salt water
because<00:01:45.569> the<00:01:45.929> salt<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.529> the<00:01:46.799> water<00:01:47.189> actually

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
because the salt in the water actually

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.679 
because the salt in the water actually
helps<00:01:48.029> pull<00:01:48.749> it<00:01:48.959> out<00:01:49.109> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:50.399> dead<00:01:50.700> Rock<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
helps pull it out of the dead Rock so I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.989 
helps pull it out of the dead Rock so I
thought<00:01:52.020> I'd<00:01:52.170> run<00:01:52.409> both<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.249> see<00:01:53.429> what<00:01:53.579> happens

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
thought I'd run both to see what happens

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.309 
thought I'd run both to see what happens
I<00:01:54.149> was<00:01:54.240> pretty<00:01:54.509> pleased<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.139> the<00:01:55.289> outcome

folks pretty standard in the industry
and<00:03:04.600> they<00:03:04.720> work<00:03:04.900> pretty<00:03:05.350> reliably<00:03:05.950> they're

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
and they work pretty reliably they're

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.070 
and they work pretty reliably they're
not<00:03:06.520> perfect<00:03:07.180> don't<00:03:07.390> get<00:03:07.510> me<00:03:07.660> wrong<00:03:07.690> but

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
not perfect don't get me wrong but

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.450 
not perfect don't get me wrong but
they're<00:03:08.260> good<00:03:08.410> enough<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.770> do<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.890> test<00:03:09.250> like

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
they're good enough to do a test like

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.790 
they're good enough to do a test like
this<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.880> prove<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.270> point<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.290> point<00:03:11.560> is

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
this to prove a point and the point is

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.410 
this to prove a point and the point is
here<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.640> his<00:03:12.970> pre-soaking<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.110> good<00:03:14.380> thing

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
here is his pre-soaking is a good thing

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.480 
here is his pre-soaking is a good thing
so<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> first<00:03:16.750> job<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.020> did<00:03:17.290> was<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.280> right

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
so the first job I did was on the right

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.290 
so the first job I did was on the right
it's<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.500> 72<00:03:20.500> hour<00:03:20.680> saltwater<00:03:21.340> soak<00:03:21.790> with<00:03:22.150> the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
it's the 72 hour saltwater soak with the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.380 
it's the 72 hour saltwater soak with the
dead<00:03:22.480> rock<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:22.990> it<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.350> basically<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:25.030> ended

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
dead rock in it and basically that ended

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.630 
dead rock in it and basically that ended
up<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:26.140> water<00:03:26.470> ended<00:03:26.920> up<00:03:27.040> picking<00:03:27.280> up<00:03:27.490> the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
up that water ended up picking up the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.900 
up that water ended up picking up the
most<00:03:27.850> amount<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.240> phosphate<00:03:28.750> at<00:03:29.430> 0.11<00:03:30.430> parts

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
most amount of phosphate at 0.11 parts

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.530 
most amount of phosphate at 0.11 parts
per<00:03:31.150> million<00:03:31.360> again<00:03:32.340> 0.11<00:03:33.340> parts<00:03:34.090> per<00:03:34.330> million

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
per million again 0.11 parts per million

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.380 
per million again 0.11 parts per million
is<00:03:34.840> what<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.680> saltwater<00:03:36.550> jar<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.180> right

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
is what the saltwater jar on the right

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.670 
is what the saltwater jar on the right
picked<00:03:37.690> up<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.470> rrdi<00:03:39.010> water<00:03:39.400> after<00:03:39.970> 72<00:03:40.360> hours

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
picked up the rrdi water after 72 hours

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.920 
picked up the rrdi water after 72 hours
machines<00:03:41.680> still<00:03:41.920> reading<00:03:42.310> zero<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:43.000> that's<00:03:43.690> a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
machines still reading zero so that's a

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.630 
machines still reading zero so that's a
good<00:03:44.080> control<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.770> just<00:03:44.980> tells<00:03:45.250> us<00:03:45.430> that

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
good control it just tells us that

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.300 
good control it just tells us that
basically<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:47.140> jar<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.830> lid

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
basically the the jar is the lid

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.310 
basically the the jar is the lid
nothing<00:03:48.760> leached<00:03:49.030> phosphate<00:03:49.990> into<00:03:50.230> the

nothing leached phosphate into the

system and then the ro/di water which
soaked<00:03:53.620> for<00:03:53.830> 72<00:03:54.370> hours<00:03:54.400> picked<00:03:54.850> up<00:03:55.440> 0.05<00:03:56.440> parts

soaked for 72 hours picked up 0.05 parts

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.460 
soaked for 72 hours picked up 0.05 parts
per<00:03:57.130> million<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.880> it<00:03:58.120> still<00:03:58.480> work<00:03:58.660> -<00:03:58.930> maybe<00:03:59.230> if

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
per million so it still work - maybe if

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.350 
per million so it still work - maybe if
he<00:03:59.590> soaked<00:03:59.860> it<00:04:00.010> longer<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.790> would<00:04:00.970> get<00:04:01.090> more

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
he soaked it longer it would get more

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.070 
he soaked it longer it would get more
out<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:02.590> either<00:04:02.709> way<00:04:03.209> soaking<00:04:04.209> your<00:04:04.750> dead
