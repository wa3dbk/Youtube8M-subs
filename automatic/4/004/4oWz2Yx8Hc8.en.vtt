00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.860
 october text age we are here at the moment 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.139
 with samsung in new york where samsung today 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.270
 evening in the madison square garden the new 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.010
 flagship tablet has presented that 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.539
 it is the galaxy tab is equal to two 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.890
 There is a large one small version 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.720
 the technical data is complete 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.839
 identical and what this tablet can 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.550
 they could only at times 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.609
 Here are the two new galaxy 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.770
 tabs in the overview on the left is the 84 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.680
 inch variant right the 10 5 inch 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.900
 Variant you can already see the lettering 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.250
 over the displays that is not a model 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.200
 of course great for use in the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.450
 portrait format meant so to speak as a large 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.980
 mobile phone without a telephone while the 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.780
 great tablet for use in the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.310
 horizontal format is what kind of variant 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.810
 personally prefer now it i think 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.780
 the matter of taste what more often 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.400
 uses on the road or who in between 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.260
 just want to surf the internet 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.850
 makes a bit of ebay or something comes 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.100
 the small version certainly very good 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.829
 rightly the big variation is natural 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.650
 definitely the nicer if you have many 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.659
 I watch videos movies pictures and so on 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.790
 are of the technical equipment ago 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.790
 both devices completely identical that applies 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.350
 even for the display resolution means 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.240
 but of course in that by that 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.430
 the smaller display from the surface 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.170
 it's just over half the size 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.270
 the big, of course, one clearly 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.820
 sharper presentation allows than that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.450
 Great display that is the galaxy tab of 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.320
 samsung in the 84 inch version so the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.140
 small variant 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.860
 what is striking at first attempt mainly 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.830
 the fertilizer is on stock 66 mm from the stock exchange 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.860
 side and the relatively light weight 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.160
 just under 300 grams 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.200
 advertises his tablet relatively easily 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.750
 even if you hold it in your hand 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.250
 So the high of the table I have that 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.750
 Feel it should weigh more 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.940
 is a fine thing 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.590
 the price like samsung's low 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.000
 weight, however, bought samsung 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.620
 typical again the use of a lot 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.150
 plastic 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.610
 that is here on the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.920
 back of the tablet like the galaxy s 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.560
 5 gum is wrong so that means it's alright 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.660
 and handy in hand is now but 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.340
 not even once 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.440
 caressing like the metal 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.600
 backs of apple tablets to 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.140
 example we have on the front page 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.660
 Here is a 84 inch super amoled 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.280
 Display with a fat resolution 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:34.540
 namely 2560 x 1600 pixels dominates the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.040
 also the ipad forth under the retina ipad 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.480
 mini by apple super amoled means for 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.730
 besides that we really 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.980
 So I have excellent angles 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.750
 No matter which side I go to this 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.850
 Tablet also looks from the corners that is 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.500
 the typical weakness of the lcd can 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.799
 it as they are used in apple 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.549
 really complete without any 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.959
 color changes or contrast 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.820
 changes see the picture 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.480
 I also have technical reasons 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.970
 a perfect contrast because dark 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.570
 pixel just completely switched off 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.330
 are 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.810
 on these devices such as at 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.850
 this is during these night shots 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.500
 just an insanely strong contrast 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.620
 between light and dark 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.970
 this looks a bit artificial 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.989
 So there are people who say yes when 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.940
 I do not like it I like it better 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.470
 natural illustration natural colors 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.870
 in the injured lcd under circumstances 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.690
 looks better but better on everyone 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.489
 case the amoled panel with the samsung 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.080
 otherwise we have tablet here 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.140
 still we have on the front here 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.600
 above a 2 megapixel front camera for 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.670
 Video calling 111 on the back 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.720
 we have an 8 megapixel camera with 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.120
 Photo LED back is similar to 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.489
 this golfball profile as we know it from 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.120
 galaxy s 5 here already know this 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.060
 Both nipples are the fixings for 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.120
 the samsung own cases and we have 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.799
 on the bottom of the micro USB socket 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.430
 to charge the battery to the transfer 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.040
 of data 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.890
 the jack and here the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.000
 speakers on the other side above 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.610
 there is also a speaker 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.269
 will be stereo sound at the new 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.430
 galaxy tablet s the front exists 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:22.400
 completely made of glass a relatively thin 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.229
 Metal frame could be good 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.270
 that samsung is not a metal again 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.310
 actually uses plastic 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.750
 with metallic paints i want it 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.490
 but I do not like scratching and getting it 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.650
 that annoys that we lift ourselves up for 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.080
 a little later on if here on the left 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.880
 side infrared port so that i can 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.130
 So I want to remotely control one 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.800
 use of television stelen plant 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.530
 here is our little flap micro usb 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.620
 micro sd memory card slot up to 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.910
 32gb cards take the tablet 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.120
 itself also has depending on the execution 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.860
 again between 16 and 32 gb 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.550
 above it the web page to 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.530
 volume control and the on off button 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.020
 and on the left side of the device there are 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.699
 no further elements 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.910
 the interior equipment is the one 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.370
 samsung own octa core processor 650 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.139
 19 gigahertz in there are also the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.409
 meanwhile almost usual three 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.979
 gigabyte ram and wlan after the hc 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.960
 standard and the galaxy tab should also be in 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.800
 a mobile version with lte on the 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.610
 market come 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.090
 on the software side we have android 4 4 im 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.780
 commitment 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.020
 with the samsung own surface what 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.530
 new here is the kids mode 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.060
 So I have the possibility for that 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.099
 So restrict the surface of the tablet 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.210
 So my kids are just applications 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.380
 see who are suitable for you 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.680
 At the same time there is a multi user 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.919
 mode i can make this funny 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.259
 This stupid thing is not out there anymore 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.750
 there we have now strictly on the 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.069
 of course , the children should not 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.719
 nevertheless come to the internet because of that 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.680
 is therefore to leave the kit not a 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.930
 password required 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.919
 that is conveniently 000 so can 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.520
 you can even go on 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:12.430
 we have down here like the galaxy s 5 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.110
 the fingerprint scanner and i have 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.530
 the possibility per user up to three 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.180
 to register fingerprint 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.710
 I can have eight users on this tablet 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.150
 that means every user can 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.740
 his own apps install his 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.270
 own favorites browser contrary 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.750
 his own e-mail accounts facebook 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.490
 etc and so can the tablet like 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.199
 lying on the table in a family 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.520
 and whoever needs to report 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.669
 a password or per 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.099
 fingerprint scanner and then it would have to 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.500
 So it's the best one's own 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:44.789
 book cover that's the more elaborate cover 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.370
 For the samsung tablets you can do it 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.190
 Magnetic in different positions 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.050
 hook the device into one another 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.139
 different angles then on the 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.680
 set the table 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:02.410
 You can use it as protection for that 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.740
 Completely pack the tray on both sides 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.139
 and what is funny as it is 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.580
 attached one is told me I can 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:10.900
 actually just pull off i have 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.229
 I did not dare what really damned 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.460
 good but with a bit of strength 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:18.699
 you can do it and sit here 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.919
 actually similar to small press buttons 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:22.960
 like a trouser with the book cover 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.940
 keeps on the tablet and there are both for 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.720
 the small 8 inch as well as the big one 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.720
 10 inch version
