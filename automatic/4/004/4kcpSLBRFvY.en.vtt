from<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.200> last<00:00:13.349> video<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.130> finished

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
from the last video is that I finished

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.960 
from the last video is that I finished
covering<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.660> outside<00:00:15.690> with<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.970> sheetrock

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
covering the outside with the sheetrock

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.029 
covering the outside with the sheetrock

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that for the seedling station and I've

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
that for the seedling station and I've
actually<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.000> got<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.810> old<00:01:34.200> end

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
table in here with a big heat mat that I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.920 
table in here with a big heat mat that I
might<00:01:36.960> use<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:38.030> seedlings<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.240> well<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.720> I'll

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
might use for seedlings as well so I'll

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.899 
might use for seedlings as well so I'll
provide<00:01:40.110> an<00:01:40.350> update<00:01:40.680> when<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> plant<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:41.790> more

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
provide an update when I plant some more

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
provide an update when I plant some more
seedlings<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.869> let<00:01:43.140> me<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.259> give<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
seedlings but let me just give you a

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.520 
seedlings but let me just give you a
little<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.979> tour<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.960> what's<00:01:45.960> growing<00:01:46.259> on

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
little bit tour of the what's growing on

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.050 
little bit tour of the what's growing on
so<00:01:48.290> right<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.369> tips<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:50.759> actually

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so right here and the tips are actually

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.609 
so right here and the tips are actually
looking<00:01:51.210> burnt<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.930> some<00:01:52.079> reason<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.560> think

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
looking burnt for some reason I think

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.010 
looking burnt for some reason I think
they're<00:01:52.860> getting<00:01:52.979> too<00:01:53.280> close<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:53.939> uh

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
they're getting too close to these uh

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.690 
they're getting too close to these uh
tea<00:01:55.020> aids<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.530> which<00:01:55.710> run<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.369> hotter

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
tea aids here which run a little hotter

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.870 
tea aids here which run a little hotter
than<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.960> complex<00:01:58.770> compact<00:01:59.369> fluorescent

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
than the complex compact fluorescent

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
than the complex compact fluorescent
lights<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.210> seems<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950

hydroponic garden you can see that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.339 
hydroponic garden you can see that
things<00:03:05.470> are<00:03:05.790> growing<00:03:06.790> pretty<00:03:07.359> good<00:03:07.629> here<00:03:07.870> not

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
things are growing pretty good here not

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.020 
things are growing pretty good here not
actually<00:03:08.799> as<00:03:08.920> quick<00:03:09.159> as<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.430> would<00:03:09.640> have<00:03:09.760> liked

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
actually as quick as I would have liked

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.930 
actually as quick as I would have liked
but<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.269> think<00:03:10.510> that's<00:03:10.690> because<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.849> this<00:03:12.849> is

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
but I think that's because the this is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.149 
but I think that's because the this is
my<00:03:13.060> second<00:03:13.390> time<00:03:13.510> growing<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.470> it's<00:03:15.040> a

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
my second time growing in it and it's a

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.979 
my second time growing in it and it's a
winter<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.790> it's<00:03:15.909> actually<00:03:16.269> around<00:03:16.599> mid<00:03:16.959> to

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
winter and it's actually around mid to

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.839 
winter and it's actually around mid to
low<00:03:17.829> 60s<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.380> basement<00:03:20.380> here<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:21.700> can

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
low 60s in the basement here and you can

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.670 
low 60s in the basement here and you can
see<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.209> actually<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:23.139> been<00:03:23.169> running

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680

the fan that kind of blows the mist
around<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:29.680> since<00:03:30.160> I've<00:03:30.310> been<00:03:30.340> doing<00:03:30.579> that

around and since I've been doing that
things<00:03:31.209> have<00:03:31.359> actually<00:03:31.480> perked<00:03:32.169> up<00:03:32.260> pretty

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
things have actually perked up pretty

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.610 
things have actually perked up pretty
good<00:03:32.680> but<00:03:33.669> um<00:03:33.879> quite<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> big<00:03:35.019> change<00:03:35.379> though<00:03:35.590> I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
good but um quite a big change though I

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.930 
good but um quite a big change though I
would<00:03:35.980> say<00:03:36.220> on<00:03:36.669> a<00:03:36.780> lot<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.079> from<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.760> last

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
would say on a lot of it from the last

burpee<00:04:09.790> corn<00:04:10.209> as<00:04:10.419> well<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.949> same

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
burpee corn as well this is the same

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.819 
burpee corn as well this is the same
corn<00:04:13.299> as<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:13.750> showed<00:04:13.959> you<00:04:14.139> in<00:04:14.290> this<00:04:14.440> seedling

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
corn as I showed you in this seedling

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.620 
corn as I showed you in this seedling
right<00:04:15.220> here<00:04:15.519> that's<00:04:15.760> how<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:15.940> started<00:04:16.449> it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
right here that's how I started it

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.650 
right here that's how I started it
actually<00:04:17.440> in<00:04:17.650> soil<00:04:18.190> then<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.030> took<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.389> out<00:04:19.510> of

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
actually in soil then I took it out of

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.170 
actually in soil then I took it out of
soil<00:04:19.930> once<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.500> roots<00:04:20.739> were<00:04:20.919> begging<00:04:21.219> off<00:04:21.370> put

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
soil once the roots were begging off put

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.040 
soil once the roots were begging off put
it<00:04:22.270> into<00:04:22.719> a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
it into a

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.100 
it into a
Rockwell's<00:04:24.800> cube<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.520> then<00:04:25.940> stuff<00:04:26.390> that<00:04:26.630> into

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
Rockwell's cube and then stuff that into

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.530 
Rockwell's cube and then stuff that into
the<00:04:27.230> hydroponic<00:04:27.980> garden<00:04:28.010> so<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:28.970> can<00:04:29.360> see

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
the hydroponic garden so you can see

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.720 
the hydroponic garden so you can see
that<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:29.900> one<00:04:30.800> is<00:04:30.980> doing<00:04:31.160> much<00:04:31.490> better

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
that this one is doing much better

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.970 
that this one is doing much better
getting<00:04:32.300> some<00:04:32.510> big<00:04:32.720> curl<00:04:32.990> going<00:04:33.110> on<00:04:33.500> here<00:04:33.860> and

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
getting some big curl going on here and

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.350 
getting some big curl going on here and
they're<00:04:34.100> growing<00:04:34.430> towards<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.880> light<00:04:35.090> and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
they're growing towards the light and

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.500 
they're growing towards the light and
the<00:04:35.990> tips<00:04:36.260> aren't<00:04:37.130> really<00:04:37.460> brown<00:04:37.760> or<00:04:38.030> burnt<00:04:38.300> at

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
the tips aren't really brown or burnt at

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.950 
the tips aren't really brown or burnt at
all<00:04:38.690> unlike<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.500> other<00:04:39.680> one<00:04:39.920> so<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:41.240> seems<00:04:41.780> to

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
all unlike the other one so it seems to

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.930 
all unlike the other one so it seems to
really<00:04:42.140> like<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.590> light<00:04:42.770> as<00:04:43.010> well<00:04:43.190> as<00:04:43.250> the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
really like the light as well as the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.410 
really like the light as well as the
tomatoes<00:04:44.630> do<00:04:45.880> some<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.030> other<00:04:47.150> stuff

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
tomatoes do some of the other stuff

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.940 
tomatoes do some of the other stuff
doesn't<00:04:47.660> actually<00:04:47.990> like<00:04:48.440> I<00:04:48.470> said<00:04:48.740> this

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
doesn't actually like I said this

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.830 
doesn't actually like I said this
lettuce<00:04:49.250> doesn't<00:04:49.670> appear<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.120> be<00:04:50.210> going<00:04:50.630> as

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
lettuce doesn't appear to be going as

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.330 
lettuce doesn't appear to be going as
good<00:04:51.770> as<00:04:51.880> obviously<00:04:52.880> this<00:04:53.090> front<00:04:53.540> one<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:55.070> can

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
good as obviously this front one you can

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.270 
good as obviously this front one you can
see<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.610> don't<00:04:55.820> know<00:04:55.970> if<00:04:56.000> you've<00:04:56.180> ever<00:04:56.300> seen

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
see I don't know if you've ever seen

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.320 
see I don't know if you've ever seen
hydroponically<00:04:58.280> grown<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:59.000> can<00:04:59.150> see

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
hydroponically grown but you can see

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.590 
hydroponically grown but you can see
here<00:04:59.720> the<00:05:00.320> roots<00:05:00.590> are<00:05:01.300> growing<00:05:02.300> out<00:05:02.420> of<00:05:02.450> the

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
here the roots are growing out of the

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.880 
here the roots are growing out of the
bottom<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.050> pot<00:05:03.260> like<00:05:03.560> they're<00:05:03.770> supposed

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
bottom of the pot like they're supposed

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.630 
bottom of the pot like they're supposed
to<00:05:04.220> do<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:05.020> that's<00:05:06.020> obviously<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.640> indication

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
to do and that's obviously a indication

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.230 
to do and that's obviously a indication
that<00:05:07.790> it<00:05:08.000> is<00:05:08.120> growing<00:05:09.880> contrast<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.090> with

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
that it is growing contrast that with

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.460 
that it is growing contrast that with
something<00:05:11.300> else<00:05:11.750> like<00:05:12.590> this<00:05:13.040> lettuce<00:05:14.320> look<00:05:15.320> at

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
something else like this lettuce look at

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.810 
something else like this lettuce look at
the<00:05:15.910> root<00:05:16.910> growth<00:05:17.620> so<00:05:18.620> nice<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.640> healthy

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
the root growth so nice and healthy

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.000 
the root growth so nice and healthy
clean<00:05:20.650> no<00:05:21.650> no<00:05:22.310> real<00:05:23.300> diseases<00:05:23.750> I<00:05:24.110> do<00:05:24.680> see<00:05:24.980> a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
clean no no real diseases I do see a

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.520 
clean no no real diseases I do see a
little<00:05:25.130> black<00:05:25.490> on<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.000> peat<00:05:26.990> there<00:05:27.260> but

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
little black on that a peat there but

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.710 
little black on that a peat there but
you<00:05:27.620> can<00:05:27.770> see<00:05:27.920> kind<00:05:28.160> of<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.370> difference<00:05:28.760> if

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
you can see kind of the difference if

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.980 
you can see kind of the difference if
you've<00:05:29.840> never<00:05:29.990> seen<00:05:30.230> hydroponic<00:05:31.010> fully<00:05:31.520> grown

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
you've never seen hydroponic fully grown

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.480 
you've never seen hydroponic fully grown
vegetables<00:05:32.990> before<00:05:33.500> what<00:05:34.070> that<00:05:34.220> looks<00:05:34.430> like

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
vegetables before what that looks like

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.820 
vegetables before what that looks like
on<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.850> bottom<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.420> then<00:05:35.960> take<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.530> look<00:05:36.680> in

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
on the bottom and then take a look in

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.060 
on the bottom and then take a look in
there<00:05:37.010> and<00:05:37.250> you<00:05:37.460> can<00:05:37.580> actually<00:05:37.760> see<00:05:38.150> the

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
there and you can actually see the

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.390 
there and you can actually see the
tomato<00:05:41.440> growing<00:05:42.440> out<00:05:42.620> so<00:05:42.920> they're<00:05:43.220> definitely

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
tomato growing out so they're definitely

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.130 
tomato growing out so they're definitely
liking<00:05:44.140> liking<00:05:45.140> this<00:05:45.470> solution<00:05:46.300> let<00:05:47.300> me<00:05:47.480> get

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
liking liking this solution let me get

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.720 
liking liking this solution let me get
this<00:05:48.290> back<00:05:48.350> in<00:05:48.560> here<00:05:48.980> I<00:05:49.870> run<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:51.050> around<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:52.370> pH

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
this back in here I run it around the pH

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.230 
this back in here I run it around the pH
is<00:05:52.940> about<00:05:53.380> 6.5<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:56.410> TDS<00:05:57.410> meter<00:05:58.370> has<00:05:58.760> shows

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
is about 6.5 and the TDS meter has shows

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.730 
is about 6.5 and the TDS meter has shows
around<00:06:01.150> 450<00:06:02.150> I<00:06:02.180> would<00:06:02.480> say<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:03.610> in<00:06:04.610> the

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
around 450 I would say and in the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.160 
around 450 I would say and in the
beginning<00:06:06.740> stages<00:06:07.250> all<00:06:07.850> I<00:06:08.120> use<00:06:08.600> is<00:06:10.300> this<00:06:11.300> flora

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
beginning stages all I use is this flora

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.260 
beginning stages all I use is this flora
Nova<00:06:13.240> grow<00:06:14.920> so<00:06:15.920> it's<00:06:16.070> really<00:06:16.220> just<00:06:16.370> regular

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270
