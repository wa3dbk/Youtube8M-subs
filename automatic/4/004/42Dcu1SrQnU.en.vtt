and<00:03:27.989> once<00:03:28.110> we<00:03:28.230> put<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> 2-step<00:03:29.010> when

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
and once we put it on the 2-step when

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.320 
and once we put it on the 2-step when
you<00:03:29.190> put<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.580> high<00:03:29.700> side<00:03:29.910> like<00:03:30.120> that

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
you put it on the high side like that

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.300 
you put it on the high side like that
all<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.930> heat<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.320> everything<00:03:31.410> expands<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
all the heat and everything expands the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.250 
all the heat and everything expands the
clutch<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.330> it'll<00:03:33.570> take<00:03:33.750> all<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.930> our<00:03:34.080> air

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
clutch and so it'll take all of our air

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.870 
clutch and so it'll take all of our air
gap<00:03:34.440> away<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.010> just<00:03:35.160> makes<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.610> we

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
gap away and it just makes it so that we

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.270 
gap away and it just makes it so that we
it's<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.209> junk<00:03:36.480> run<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.350> what<00:03:37.530> we'll<00:03:37.680> do<00:03:37.830> is<00:03:37.860> next

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
it's a junk run so what we'll do is next

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.560 
it's a junk run so what we'll do is next

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
little bit of air out of it in case we
