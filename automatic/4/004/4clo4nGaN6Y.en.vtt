12b and yep this is a clock radio it's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.319 
12b and yep this is a clock radio it's
model<00:01:31.290> 746<00:01:32.780> 746<00:01:33.780> 12b<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> date

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
model 746 746 12b and I know the date

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.539 
model 746 746 12b and I know the date
code<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.590> sure<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.189> it's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
code for this one I'm not sure it's it's

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.749 
code for this one I'm not sure it's it's
I<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.650> actually<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.220> twenty<00:01:41.490> third

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
think it's yeah the date code is 23:07

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.090 
think it's yeah the date code is 23:07
which<00:01:51.240> actually<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.439> manufactured

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
which actually it's it was manufactured

be great because yeah I'm not going to
tell<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.840> 23<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.310> look

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
tell you what it is it's 23 if you look

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.140 
tell you what it is it's 23 if you look
at<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> date<00:02:08.910> code<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.800> 23:07<00:02:10.800> Kay<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.430> think

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
at the date code it's 23:07 Kay I think

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.730 
at the date code it's 23:07 Kay I think
I<00:02:12.239> don't<00:02:12.300> know<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:12.900> made

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
I don't know if it's made

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.210 
I don't know if it's made
is<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.910> made<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> seventh<00:02:15.540> week<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.900> 1993<00:02:16.620> I'm

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
is it made the seventh week of 1993 I'm

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.830 
is it made the seventh week of 1993 I'm
not<00:02:17.580> telling<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.060> I'm<00:02:18.270> not<00:02:18.420> gonna<00:02:18.570> show<00:02:18.810> you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
its if you know the date it code is so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.260 
its if you know the date it code is so
enough<00:02:23.670> said

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.680 
noise yeah that's quite an interesting
clock<00:05:13.229> radio<00:05:13.590> if<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.039> recognize<00:05:14.789> that<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.419> I

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
clock radio if you recognize that so I

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.230 
clock radio if you recognize that so I
know<00:05:16.349> a<00:05:16.770> lot<00:05:17.010> of<00:05:17.099> some<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.520> other<00:05:17.849> users

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
know a lot of some of the other users

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.089 
know a lot of some of the other users
who<00:05:18.300> have<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.690> exact<00:05:19.050> clock<00:05:19.289> radio<00:05:19.650> like<00:05:19.889> that

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
who have the exact clock radio like that

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.469 
who have the exact clock radio like that
because<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:20.580> know<00:05:20.639> if<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:20.910> want<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.090> see<00:05:21.240> it

because I know if you want to see it

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.020 
because I know if you want to see it
back<00:05:21.960> couple<00:05:22.889> of<00:05:22.950> years<00:05:23.099> back<00:05:23.400> when<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:23.610> did<00:05:23.880> the

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
back couple of years back when I did the

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.170 
back couple of years back when I did the
video<00:05:24.510> on<00:05:24.720> my<00:05:24.810> old<00:05:24.960> channel<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:25.940> this<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:27.150> a

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
video on my old channel and this is a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.650 
video on my old channel and this is a
very<00:05:27.570> interesting<00:05:27.870> clock<00:05:28.260> radio<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.710> find<00:05:28.800> so

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
very interesting clock radio to find so

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.860 
very interesting clock radio to find so
there<00:05:30.660> you<00:05:30.750> have<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.960> my<00:05:31.950> my<00:05:32.720> demonstration<00:05:33.720> of

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
there you have it my my demonstration of

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.190 
there you have it my my demonstration of
my<00:05:33.900> GE<00:05:34.610> digital<00:05:35.610> clock<00:05:35.789> radio<00:05:36.060> from<00:05:36.240> 1993

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
my GE digital clock radio from 1993

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.550 
my GE digital clock radio from 1993
model<00:05:37.830> 7<00:05:38.520> -<00:05:39.060> 46<00:05:39.720> 12<00:05:40.110> B<00:05:40.760> so<00:05:42.260> tell<00:05:43.260> us<00:05:43.289> what<00:05:43.440> you

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
model 7 - 46 12 B so tell us what you

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.240 
model 7 - 46 12 B so tell us what you
think<00:05:43.680> about<00:05:43.830> it<00:05:44.070> so<00:05:44.280> see<00:05:45.120> you<00:05:45.210> later
