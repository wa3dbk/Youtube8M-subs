00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.240 

this<00:00:04.540> video<00:00:04.899> will<00:00:05.109> be<00:00:05.290> working<00:00:05.680> with<00:00:05.800> strong

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
this video will be working with strong

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.789 
this video will be working with strong
acids<00:00:06.790> and<00:00:07.060> strong<00:00:07.120> bases<00:00:07.810> and<00:00:08.109> we'll<00:00:08.650> be

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:08.799 
acids and strong bases and we'll be

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.490 
acids and strong bases and we'll be
trying<00:00:09.010> to<00:00:09.160> find<00:00:09.400> the<00:00:09.520> pH<00:00:09.790> of<00:00:10.349> solutions<00:00:11.349> at

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
trying to find the pH of solutions at

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.430 
trying to find the pH of solutions at
them<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:13.030> in<00:00:13.210> all<00:00:13.330> of<00:00:13.450> these<00:00:13.599> it's<00:00:13.990> best<00:00:14.259> to

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
them so in all of these it's best to

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.470 
them so in all of these it's best to
start<00:00:14.650> out<00:00:14.889> by<00:00:15.160> writing<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:16.090> actual

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
start out by writing the actual

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.200 
start out by writing the actual
dissociation<00:00:17.349> equation<00:00:17.860> for<00:00:18.099> them<00:00:18.250> and<00:00:18.640> it

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
dissociation equation for them and it

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.880 
dissociation equation for them and it
will<00:00:19.330> save<00:00:19.539> you<00:00:19.690> a<00:00:19.720> lot<00:00:19.930> of<00:00:19.990> time<00:00:20.289> in<00:00:20.470> trouble

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
will save you a lot of time in trouble

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.060 
will save you a lot of time in trouble
in<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.130> future<00:00:21.340> if<00:00:21.730> you<00:00:21.970> do<00:00:22.119> that<00:00:22.359> every<00:00:22.480> time

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
in the future if you do that every time

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.849 
in the future if you do that every time
so<00:00:24.070> for<00:00:24.430> hydrochloric<00:00:25.060> acid<00:00:25.480> we<00:00:26.380> write<00:00:26.740> it<00:00:26.859> up

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
so for hydrochloric acid we write it up

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.530 
so for hydrochloric acid we write it up
and<00:00:30.599> since<00:00:31.599> HCl<00:00:32.199> is<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.529> strong<00:00:33.010> acid<00:00:33.330> we<00:00:34.330> know

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
and since HCl is a strong acid we know

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:44.670 
and since HCl is a strong acid we know
that<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:35.649> completely<00:00:36.100> dissociates<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.469> that's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
that it completely dissociates so that's

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.979 
that it completely dissociates so that's
how<00:00:44.800> we<00:00:44.829> we<00:00:45.340> do<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.700> single<00:00:46.390> arrow<00:00:46.600> rather

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
how we we do the single arrow rather

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.060 
how we we do the single arrow rather
than<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:47.379> equilibrium<00:00:47.649> arrow<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.770> now<00:00:50.920> that

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
than the equilibrium arrow so now that

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.069 
than the equilibrium arrow so now that
we<00:00:51.160> have<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:51.370> we<00:00:51.910> want<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.420> find<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.870> ratio

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
we have that we want to find the ratio

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:07.609 
we have that we want to find the ratio
of<00:00:53.710> our<00:00:54.579> moles<00:00:54.879> of<00:00:55.090> h<00:00:55.239> three<00:00:55.270> o<00:00:55.570> plus<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:57.000> HCl<00:00:58.020> so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.460 

so<00:01:08.619> with<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.100> ratio<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:10.750> then<00:01:11.020> are

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
so with this ratio we then are

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.580 
so with this ratio we then are
interested<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.189> finding<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.590> concentration

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
interested in finding the concentration

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.820 
interested in finding the concentration
of<00:01:14.650> h3o<00:01:14.830> plus<00:01:15.220> in<00:01:15.820> order<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.180> find<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.510> pH<00:01:16.830> so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
of h3o plus in order to find the pH so

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:27.620 
of h3o plus in order to find the pH so
we<00:01:18.009> multiply<00:01:18.220> this<00:01:18.610> ratio<00:01:19.180> by<00:01:20.110> our<00:01:20.320> point<00:01:20.830> 40

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.499 

and<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:29.560> tells<00:01:29.770> us<00:01:30.009> that<00:01:30.220> we<00:01:30.369> have<00:01:30.520> zero

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
and that tells us that we have zero

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.859 
and that tells us that we have zero
point<00:01:31.810> 400<00:01:32.619> molar<00:01:33.810> h3o<00:01:34.810> plus<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.509> now<00:01:37.689> we're

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
point 400 molar h3o plus so now we're

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.940 
point 400 molar h3o plus so now we're
ready<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.110> solve<00:01:38.470> for<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.799> pH<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:40.829> from<00:01:41.829> the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
ready to solve for the pH and from the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.380 
ready to solve for the pH and from the
definition<00:01:42.159> of<00:01:42.640> pH<00:01:43.119> it's<00:01:43.689> just<00:01:45.119> equal<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.270> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
definition of pH it's just equal to the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.310 
definition of pH it's just equal to the
negative<00:01:46.600> log<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:48.119> h3o<00:01:49.119> plus<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.899> now<00:01:53.049> we<00:01:53.110> can

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
negative log of h3o plus so now we can

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.740 
negative log of h3o plus so now we can
plug<00:01:53.560> our<00:01:53.710> numbers<00:01:54.009> in

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.770 

and<00:02:01.750> when<00:02:02.680> we<00:02:02.830> calculate<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.370> all<00:02:03.670> out<00:02:03.970> we

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
and when we calculate that all out we

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.210 
and when we calculate that all out we
should<00:02:05.050> get<00:02:05.320> zero<00:02:05.350> point<00:02:06.190> three<00:02:06.520> nine<00:02:07.390> nine

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
should get zero point three nine nine

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.990 
should get zero point three nine nine
and<00:02:09.600> that's<00:02:10.600> going<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.810> be<00:02:10.960> our<00:02:10.990> pH<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.730> we

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
and that's going to be our pH and we

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.210 
and that's going to be our pH and we
check<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.360> significant<00:02:13.900> figures<00:02:14.290> with

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
check the significant figures with

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.990 
check the significant figures with
logarithms<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:16.540> want<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.550> take<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.760> total

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
logarithms we want to take the total

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.620 
logarithms we want to take the total
number<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.420> significant<00:02:19.900> figures<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:21.630> that

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
number of significant figures and that

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.720 
number of significant figures and that
number<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.080> significant<00:02:23.500> figures<00:02:23.530> should<00:02:24.490> be

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
number of significant figures should be

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.630 
number of significant figures should be
past<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.990> decimal<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:28.570> checks<00:02:28.840> out

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
past the decimal and that checks out

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.480 
past the decimal and that checks out
that's<00:02:30.640> our<00:02:30.820> pH<00:02:31.980> now<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:35.020> move<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.400> a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
that's our pH now we can move on to a a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.750 
that's our pH now we can move on to a a
little<00:02:37.390> harder<00:02:37.720> one<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.520> dissociation<00:02:39.520> of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
little harder one a dissociation of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.270 
little harder one a dissociation of
another<00:02:40.060> strong<00:02:40.360> acid<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:44.280> h2so4

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
another strong acid and this is h2so4

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.390 
another strong acid and this is h2so4
which<00:02:46.150> we<00:02:46.360> know<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.720> strong<00:02:47.050> acid<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:48.190> we're

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
which we know is a strong acid so we're

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.830 
which we know is a strong acid so we're
going<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.580> write<00:02:48.760> out<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.120> dissociation

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
going to write out the dissociation

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:58.830 
going to write out the dissociation
equation<00:02:50.500> for<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.940> use<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.420> single

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
equation for it and we use the single

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:16.900 
equation for it and we use the single
arrow<00:02:59.050> rather<00:02:59.380> than<00:02:59.620> equilibrium<00:03:00.340> arrow

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.960 

so<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.030> can<00:03:18.330> see<00:03:18.540> there's<00:03:18.750> two<00:03:19.080> h0<00:03:20.010> pluses<00:03:20.580> per

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
so you can see there's two h0 pluses per

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:36.880 
so you can see there's two h0 pluses per
1<00:03:21.840> h2so4<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:24.060> we<00:03:24.180> write<00:03:24.330> out<00:03:24.510> our<00:03:24.769> ratio<00:03:35.269> and

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
1 h2so4 so we write out our ratio and

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.410 
1 h2so4 so we write out our ratio and
then<00:03:37.890> our<00:03:38.010> molar<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.670> 20<00:03:39.360> 2.10<00:03:40.459> millimolar<00:03:41.459> so

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
then our molar is 20 2.10 millimolar so

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.130 
then our molar is 20 2.10 millimolar so
we<00:03:42.720> need<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.230> be<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.910> molar<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.900> let's

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
we need this to be in molar so let's

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:57.920 
we need this to be in molar so let's
convert<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.620> molar<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:57.090> after<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.690> we

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
convert it to molar and after that we

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:10.780 
convert it to molar and after that we
should<00:03:58.200> get<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:10.230> now<00:04:10.349> that<00:04:10.379> we<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.620> our

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
should get so now that we have our

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.780 
should get so now that we have our
concentration<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:12.480> h<00:04:12.720> 0<00:04:13.079> plus<00:04:13.440> we<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.370> solve

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
concentration of h 0 plus we can solve

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:29.390 
concentration of h 0 plus we can solve
for<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.120> pH

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.249 

and<00:04:29.669> we<00:04:30.570> get<00:04:31.400> 1.3<00:04:34.490> 546<00:04:35.490> as<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.630> can<00:04:36.750> see<00:04:36.930> four

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
and we get 1.3 546 as you can see four

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.469 
and we get 1.3 546 as you can see four
significant<00:04:37.770> figures<00:04:37.830> here<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.669> there

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
significant figures here and there

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.240 
significant figures here and there
should<00:04:39.720> be<00:04:39.840> four<00:04:40.169> significant<00:04:40.740> figures<00:04:40.770> in

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
should be four significant figures in

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.460 
should be four significant figures in
your<00:04:41.370> answer<00:04:41.639> past<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.060> decimal<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:43.320> that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
your answer past the decimal so that

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.040 
your answer past the decimal so that
checks<00:04:43.710> out<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:45.210> many<00:04:45.360> students<00:04:46.139> tend<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:48.050> not

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
checks out so many students tend to not

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.890 
checks out so many students tend to not
get<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.470> ratio<00:04:49.740> right<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:51.240> their<00:04:51.539> answer

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
get this ratio right so their answer

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.590 
get this ratio right so their answer
they<00:04:52.320> think<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.770> there's<00:04:52.949> 0<00:04:53.039> point<00:04:53.250> 0<00:04:53.370> 2<00:04:54.270> to

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
they think that there's 0 point 0 2 to

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.580 
they think that there's 0 point 0 2 to
10<00:04:55.229> moles<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:56.160> h<00:04:56.669> three<00:04:56.699> o<00:04:57.000> plus<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.600> then<00:04:58.440> they

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
10 moles of h three o plus and then they

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.140 
10 moles of h three o plus and then they
get<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.919> answer<00:04:59.160> completely<00:04:59.639> wrong<00:04:59.850> so

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
get the answer completely wrong so

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.909 
get the answer completely wrong so
that's<00:05:00.300> why<00:05:00.509> it's<00:05:00.690> important<00:05:01.199> to<00:05:01.560> write<00:05:01.740> out

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
that's why it's important to write out

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.000 
that's why it's important to write out
the<00:05:02.130> dissociation<00:05:02.760> reaction<00:05:03.120> completely

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
the dissociation reaction completely

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.689 
the dissociation reaction completely
before<00:05:05.010> you<00:05:05.190> start<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.520> problem<00:05:07.340> okay<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:08.400> now

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
before you start the problem okay so now

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.120 
before you start the problem okay so now
we<00:05:08.760> can<00:05:08.970> use<00:05:09.180> it<00:05:09.330> another<00:05:09.690> problem<00:05:10.260> with<00:05:11.100> a

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
we can use it another problem with a

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.150 
we can use it another problem with a
base<00:05:13.940> in<00:05:15.020> this<00:05:16.020> case<00:05:16.260> we<00:05:16.500> have<00:05:16.620> calcium

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
base in this case we have calcium

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.830 
base in this case we have calcium
hydroxide<00:05:19.010> and<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:21.120> let's<00:05:21.300> write<00:05:21.510> out<00:05:21.690> the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
hydroxide and so let's write out the

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:42.290 
hydroxide and so let's write out the
dissociation<00:05:22.560> equation

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.720 

and<00:05:43.300> make<00:05:43.570> sure<00:05:43.600> we're<00:05:43.930> not<00:05:44.110> forgetting<00:05:44.730> that

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
and make sure we're not forgetting that

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.600 
and make sure we're not forgetting that
this<00:05:45.970> is<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.240> strong<00:05:46.630> base<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.260> it<00:05:48.250> completely

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
this is a strong base and it completely

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.630 
this is a strong base and it completely
dissociates<00:05:49.420> so<00:05:49.690> we<00:05:49.840> have<00:05:50.020> two<00:05:50.770> hydroxides

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
dissociates so we have two hydroxides

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.590 
dissociates so we have two hydroxides
produced<00:05:52.710> so<00:05:53.710> we<00:05:53.950> check<00:05:54.190> that<00:05:54.340> out<00:05:54.370> so<00:05:55.270> now<00:05:55.450> in

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
produced so we check that out so now in

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.840 
produced so we check that out so now in
this<00:05:55.750> case<00:05:56.020> we're<00:05:56.980> interested<00:05:57.280> in<00:05:57.670> the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
this case we're interested in the

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.250 
this case we're interested in the
concentration<00:05:58.240> of<00:05:58.840> hydroxide<00:06:00.660> for<00:06:01.660> however

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
concentration of hydroxide for however

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.100 
concentration of hydroxide for however
many<00:06:02.560> calcium<00:06:03.130> hydroxides<00:06:03.730> we<00:06:03.880> have<00:06:04.060> so<00:06:04.960> our

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
many calcium hydroxides we have so our

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:13.830 
many calcium hydroxides we have so our
ratio<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:09.520> 20<00:06:09.880> h<00:06:10.240> minus<00:06:10.800> /<00:06:11.800> one<00:06:12.840> calcium

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
ratio is 20 h minus / one calcium

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.270 
ratio is 20 h minus / one calcium
hydroxide<00:06:14.440> and<00:06:16.350> then<00:06:17.350> we're<00:06:17.560> told<00:06:17.830> that<00:06:18.010> we

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
hydroxide and then we're told that we

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.920 
hydroxide and then we're told that we
have<00:06:18.490> a<00:06:18.720> point<00:06:19.720> 53<00:06:20.530> millimolar<00:06:21.100> solution<00:06:24.930> so

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
have a point 53 millimolar solution so

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.830 
have a point 53 millimolar solution so
we<00:06:26.050> always<00:06:26.200> convert<00:06:26.650> that<00:06:26.770> to<00:06:26.919> molar<00:06:27.450> so<00:06:28.450> it's

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
we always convert that to molar so it's

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:40.200 
we always convert that to molar so it's
time<00:06:29.140> 10<00:06:29.410> to<00:06:29.530> the<00:06:29.590> negative<00:06:29.740> 3<00:06:30.190> and<00:06:38.850> we<00:06:39.850> should

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
time 10 to the negative 3 and we should

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:47.840 
time 10 to the negative 3 and we should
get<00:06:40.570> one<00:06:43.980> point<00:06:44.980> zero<00:06:45.190> six<00:06:46.000> times<00:06:46.780> ten<00:06:47.050> to

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
get one point zero six times ten to

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.040 
get one point zero six times ten to
negative<00:06:48.850> 3<00:06:49.180> molar<00:06:49.680> and<00:06:51.870> that's<00:06:52.870> our

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
negative 3 molar and that's our

00:06:53.050 --> 00:07:01.500 
negative 3 molar and that's our
concentration<00:06:53.950> of<00:06:54.130> hydroxide<00:06:58.919> and<00:07:00.510> that's

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
concentration of hydroxide and that's

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.890 
concentration of hydroxide and that's
exactly<00:07:01.690> what<00:07:02.169> we<00:07:02.290> need<00:07:02.500> to<00:07:02.710> find<00:07:02.979> the<00:07:03.130> Poh<00:07:03.900> so

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
exactly what we need to find the Poh so

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.880 
exactly what we need to find the Poh so
the<00:07:05.290> Poh<00:07:06.419> just<00:07:07.419> like<00:07:07.570> the<00:07:07.690> pH<00:07:08.020> except<00:07:08.470> for<00:07:08.710> is

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
the Poh just like the pH except for is

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.130 
the Poh just like the pH except for is
the<00:07:09.040> negative<00:07:09.250> log<00:07:09.669> of<00:07:11.880> the<00:07:13.050> concentration<00:07:14.050> of

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
the negative log of the concentration of

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:26.240 
the negative log of the concentration of
O<00:07:14.260> H

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.089 

after<00:07:27.250> that<00:07:27.430> we<00:07:27.669> should<00:07:28.000> get<00:07:28.439> two<00:07:29.439> point<00:07:29.979> nine

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:30.099 
after that we should get two point nine

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.990 
after that we should get two point nine
seven<00:07:31.090> five<00:07:31.960> three<00:07:32.969> significant<00:07:33.969> figures

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 
seven five three significant figures

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.719 
seven five three significant figures
there<00:07:34.629> three<00:07:35.319> significant<00:07:35.860> figures<00:07:35.889> there<00:07:36.430> so

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729 
there three significant figures there so

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:39.330 
there three significant figures there so
that<00:07:36.759> checks<00:07:37.090> out<00:07:37.439> so<00:07:38.439> now<00:07:38.560> we<00:07:38.650> want<00:07:38.979> to<00:07:39.219> find

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:39.340 
that checks out so now we want to find

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.700 
that checks out so now we want to find
the<00:07:39.520> pH<00:07:40.349> so<00:07:41.349> from<00:07:41.650> the<00:07:41.770> definition<00:07:42.370> of<00:07:42.460> pH<00:07:43.710> it's

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:44.710 
the pH so from the definition of pH it's

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:53.659 
the pH so from the definition of pH it's
just<00:07:45.099> 14<00:07:45.810> minus<00:07:46.810> the<00:07:47.259> Poh<00:07:49.740> so<00:07:50.740> we<00:07:50.979> take<00:07:52.110> 14

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:53.669 
just 14 minus the Poh so we take 14

00:07:53.669 --> 00:08:05.540 
just 14 minus the Poh so we take 14
minus<00:07:58.800> and<00:07:59.800> we<00:08:00.189> should<00:08:00.460> get<00:08:01.500> 11.0<00:08:02.879> 25<00:08:04.379> and

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:05.550 
minus and we should get 11.0 25 and
