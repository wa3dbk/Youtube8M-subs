00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.260 

you<00:02:05.939> are<00:02:06.060> witnessing<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.930> most<00:02:07.530> powerful<00:02:08.340> in

Queens<00:02:09.569> technique<00:02:10.229> ever<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.280> exist

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.080 

I<00:02:19.480> think<00:02:20.410> Tony<00:02:20.620> Jaa's<00:02:20.950> actually<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.819> best

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
I think Tony Jaa's actually the best

I think Tony Jaa's actually the best
action<00:02:22.599> star

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.270 

I<00:02:29.950> think<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.060> appeals<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.630> more<00:02:32.530> than<00:02:32.770> just<00:02:33.069> one

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
I think it appeals to more than just one

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.630 
I think it appeals to more than just one
audience<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:34.650> don't<00:02:35.650> think<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.310> time

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
audience I don't think that it's time

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.280 
audience I don't think that it's time
Marshall<00:02:37.030> arts<00:02:37.390> movie<00:02:37.660> or<00:02:37.780> its<00:02:37.900> high<00:02:38.050> action

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
Marshall arts movie or its high action

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.550

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
movie it is made in Thailand by great

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.800 
movie it is made in Thailand by great
Thai<00:02:41.830> actors<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.700> great<00:02:42.730> Thai<00:02:43.060> producers<00:02:43.630> and

Thai actors and great Thai producers and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.630 
Thai actors and great Thai producers and
directors<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.650> think<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.220> made<00:02:45.370> for<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
