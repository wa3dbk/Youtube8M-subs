gonna<00:00:46.110> call<00:00:46.289> me<00:00:46.379> crazy<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:47.270> this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.390> actually

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
gonna call me crazy but this is actually

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.720 
gonna call me crazy but this is actually
probably<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.960> easiest<00:00:49.260> level<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> game

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.340 

all<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:53.910> maybe<00:00:54.120> uplift<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.260> bit

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
all right maybe uplift was a little bit

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.189 
all right maybe uplift was a little bit
easier<00:00:55.500> doing<00:00:56.160> them<00:00:56.750> even<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> speedrun

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
easier doing them even the speedrun

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.869 
easier doing them even the speedrun
there<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.219> pretty<00:00:59.309> easy<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.469> anyways

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
there but this is pretty easy so anyways

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.479 
there but this is pretty easy so anyways
as<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.589> where<00:01:04.830> we're<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.430> not

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
as you can see where we're we're not

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.380 
as you can see where we're we're not
wasting<00:01:05.760> any<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> laser<00:01:07.830> ammo<00:01:08.390> hold

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
this section you may be in some

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.509 
this section you may be in some
situations<00:02:26.620> where<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.799> may<00:02:26.859> need<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.219> use<00:02:27.280> it

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
situations where you may need to use it

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.940 
situations where you may need to use it
but<00:02:27.700> i<00:02:28.629> think<00:02:28.930> i<00:02:29.049> just<00:02:29.079> used<00:02:29.530> like<00:02:30.359> two<00:02:31.359> bullets

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
but i think i just used like two bullets

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.280 
but i think i just used like two bullets
two<00:02:32.950> bullets<00:02:33.219> yeah<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:36.989> because<00:02:37.989> we're<00:02:38.170> going

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
two bullets yeah so because we're going

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
two bullets yeah so because we're going
to<00:02:38.349> need<00:02:38.409> it<00:02:38.620> once<00:02:38.769> we're<00:02:38.950> inside<00:02:39.069> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
to need it once we're inside the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.149 
to need it once we're inside the
building<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.750> usually<00:02:43.870> what<00:02:44.139> I<00:02:44.200> do<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.530> um<00:02:44.769> once

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
building so usually what I do is um once

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.280 
building so usually what I do is um once
our<00:02:45.730> guys<00:02:46.030> have<00:02:46.180> cleared<00:02:46.450> out<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.599> area<00:02:46.900> I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
our guys have cleared out the area I

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.409 
our guys have cleared out the area I
come<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:50.129> turret<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:55.030> level<00:02:55.329> isn't

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:55.419 
come to this turret and the level isn't

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.580 
come to this turret and the level isn't
progressing<00:02:55.659> because<00:02:56.049> there's<00:02:56.260> two<00:02:56.439> guys

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
progressing because there's two guys

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.220 
progressing because there's two guys
still<00:02:56.919> at<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.129> bottom<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.489> shield<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.230> I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
still at the bottom of shield and I

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.289 
still at the bottom of shield and I
failed<00:02:59.859> to<00:03:00.040> take<00:03:00.189> them<00:03:00.310> out<00:03:00.459> from<00:03:00.669> there<00:03:01.629> and

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
failed to take them out from there and

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.599 
failed to take them out from there and
here<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.590> have<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.859> actually<00:03:06.010> get<00:03:06.280> down<00:03:06.400> and

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
here so I have to actually get down and

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.190 
here so I have to actually get down and
down<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.719> the<00:03:07.840> ditches<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.340> take<00:03:09.340> them<00:03:09.459> up<00:03:10.200> so

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
down in the ditches and take them up so

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.240 
down in the ditches and take them up so

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
all the guys that they dropped off

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.129 
all the guys that they dropped off
that's<00:03:44.799> all<00:03:45.159> you're<00:03:46.030> really<00:03:46.060> going<00:03:46.479> to<00:03:46.540> do<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
that's all you're really going to do the

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.869 
that's all you're really going to do the
intention<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.799> not<00:03:47.979> really<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.430> kill<00:03:48.669> anybody

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
intention is not really to kill anybody

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.710 
intention is not really to kill anybody
if<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.329> kill<00:03:49.540> people<00:03:49.569> then<00:03:49.989> great<00:03:50.639> but<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
if you kill people then great but the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.270 
if you kill people then great but the
idea<00:03:53.049> is<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.229> put<00:03:53.439> some<00:03:53.590> fire<00:03:53.769> on<00:03:53.829> people

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
idea is to put some fire on people

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.939 
idea is to put some fire on people
because<00:03:54.430> what<00:03:55.150> that'll<00:03:55.479> do<00:03:55.689> when<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.769> start

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
because what that'll do when you start

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.009 
because what that'll do when you start
shooting<00:03:57.250> at<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.459> enemy<00:03:57.540> it'll<00:03:58.540> it'll

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
shooting at the enemy it'll it'll

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.330 
shooting at the enemy it'll it'll
trigger<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.620> the<00:04:00.280> game<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.909> progress<00:04:01.299> so<00:04:01.959> I

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
trigger the the game to progress so I

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.170 
trigger the the game to progress so I
don't<00:04:03.340> know<00:04:03.400> who<00:04:03.549> yells<00:04:03.759> it<00:04:03.909> out<00:04:04.000> with

once we go into the UM once we go into

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.150 
once we go into the UM once we go into
the<00:05:05.150> building<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:08.840> it's<00:05:09.020> what's<00:05:09.800> going<00:05:10.040> on

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
the building so it's what's going on

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.290 
the building so it's what's going on
here<00:05:10.370> is<00:05:10.430> we're<00:05:10.550> going<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.700> be<00:05:10.820> using<00:05:10.850> this

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
here is we're going to be using this

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.750 
here is we're going to be using this
wall<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.900> kind<00:05:12.560> of<00:05:12.620> put<00:05:13.550> us<00:05:13.700> between<00:05:15.669> put<00:05:16.669> the

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
wall to kind of put us between put the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.480 
wall to kind of put us between put the
end<00:05:16.880> of<00:05:16.940> each<00:05:17.000> enemy<00:05:17.360> between<00:05:17.960> us<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.490> we're

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
end of each enemy between us and we're

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.760 
end of each enemy between us and we're
going<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.669> rely<00:05:19.790> on<00:05:19.910> Mickey<00:05:20.590> slowly<00:05:21.590> but

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
going to rely on Mickey slowly but

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.550 
going to rely on Mickey slowly but
surely<00:05:22.190> because<00:05:22.430> all<00:05:22.580> he<00:05:22.669> has<00:05:22.820> is<00:05:22.850> that<00:05:23.560> that

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
surely because all he has is that that

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.580 
surely because all he has is that that
um<00:05:26.290> that<00:05:27.290> mp5<00:05:27.950> looking<00:05:28.310> at<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:29.210> SMG<00:05:29.600> the

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
um that mp5 looking at the SMG the

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.030 
um that mp5 looking at the SMG the
styling<00:05:30.919> system<00:05:31.220> view<00:05:31.370> so<00:05:32.650> if<00:05:33.650> you're<00:05:33.860> quick

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
styling system view so if you're quick

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.250 
styling system view so if you're quick
enough<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:36.820> go<00:05:37.820> ahead<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.240> give<00:05:38.690> him<00:05:38.900> a<00:05:39.020> better

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
enough to go ahead and give him a better

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.530 
enough to go ahead and give him a better
weapon<00:05:39.940> like<00:05:40.940> if<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:41.270> have<00:05:41.479> them<00:05:43.479> would<00:05:44.479> you

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
weapon like if you have them would you

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.360 
weapon like if you have them would you
call<00:05:44.720> it<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:46.340> laser<00:05:46.550> blaster<00:05:47.979> you<00:05:48.979> know<00:05:49.070> it'll

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
call it the laser blaster you know it'll

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.300 
call it the laser blaster you know it'll
take<00:05:49.520> him<00:05:49.669> time<00:05:49.850> because<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:51.800> game's<00:05:52.010> kind<00:05:52.220> of

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
take him time because the game's kind of

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.070 
take him time because the game's kind of
weird<00:05:52.490> that<00:05:52.669> if<00:05:52.910> enemies<00:05:53.300> are<00:05:53.479> really<00:05:53.870> really

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
weird that if enemies are really really

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.580 
weird that if enemies are really really
close<00:05:54.700> the<00:05:55.700> AI<00:05:55.880> your<00:05:56.510> your<00:05:56.870> co-op<00:05:57.229> AI<00:05:57.410> will<00:05:58.040> be

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
close the AI your your co-op AI will be

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.570 
close the AI your your co-op AI will be
cognizant<00:06:00.590> that<00:06:00.620> he's<00:06:00.830> too<00:06:00.979> close<00:06:01.220> and<00:06:01.430> he

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
cognizant that he's too close and he

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.580 
cognizant that he's too close and he
won't<00:06:01.760> shoot<00:06:02.060> like<00:06:02.630> if<00:06:02.930> he<00:06:03.080> has<00:06:03.169> a<00:06:03.200> rocket

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
won't shoot like if he has a rocket

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.590 
won't shoot like if he has a rocket
launcher<00:06:03.919> you<00:06:04.130> won't<00:06:04.310> shoot<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:04.640> if<00:06:05.330> he<00:06:05.450> has<00:06:05.570> a

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
launcher you won't shoot it if he has a

launcher you won't shoot it if he has a
laser<00:06:05.870> blaster<00:06:06.290> he<00:06:06.440> won't<00:06:06.620> shoot<00:06:06.740> it<00:06:06.890> he<00:06:07.580> needs

good gun to give him
you<00:06:20.740> know<00:06:20.860> just<00:06:21.009> stuff<00:06:21.159> like<00:06:21.249> that<00:06:21.370> that<00:06:21.550> way

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
you know just stuff like that that way

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.760
