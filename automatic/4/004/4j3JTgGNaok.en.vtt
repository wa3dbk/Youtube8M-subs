00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello and welcome to do it 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.980
 yourself inspiration some of you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.750
 had wished that I have one 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.340
 piece melon maker so a bit 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.139
 I have watermelon here 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.040
 I made that on the longboard 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 you need a total of 15 greens 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.439
 Outside rubbers 22 red with this one 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.029
 above as connecting group and four 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.590
 black he could of course more 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.430
 We never use blacks anymore 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 want to do 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 so the whole looks then you need from 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.580
 your crochet needle for now and then 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 Let's start with the instructions 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.230
 so it starts with the instructions with 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.559
 your board that you adjust so that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.780
 the three pins are in a row and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.870
 her state with the green rubbers of the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.020
 green you need as I said 15 and from 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.489
 the red 22 and four black the four 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.649
 I already have black over each 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.570
 two red ones just given to the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.789
 want to crochet hook roll and then over 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.469
 so they there in the middle are the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.230
 be the working cores I equal 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.300
 with one and you start with as I said 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.510
 Two green rubbers I always work with 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.640
 two commissars all my fans and you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.710
 starts in the upper right corner is 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.670
 once to the left and then once 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:17.060
 diagonally to the left then it goes 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:22.619
 Let's go with the red rubbers and I'll stretch 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:26.520
 a total of five times in the fall direction and 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.659
 on the right and in the middle 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.259
 I distribute the red ones with the black ones 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.150
 simply with rubber after so easy 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.460
 random times there 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.850
 Grasp and the pain just with you 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.200
 put up 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.200
 always alternately best 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:01.310
 one two three four man then we do 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:04.420
 here is a 5 anyway and that would be 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.420
 Here are five 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.780
 no turning back 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.879
 then again no and then come here 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.879
 last but not least one 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.130
 so 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.780
 These are the red rubbers that I have 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.510
 and now I change 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:49.459
 back to the green and span 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:55.380
 here on the edge three times in the fall direction 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:03:00.300
 then a fourth time for the fourth time 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.819
 diagonal over just like up here and 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:09.570
 once again to the side 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.090
 The whole thing looks like it recognizes 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.300
 Even as melon I find here and on 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.920
 the last pin is the sixth on 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.000
 the right side of the sixth on the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.150
 top page here 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.090
 here comes this stretch rubber out that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:31.800
 I give it twice around my fingers and 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:35.400
 there would be out there on so then 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.030
 are still red gums spun it here 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.200
 once over the fourth row and once 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.200
 over the third row 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.620
 the whole thing looks like this and now 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.620
 I'll start with the agreement of 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:58.890
 I start at the very bottom of the last pin 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.700
 little existed and coal more than 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.900
 first the red gums out flower 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.630
 first red once off completely 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.609
 all the way up through lungs 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.120
 Take care of the rubber straps that you are 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.120
 do not take it out 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:27.140
 the series is engaged then the next one 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.140
 red synonymous because the red rausnehmen 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.949
 by 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:50.669
 The red rows are engaged now 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:55.319
 I make the green as I pick myself 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:59.629
 First, this is the green one out there 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:02.339
 give it over to the side 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:05.939
 you have to be careful when 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:13.559
 it is the about page as nothing 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:16.050
 then slip the next here too 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:17.729
 above diagonally over and then it will 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.319
 again easier then in the rubbers only 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:28.409
 still up like the whole series through 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:30.979
 then take it up here again 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.979
 diagonal 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:43.250
 and here again later then is 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.410
 everything tries and then I take to 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.660
 conclusion still my last big rubber 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.440
 and she's up here once through the 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.140
 very first pin in which I am with the 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.990
 she started him up 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:01.160
 once through again through yourself 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:12.230
 pull yourself tight and then take it 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:15.940
 I do the whole of the board then the whole 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.710
 how to get in shape like always 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.560
 and then that's one piece and done 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.060
 Looks like it says the kernels of course 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.920
 also in a bit of shape 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.570
 you can see the whole thing as perfect 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.250
 watermelon if you like the whole 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.050
 I liked it then 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.700
