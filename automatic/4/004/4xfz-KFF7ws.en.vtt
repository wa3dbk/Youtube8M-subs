00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
it will be but I think today is you know

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.600 
it will be but I think today is you know
it's<00:01:30.350> still<00:01:30.530> disappointing<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:31.189> still<00:01:31.399> hurts

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
it's still disappointing it still hurts

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.580 
it's still disappointing it still hurts
we<00:01:31.850> mean<00:01:32.119> we<00:01:32.540> really<00:01:32.689> believe<00:01:33.049> we<00:01:33.259> could<00:01:33.409> win

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
we mean we really believe we could win

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.620 
we mean we really believe we could win
that<00:01:33.619> game<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:34.369> I<00:01:34.759> think<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.299> could<00:01:35.450> see

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
that game and and I think you could see

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.260 
that game and and I think you could see
from<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.740> game<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.159> we<00:01:37.310> we<00:01:37.820> did<00:01:38.000> believe

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
from the the game that we we did believe

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.910 
from the the game that we we did believe
that<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.630> wasn't<00:01:38.930> just<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.170> case<00:01:39.320> of<00:01:39.380> us<00:01:39.649> hoping

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
that it wasn't just a case of us hoping

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.469 
that it wasn't just a case of us hoping
for<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.189> best<00:01:40.340> we<00:01:40.549> really<00:01:40.820> were<00:01:40.969> in<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.270> game

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
for the best we really were in that game

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.910 
for the best we really were in that game
and<00:01:41.630> me<00:01:41.750> we<00:01:41.990> had<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> good<00:01:42.320> chance<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.740> win<00:01:42.890> it

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
and me we had a good chance to win it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.280 
and me we had a good chance to win it
and<00:01:43.130> we<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.880> know<00:01:44.000> that<00:01:44.149> hurts<00:01:44.329> but<00:01:44.899> I<00:01:44.930> think

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
and we you know that hurts but I think

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.080 
and we you know that hurts but I think
when<00:01:45.530> we<00:01:45.680> have<00:01:46.189> a<00:01:46.219> little<00:01:46.399> time<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.700> reflect

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
when we have a little time to reflect

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.789 
when we have a little time to reflect
