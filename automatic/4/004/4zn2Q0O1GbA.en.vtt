00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.010
 michelle good night the two teams 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.540
 made it a tough match 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.280
 pluk took the lead shortly after the break 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.110
 but still had one at the end 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.240
 allow draw request comment on 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.119
 the match 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.980
 yes i think their example have what 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.620
 weeks in the cloud expect everything 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.950
 can happen at any time the best 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.310
 example in the two on the last 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.770
 minute of the match in the first 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.780
 part of which the match still 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.159
 connected the two teams respect 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.710
 for each other 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.800
 how do we have our can I think three 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.230
 had the best options 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.219
 with give up dirt or those that the construction site 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.960
 in the bottom corner a budget it will 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.179
 I know we wanted a lot at that time 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.579
 have left room for the two box 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.829
 of such ones have way too much after 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.069
 mingoes team can sit in and out 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.920
 position of being full 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:08.810
 so balanced setting then you come on 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.430
 lead in such a hat webshop bosman 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.590
 come what you think at a certain time 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.750
 the opponent gets a number of risks 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.910
 because what happens is that you had 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.040
 might come under pressure so that you 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.160
 must come into that organization but that 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.650
 I also had room to get any 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.370
 score second goal no matter what 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.620
 happened at a certain time 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.240
 who serves that we had two chances 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.350
 today to win that competition 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.500
 on 0 in and on in knowing that too 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.600
 will still have the last one but me 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.480
 think if we score the second you 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.430
 can then be a cell that could 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.900
 Anderlecht therefore loses the evening end 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.910
 still not so bad for you 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.790
 pants there did not look at the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.900
 rest i think we have the ship 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.120
 was not taken 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.670
 we knew we would be difficult 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.820
 match that 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:05.040
 will be home undefeated we see the grain 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.040
 to be able to beat them 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.110
 and yes standard wind and and other life 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.030
 and that state is there and at the moment 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.580
 that one your actions will be a panty pants 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.520
 and in Mechelen so you know you see how 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.890
 Bringing them together shortly sees everything is 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.750
 and no we do that within every week nothing can 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.010
 and that will happen to many people and 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.170
 do you think kids clubs 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.450
 thank you, football can't be a good one 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.300
 evening we saw two attacks the teams 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.940
 who both want to win 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.860
 shortly after the break, but then 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.450
 kept the waregem, but the gas pedal 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.610
 pushing it in and then it moves on to me 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.319
 deserved equalizer than the anyway 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.959
 both teams with one or the side for the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.209
 on the win please hear your analysis yes 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.160
 indeed like the lord like michel 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.989
 says first half was closed 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.940
 think how many were pretty good 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.049
 from a good organization 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.080
 I found that we are much the long ball 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.430
 searched could not connect split 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.840
 and you have to set your back on the goal 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.549
 problem to ensure the connection 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.720
 face to do they can they can 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.940
 take action they can do anything 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.549
 indeed we already had it in 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.900
 offcenter but there they had 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.790
 yes a keeper who is strong in there two 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.900
 central distributors also assisted 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.519
 by siemens 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.019
 so we actually don't have enough there 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.060
 More than maybe we could use the space 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.230
 in the took the sixteen-meter man was good 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.790
 closed 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.410
 in the second half they break open with one 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.420
 The cities in the phase are also pajamas 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.359
 in my opinion not always responded 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.760
 still one and two and then yes then must 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.950
 you try and especially the input of 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.290
 suffering and and asus 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.480
 a because player if deposited or able 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.799
 provide the appropriate help lines 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.180
 for show pointers last year 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.890
 seventeen goals market he must 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.780
 have six man mission then eh yes that is 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.610
 gratifying that he can her again 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.620
 but also the middle of 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.710
 real estate mean there by azar and 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.090
 could draw you three excellent 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.770
 football is a whole set of those three 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.210
 pointed and 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.860
 via the small source from there it was possible again 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.720
 the end as there was for drain 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.370
 so the kind of luck because where should it go 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.780
 take a risk on the road 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.130
 they still bring the Jewish indie 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.050
 very good prosper between ours 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.590
 defense and midfield so it was 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.840
 watch out and yes then along economy 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.400
 maybe we wanted to order about maria it 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.020
 can you two are the two may be 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.760
 so that's there but i 'm mostly 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.799
 satisfied with him 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.390
 well say about the four scribbles necessary 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.930
 when i said for the van will 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.180
 are still improving and 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.380
 appoint improved honey and 10% but 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.990
 looks 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.330
 He can see it on the up 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.730
 the key pani for Zulte-Waregem have now 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.350
 still first creator to play real to 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.340
 decide who play-off 1 plays together 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.590
 with kortrijk 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.760
 and then that match follows the trick 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.800
 yes we should start 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.090
 we had a very different try how the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.169
 people toys is totally not 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.600
 important to us 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.669
 the play-offs because we have a whole day 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.330
 stay competitive i like being u 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.820
 next time 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.720
 often very not coincidentally possible 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.410
 viewed the last play-offs and yes they are 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.000
 exciting 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.560
 you can grab many points there 'you can 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.510
 then little suits 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.190
 we must ensure that we are competitive 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.800
 continue to exist not as high as strange 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.630
 her game is also slightly less but we one 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.760
 played a lot much again you play 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.169
 also the final of the bang 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.850
 so we have to get ready for that 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.110
 final and if it goes that stone 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.790
 only had 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.380
 and we can confirm that on them 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.380
 I will all freeze clariah
