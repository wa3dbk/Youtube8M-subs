00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.250 
fish flingers update it goes into detail
about<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:48.800> combat<00:03:49.310> evolution<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.180> how<00:03:50.990> some

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
about the combat evolution and how some

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.020 
about the combat evolution and how some
of<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.530> attacks<00:03:51.920> are<00:03:52.070> going<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.250> work<00:03:52.400> now

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
of the attacks are going to work now

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.500 
of the attacks are going to work now
also<00:03:53.590> from<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:55.160> behind-the-scenes<00:03:55.880> video<00:03:56.209> I

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
also from that behind-the-scenes video I

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.300 
also from that behind-the-scenes video I
was<00:03:57.020> able<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.320> realize<00:03:57.650> with<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.980> combat

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
was able to realize with the combat

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.590 
was able to realize with the combat
evolution<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.959> different<00:04:00.680> tiers<00:04:01.130> of

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
evolution that the different tiers of

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.900 
evolution that the different tiers of
attack<00:04:02.600> styles<00:04:03.110> will<00:04:03.350> probably<00:04:03.860> also<00:04:04.100> operate

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
attack styles will probably also operate

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.699 
attack styles will probably also operate
off<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.330> armor<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.990> wear<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:06.530> that's

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
off of the armor that you wear so that's

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.980 
off of the armor that you wear so that's
a<00:04:06.950> pretty<00:04:07.610> interesting<00:04:07.880> fact<00:04:08.390> right<00:04:08.600> there<00:04:08.810> or

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
a pretty interesting fact right there or

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.080 
a pretty interesting fact right there or
not<00:04:09.140> fact<00:04:09.500> but<00:04:09.770> you<00:04:09.860> know<00:04:09.950> saw<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.370> from<00:04:10.850> them

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
not fact but you know saw it from them

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.650 
not fact but you know saw it from them
from<00:04:11.750> me<00:04:12.140> that<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.950> think<00:04:13.490> is<00:04:13.610> actually<00:04:13.760> going

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
from me that I think is actually going

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.150 
from me that I think is actually going
to<00:04:14.810> be<00:04:14.930> happening<00:04:15.170> with<00:04:15.950> this<00:04:16.609> new<00:04:17.510> combat

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160
