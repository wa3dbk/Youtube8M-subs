00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.529
 never good let's start look here 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.840
 we have a brie cheese that is a cheese 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.120
 French can be found in any 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.280
 supermarket there is no problem 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.890
 they come in ones where the cheeses are 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.470
 they come in some exact round boxes 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.289
 here we have it, I suggest that this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 cheese at room temperature tends to 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.730
 make creamy that is like sitel you 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 what you are going to eat naturally is how you have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 to eat but in this arm in this 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 case we require that it be well 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.829
 cold so that at the time of cutting it 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.950
 it costs us work because if we want 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.960
 then well refrigerated we take it out and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.079
 what we do is to cut the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 slices well as is a bit thick 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.300
 successes and ready we put them here as 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.940
 we have them in this in it's here 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.920
 and so we are cutting everything is quite 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.699
 pretty simple ok we have it here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.010
 after exactly look there are several 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:10.590
 techniques to me what I like is like this 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:12.690
 let's enter also here can be 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.729
 flour or it can be cornstarch to me in 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.820
 Particularly I like the cornstarch 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.130
 because because what helps me is that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.560
 do not stay in the part that when the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.940
 fries if you do not apply well the frying 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.530
 right now I'm going to talk about that very well 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.200
 many times if the oil is very 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.000
 hot when you bite him you have all 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.979
 the mealy part that is not very 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.140
 nice brie cheese that is a flavor 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.509
 very soft then it is very important 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.119
 existing exactly then here what 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.720
 what we do is let's put the cheese 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.940
 first we put it here in the cornstarch ok 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.330
 we remove the surplus as is 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.110
 then we passed it through egg the egg is 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.500
 a lightly beaten egg and here you 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:03.400
 let's put a little pepper 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.400
 freshly ground and a pinch of salt 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.850
 and it's all we need perfect 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.850
 good stirring because as is 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.200
 let's put it very well ok and then 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.200
 here we will go through the egg 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.410
 and later to bread to bread ok bank 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.450
 because the bank's good bank what has 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.850
 is a fresh bread that is used a lot to 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.850
 oriental cooking especially in kitchen 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.400
 Japanese ok here I 'm going to bake two 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.320
 which itself sometimes exactly what the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.930
 purpose of doing it twice that is left 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.700
 very crispy then like that when 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.170
 we approach let's feel it crispy 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.970
 of bread and let's go to feel what 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.120
 creamy cheese that is is the purpose 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.280
 of our of our courageous dish 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.430
 here the bread I do not have bread with not what 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.710
 I got, I can occupy ground bread or 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.290
 I do not have bread crushed but I have a bread 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.300
 I have cast aside old man there that bread 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.680
 old man I light it very well and it's going to 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.569
 remain as panko and they will stay 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.319
 pretty good in wheat then 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.299
 to diet with these cracker cookies 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.700
 embers and terrific and also knows 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.180
 delicious but good ok or with any 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.769
 type of salty cookie that has 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.459
 exactly how and from here, well, well, 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.459
 we already have here our ours 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.859
 Previously heated frying pan or plates 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.239
 illusion exactly here almost always 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.069
 I'm seeing that everyone is working 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.719
 in these induction plates if you are 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.579
 induction plates for example when 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.579
 we have cold kitchen that is like this 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.690
 well we can see the marble in these the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.570
 stainless all around to keep 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.850
 the cold the place and here is given by 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.400
 example to make salads vinaigrettes 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.230
 to make pate terrines but there 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.030
 some there are some products that 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.770
 they require preparations because there are 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.170
 example warm salads vinaigrettes 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.150
 lukewarm then here what we do is 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.980
 we put the induction plates and here 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.200
 the guys without leaving the area can 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.730
 need to work on parents then 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.870
 we are going to occupy oil 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:21.729
 vegetable oil 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:23.919
 just a little perfect 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.460
 ok once breaded we will leave 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.979
 we're not going to put it in the fire here 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.530
 so that it is cold and 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:37.199
 later we let it cool that 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.199
 it's super crispy and we're going to get 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:46.009
 everything and fast television and I imagine 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:49.169
 that will mount exactly clear not 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.850
 baits work 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.400
 and help 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.980
 Well, all this, this kind of thing 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.940
 what we do can learn 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.720
 regardless of what they want 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.670
 enroll in the institute to be out 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.350
 some role at a professional level or 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.630
 if you are amateurs and you want 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.640
 study the course of a day that 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.890
 they impart Saturdays 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.580
 then and for example there are courses 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.230
 only dedicated to pastry then 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.000
 this the truth is that it is like 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.370
 open to all expectations 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.180
 social for all 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.180
 age does not matter 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.250
 a point can come here 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.940
 number 10 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.710
 here what we did is very simple is 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.620
 a coulis of red fruits 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.720
 nothing else what we did was liquify to put 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.120
 the red fruits because with a little 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.550
 of water a few drops of lemon 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.310
 what he is going to do is going to be this 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.160
 the salt taste and sugar 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.860
 so much is liquefied we strain it so that it does not 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.130
 be so thick and ready is worth it in 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.200
 this case here we have already what we put 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.910
 to fry but today we are going to assemble a 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.400
 little bit and here what I have is clearly 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.490
 decoration what is a reduction of 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:14.740
 balsamic vinegar nothing more with a little 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:16.840
 sugar roughly 10 minutes 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.000
 but they are watching it so that it does not 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.940
 go to burn because if they are burning is 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.440
 it makes a candy and it is not see the texture 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.440
 we can see this texture here 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.210
 it's like a molasses of that 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.210
 because you have to listen 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.400
 and will use for decoration and I gave 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.120
 hand do not worry here anything else 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.120
 Very simple 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.240
 okay 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.240
 let's put this 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:54.460
 ok let's put here 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.620
 good 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.650
 like I have no deficit at hand but 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.750
 good thing is that this looks for example this 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.430
 it helps you for small things but for 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.110
 there are bigger things the truth is that 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.419
 they are nothing officials to clarify 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.889
 how everything has its use so I like it 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.510
 the kitchen does not give me anything more than pretty 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.330
 decoration so easy that you just did 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.020
 It is very simple and right now that 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.770
 now with this 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.870
 ok here over 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.360
 this is a very simple snack now if 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.699
 they do not want to ride it like that there is no 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.020
 problem 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:35.569
 you can ride it in a little dish 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.259
 so simple let's put some shoots 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:41.599
 and there they were but we had the recipe if 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:43.460
 you want more I invite you to subscribe to the
