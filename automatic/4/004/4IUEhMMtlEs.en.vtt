00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.819
 so hellers dear friends and sincerely 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.460
 welcome to tsum draw video of the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.090
 winning, game that I have indeed started 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.139
 to the topic my best black ops 2 moment and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.210
 yes I have your messages 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.210
 looked at and who wonders why 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.930
 here then a roxy like this if here 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.779
 such a tail through the picture 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.240
 that's just my cat's fooling 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.609
 just at my lap it was almost 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.529
 200 submissions so i was real 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.340
 by properly busy your videos 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.770
 anzugucken 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 There were a lot of sniper feeds involved 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.469
 There were many quad feeds here 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.480
 a lot of quick feeds though 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.579
 maybe that was not exactly what 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 I searched but it was just this 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.719
 moments where I'm going to show you 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.350
 I personally liked where I am 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.140
 said 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 that was just no moment because that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.920
 You do not make it that often and me 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.170
 thought it was really cool and I hope 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 I've got where I also a bit 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.260
 shown fairness and have it 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 that is not a nice drop 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.739
 always just something so objectively too 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.739
 judge or what do you say to that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.409
 make it into the camera for the year 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.150
 do 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.650
 sometimes well, then honestly 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.470
 not long around the bush 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.680
 talked around but we solve the same 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:32.850
 times place call out so on the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 place number 5, there is the budget luca with 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.009
 the short cut bsg at the end 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.950
 He has me a crate fur clip 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.899
 sent in and I thought I did 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.369
 sent a few boxes fanclubs 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.710
 get but it was I found halt 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.600
 somehow the best he plays 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.090
 here on the map yemen and call his 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 Kerpen write down the core business 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.149
 and flies completely over the whole map 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.280
 about it 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.689
 and I have a few boxes box 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.119
 seen must be pimped and then 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.310
 Immediately out there but the thing is 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.909
 simply mega far belongs to you 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.680
 fifth place a lot of fun with it 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.710
 so people then we come right to 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:18.890
 place number row 44 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:23.820
 otherwise 234 should be the fourth place goes 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:28.140
 gamer hdd with your super great jump 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.840
 I also did not care about the train 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.730
 because it is against him like me in that 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.760
 has seen around the lens and clip 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.590
 action brings in and gets it 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.420
 I think I found the right ball in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.630
 green black ops 2 moment for that 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.130
 me number four 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:50.700
 so then come to the place 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:53.190
 number 31 33 with types a plasma row 3 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.860
 It was not extremely difficult because of me 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.300
 since two clubs had hard and I could 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.970
 me really between the two clubs 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.880
 Although that is not decide a clip 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.100
 a big club and the other one is 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.460
 orbital clip where the term of a 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.340
 my harder to reach is 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.770
 I downgraded the orbital one 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.980
 and that's why number three comes on place 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.160
 a video from xdd gaming secure at two 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.470
 gave us an orbital of satellites 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.320
 submitted he runs up to the athens 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.500
 how to weld c4 then picks up the same 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.570
 kill in the quad and got the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.970
 flag which I find really cool he was 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.090
 does not play objective and opponents and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.400
 gets his dilemma horny thing place 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.170
 three for you my friend right 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.480
 really well done so I have to 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.160
 at the time say say goodbye then come 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.520
 Of course, right to square numero 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.550
 two and thus the second place that 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.220
 so to speak shortly missed the podium but 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.440
 a really hot moment also to you 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.890
 you rocked right and have is 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.690
 that the asat per the asat pro too 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.760
 why you're so well-known to me does not matter 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.250
 whatever that means 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.120
 hopefully not something 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.320
 right-radical or something and in 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.560
 drive Germany 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.390
 no he plays hijack on the map 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.740
 Of course, how long that was for me 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.840
 also very important in the clips as 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.970
 to show the people a bit objective 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.980
 show that I'm not only lucky 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.840
 what you paint in kochi traismauer sniper 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.550
 but also play objectively 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.039
 brought the flag b 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.690
 and then several opponents away and is 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.699
 then within really few 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.159
 seconds ago I started there 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:36.030
 really cool and therefore place number 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:38.729
 o2 for you so dear friends and then 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.330
 we are already at number 1 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.479
 reached 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:50.250
 roxy what do you say to the number one place ? 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:56.009
 if you have what you have to say to 1 hab 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:58.319
 this is number one and that 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.960
 all place goes to ex university woman 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.840
 and indeed he shows us in search and 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.930
 destroy an awesome thing 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.629
 he attaches a c4 to the arriving train 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.009
 sin the c4 bam and bring him looking and 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.150
 destroy the last kick 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.690
 I hope for you boy was the thing 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.530
 so wanted 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.000
 it was not a clerk clip i hope 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.469
 it for you if the set club 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.530
 the boy then it's your turn 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.150
 Although, but the thing is right 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.830
 cool and of course was still nice 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.569
 here the german bank because of that 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.310
 I'm really green at home 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.710
 hope you liked the draw 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.210
 I'll put it this way 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.759
 people who have won now 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.770
 below in the description and that would have 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.090
 I have to say that they write me 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.340
 just that they won 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.840
 where they want to have the key or 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.370
 what they want to have exactly the 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.469
 profits are clear 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.740
 So the fifth place is medal of honor 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:57.210
 for the pc or for the xbox place 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.150
 Number four was borderlands for the 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.259
 pc version place 3 assassin's creed ipad 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.110
 pc version 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:07.710
 second place was far cry the pc version 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.139
 Place number one is the following either 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.789
 So two according to your choice that you 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:16.050
 choose two games of his choice or 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.129
 take psn or xbox live there we have to 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.659
 then somehow we would actually be 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.469
 maybe there's a janyk sports 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:25.169
 live or any microsoft points 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:27.000
 or psn points do not know if it's there 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.719
 But points are just what you write 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.900
 I want by comment pn what synonymous 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.900
 always
