00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.870
 Columbine today I will tell you about 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.330
 one very short but useful mod 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.469
 which is called track appetites for 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.520
 start take a little something paros show 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:20.160
 how do you each ax that is 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.600
 how effective are they all beginning 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.820
 show in creative then survival 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.439
 By the way this house saw my 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.000
 never succumbed to this first home 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.809
 which got me 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.790
 there is but we are here our music should not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.120
 be a simple house 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.840
 vlady have what came let's same with 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.260
 With fishes our tree is clicked and 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.260
 amazing shorter the whole tree is cut down 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.629
 very cool fast and if you need 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.180
 clear some area here you 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:03.219
 help let me do a little bit 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.780
 trees will show you by the way tree 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.630
 cut off with all the foliage 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.409
 all that was in the leaves also falls 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.170
 let's say 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.640
 seedlings if it is oak trees it 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.729
 apples fall out here let's say here choose 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.920
 No apples fall out right away every time 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.710
 long first join the whole trunk then 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.670
 leaves and so very long one by one 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.910
 just tree 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.960
 click click but this is in creative let's 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.960
 show you survival 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.299
 so wooden ax he chops enough 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.110
 long seconds so 78 but he doesn't care 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.789
 cuts down all the tree it is very comfortable and 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.409
 strength by the way is taken 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.079
 exactly as much as if you were chopping 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.630
 the tree is completely without this year that is 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.310
 if the trunk got out there all the blocks and 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.640
 leaves all blocks ie strength 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.769
 see how much she climbed that is she 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.410
 is going to be equivalent to something okay 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.900
 wooden yard showed you a stone 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.549
 hacks too long enough but already 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.739
 faster we see the barrel collapse 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.760
 ruby deep tooth 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.060
 so all we fought and tree 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.209
 let's finally show you the gold and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.280
 By the way, if you chop a block, then everything is wrong 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.150
 over it that is, let's say if I'm chopping down 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.069
 Now the bottom is well, everything is cut down 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.299
 tree completely and if i tear down 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.959
 let's say 2 below it is cut down all that 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.930
 above 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.930
 and the lower unit it remains like this 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.160
 Well, this mod has already shown itself more 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.750
 there is nothing to talk about i think is coming 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.970
 mod and short but it is very useful 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.440
 especially in the beginning when you are only 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:09.760
 you start to develop quickly you will get 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.790
 tree and it will help a lot 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.020
 I told everyone thanks for watching 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.020
 with you was kalabina bye
