00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.630 
10 films I think this contest is very
important<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.259> lets<00:01:07.470> us<00:01:07.770> once<00:01:08.460> again

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

talk about some positive things about

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.700 
talk about some positive things about
water<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.909> know<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.180> read<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.780> much<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
water you know we read so much about the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
drought and it's so negative its own in
it<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> has<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.400> said<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> mean<00:01:18.030> it's

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it and it has to be said I mean it's

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.630

such<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.510> important<00:01:18.900> topic<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.860> these<00:01:20.190> these

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
such an important topic but these these

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
such an important topic but these these
videos<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.630> giving<00:01:21.870> us<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.380> about

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
videos are giving us a little bit about

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.490 
videos are giving us a little bit about
change<00:01:23.010> what<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.090> happen<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.290> really

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
change what can happen how we can really

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.800 
change what can happen how we can really
do<00:01:26.220> more<00:01:26.430> toward<00:01:26.700> sustainable<00:01:27.270> communities

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
do more toward sustainable communities

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.930 
do more toward sustainable communities
so<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> think<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.680> are<00:01:28.740> great<00:01:29.070> examples<00:01:29.220> for

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
so I think these are great examples for

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.940 
so I think these are great examples for
the<00:01:30.060> citizens<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.960> some<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.830> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the citizens to see some of what the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
the citizens to see some of what the
city<00:01:32.190> is<00:01:32.310> doing<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.909> specifically<00:01:33.750> asked<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
city is doing I specifically asked the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.500 
city is doing I specifically asked the
mayor<00:01:34.500> her<00:01:34.799> opinion<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.520> how<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> residents

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
mayor her opinion on how the residents

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.899 
mayor her opinion on how the residents
of<00:01:36.630> Ventura<00:01:37.049> are<00:01:37.320> doing<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.920> their<00:01:38.369> quest<00:01:38.580> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

of Ventura are doing in their quest to
save<00:01:39.180> water<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.740> citizens

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
save water I think for the citizens

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.130 
save water I think for the citizens
adventure<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.030> important<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
adventure it's important to know that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
percent water conservation our goal is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.899
