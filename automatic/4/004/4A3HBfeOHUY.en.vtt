00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
yeah this is just a lot of me and my

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.800 
yeah this is just a lot of me and my
best<00:02:42.380> friend<00:02:42.470> Taylor<00:02:42.919> Rowe

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.720 

and<00:02:49.810> like<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.170> said<00:02:50.230> before<00:02:50.530> water<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.520> so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
and like I said before water is so so

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.700 
and like I said before water is so so
important<00:02:52.240> so<00:02:52.390> here's<00:02:52.660> me<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:53.260> taking<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
important so here's me just taking a

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.440 
important so here's me just taking a
water<00:02:53.920> right<00:02:54.160> before<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.730> practice<00:02:55.270> some

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
water right before we practice some

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.450 
water right before we practice some
starts<00:02:55.900> which<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.470> right<00:02:56.800> here<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.070> that's<00:02:57.310> why

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
starts which is right here so that's why

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.310 
starts which is right here so that's why
it's<00:02:57.790> only<00:02:57.940> three<00:02:58.360> strokes<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.900> then<00:02:59.110> we

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
it's only three strokes and then we

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:11.650 
it's only three strokes and then we
glide

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.210 

and<00:03:12.660> if<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.140> didn't<00:03:13.440> notice<00:03:13.560> before<00:03:13.770> it

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
and if you didn't notice before it

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.710 
and if you didn't notice before it
doesn't<00:03:14.430> really<00:03:14.640> matter<00:03:14.880> what<00:03:15.210> shoes<00:03:15.510> you

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
doesn't really matter what shoes you

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.510 
doesn't really matter what shoes you
wear<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.140> run<00:03:16.290> practice<00:03:16.530> because<00:03:17.100> you're<00:03:17.370> just

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
wear to run practice because you're just

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.800 
wear to run practice because you're just
going<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.730> wear<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.940> shoes<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.360> are<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.660> your

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
going to wear the shoes that are in your

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.480 
going to wear the shoes that are in your
boat<00:03:18.990> anyway<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.560> if<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.770> row<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.190> know<00:03:20.370> what

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
boat anyway and if you row you know what

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.230 
boat anyway and if you row you know what
I'm<00:03:20.550> talking<00:03:20.820> about

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
I'm talking about

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.820 
I'm talking about
so<00:03:21.540> that's<00:03:21.690> why<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.840> wear<00:03:22.140> flip-flops<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:22.770> I

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
so that's why I wear flip-flops but I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.430 
so that's why I wear flip-flops but I
bring<00:03:23.160> socks<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.570> was<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:24.900> us<00:03:25.050> getting
