double-sided<00:01:47.619> head<00:01:47.799> now<00:01:48.220> I<00:01:52.289> didn't<00:01:53.289> see<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
double-sided head now I didn't see the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.570 
double-sided head now I didn't see the
point<00:01:53.649> in<00:01:53.860> putting<00:01:53.979> eyes<00:01:54.789> on<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.420> cuz<00:01:59.580> it'll

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
point in putting eyes on that cuz it'll

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.380 
point in putting eyes on that cuz it'll
just<00:02:00.819> look<00:02:00.970> stupid<00:02:01.539> and<00:02:01.720> mask<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:04.240> that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
just look stupid and mask with that

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.160 
just look stupid and mask with that
white<00:02:04.840> headband<00:02:05.380> thing<00:02:06.990> anyway<00:02:07.990> that's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
white headband thing anyway that's

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:21.410 
white headband thing anyway that's
Batman<00:02:11.549> and<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.870> next<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:19.440> Robin

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
Batman and the next one I have is Robin

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.740 
Batman and the next one I have is Robin
so<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.599> custom<00:02:23.049> Robin<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:24.390> never<00:02:25.390> got<00:02:25.570> this

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
so it's a custom Robin I never got this

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.960 
so it's a custom Robin I never got this
said<00:02:26.049> I<00:02:26.290> had<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.160> chance<00:02:27.489> but<00:02:29.579> at<00:02:30.579> the<00:02:30.730> time<00:02:30.940> I

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
said I had a chance but at the time I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:40.009 
said I had a chance but at the time I
wasn't<00:02:31.359> very<00:02:31.480> into<00:02:31.959> it

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.500 

so<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.349> think<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.519> is<00:02:42.579> better<00:02:43.090> than<00:02:43.269> the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
so I think this is better than the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.630 
so I think this is better than the
official<00:02:44.170> Robin<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:44.920> more<00:02:45.129> accurate<00:02:45.310> to

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
official Robin it's more accurate to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.179 
official Robin it's more accurate to
comics<00:02:48.629> so<00:02:49.629> he's<00:02:49.840> got<00:02:49.989> black<00:02:50.230> boots<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.769> green

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
comics so he's got black boots on green

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:59.929 
comics so he's got black boots on green
pants<00:02:53.040> short<00:02:54.040> green<00:02:54.370> sleeves<00:02:56.970> black<00:02:57.970> gloves

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
pants short green sleeves black gloves

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.339 
pants short green sleeves black gloves
one<00:03:00.939> side<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.269> his<00:03:01.359> cape<00:03:01.569> is<00:03:01.599> black<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.230> other

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
one side of his cape is black the other

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.929 
one side of his cape is black the other
the<00:03:02.859> other<00:03:02.950> side<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.430> yellow<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.939> think

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
the other side is yellow and I think

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.069 
the other side is yellow and I think
it's<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.120> pretty<00:03:07.359> good<00:03:08.159> representation<00:03:09.159> it<00:03:09.730> was

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
it's a pretty good representation it was

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:17.490 
it's a pretty good representation it was
rollin<00:03:11.079> oh<00:03:15.659> if<00:03:16.659> you<00:03:16.870> look<00:03:17.049> there<00:03:17.230> there's

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
rollin oh if you look there there's

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.409 
rollin oh if you look there there's
those<00:03:17.680> little<00:03:18.150> lines<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.780> his<00:03:20.409> sleeve<00:03:23.939> and<00:03:24.939> now

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
those little lines on his sleeve and now

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:35.309 
those little lines on his sleeve and now
we<00:03:25.480> have<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:27.879> face

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.339 

and<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.069> think<00:03:36.159> that<00:03:36.370> looks<00:03:36.579> pretty<00:03:36.760> good<00:03:37.299> I

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
and I think that looks pretty good I

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.619 
and I think that looks pretty good I
used<00:03:38.349> a<00:03:38.530> gold<00:03:39.420> stuffed<00:03:40.420> because<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:43.209> minifigs

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
used a gold stuffed because the minifigs

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.660 
used a gold stuffed because the minifigs
can't<00:03:43.959> hold<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:45.310> actual<00:03:45.489> coins<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.890> he<00:03:48.099> has<00:03:48.310> a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
can't hold the actual coins and he has a

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.960 
can't hold the actual coins and he has a
magnum<00:03:49.450> revolver<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.459> really<00:03:54.760> think<00:03:54.939> that

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
magnum revolver so I really think that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.599 
magnum revolver so I really think that
looks<00:03:55.319> like<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.349> bad<00:03:56.680> face<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.430> me<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:58.150> just<00:03:58.180> does

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:08.759 

and<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:04.540> suits<00:04:04.840> from<00:04:07.319> from<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.560> Harry

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
and that suits from from the Harry

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:18.300 
and that suits from from the Harry
Osborne<00:04:09.340> from<00:04:10.680> spider-man<00:04:11.680> 2<00:04:16.979> now<00:04:17.979> what<00:04:18.160> we

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
same scarecrow I think this is just a

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.579 
same scarecrow I think this is just a
mine<00:06:46.179> but<00:06:46.449> if<00:06:46.569> you<00:06:46.719> look<00:06:46.869> close<00:06:47.169> you<00:06:47.199> can<00:06:47.439> see

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
side of the head I think that was just a

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.989 
side of the head I think that was just a
scratch<00:06:54.129> I<00:06:54.449> made<00:06:55.449> on<00:06:55.599> it<00:06:55.749> by<00:06:56.379> accident<00:06:56.879> he<00:06:57.879> also
