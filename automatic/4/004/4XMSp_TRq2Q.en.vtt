and<00:01:39.959> moved<00:01:40.959> to<00:01:41.170> Berlin<00:01:41.500> in<00:01:42.009> recent<00:01:42.789> years<00:01:42.849> a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
and moved to Berlin in recent years a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.800 
and moved to Berlin in recent years a
very<00:01:44.020> few<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.800> I<00:01:45.220> collector<00:01:45.670> sweetie<00:01:45.910> which

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
very few and I collector sweetie which

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.510 
very few and I collector sweetie which
has<00:01:46.989> been<00:01:47.170> living<00:01:47.470> in<00:01:47.560> Berlin<00:01:47.860> for<00:01:48.130> four

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
has been living in Berlin for four

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.089 
has been living in Berlin for four
decades<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:49.209> think<00:01:49.989> here<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.380> was<00:01:50.530> always<00:01:50.709> good

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
decades I think here it was always good

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.430 
decades I think here it was always good
because<00:01:51.280> there<00:01:52.119> wasn't<00:01:52.300> that<00:01:52.629> big<00:01:52.869> base<00:01:53.410> of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
because there wasn't that big base of

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.609 
because there wasn't that big base of
collectors<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.479> there<00:01:55.720> still<00:01:55.869> isn't<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.590> a

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
collectors and there still isn't that a

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.949 
collectors and there still isn't that a
shows<00:01:57.160> could<00:01:57.459> go<00:01:57.610> up<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:57.910> come<00:01:58.090> down<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.720> and

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
shows could go up and come down and and

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.869 
shows could go up and come down and and
it<00:01:59.140> could<00:01:59.319> still<00:01:59.530> be<00:01:59.590> interesting<00:02:00.310> shows<00:02:00.610> and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:00.879 
it could still be interesting shows and

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:03.990 
it could still be interesting shows and
it<00:02:00.940> wasn't<00:02:01.330> all<00:02:01.539> about<00:02:02.009> who<00:02:03.009> was<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.429> next<00:02:03.580> big

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
it wasn't all about who was the next big

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.320 
it wasn't all about who was the next big
art<00:02:04.569> style<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.319> was<00:02:05.530> just<00:02:05.830> about<00:02:06.330> hopefully

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
art style it was just about hopefully

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.960 
art style it was just about hopefully
good<00:02:07.569> ideas<00:02:08.020> in<00:02:08.259> odd<00:02:08.500> places<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:09.489> were<00:02:09.729> or
