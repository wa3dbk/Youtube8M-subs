easily<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.790> i<00:01:41.880> doubt<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.380> was<00:01:43.560> by<00:01:43.890> Cesar

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
easily and i doubt that it was by Cesar

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.609 
easily and i doubt that it was by Cesar
Kham<00:01:44.610> any<00:01:44.880> type<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> way<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.500> just

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
Kham any type of way because it just

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.370 
Kham any type of way because it just
seemed<00:01:46.890> too<00:01:47.280> spontaneous<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.049> do

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
seemed too spontaneous so it has to do

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.859 
seemed too spontaneous so it has to do
with<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.130> figure<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.909> appeared<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.689> him<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
with the figure that appeared to him to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
with the figure that appeared to him to
the<00:01:51.930> chapter<00:01:52.259> who<00:01:52.380> approached<00:01:52.770> law<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the chapter who approached law and I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.749 
the chapter who approached law and I
think<00:01:54.270> he<00:01:54.390> stayed<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.810> law<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.610> have

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
think he stayed to law like you have

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.880 
think he stayed to law like you have
grown<00:01:57.090> over<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.810> years<00:01:57.899> law<00:01:58.409> something

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
grown over the years law something

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.399 
grown over the years law something
around<00:01:59.130> there<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.630> calm<00:02:00.840> anything<00:02:01.200> okay

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
around there and that calm anything okay

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.840 
around there and that calm anything okay

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
it has to be somebody knows a lot of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.870 
it has to be somebody knows a lot of
course<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.649> kind<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.399> person<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
course but it kind of the person the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
course but it kind of the person the
outline<00:02:06.299> kinda<00:02:06.750> reminded<00:02:07.079> me<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.439> go<00:02:07.500> Punk

reviewers<00:02:09.780> thinking<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> same<00:02:10.379> thing

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
reviewers thinking the same thing

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.809 
reviewers thinking the same thing
and<00:02:11.599> only<00:02:12.599> thing<00:02:12.959> if<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.440> Vega<00:02:13.770> punk<00:02:14.130> my

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and only thing if it is Vega punk my

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.370 
and only thing if it is Vega punk my
only<00:02:15.060> thing<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.599> wondering<00:02:15.959> what<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.200> he

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
only thing is is wondering what is he

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.190 
only thing is is wondering what is he
gonna<00:02:16.530> end<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.099> facing<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.150> straw<00:02:18.630> hats<00:02:18.930> now

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
gonna end up facing the straw hats now

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.710 
gonna end up facing the straw hats now
and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.590> think<00:02:20.010> it'd<00:02:20.160> be<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.310> bit<00:02:20.880> too<00:02:21.090> early<00:02:21.150> for

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and I think it'd be a bit too early for

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.780 
and I think it'd be a bit too early for
anybody<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.260> take<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.709> Vega<00:02:22.980> punk<00:02:23.310> right<00:02:23.550> now

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
because I kind of feel like Vega hunk

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.150 
because I kind of feel like Vega hunk
was<00:02:26.430> gonna<00:02:26.610> play<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.150> role<00:02:27.810> later<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.319> maybe<00:02:28.680> you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
was gonna play a role later on maybe you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.740

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.680 
could be Joker my only thing is is that
whatever<00:03:17.010> went<00:03:17.370> on<00:03:17.459> with<00:03:17.670> Joker<00:03:17.940> because<00:03:18.390> I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
whatever went on with Joker because I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.060 
whatever went on with Joker because I
know<00:03:18.900> there<00:03:19.260> are<00:03:19.350> some<00:03:19.470> theories<00:03:19.709> out<00:03:20.010> there

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
know there are some theories out there

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.310 
know there are some theories out there
about<00:03:20.370> Joker<00:03:20.820> possibly<00:03:21.810> have<00:03:21.989> doing

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
about Joker possibly have doing

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.430 
about Joker possibly have doing
something<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.799> laws<00:03:23.190> crew<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.079> if<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.260> is

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
something to laws crew and if that is

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.110 
something to laws crew and if that is
the<00:03:25.620> case<00:03:25.650> then<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.340> kind<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.609> makes<00:03:26.760> me<00:03:26.910> think

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
the case then it kind of makes me think

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.970 
the case then it kind of makes me think
about<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.630> whole<00:03:27.810> thing<00:03:27.870> with<00:03:28.320> them<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.859> know

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
about the whole thing with them you know

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.910 
about the whole thing with them you know
how<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.519> when<00:03:29.970> did<00:03:30.120> they<00:03:30.239> actually<00:03:30.680> like<00:03:31.680> when

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
how I when did they actually like when

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.069 
how I when did they actually like when
it<00:03:32.130> actually<00:03:32.850> did<00:03:33.180> he<00:03:33.269> actually<00:03:33.450> do<00:03:33.840> something

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
it actually did he actually do something

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.470 
it actually did he actually do something
to<00:03:34.290> his<00:03:34.440> crew<00:03:34.709> because<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.430> seemed<00:03:36.030> like<00:03:36.239> he

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
to his crew because it seemed like he

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.420 
to his crew because it seemed like he
hadn't<00:03:36.840> seen<00:03:37.079> law<00:03:37.380> in<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.829> very<00:03:38.100> long<00:03:38.370> time

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
hadn't seen law in a very long time

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.250 
hadn't seen law in a very long time
since<00:03:39.000> he's<00:03:39.209> talking<00:03:39.570> about<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:40.019> know<00:03:40.109> it's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
since he's talking about you know it's

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.039 
since he's talking about you know it's
been<00:03:40.470> years<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.100> you've<00:03:41.190> grown<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.489> lot<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.600> I

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
been years and you've grown a lot so I

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.660 
been years and you've grown a lot so I
don't<00:03:43.470> know<00:03:43.590> if<00:03:43.739> it's<00:03:43.890> really<00:03:44.190> Joker<00:03:44.489> cuz

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
don't know if it's really Joker cuz

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.150 
don't know if it's really Joker cuz
Joker<00:03:44.910> seems<00:03:45.269> like<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.450> fairly<00:03:45.810> recent<00:03:46.440> person

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
Joker seems like a fairly recent person

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.300 
Joker seems like a fairly recent person
but<00:03:47.340> then<00:03:47.489> again<00:03:47.609> we<00:03:47.940> don't<00:03:48.120> really<00:03:48.329> know<00:03:48.630> um

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
but then again we don't really know um

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.310 
but then again we don't really know um
like<00:03:50.310> Joker's<00:03:50.940> but<00:03:51.180> not<00:03:51.540> Joker's<00:03:51.870> backstory

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
like Joker's but not Joker's backstory

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.620 
like Joker's but not Joker's backstory
but<00:03:52.440> laws<00:03:52.650> backstory<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.670> it's<00:03:54.180> kind<00:03:54.359> of<00:03:54.390> hard

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
but laws backstory so it's kind of hard

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.780 
but laws backstory so it's kind of hard
to<00:03:54.660> tell<00:03:54.780> at<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.200> point<00:03:55.319> but<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.190> really<00:03:56.640> do

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
to tell at this point but I really do

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.640 
to tell at this point but I really do
think<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.209> person<00:03:57.450> could<00:03:57.780> be<00:03:57.810> Vega<00:03:58.200> Punk<00:03:58.500> do

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
think this person could be Vega Punk do

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.920 
think this person could be Vega Punk do
the<00:03:58.829> outline<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.329> fact<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.630> he's<00:04:00.780> been

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
the outline and the fact that he's been

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.860 
the outline and the fact that he's been
mentioned<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> few<00:04:01.620> times<00:04:01.680> in<00:04:02.100> this<00:04:02.190> arc<00:04:02.519> um

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
mentioned a few times in this arc um

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.759 
mentioned a few times in this arc um
astro<00:04:03.870> i<00:04:03.959> think<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.200> gonna<00:04:04.319> happen<00:04:04.410> next

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
astro i think is gonna happen next

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.500 
astro i think is gonna happen next
chapter<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.459> gonna<00:04:05.579> be<00:04:05.760> kind<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.180> tough

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
chapter this is gonna be kind of a tough

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.110 
chapter this is gonna be kind of a tough
one<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.840> call<00:04:07.049> mean<00:04:07.920> obviously<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.790> think<00:04:08.819> that

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
one to call mean obviously I think that

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.449 
one to call mean obviously I think that
obviously<00:04:09.410> Luffy's<00:04:10.410> gonna<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:10.739> okay<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.100> maybe

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
obviously Luffy's gonna be okay so maybe

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.789 
obviously Luffy's gonna be okay so maybe
the<00:04:11.670> straw<00:04:11.910> hats<00:04:12.180> will<00:04:12.420> grab<00:04:13.200> Luffy<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.680> get

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
the straw hats will grab Luffy and get

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.590 
the straw hats will grab Luffy and get
out<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:14.040> there<00:04:14.220> I'm<00:04:14.459> also<00:04:14.730> kind<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.150> wondering

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
out of there I'm also kind of wondering

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.909 
out of there I'm also kind of wondering
because<00:04:15.690> we<00:04:15.870> know<00:04:16.049> at<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.320> end<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.650> arc

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
because we know at the end of this arc

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.460 
because we know at the end of this arc
I'm<00:04:17.130> thinking<00:04:17.639> that<00:04:17.760> this<00:04:17.970> big<00:04:18.539> giant<00:04:18.989> slime

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
I'm thinking that this big giant slime

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.839 
I'm thinking that this big giant slime
thing<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.890> probably<00:04:20.099> going<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.519> end<00:04:20.580> up

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
thing is probably going to end up

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.240 
thing is probably going to end up
exploding<00:04:21.239> that's<00:04:21.720> probably<00:04:22.019> gonna<00:04:22.200> be

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
exploding that's probably gonna be

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.950 
exploding that's probably gonna be
a pretty<00:04:23.970> significant<00:04:24.570> thing<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:24.840> that's

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
a pretty significant thing so that's

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.480 
a pretty significant thing so that's
probably<00:04:25.170> how<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.440> straw<00:04:25.770> hats<00:04:26.010> wind<00:04:26.250> up

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
probably how the straw hats wind up

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.370 
probably how the straw hats wind up
having<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.120> escape<00:04:27.450> somehow<00:04:27.720> because<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.110> doubt

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
having to escape somehow because I doubt

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.380 
having to escape somehow because I doubt
they're<00:04:28.980> gonna<00:04:29.070> be<00:04:29.310> able<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.700> withstand<00:04:29.940> an

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
they're gonna be able to withstand an

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.210 
they're gonna be able to withstand an
explosion<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:31.050> great<00:04:31.470> cuz<00:04:31.770> it's<00:04:31.920> probably

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
explosion that great cuz it's probably

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.250 
explosion that great cuz it's probably
he's<00:04:32.340> probably<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.970> see<00:04:33.330> Cesar<00:04:33.630> Conde<00:04:34.080> entities

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
he's probably I see Cesar Conde entities

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.880 
he's probably I see Cesar Conde entities
are<00:04:34.530> setting<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.580> thing<00:04:35.850> off<00:04:36.030> again<00:04:36.390> but<00:04:37.380> who

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
are setting that thing off again but who

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.920 
are setting that thing off again but who
knows<00:04:38.070> at<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.400> point<00:04:38.580> but<00:04:39.060> those<00:04:39.750> are<00:04:39.900> just

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
knows at this point but those are just

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.950 
knows at this point but those are just
my<00:04:40.080> thoughts<00:04:40.200> in<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.680> chapter<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.930> what<00:04:42.930> I

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
my thoughts in the chapter and what I

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.390 
my thoughts in the chapter and what I
think<00:04:43.170> is<00:04:43.260> going<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.440> happen<00:04:43.470> next<00:04:43.800> chapter<00:04:44.250> is

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
think is going to happen next chapter is

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.990 
think is going to happen next chapter is
pretty<00:04:44.700> much<00:04:44.850> hard<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.420> call<00:04:45.600> like<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.900> said<00:04:46.140> and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
pretty much hard to call like I said and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
pretty much hard to call like I said and
