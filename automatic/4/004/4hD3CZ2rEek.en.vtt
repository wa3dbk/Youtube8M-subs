00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.759
 Welcome to the next east equity 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.980
 actually was happy paper mario 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.679
 planned however I could firstly 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 Comic 6 will find two of the ones I found 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.480
 I have known myself in Timbuktu 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.869
 that's why I thought good now come on 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 plan b.com 64 and here too I only have 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.260
 with bending and breaking material for one 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.170
 decent video can find out 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.000
 Anyway, thank you 64 today 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.480
 of games where you look at the most 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.769
 can 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.079
 that can be funny the first he is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 can be found directly in the start menu if 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.469
 you wait a bit then you can 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.079
 just noticed that 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.149
 the whole thing can be pushed 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.850
 about five to six minutes go up 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.500
 the faxes repeat themselves 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.600
 and because i have problems watching the video too 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.239
 fill I show you now five minutes 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 long these faxes no of course not 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.289
 would be silly but I could 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.969
 but I will not do it 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.350
 number two is a lucky me 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.870
 I said that in this game 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.549
 can clap a lot and mine 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.979
 opinion is the most interesting bridge 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.110
 following you must on the edge of the tk 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.360
 dive island and somehow stupid for 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.670
 you then the island then floats 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.159
 a little bit around and eventually you come 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.830
 to a very special room a room 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.299
 but you can see that for example 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.729
 actually can not enter 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.920
 in short you can also room on the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.920
 Kinkel probably his crazy flying machine 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.070
 It's cool to know that this is cool 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.970
 evil room is located under the island 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.100
 short work green 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.790
 the next one is a very well known one 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.470
 It is the alternative conclusion video 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.930
 you just have to play the game at 101 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.140
 play through then you get a kind 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.880
 casting is still better than seeing 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.509
 most castings on tv so 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.250
 is something nice 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.600
 at the second not very much there was already 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.100
 a special room 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.470
 Now I have a really cool one 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.509
 room for you in nato headquarters 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.539
 can you if you all blueprints 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.369
 have submitted go into bonus mode 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.670
 here you can play all possible 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.040
 play just by moving art 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.170
 but press a and b at the same time 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.420
 if we do it right you come in 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.610
 a kind of training room and who are you? 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.440
 there right donkey kong 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.480
 as a kid, I'm right 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.290
 scared I decided 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.580
 to go out but it did not work 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.319
 perfect fabric for a flu pasta 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.770
 I mean, look at the song the charts 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.170
 on 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.680
 somehow scary fast on 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.680
 I get goosebumps 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.709
 here is an easter egg which 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.069
 maybe not even intended 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.680
 was 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.690
 There is one in the first world tropics 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 room with a little time over it 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.250
 floats 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.480
 that sounds familiar to you, I was shut 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.750
 an instant and you can 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.700
 think 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.920
 now you have it clear that could 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.269
 to be pure coincidence but I think so 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.310
 not my turn this is my room 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.750
 completely irrelevant and you would have the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.180
 febro problems somewhere else 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.040
 I can already say that 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.620
 that of rewe on purpose was the last one 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.850
 is located in donkey's tree house 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.620
 there you see the one 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.200
 phonograph of offense from the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.329
 play donkey kong country you see 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.880
 steel beam clear refers to the 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.609
 classic donkey kong and you see 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.070
 Picture of a dolphin of this dolphin 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.890
 a very special easter egg the code 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.590
 name of the gamecube project was great 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.570
 find that suggests that 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.100
 also a bigger donkey kong game for 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.410
 the gamecube was planned 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.079
 well we had to know nintendo 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.280
 forcibly their 49 percent of 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.269
 sell shares to microsoft 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.340
 why do not you just pretend 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.910
 microsoft's 51 percent share 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.200
 acquired 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:57.459
 i just do not understand it microsoft 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.530
 that was it with the video myself 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.299
 Hope you liked it too if I did 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.980
 At the end, I dare to return 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.200
 do not get me wrong I am 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.209
 no one who respects the xbox I hate 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.319
 in general this was the enemy 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.160
 somehow fell in love with the fun 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.350
 video games 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.470
 Anyway, I find that microsoft 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.269
 Well, what did I destroy ? 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.979
 I still wanted to address it again 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.880
 hard to please this video too 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.739
 Feel what that means 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.140
 This concept does not seem to be so 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.000
 will hold long because I do not want any 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.430
 two minutes easter egg proved 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.470
 the equity would go too fast for me 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.360
 Let's see how long the concept is 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.920
 I do not know for sure 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.990
 maybe you can give me a few by pn 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.270
 propose games where you 46 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.850
 and I'll take a look 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.430
 I have in the comments 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.980
 once mario kart read but the spar 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.710
 I look for the facts on so and now 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.900
 the obligatory end has you 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.330
 video if so then would be a 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.290
 Thumbs up cool when one is a thumb 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.690
 attached down 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.980
 at best with his reasoning though 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.440
 We do not save the first dislike 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.510
 Do not get me serious 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.310
 But I am only surprised if you 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.590
 want to see more in my videos who 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.870
 an abo attached so give me one 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.170
 So, what do you know back then? 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.170
 I've talked enough my tongue will 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.170
 purely
