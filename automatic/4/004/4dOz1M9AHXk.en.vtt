00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.979 
hair will be I prefer braids as opposed
to<00:02:26.720> twists<00:02:27.200> because<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.760> allows<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.630> hair<00:02:29.810> to

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
to twists because it allows the hair to

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.979 
to twists because it allows the hair to
be<00:02:30.110> more<00:02:30.380> stressed<00:02:30.850> once<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.030> get<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.600> about

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
be more stressed once you get to about

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.140 
be more stressed once you get to about
three-quarters<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.370> braid<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.940> can

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
three-quarters of the braid you can

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.840 
three-quarters of the braid you can
begin<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.780> twist<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:37.130> don't<00:02:37.400> want<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.700> braid

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
begin to twist you don't want to braid

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.729 
begin to twist you don't want to braid
it<00:02:37.880> all<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.209> way<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.750> ends<00:02:39.170> because<00:02:39.350> this

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
it all the way to the ends because this

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.620 
it all the way to the ends because this
will<00:02:39.950> create<00:02:40.160> knots<00:02:40.549> when<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.120> are<00:02:41.239> taking
