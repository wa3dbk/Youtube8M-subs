the university so heritage language

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.089 
the university so heritage language
speaker<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.879> case<00:02:19.450> where<00:02:19.750> somebody<00:02:20.290> has<00:02:20.470> in

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
speaker is a case where somebody has in

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.199 
speaker is a case where somebody has in
their<00:02:21.700> family<00:02:22.150> background<00:02:22.689> on<00:02:24.030> somebody<00:02:25.030> that

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
their family background on somebody that

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.490 
their family background on somebody that
speaks<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.659> language<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.230> could<00:02:26.379> be<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
speaks a language it could be a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.289 
speaks a language it could be a
grandparent<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.370> could<00:02:27.519> be<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.640> parents<00:02:28.150> and

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
grandparent it could be the parents and

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.080 
grandparent it could be the parents and
so<00:02:29.170> people<00:02:29.590> may<00:02:29.829> have<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:30.099> familiarity<00:02:30.730> with

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
so people may have a familiarity with

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.350 
so people may have a familiarity with
the<00:02:31.209> language<00:02:31.480> from<00:02:31.900> an<00:02:32.019> early<00:02:32.319> age<00:02:32.670> but<00:02:33.670> maybe

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the language from an early age but maybe

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360 
the language from an early age but maybe
let's<00:02:34.959> say<00:02:35.079> a<00:02:35.170> grandparent<00:02:35.860> speaks<00:02:36.099> with<00:02:36.250> you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
let's say a grandparent speaks with you

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.860 
let's say a grandparent speaks with you
in<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.640> language<00:02:36.849> but<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:37.420> never<00:02:37.629> had

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
in that language but you never had

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.710 
in that language but you never had
experience<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.909> reading<00:02:39.909> high<00:02:40.209> level<00:02:40.629> of

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
experience in reading high level of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.929 
experience in reading high level of
literature<00:02:41.290> or<00:02:41.590> writing<00:02:42.250> or<00:02:42.400> something<00:02:42.849> like

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
literature or writing or something like

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.210 
literature or writing or something like
this<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> different<00:02:44.620> case<00:02:44.799> for

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
this this is a different case for

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.979 
this this is a different case for
learning<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.609> language<00:02:46.000> then<00:02:46.299> somebody<00:02:46.810> that

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
learning the language then somebody that

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.839 
learning the language then somebody that
has<00:02:47.140> no<00:02:47.379> familiarity<00:02:48.129> with<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:48.340> language<00:02:48.519> at

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
has no familiarity with the language at

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.599 
has no familiarity with the language at
all<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:50.079> foreign<00:02:50.590> student<00:02:50.799> may<00:02:51.129> be<00:02:51.190> learning

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
all so a foreign student may be learning

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.119 
all so a foreign student may be learning
Kazakh<00:02:52.030> had<00:02:52.209> no<00:02:52.870> experience<00:02:53.260> with<00:02:53.530> any<00:02:53.709> Turkic

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
Kazakh had no experience with any Turkic

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.500 
Kazakh had no experience with any Turkic
language<00:02:54.489> or<00:02:54.670> anything<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
language or anything like that and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.930 
language or anything like that and
that's<00:02:56.079> one<00:02:56.409> type<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.190> student<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.609> teach<00:02:57.819> a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
that's one type of student to teach a

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.520 
that's one type of student to teach a
language<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:58.930> with<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.170> heritage

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
language to but with the heritage

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.649 
language to but with the heritage
speaker<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.310> have<00:03:00.459> some<00:03:00.760> familiarity<00:03:01.209> and

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
speaker you have some familiarity and

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.899 
speaker you have some familiarity and
may<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.319> very<00:03:02.590> good<00:03:02.799> speaking<00:03:03.159> ability<00:03:03.700> for

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
may be very good speaking ability for

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.490 
may be very good speaking ability for
example<00:03:04.299> or<00:03:04.450> very<00:03:04.690> good<00:03:04.870> listening<00:03:05.260> ability

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
example or very good listening ability

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.890 
example or very good listening ability
but<00:03:06.040> maybe<00:03:06.280> not<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:06.700> much<00:03:06.849> writing<00:03:07.150> ability<00:03:07.629> or

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
but maybe not so much writing ability or

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.229 
but maybe not so much writing ability or
it<00:03:08.079> could<00:03:08.829> depend<00:03:09.159> maybe<00:03:09.670> reading<00:03:10.000> and

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
it could depend maybe reading and

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.599 
it could depend maybe reading and
writing<00:03:10.359> is<00:03:10.629> strong<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.680> never<00:03:11.920> spoke<00:03:12.400> it

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
writing is strong but you never spoke it

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.190 
writing is strong but you never spoke it
or<00:03:12.760> something<00:03:13.359> like<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.840> there<00:03:13.989> can<00:03:14.170> be

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
or something like that so there can be

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.449 
or something like that so there can be
different<00:03:14.409> challenges<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.159> language

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
different challenges in language

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.800 
different challenges in language
learning<00:03:15.639> so<00:03:16.209> that's<00:03:16.389> one<00:03:16.599> of<00:03:16.629> the<00:03:16.780> issues

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
learning so that's one of the issues

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.589 
learning so that's one of the issues
that<00:03:17.109> we<00:03:17.410> are<00:03:17.819> working<00:03:18.819> wins<00:03:19.090> because<00:03:19.209> there's

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
that we are working wins because there's

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.280 
that we are working wins because there's
different<00:03:19.930> kinds<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.260> language<00:03:20.650> students
