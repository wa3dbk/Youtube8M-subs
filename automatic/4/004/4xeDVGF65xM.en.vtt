looking for a steady tripod for a

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.730 
looking for a steady tripod for a
tabletop<00:00:08.099> or<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.639> smaller<00:00:09.269> one<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.900> travel<00:00:10.559> and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
tabletop or a smaller one for travel and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.390 
tabletop or a smaller one for travel and
I<00:00:11.429> came<00:00:11.639> across<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.990> I'm<00:00:13.830> pretty

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I came across this one and I'm pretty

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.200 
I came across this one and I'm pretty
happy<00:00:14.790> with<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.619> it<00:00:16.619> folds<00:00:16.890> up<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.730> I'm

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
happy with it it folds up like this I'm

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
happy with it it folds up like this I'm
just<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.539> show<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.810> how<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.050> works<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
just going to show you how it works and

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.250 
just going to show you how it works and
then<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.460> unfolds<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.689> very<00:00:21.960> durable

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
then it unfolds and this is very durable

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.040 
then it unfolds and this is very durable
but<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.490> believe<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:23.970> cast<00:00:24.949> aluminum<00:00:27.050> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
but I believe this is cast aluminum it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.490 
but I believe this is cast aluminum it
feels<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:30.060> very<00:00:30.500> very

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
feels like and it's it's very very

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
feels like and it's it's very very
steady<00:00:32.239> um<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.070> loosen<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.579> part<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
steady um you can loosen this part up to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.940 
steady um you can loosen this part up to
raise<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.530> lower<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.980> neck<00:00:39.800> slides<00:00:40.800> like

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
raise and lower the neck slides like

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.560 
raise and lower the neck slides like
that<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.730> lift<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.300> up

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that and then you can lift that up

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.270 
that and then you can lift that up
making<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.440> taller<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:44.700> some<00:00:45.600> overhead

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
making it taller to get some overhead

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
making it taller to get some overhead
you<00:00:47.280> know<00:00:47.370> some<00:00:47.670> overhead<00:00:48.059> shots<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.600> want

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you know some overhead shots if you want

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.130 
you know some overhead shots if you want
like<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.309> this<00:00:50.309> loosens<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> performs<00:00:51.750> just

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
like that this loosens and performs just

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.479 
like that this loosens and performs just
like<00:00:54.020> normal<00:00:55.020> tripod<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.829> these<00:00:56.640> feet<00:00:57.140> also

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
like normal tripod and these feet also

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.820 
like normal tripod and these feet also
extend<00:00:59.489> like<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:01.730> if<00:01:02.730> needed

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
extend like this if needed

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.020 
extend like this if needed
it<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.949> loosen<00:01:05.489> pull<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.200> tighten<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:08.030> okay

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it is loosen pull out tighten up okay

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.660 
it is loosen pull out tighten up okay
like<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> um<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.010> does<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.549> do

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
like that so um now this does you do

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
like that so um now this does you do
have<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> screw<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.540> directly<00:01:16.080> onto<00:01:16.320> your

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
have to screw this directly onto your

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
have to screw this directly onto your
camera<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.720> pain<00:01:18.960> but

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
camera so that can be kind of a pain but

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.800 
camera so that can be kind of a pain but
besides<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.610> mean<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> stability<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
besides that I mean the stability of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.649 
besides that I mean the stability of
this<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> ground<00:01:23.850> solid<00:01:24.450> it's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
this thing with the ground solid it's

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
this thing with the ground solid it's
not<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> shake<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> heavy-duty

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
not going to shake this is a heavy-duty

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.390 
not going to shake this is a heavy-duty
tripod<00:01:27.049> I'll<00:01:28.049> go<00:01:28.200> ahead<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.680> connect<00:01:29.220> my

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
tripod I'll go ahead and connect my

Nikon d50 200 you could always get a
quick-release<00:01:33.390> plate<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.560> top<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
quick-release plate on the top this

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.140 
quick-release plate on the top this
tripower<00:01:36.270> 2<00:01:36.509> had<00:01:36.829> no<00:01:37.829> problem<00:01:38.490> holding<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
tripower 2 had no problem holding that

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.350 
tripower 2 had no problem holding that
up<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:40.040> now<00:01:41.040> let's<00:01:41.220> put<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.970> there<00:01:42.210> so

you can see

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.589 
you can see
it<00:02:13.540> I'm<00:02:14.319> sure<00:02:14.650> if<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.010> go<00:02:15.520> all<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.790> way<00:02:15.940> with<00:02:16.360> it

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
it I'm sure if I go all the way with it

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.740 
it I'm sure if I go all the way with it
it<00:02:16.870> might<00:02:17.230> lift<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.800> yep<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.060> but

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
it might lift up yep see like that but

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.180 
it might lift up yep see like that but
for<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.050> most<00:02:20.110> part<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:20.709> long<00:02:20.739> as<00:02:20.980> you're<00:02:21.099> not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
for the most part as long as you're not

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.729 
for the most part as long as you're not
doing<00:02:21.430> those<00:02:21.730> tight<00:02:22.120> angles<00:02:22.690> or<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.620> to

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
doing those tight angles or you have to

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.190 
doing those tight angles or you have to
be<00:02:23.920> directly<00:02:24.430> down<00:02:24.730> like<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.300> you're<00:02:26.050> gonna

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
be directly down like that you're gonna

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.120 
be directly down like that you're gonna
be<00:02:26.470> fine

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
be fine
