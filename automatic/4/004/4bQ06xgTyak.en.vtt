00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
I'm gonna go and be set up with the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.110 
I'm gonna go and be set up with the
internal<00:00:03.600> mics<00:00:03.840> but<00:00:04.110> let<00:00:04.319> me<00:00:04.410> turn<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:05.120> low

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
internal mics but let me turn the low

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.459 
internal mics but let me turn the low
cut<00:00:06.450> off<00:00:07.309> now<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.370> got<00:00:08.880> Pierre<00:00:09.210> off<00:00:10.019> we'll<00:00:10.320> turn

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
cut off now we got Pierre off we'll turn

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.400 
cut off now we got Pierre off we'll turn
that<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.740> off<00:00:10.920> I'll<00:00:11.730> exit<00:00:12.269> out<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.509> we'll

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
that to off I'll exit out of that we'll

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.230 
that to off I'll exit out of that we'll
also<00:00:13.530> go<00:00:13.769> down<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> compressor<00:00:14.370> limiter<00:00:14.580> we'll

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
also go down a compressor limiter we'll

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.500 
also go down a compressor limiter we'll
make<00:00:15.420> sure<00:00:15.660> that's<00:00:15.929> off<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:17.730> more<00:00:17.940> thing

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
make sure that's off and one more thing

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.679 
make sure that's off and one more thing
if<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.859> back<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.510> there<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:21.600> that

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
if I was to go back here there was that

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.210 
if I was to go back here there was that
I<00:00:21.750> dismissed<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.260> all<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.680> level<00:00:22.949> let<00:00:23.130> me

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
I dismissed it all that level let me

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.349 
I dismissed it all that level let me
just<00:00:23.400> turn<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.449> off<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:25.080> well<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
just turn that to be off as well and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.230 
just turn that to be off as well and
we'll<00:00:27.359> go<00:00:27.539> back<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.439> main<00:00:28.650> screen<00:00:29.210> okay

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
we'll go back to the main screen okay

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.120 
we'll go back to the main screen okay

we'll<00:02:13.560> probably<00:02:13.800> need<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.340> an<00:02:14.490> mp3<00:02:14.730> file

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
we'll probably need to be an mp3 file

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.870 
we'll probably need to be an mp3 file
you<00:02:15.420> could<00:02:15.540> record<00:02:15.900> directly<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.010> format

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you could record directly to this format

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.750 
you could record directly to this format
and<00:02:18.440> or<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.620> could<00:02:19.770> record<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.190> WAV<00:02:20.400> file<00:02:20.640> and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
and or you could record a WAV file and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.520 
and or you could record a WAV file and
then<00:02:20.850> make<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.240> change<00:02:21.510> later<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.140> in

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
then make that change later on in

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.530 
then make that change later on in
editing<00:02:23.010> your<00:02:23.460> choice<00:02:23.760> between<00:02:24.000> those<00:02:24.360> two

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
editing your choice between those two

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.060 
editing your choice between those two
but<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:24.990> love<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> fact<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> can

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
but I just love the fact that you can

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.790 
but I just love the fact that you can

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.710 
formats we have the mp3 formats going
from<00:02:49.950> several<00:02:50.400> different<00:02:50.520> bit<00:02:50.820> rates<00:02:50.850> from

the very smallest file size which will

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.670 
the very smallest file size which will
obviously<00:02:54.120> give<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.750> least<00:02:54.930> quality<00:02:55.380> all

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
obviously give you the least quality all

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.410 
obviously give you the least quality all
the<00:02:55.950> way<00:02:56.070> up<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.490> believe<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.910> up<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.150> three

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
the way up to I believe is up to three

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.600 
the way up to I believe is up to three
and<00:02:57.540> twenty<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.620> right<00:02:58.830> yes<00:02:59.010> three<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.430> twenty

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610

recommendation on all of this is to just

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.810 
recommendation on all of this is to just
make<00:03:22.320> some<00:03:22.530> test<00:03:22.770> recordings<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.370> old<00:03:23.550> trade

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
make some test recordings the old trade

now if you're fuzzy about what to use

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.910 
now if you're fuzzy about what to use
and<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.300> just<00:03:48.450> have<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.630> big<00:03:48.989> old<00:03:49.200> card<00:03:49.650> so

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
and you just have a big old card so

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.770 
and you just have a big old card so
memory<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.400> really<00:03:50.640> not<00:03:50.820> an<00:03:50.940> issue<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:51.600> I

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
memory is really not an issue then I

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.650 
memory is really not an issue then I
just<00:03:51.959> go<00:03:52.140> with<00:03:52.290> CD<00:03:52.590> quality<00:03:52.820> 44.1<00:03:53.820> case<00:03:54.090> 16-bit

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
just go with CD quality 44.1 case 16-bit

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.979 
just go with CD quality 44.1 case 16-bit
waves<00:03:55.550> so<00:03:56.550> with<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:56.970> being<00:03:57.209> said<00:03:57.330> let's<00:03:57.810> go

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
waves so with that being said let's go

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.449 
waves so with that being said let's go
back<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.440> very<00:03:58.620> first<00:03:58.920> setting<00:03:59.280> here

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
back to the very first setting here

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.600 
back to the very first setting here
which<00:03:59.580> is<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.790> WAV<00:04:00.090> file<00:04:00.620> 44.1<00:04:01.620> K<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.100> 16-bit
