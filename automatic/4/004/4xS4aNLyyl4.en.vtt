on<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.380> switch<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.830> can<00:01:07.210> help<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:08.300> out

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
on the switch that you can help you out

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.200 
on the switch that you can help you out
there<00:01:09.040> so<00:01:10.040> what<00:01:10.220> all<00:01:10.310> I<00:01:10.400> did<00:01:10.550> was<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:10.790> had<00:01:11.030> a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
there so what all I did was I had a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.899 
there so what all I did was I had a
black<00:01:11.480> cable<00:01:12.190> when<00:01:13.190> I<00:01:13.280> attached<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.550> to<00:01:13.700> the

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
black cable when I attached it to the

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.050 
black cable when I attached it to the
ground<00:01:14.060> on<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.330> switch<00:01:15.730> yellow<00:01:16.730> cable

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
ground on the switch yellow cable

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.120 
ground on the switch yellow cable
attached<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.570> power<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.680> switch<00:01:18.950> and

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
attached to the power on the switch and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.370 
attached to the power on the switch and
the<00:01:19.250> right<00:01:19.430> attaches<00:01:20.230> accessory<00:01:21.230> on<00:01:21.320> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
the right attaches accessory on the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.440 
the right attaches accessory on the
switch<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.160> I<00:01:22.190> do<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.400> solder<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.790> on<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.330> this

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
switch so I do a solder that on to this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.980 
switch so I do a solder that on to this
dis<00:01:23.750> switch<00:01:23.930> here<00:01:24.580> then<00:01:26.410> what<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:27.440> did<00:01:27.680> was<00:01:28.520> I

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
dis switch here then what I did was I

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.020 
dis switch here then what I did was I
cold<00:01:29.990> cathodes<00:01:30.350> come<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:30.680> this<00:01:30.800> PCI<00:01:31.550> bracket

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
cold cathodes come with this PCI bracket

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.220 
cold cathodes come with this PCI bracket
switch<00:01:32.210> here<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:33.130> has<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.520> yellow<00:01:35.000> power<00:01:35.360> and

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
switch here that has a yellow power and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.810 
switch here that has a yellow power and
a<00:01:36.290> red<00:01:36.470> accessory<00:01:37.010> I<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:37.850> cut<00:01:38.060> them<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:39.820> solder

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
a red accessory I just cut them I solder

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.980 
a red accessory I just cut them I solder
the<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.390> yellow<00:01:41.780> from<00:01:42.910> this<00:01:43.910> switch<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.900> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
the the yellow from this switch to the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.940 
the the yellow from this switch to the
one<00:01:45.230> to<00:01:45.590> my<00:01:45.770> switch<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:47.660> what<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.290> really<00:01:48.320> is<00:01:48.620> is

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
one to my switch so what it really is is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.900 
one to my switch so what it really is is
it<00:01:49.910> goes<00:01:50.150> at<00:01:50.300> this<00:01:50.420> molex<00:01:50.870> connector<00:01:51.350> here<00:01:51.910> the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
it goes at this molex connector here the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.820 
it goes at this molex connector here the
yellow<00:01:53.470> right<00:01:54.470> follows<00:01:55.460> along<00:01:55.670> yeah<00:01:55.910> i

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
yellow right follows along yeah i

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.270 
yellow right follows along yeah i
soldered<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:57.950> here<00:01:59.320> and<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:00.500> goes<00:02:00.680> up<00:02:00.980> to<00:02:01.190> my

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
soldered it here and this goes up to my

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.500 
soldered it here and this goes up to my
switch<00:02:01.900> so<00:02:02.900> this<00:02:03.050> course<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.440> molex<00:02:04.060> red<00:02:05.060> as

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
switch so this course the molex red as

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.540 
switch so this course the molex red as
well<00:02:06.610> right<00:02:07.610> here<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.000> sorted<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:08.720> right<00:02:09.080> here

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
well right here I sorted this right here

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.229 
well right here I sorted this right here
going<00:02:10.550> up<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.759> my<00:02:10.849> switch<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:13.580> also<00:02:13.849> goes

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
going up to my switch this also goes

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.930 
going up to my switch this also goes
this<00:02:14.569> actually<00:02:15.050> goes<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.470> into<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.940> inverter

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
this actually goes it into the inverter

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.280 
this actually goes it into the inverter
box<00:02:18.700> then<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.879> ground<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:21.080> most

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
box then the ground the most

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.450 
box then the ground the most
dissapointing<00:02:22.010> more<00:02:22.100> complicated<00:02:22.550> work

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
dissapointing more complicated work

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.030 
dissapointing more complicated work
this<00:02:24.210> comes<00:02:24.480> from<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.720> molex<00:02:25.440> connector<00:02:25.860> I

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
this comes from the molex connector I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.580 
this comes from the molex connector I
just<00:02:26.760> cut<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.150> half<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:28.140> I'm<00:02:28.260> practically

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
just cut it in half and I'm practically

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.410 
just cut it in half and I'm practically
tapped<00:02:28.920> into<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.310> since<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.090> was<00:02:30.270> also

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
tapped into it since this was also

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.050 
tapped into it since this was also
connected<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.230> inverter<00:02:31.530> box<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:32.850> just

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
connected to the inverter box so I just

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.930 
connected to the inverter box so I just
cut<00:02:33.360> cut<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:34.200> half<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.220> added<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.730> water

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
cut cut in half and I added this water

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.030 
cut cut in half and I added this water
to<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.470> really<00:02:37.620> it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
to it and that's really it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.070 
to it and that's really it
that<00:02:38.490> means<00:02:38.640> really<00:02:38.880> simple<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:39.840> any

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
that means really simple if you have any

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.040 
that means really simple if you have any
questions<00:02:40.440> other<00:02:40.650> than<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:42.060> send<00:02:42.930> me<00:02:43.020> a
