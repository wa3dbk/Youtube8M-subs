years ago I started in 2009 to 2000-2001
and<00:00:34.379> then<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.930> was<00:00:36.930> kind<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.680> around<00:00:37.860> getting

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
and then I was kind of around getting

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.130 
and then I was kind of around getting
the<00:00:38.610> RCC<00:00:38.969> thing<00:00:39.480> started<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.110> is

the RCC thing started which is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.050 
the RCC thing started which is
definitely<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.770> big<00:00:40.920> feeder<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.460> us<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
definitely a big feeder for us now and

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.229 
definitely a big feeder for us now and
that's<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.560> of<00:00:43.910> became<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.090> bit

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that's how I kind of became a little bit

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.139 
that's how I kind of became a little bit
closer<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.540> Scott<00:00:45.810> Johnson<00:00:46.290> and<00:00:47.030> when<00:00:48.030> it

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
closer with Scott Johnson and when it

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.660 
closer with Scott Johnson and when it
came<00:00:48.300> time<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.960> he<00:00:49.230> asked<00:00:49.560> me<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> come<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
came time to be he asked me to come and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.780 
came time to be he asked me to come and
teach<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:51.000> snare<00:00:51.180> line<00:00:51.680> I<00:00:52.680> loved<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> ever

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
