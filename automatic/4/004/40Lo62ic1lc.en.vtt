the big one was only 75 coins right but

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.619 
the big one was only 75 coins right but
it<00:02:07.110> was<00:02:07.200> third<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.009> these<00:02:08.129> are<00:02:08.310> 150<00:02:09.209> that's

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
it was third so but these are 150 that's

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.290 
it was third so but these are 150 that's
really<00:02:10.020> about<00:02:10.080> paki<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.709> yet<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:12.000> was<00:02:12.120> thirty

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
