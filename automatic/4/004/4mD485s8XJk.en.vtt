00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.450
 well hi everyone dear boys 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.049
 welcome back in the company of war 86 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.260
 today we are going to make this video 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.270
 a little always with the recam was seen that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.859
 you said the audio a bit low now 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.000
 I want to try this with the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:29.760
 microphone here placed on the video pina 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.989
 concentrated on the galaxy s 6 after now 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.180
 having tried it for about ten days in 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.000
 these decisions could be noted 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 different things about this samsung galaxy s 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.379
 if later also having seen the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.059
 full videorecensione as you can 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.700
 find both on the site of those who 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.800
 call point it where you find all the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.010
 various benchmarks found all that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.540
 in short, this was being 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.280
 along with the galaxy s 6 ex 6 I have to say 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.230
 I confirm what I said inside 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.040
 of the videorecensione or the best 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.380
 samsung galaxy s samsung ever 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 because the materials really are 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.550
 defining beautiful touches too 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.740
 after maybe the first appeal 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.440
 you know when you buy smartphones yes 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.340
 always tends to say how beautiful it is because 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.800
 the touch id has clearly arrived now 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.960
 after having it anyway it is set to the best 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.020
 now it is becoming very fluid it is 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.970
 becoming constant and this is not a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.390
 plus recently 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.369
 the main problem i 'm having on 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.040
 this smartphone is still autonomy 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.100
 the battery is not really performing with 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.530
 a qhd display is one of the points that most 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.440
 makes you turn up your nose if you use this 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.930
 smartphone is very aggressive 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.360
 they ca n't get past the 20 of 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 evening but it happened in these ten 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.560
 abundant days and this is one thing 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.780
 which sometimes can be annoying if not 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.550
 we have the possibility to recharge the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.159
 our smartphone 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.519
 I found some overheating 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.649
 when the network does not take or when 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.450
 we always go roaming or searching 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.640
 of a better signal 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.030
 the phone tends to heat up in this 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.220
 part here in games absolutely 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.870
 the conversations are not very hot 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.390
 good then what I said in the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 video review is taken in full 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.260
 in this little in-depth video 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.709
 this little chat I have with 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.870
 you 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.690
 many have asked me if it really is 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.030
 deserves the purchase this s6 deserves 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.430
 absolutely to be try of 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.860
 be seen to be touched with hand 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.720
 because this is what was lacking for 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.049
 other samson wills stick us 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.410
 What is important is that it is confirmed 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.560
 between now and now in this s6 the fingerprints 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.330
 I also show how later maybe 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.920
 maybe the eye 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.959
 a little special treatment that is 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.140
 been installed within this 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.330
 glass 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.250
 honestly, right now I don't do anymore 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.580
 case to fingerprints and seem to me less 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.490
 compared to when it was so open 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.340
 from the packaging then also the post of 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.740
 in short, it was absolutely 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.090
 promoted touch wiz interface is 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.910
 always the one we know 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.500
 the interface that actually moves 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.300
 all very fluid here I have not 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.610
 encountered setbacks that maybe 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.000
 on other smartphones you could see 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.459
 the opening could also be seen 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.800
 camera is always ready to fly 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.110
 this non plus is very fluid 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.000
 short in short, a smartphone that 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.209
 according to me at the prices I've seen 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.750
 lately also within the various ones 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.550
 580 sites guarantee Italy absolutely 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.260
 a smartphone to buy 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.760
 I await your comments internally 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.070
 we talk together again 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.530
 on these considerations after ten 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.450
 days use of samsung galaxy s 6 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.310
 I wait as always inside the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.239
 youtube channel and within the various 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.220
 social network 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.350
 for today it's all for the kids there 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.120
 we always hear in the next videos a 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.120
 war salute 86
