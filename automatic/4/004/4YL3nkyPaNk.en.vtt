00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.129
 yesterday 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.809
 R101 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.199
 we are in front of the construction site of matese 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.919
 21st century art museum 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.579
 designed the Sardinian stura valley definitely dedicated to Rome 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.929
 extremely innovative 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.089
 itself a work of art 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.089
 let's see it 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.100
 in the flaminio district a few hundred meters from the auditorium there is a 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.170
 conversion of the former Montorio barracks into the fire brigade 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.140
 the national museum of arts of the twenty-first century 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630
 t max it 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.160
 clear in the acronym the allusion not without pride and its dimensions that 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.500
 they are articulated on various three tariffs 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.720
 to the financial commitment of around 80 million euros and to the complexity 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.640
 organization of the construction site with the experimentation of construction systems 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 innovative 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.430
 the history of the marsi begins in the summer of 1998 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.880
 period in which it was founded in the renewed interest of Italian culture for the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.260
 contentment 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.640
 it is decided to announce an international competition of ideas in two phases for 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.970
 the realization of an articulated photo music 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.040
 the winner is the Iraqi angel architect Zara goodbye 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.010
 together with patrik schumacher 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.070
 the creativity of the architectural solution but above all for the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.070
 ability to integrate into the urban fabric 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.440
 drawing from the context orientation of physiognomy 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.250
 this center because contemporary arts presents itself as an urban investment 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.470
 far from posing as a fracture it resumes its height from the pre-existing ones 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.770
 barracks reconnects via guido kidneys with via masaccio itlia politicians and from here with 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.950
 piazza mancini through an external pedestrian path under the volumes 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.370
 construction silver 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.510
 the same thing beta cables describes his project in the drafting of non competition 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.639
 much like a signed object 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.340
 ubuntu as a world in which to dive 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.230
 and let yourself be drifted through ever-changing paths 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.489
 the architecture between the arts is the la 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.209
 because it is always more connected 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.989
 to format function report 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.409
 cover contents form making prevail by deliriously form the function 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.349
 relations with the context relations with man fundamental elements for the 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.689
 contemporary literature 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:43.889
 inter of the fish 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.559
 in its most extreme trends 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.899
 to become a work of art itself 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:52.309
 to make the form prevail with the function 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:53.509
 this building 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.299
 alano cheese production 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.339
 as well as enslaving the building with the context 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:59.699
 so neighborhood 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.209
 the coolest resistance of the oldest 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.209
 barracks of Titian avenue 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.830
 through an entrance in the heart of the island 8 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.210
 it is accessed once at full height and from here to the two museums maxxi art and maxi 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.199
 architecture 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:22.629
 and again in the reception services at the coffee shop at the bookshop via the spaces 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.629
 for temporary exhibitions for graphics and photography 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.589
 rejecting the white neutrality of so many twentieth-century museums 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:35.109
 the designer aspires to approach the polyvalent density of the 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.529
 twenty-first century 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:41.090
 proposing a critical comparison through a flexible and porous organism 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.579
 between architecture and contemporary social and aesthetic categories 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.479
 from the wall it was eaten from a simple support for paintings. 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.880
 I hope to be a versatile engine for staging the set up 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.779
 artistic 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.680
 does not turn into movement 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.240
 twist the ceiling oh empty to accommodate a large window for 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.680
 watch out unstoppable architectural fluid vinum 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.670
 a series of retractable partitions 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.959
 they can drop where required by the ribs on the roof 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:17.569
 it is these last ones that highlight the articulated vintage line 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.569
 with parallel walls 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.199
 and moreover a high-tech cover that of the mar sing that 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.129
 integrates elements of doors and windows 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.639
 artificial lighting devices 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.759
 mechanisms for containing heat from solar radiation and electricity 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.120
 external metallic for control of natural lighting passable as 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.110
 pass for non-Trentino purposes 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.200
 if the glass stands out on the roof 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.320
 it is however made of self-compacting cement but leaves the types of trani 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.810
 fiber-reinforced 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.569
 apples read mind cover 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.339
 the real protagonist of this work punctuated in the links 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.680
 from steel 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.419
 in March 2003 the first stone was laid 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.020
 and although completion is expected only for one night 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.529
 2000 dew in some buildings of the former barracks kit 180 maintained cardigan 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.979
 a fervent cultural activity has started, bringing the acquisition of works 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.939
 art architecture by means of exhibition competitions trains 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.180
 coin dynamism of the routes 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.669
 It is only designed by these numerous choices that Trenitalia light enters from 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:25.460
 door 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.789
 to indicate exhibition routes 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.789
 the connection between interior spaces and outdoor spaces 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:35.359
 this dude a modern architecture and feel bad at the same time 

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:39.830
 looking at her penetrating her intimate inspiration feeling anxiety 

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:42.829
 being at the same time assica air romania
