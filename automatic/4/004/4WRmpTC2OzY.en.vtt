tweaks here and there here and there we

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.130 
tweaks here and there here and there we
had<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.270> then<00:02:38.360> when<00:02:38.510> we<00:02:38.600> eventually<00:02:38.720> had

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
had and then when we eventually had

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.840 
had and then when we eventually had
something<00:02:39.650> he<00:02:40.010> actually<00:02:40.310> came<00:02:40.490> out<00:02:40.640> there

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
something he actually came out there

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.490 
something he actually came out there
because<00:02:40.970> it's<00:02:41.240> seared<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> surface<00:02:42.200> with<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
because it's seared the surface with a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.280 
because it's seared the surface with a
with<00:02:42.980> an<00:02:43.070> oil<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:44.300> then<00:02:44.540> gone<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> oven

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
with an oil and then gone in the oven

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.010 
with an oil and then gone in the oven
immediately<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.360> Rises<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.540> gets<00:02:47.720> really

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
immediately and Rises it gets really

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.780 
immediately and Rises it gets really
light<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.500> fluffy<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.070> it's<00:02:49.640> actually

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
light and fluffy so it's actually

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.060 
light and fluffy so it's actually
getting<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.930> benefit<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.260> baking<00:02:51.740> in<00:02:51.920> their

those

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.280 
those
you<00:04:10.430> know<00:04:10.550> a<00:04:10.760> glaze<00:04:11.540> rather<00:04:11.900> for<00:04:12.080> one<00:04:12.200> of

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
you know a glaze rather for one of

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.550 
you know a glaze rather for one of
American<00:04:12.830> brands<00:04:13.130> it's<00:04:13.250> donut<00:04:13.970> he's<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:15.350> about

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
American brands it's donut he's is about

American brands it's donut he's is about
17<00:04:16.070> grams<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.940> it's<00:04:16.970> less<00:04:17.239> than<00:04:17.390> half<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.630> fact

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
17 grams so it's less than half the fact

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.289 
17 grams so it's less than half the fact
of<00:04:18.260> course<00:04:18.680> when<00:04:18.980> we<00:04:19.010> add<00:04:19.280> chocolate<00:04:19.700> and

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
of course when we add chocolate and

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.330 
of course when we add chocolate and
creams<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.989> things<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.560> goes<00:04:21.890> up<00:04:22.160> but

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
creams and things to it that goes up but

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.680 
creams and things to it that goes up but
it<00:04:22.430> would<00:04:22.550> always<00:04:22.700> be<00:04:22.850> less<00:04:23.180> than<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.450> fried

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
it would always be less than the fried

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.340 
it would always be less than the fried
dough<00:04:23.870> alternative<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.970> then<00:04:26.420> we've<00:04:26.540> got<00:04:26.720> at

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
dough alternative and then we've got at

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.280 
dough alternative and then we've got at

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
we like trying to do that and then try

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.030 
we like trying to do that and then try
to<00:04:50.330> do<00:04:50.450> something<00:04:50.690> extra<00:04:50.930> special<00:04:51.050> with<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.560> so

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
example here if you look it's got we do

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.060 
example here if you look it's got we do
a<00:04:56.570> quoi<00:04:56.780> some<00:04:57.020> dough<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.650> talk<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.890> across

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
a quoi some dough and to talk to across

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.410 
a quoi some dough and to talk to across
and<00:04:58.280> then<00:04:58.370> we<00:04:58.520> layer<00:04:58.670> those<00:04:58.910> up<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.240> look<00:04:59.390> like

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
and then we layer those up to look like

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.120
