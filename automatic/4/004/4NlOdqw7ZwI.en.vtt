00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
today I'm going to show you guys how to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.090 
today I'm going to show you guys how to
instantly<00:00:18.060> activate<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.500> fast<00:00:19.800> twitch

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
instantly activate the fast twitch

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.420

blazing speed I'm going to teach you
right<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:25.890> three<00:00:26.340> variations<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.210> are

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
right now three variations that are

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.150 
right now three variations that are
really<00:00:27.570> gonna<00:00:27.660> help<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.109> develop<00:00:28.470> that's

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
really gonna help you develop that's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.970 
really gonna help you develop that's
starting<00:00:29.880> strength<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:31.199> ability<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> turn

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
starting strength that ability to turn

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.240 
starting strength that ability to turn
on<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.279> many<00:00:33.020> fast<00:00:34.020> twitch<00:00:34.320> muscle<00:00:34.770> fibers<00:00:35.130> as

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
on as many fast twitch muscle fibers as

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.150 
on as many fast twitch muscle fibers as
you<00:00:35.370> possibly<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.239> now<00:00:36.950> you're<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you possibly can now you're going to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.250 
you possibly can now you're going to
only<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:39.030> ten<00:00:39.270> seconds<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.170> gonna

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
only go for ten seconds but you're gonna

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.740 
only go for ten seconds but you're gonna
go<00:00:40.440> with<00:00:40.620> extremely<00:00:41.190> high<00:00:41.340> intensity<00:00:42.180> now<00:00:42.629> I'm

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
go with extremely high intensity now I'm

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
go with extremely high intensity now I'm
just<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:42.960> demonstrate<00:00:43.320> right<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:44.010> what

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
just gonna demonstrate right now what

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
just gonna demonstrate right now what
you<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.520> me<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.660> sure<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.960> you're

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you have me but make sure that you're

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.389 
you have me but make sure that you're
doing<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:47.120> with<00:00:48.120> most<00:00:48.920> intensity<00:00:49.920> because

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
doing this with most intensity because

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.630 
doing this with most intensity because
it's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> short<00:00:50.820> variation<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:52.430> that's<00:00:53.430> we

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it's a short variation now that's we

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
it's a short variation now that's we
have<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:54.000> doing<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.480> really<00:00:54.629> activate<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
have to be doing to really activate and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.279 
have to be doing to really activate and
develop<00:00:56.190> those<00:00:56.340> fast<00:00:56.640> twitch<00:00:56.879> muscle<00:00:57.300> short

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
develop those fast twitch muscle short

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.099 
develop those fast twitch muscle short
bursts<00:00:58.829> now<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.329> may<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.510> familiar<00:01:00.840> with

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
bursts now you may be familiar with

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
bursts now you may be familiar with
speed<00:01:01.440> training<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:03.149> type<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> beat

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
speed training and the type of beat

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
speed training and the type of beat
training<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.229> I've<00:01:04.350> seen<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.830> athletes<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
training that I've seen is athletes a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.060 
training that I've seen is athletes a
gas<00:01:05.820> back<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> forth<00:01:06.930> straining<00:01:07.560> screenings

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
gas back and forth straining screenings

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.380 
gas back and forth straining screenings
pretty<00:01:08.340> now<00:01:09.090> that's<00:01:09.810> such<00:01:10.200> an<00:01:10.970> inaccurate<00:01:11.970> way

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
pretty now that's such an inaccurate way

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
pretty now that's such an inaccurate way
to<00:01:12.930> develop<00:01:13.320> speed<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.860> I'm<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> show

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
to develop speed so I'm going to show
