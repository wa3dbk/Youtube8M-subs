00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.660
Wait, Gugu, did you wash your hands?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.400
Hands?

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.820

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.160
I can see that your hands are dirty.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.340
Wash your hands, sweetheart.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.960

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.520
Fly! Fly!

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.660
Woo-- (bonk)

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.000
(crack)

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.060
Ooh-ahh! Oh no!

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.360
It's.... broken,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
What should I do now?

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780
Gugu, what's wrong?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.840
OH!

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.580
Oh no, the flower pot is broken!

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.160
Gugu, did you do it?

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.040
Uh....

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.600
Uh

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.580
Uh...

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.920
No! No! I didn't do it daddy!

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.940
Oh, I wonder who did it then... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.960
Actually, it was Oble! My Oble spaceship did it, daddy!

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.320
Hmm..

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:33.220
Gugu, everyone makes mistakes. When you make mistakes, the best thing you can do is be honest.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.520
Gugu, you shouldn't lie because you are scared to be scolded!

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.640
OH NO!

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.360
(surprise)

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.540
Huh?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560
(woooooooo)

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.040
What's wrong honey?

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.220
Someone ruined our garden!

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.960
Huh?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.900
Huh? OH NO!

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.620
It's so messy!

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.760
Gugu, did you do it?

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.260
Ah?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.900
No! No I didn't do it! I really didn't do it!

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.420
Son, you are not lying again, are you?

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.940
Eyy?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.980
No daddy! I am not lying! I am really not lying!

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.940
Hugh,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.940
Mr. and Mrs. Gugu, Gugu didn't do it. It was me.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.120
OH?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.920
My ball rolled into the yard, so I came in to pick it up.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.060
Sorry, I didn't mean to do it!

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.020
Oh, I see Yaya.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.760
Thanks for being honest.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.260
Hugh? It's okay.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.460
Uhhhhh.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.740
Oh, Gugu, I am sorry for doubting you.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.260
I am so sorry.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.320
I am sorry too, my son.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.420
Hehehe. Gugu feels much better that mommy and daddy trust me!

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.080
Gugu is all happy now! :D

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:16.320
Gugu, if you lie a lot, no one will be able to trust your words. So, if you make any mistakes, please be honest with mom and dad.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.300
No more lying, okay?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.640
Okay, mommy!

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.000
(laughing)

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.880
(wink)

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.900
{ Yay, the song! :D }

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.180
If I lie many times, Noooooooo,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.680
No!

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.700
No one, can trust my words

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.200
Really?

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.280
No more, no more lies, no more lies for me.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.140
I will be an honest boy.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.080
{ Again? Welp, time to REsubtitle }

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.280
If I lie many times, Noooooooooooooo..

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.780
No!

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.200
No one, can trust my words,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.700
Really?

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.120
No more, no more lies, no more lies for me,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.840
I will be an honest boy

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.420
(twinkling)

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.900
Gugu is now a good boy, who does not lie to his parents.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800
Hahahaha!

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.740
