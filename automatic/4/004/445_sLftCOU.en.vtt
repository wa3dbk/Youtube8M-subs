00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that I need I'll draw the pattern on the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
that I need I'll draw the pattern on the
surface<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.810> tip<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.320> wanted<00:01:43.650> these<00:01:43.770> nails

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
surface of the tip we wanted these nails

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.969 
surface of the tip we wanted these nails
to<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.880> some<00:01:45.150> texture<00:01:45.510> to<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:45.960> not<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.799> be

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
to have some texture to them not just be

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.730 
to have some texture to them not just be
a<00:01:47.010> flat<00:01:47.490> painted<00:01:48.180> nail<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> decided<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.409> take

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
a flat painted nail so I decided to take

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.480 
a flat painted nail so I decided to take
the<00:01:50.280> design<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:51.170> D<00:01:52.170> boss<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.860> other<00:01:53.250> words

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the design and D boss it in other words

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.210 
the design and D boss it in other words
carve<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.000> into<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.720> tip<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.890> still

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
carve it into the tip so that we still

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.469 
carve it into the tip so that we still
had<00:01:56.400> our<00:01:56.430> texture<00:01:56.970> we<00:01:57.090> still<00:01:57.330> had<00:01:57.450> our

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
had our texture we still had our

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.210 
had our texture we still had our
dimension<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.790> nails<00:02:00.860> overall<00:02:01.860> were

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
dimension but the nails overall were

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.880 
dimension but the nails overall were
smooth<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.939> surface<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.930> after<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.380> drew

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
smooth on the surface so after you drew

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.469 
smooth on the surface so after you drew
in<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> designs<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> pencil<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.090> went<00:02:06.330> in

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
in the designs of the pencil you went in

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.320 
in the designs of the pencil you went in
with<00:02:06.990> an<00:02:07.140> electric<00:02:07.470> file<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.979> carved<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
with an electric file and carved out the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.060 
with an electric file and carved out the
design<00:02:09.600> what<00:02:09.869> kind<00:02:10.049> of<00:02:10.110> bit<00:02:10.350> did<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.679> use<00:02:10.860> for

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
design what kind of bit did you use for

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.430 
design what kind of bit did you use for
that<00:02:11.190> correct<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:12.000> used<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.390> diamond<00:02:12.900> cone

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that correct I just used a diamond cone

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.890 
that correct I just used a diamond cone
bit<00:02:13.739> any<00:02:14.130> tips<00:02:14.489> for<00:02:14.820> other<00:02:15.299> nail<00:02:15.480> techs<00:02:15.720> out

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
bit any tips for other nail techs out

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.530 
bit any tips for other nail techs out
there<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> mean<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.650> those<00:02:17.610> nail<00:02:17.940> tips<00:02:18.239> are<00:02:18.390> very

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
there I mean it those nail tips are very

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.140 
there I mean it those nail tips are very
thin<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:20.190> could<00:02:20.340> probably<00:02:20.519> easily<00:02:20.730> go

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
thin and you could probably easily go

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.300 
thin and you could probably easily go
through<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.900> push<00:02:22.079> too<00:02:22.110> hard

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
through it if you push too hard

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.289 
through it if you push too hard
definitely<00:02:23.310> when<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.459> practice<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
definitely when I practice this the

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.210 
definitely when I practice this the
first<00:02:24.510> time<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.690> went<00:02:24.930> through<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.230> number<00:02:25.980> of

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
first time I went through a number of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.020 
first time I went through a number of
tips<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.150> what<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.110> found<00:02:28.230> was<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:29.069> keeping<00:02:29.400> an

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
tips so what I found was just keeping an

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.970 
tips so what I found was just keeping an
even<00:02:30.300> pressure<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.959> just<00:02:31.380> following<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
even pressure and just following the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.550 
even pressure and just following the
design<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:32.910> taking<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.660> slowly<00:02:34.080> so

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
design and then taking it out slowly so

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.550 
design and then taking it out slowly so
it<00:02:34.590> used<00:02:35.040> acrylic<00:02:35.520> paint<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.630> did<00:02:36.990> by

sealer to seal the paint and create that

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.520 
sealer to seal the paint and create that
high-gloss<00:02:50.760> shine<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.020> painted<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
high-gloss shine so you painted the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.050 
high-gloss shine so you painted the
nails<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:53.160> covered<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.819> gel

pasted the nails to the edge of a file

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.880 
pasted the nails to the edge of a file
is<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.390> for<00:03:18.690> control<00:03:19.050> or<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.709> don't<00:03:19.830> have

is that for control or so you don't have
to<00:03:20.010> touch<00:03:20.160> them<00:03:20.400> all<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.819> did<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> great<00:03:21.450> question

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
to touch them all I did a great question

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.930 
to touch them all I did a great question
i<00:03:21.959> find<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.560> gives<00:03:22.739> me<00:03:22.920> complete<00:03:23.400> design

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
i find that it gives me complete design

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.630 
i find that it gives me complete design
freedom<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.870> gives<00:03:25.110> me<00:03:25.260> an<00:03:25.319> idea<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
freedom and it gives me an idea of the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.340 
freedom and it gives me an idea of the
order<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.360> tips<00:03:27.569> are<00:03:27.720> going<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.050> be<00:03:28.200> in

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
order that the tips are going to be in

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.080 
order that the tips are going to be in
and<00:03:28.590> what<00:03:29.010> they<00:03:29.130> look<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.790> models

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090

paint<00:03:32.790> for<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.269> base<00:03:33.480> design<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:33.959> went<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.320> with

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.530 
paint for the base design I went in with
black<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.130> then<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.610> wanted<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.000> create<00:03:36.209> some

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
so after you painted the inside of the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.720 
so after you painted the inside of the
design<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.709> decide<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.190> add<00:03:47.310> some

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
some rhinestones and beats to the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.630 
some rhinestones and beats to the
overall<00:03:52.140> design<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.130> give<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.340> some<00:03:53.610> more

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
overall design just to give it some more

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.330 
overall design just to give it some more
dimension<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.720> by<00:03:54.900> placing<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.709> rhinestones

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
dimension so by placing the rhinestones

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.849 
dimension so by placing the rhinestones
just<00:03:56.940> inside<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.450> curls<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.290> design<00:03:58.620> and

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
just inside the curls of the design and

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.770 
just inside the curls of the design and
then<00:03:59.280> some<00:03:59.489> beads<00:03:59.670> along<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.150> outside<00:04:00.299> edge

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
then some beads along the outside edge

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.819 
then some beads along the outside edge
gave<00:04:01.769> us<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.130> more<00:04:02.430> three-dimensional<00:04:03.299> feel<00:04:03.829> so

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
gave us a more three-dimensional feel so

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.349 
gave us a more three-dimensional feel so
after<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.190> nails<00:04:05.340> dry<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.940> have<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.150> attach

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
after the nails dry you have to attach

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.380 
after the nails dry you have to attach
them<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.750> models<00:04:07.109> nails<00:04:07.350> i<00:04:07.790> used<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:09.090> gel

them to the models nails i used a gel

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.090 
them to the models nails i used a gel
adhesive<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.049> way<00:04:10.260> would<00:04:10.470> fill<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.829> any

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
adhesive that way would fill in any

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.610 
adhesive that way would fill in any
imperfections<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.269> nail<00:04:12.540> just<00:04:13.230> simply

apply it to the back of the tip in a
small<00:04:16.260> area<00:04:16.289> because<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.890> don't<00:04:17.070> want<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
small area because you don't want the
