00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
numbers left that's how many put in each

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
numbers left that's how many put in each
one<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.659> joke<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.990> water<00:01:13.290> here

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
one I have a little joke of water here

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.530 
one I have a little joke of water here
which<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.460> makes<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.790> easier<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.240> going

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
which just makes it easier and going

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.539 
which just makes it easier and going
back<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.720> forth<00:01:16.080> from<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.500> doesn't<00:01:16.830> sink<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
back and forth from this doesn't sink I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.810 
back and forth from this doesn't sink I
think<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> first<00:01:18.600> thing<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:20.070> little

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
think the first thing we do is a little

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.149 
think the first thing we do is a little
indent<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:22.979> we

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
indent now as you can see I think we

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.609 
indent now as you can see I think we
just<00:01:23.189> filled<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.790> water<00:01:24.320> then<00:01:25.320> we're
