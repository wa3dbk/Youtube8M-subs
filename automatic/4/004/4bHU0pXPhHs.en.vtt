00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.430
 Hi, I'm Hollywood and I'm going to prepare you 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.529
 a delicious and healthy recipe with bread 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
 runner that is the recipe 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.820
 simple mackerel that we will take care of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.800
 a little romescu sauce that in this 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.170
 case is ideal escarole buds 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.029
 maybe some olives and we'll end up with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 a little lemon because I tell you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.469
 healthy because it takes the first 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 mackerel that carries fatty acids that stops 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.219
 the body are great as 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.139
 do not go up runner that takes a lot of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.690
 seeds that also provide us with fats 

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:44.670
 but it is a healthy fats a bread that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.069
 for diets where we want to have a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.569
 high percentage of great protein 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:51.289
 which the contras we will follow few 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:53.579
 carbohydrates works great 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.229
 Well, what are we going to do first, cut 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.839
 our bread our standard is what we can 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.839
 leave in a slice of good bearing 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.410
 how would it be this maybe I'm interested in how 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.850
 make a recipe that will also be fine and 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.250
 can serve us perfectly for a 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.530
 incoming in a nice menu then 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.530
 I want a cut more boy have I go 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.650
 to do cut in half I can cut 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.800
 from here or I can cut 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.690
 from here I'll stay with this one 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.830
 slice with her 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.540
 Well you can use it as is, but in 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.730
 this case I'm interested in having a point 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.070
 crispy and what I've done is that 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.170
 to toast a bit the deceased that here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.320
 I have the recipe for our recipe 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.780
 bread and every day logically to the fishmonger 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.370
 of trust we can ask you first 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.500
 a fresh mackerel of the day that is 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.450
 Tersa that is hard and we can ask 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.670
 I cleaned it and I show you fast fast 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.410
 if you want to cook a little more how 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.650
 it is cleaned a knife is made that cuts 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.470
 and few cuts we cut the head 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.760
 we turn around 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.840
 and another cut in the head 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.840
 we'll start here 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.330
 a cut until you get the part 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.330
 central we will break other thorns 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.330
 and very simple we have left 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.650
 a perfect loin we would retire the other 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.800
 tenderloin and once we have our eyes 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.300
 clean we can remove the thorns there 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.550
 some small tweezers that to remove 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.290
 the thorns are general and we do not 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.140
 we want to complicate both life and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.040
 we want to make it easy we will make a cut in 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.760
 the central part 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.760
 cut 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.610
 cut coming just just right up 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.370
 where is the skin 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.300
 and if you look in the middle we have all 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.360
 the thorns in a single strip 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.750
 that we will take and we will throw clean the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.490
 fish we will go through water 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.100
 it can be a slightly salty water 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.030
 so as not to lose flavor to the sea and once 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.920
 the fish is clean, we will take them out 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.069
 perfect perfect with kitchen paper 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.260
 with absorbent paper 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:09.499
 until the loins are very dry while 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.689
 the fish that I will do with it dries up 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:18.200
 I'll take salt to take the sugar more or less 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:21.840
 40 grams of salt per 100 grams 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.160
 and sugar we mix well 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.500
 and we will have the basic ingredients 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.110
 to cure not only mackerel to cure 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.230
 for example a salmon when we have the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.000
 dry fish and the mixture 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.620
 in a container like this that we have 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.340
 a certain height we will place a bed 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.640
 a background of salt and sugar on top 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.030
 skin down the fish and what 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.030
 we will cover 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.819
 and at this point we will do 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.520
 we will let him heal and to heal with 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.800
 the maximum health guarantee that's why 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.470
 I have this tall container we will take 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.680
 plastic kitchen paper we will have a 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.440
 cap 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.760
 and we take you we can not help cure 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.530
 room temperature but just in case 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.980
 we will bring it to the refrigerator and 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.780
 we will leave 23 hours elapsed that 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.780
 time the salt and sugar that will do 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.579
 salt slightly and extract moisture and 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.530
 cure the fish as we will be 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.420
 well we will get out of the salt and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.480
 we will have 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.760
 these loins that are perfectly 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.820
 cured that we will use the most 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.470
 romescu I have escarole and I have lemon in 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.030
 the romesco sauce I imagine that all 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.320
 you know what our romenesko is 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.000
 a sauce that is easily found 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.110
 supermarkets elaborated if you look 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.900
 very romesco has a more texture 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.310
 homogenous more integrated because because what 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.080
 I took out of the boat I put two droplets 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.400
 of water and has hit him with a 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.400
 kitchen robot with a 'tour' knicks 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.720
 until having this creamier texture 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.610
 prettier as I told you is a 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.190
 recipe that we can elaborate for 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.020
 resign for a light dinner or if 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.820
 we want to make an elegant starter and 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.800
 fun at noon we can also 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.370
 do I am going to postpone it in this format 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.540
 noon I will try to do it a little bit 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.740
 draw a line of bouquets with the plate and 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.289
 I will place 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.960
 the swamp coast 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.879
 we have already begun to place with this 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.279
 recipe the mackerel with this head is 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.990
 can do a lot of elaborations for 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.639
 example if we take a sauce is hopefully 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.439
 textured a little bit we'll make a 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.719
 elaboration that approaches the 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.500
 Japanese but now we will approach the 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:31.340
 mediterranean as we will do it by cutting 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.710
 the mackerel in pieces 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.850
 or we want more romescu sauce is a 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.520
 open recipe 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.699
 we can use the flesh of a 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.220
 eggplant a few tomatoes descalibrados me 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.260
 like because you can do or apply the 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.780
 creativity or the flavors that most 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.400
 like the toasted mackerel romescu and 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.840
 we will finish like here I have a good 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.639
 escarole samorÃ© know that escarole 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.130
 It has to be very crispy like 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.800
 we will take hot water from 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.389
 household tap at 40 45 degrees and 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.810
 we will place the shoots in that water 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:05.210
 hot 34 minutes then in a bowl with 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.700
 very cold water and you will notice that the lettuce 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.590
 It gets hard very crispy that is 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.910
 just what we want when it is already very 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.889
 crunchy 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:17.039
 we will pass it on 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:21.060
 to an absorbent paper to remove the 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:23.759
 water that we do not want to place a 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.110
 balsamic vinegar or in this case is the 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.360
 vinegar cream plus something you can 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.870
 we will find that the supermarket 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.310
 with a little bit of salt because the 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.860
 sauces that I use are already rich in salt 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.130
 romes whose tasty a part of vinegar 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.320
 of three parts of oil I will place as 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.800
 I have told you olives I have a powder 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.800
 black olive 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.540
 and I have kalamata olives that I'm going to 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.530
 cut 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.530
 in the thin sheets 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.500
 I only have to mix this vinaigrette 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.419
 balsamic with a good refined oil in 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.419
 olive oil buds 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.640
 and on top of the toast with two phases 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.050
 for weak lemons of lemon because it is already a 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.940
 recipe with few ingredients that is 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.800
 fine and elegant but apart as our 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.390
 Runner bread is healthy for those 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.030
 that we like to have good habits 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.170
 and not leave aside the things that are 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.170
 rich and give us energy
