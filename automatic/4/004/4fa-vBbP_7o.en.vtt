important now we're going to go ahead

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.979 
important now we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:53.379> start<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.070> countersink<00:00:54.609> drilling<00:00:55.180> we'll

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
and start the countersink drilling we'll

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.869 
and start the countersink drilling we'll
go<00:00:56.140> down<00:00:56.350> a<00:00:56.379> little<00:00:56.620> bit<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.190> we'll<00:00:57.430> check<00:00:57.730> it

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
go down a little bit and we'll check it

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.209 
go down a little bit and we'll check it
by<00:00:58.000> turning<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.539> screw<00:00:58.570> over<00:00:59.410> and<00:00:59.590> putting

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
by turning the screw over and putting

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.889 
by turning the screw over and putting
the<00:01:00.340> head<00:01:00.519> on<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.850> hole<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.300> we<00:01:01.420> just<00:01:01.449> made

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
the head on the hole that we just made

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.500 
the head on the hole that we just made
this<00:01:02.710> hole<00:01:03.160> is<00:01:03.399> still<00:01:03.489> too<00:01:03.789> small<00:01:03.969> so<00:01:04.360> we'll

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
this hole is still too small so we'll

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.890 
this hole is still too small so we'll
open<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.930> up<00:01:05.050> a<00:01:05.170> little<00:01:05.350> bit<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:07.270> if<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:07.540> wanted

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
open it up a little bit now if I wanted

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.560 
open it up a little bit now if I wanted
the<00:01:08.110> screw<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.950> be<00:01:09.070> flush<00:01:09.369> I'd<00:01:09.640> stop<00:01:10.030> but<00:01:10.360> we're

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
the screw to be flush I'd stop but we're

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.480 
the screw to be flush I'd stop but we're
going<00:01:10.689> to<00:01:10.780> fill<00:01:10.990> over<00:01:11.320> this<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:11.830> I'm<00:01:12.310> going<00:01:12.460> to

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
going to fill over this so I'm going to

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.370 
going to fill over this so I'm going to
make<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.850> little<00:01:12.970> larger<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:13.750> it<00:01:13.990> sinks

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
make it a little larger so that it sinks

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.170 
make it a little larger so that it sinks
in<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.770> we've<00:01:14.860> got<00:01:15.070> plenty<00:01:15.250> of<00:01:15.460> space<00:01:15.549> for<00:01:16.090> our

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
in and we've got plenty of space for our

and put it in of course it helps if I
put<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.829> spook<00:01:27.100> on<00:01:27.310> going<00:01:27.610> forward<00:01:27.909> there<00:01:28.420> we

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
put the spook on going forward there we

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
put the spook on going forward there we
go

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

go slow when you get towards the end of
this<00:01:31.869> you<00:01:32.140> don't<00:01:32.290> want<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.650> tear<00:01:33.460> up<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.820> wood

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
this you don't want to tear up the wood

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.240 
this you don't want to tear up the wood
where<00:01:34.329> your<00:01:34.540> screw<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.680> going<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.040> want<00:01:36.130> to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
where your screw is going you want to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.039 
where your screw is going you want to
get<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.399> good<00:01:36.640> hold<00:01:36.939> especially<00:01:37.390> since<00:01:37.899> we're

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
get a good hold especially since we're

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.069 
get a good hold especially since we're
going<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.229> cover<00:01:38.470> over<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.890> it's<00:01:39.579> all<00:01:39.790> ready

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
going to cover over it it's all ready

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.359 
going to cover over it it's all ready
now<00:01:41.079> you<00:01:41.290> can<00:01:41.439> see<00:01:41.590> there's<00:01:41.770> plenty<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.100> space

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
now you can see there's plenty of space

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.639 
now you can see there's plenty of space
there<00:01:42.670> for<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.939> filler<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.450> nice<00:01:44.020> strong<00:01:44.380> hold

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
there for the filler a nice strong hold

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.560 
there for the filler a nice strong hold
now<00:01:45.610> an<00:01:45.790> alternative<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.680> use<00:01:47.710> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
now an alternative to that is to use a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.370 
now an alternative to that is to use a
construction<00:01:49.570> screw<00:01:49.869> an<00:01:50.020> all-purpose
