00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
design flaw the arm which bands at this

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.860 
design flaw the arm which bands at this
point<00:01:19.120> one<00:01:20.050> there<00:01:20.320> is<00:01:20.580> object<00:01:21.580> picked<00:01:21.820> up<00:01:22.000> the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
point one there is object picked up the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.790 
point one there is object picked up the
plastic<00:01:23.350> piece<00:01:23.590> here<00:01:23.620> will<00:01:24.100> actually<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:26.620> arm

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
plastic piece here will actually the arm

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.340 
plastic piece here will actually the arm
will<00:01:27.040> cause<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.460> plastic<00:01:27.730> piece<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.810> be<00:01:29.080> very

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
will cause the plastic piece to be very

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.890 
will cause the plastic piece to be very
close<00:01:29.620> to<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.010> rubber<00:01:30.460> belt<00:01:30.700> here<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.690> the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
close to the rubber belt here so the

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.930 
close to the rubber belt here so the
elevated<00:01:32.410> piece<00:01:33.100> here<00:01:33.310> will<00:01:33.490> actually<00:01:33.790> hit

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
elevated piece here will actually hit

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.090 
elevated piece here will actually hit
the<00:01:34.090> plastic<00:01:34.480> piece<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:35.080> make<00:01:35.500> really<00:01:35.680> some

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
the plastic piece and make really some

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
really very now loud noise so let's test

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.840 
really very now loud noise so let's test
