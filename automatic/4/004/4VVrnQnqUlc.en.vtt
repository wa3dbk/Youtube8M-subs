00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
idea that than a 44 game they came from

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.180 
idea that than a 44 game they came from
a<00:00:35.250> separate<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.559> we<00:00:37.559> want<00:00:37.739> take<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
a separate are there we want take a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.630 
a separate are there we want take a
different<00:00:38.399> approach<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.090> platform<00:00:39.510> games<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
different approach to platform games and

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.180 
different approach to platform games and
they<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.910> looked<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.329> how<00:00:42.510> traditional

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
they kind of looked at how traditional

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.369 
they kind of looked at how traditional
things<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.399> been<00:00:44.550> approached<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.379> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
things have been approached that the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
things have been approached that the
designers<00:00:47.100> create<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> abilities<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.840> give

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
designers create the abilities we give

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.630 
designers create the abilities we give
them<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.410> flyer<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.309> player<00:00:50.489> can

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
them to the flyer and the player can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.090 
them to the flyer and the player can
only<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> abilities<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:52.079> we've<00:00:52.680> defined

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
only use the abilities as we've defined

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.369 
only use the abilities as we've defined
the<00:00:53.370> karoo<00:00:53.640> whereas<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.570> felt<00:00:54.809> how<00:00:55.020> many<00:00:55.140> rows

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the karoo whereas we felt how many rows

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.049 
the karoo whereas we felt how many rows
up<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.890> different<00:00:56.280> direction<00:00:56.430> whereas

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
up from a different direction whereas

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
up from a different direction whereas
the<00:00:57.180> players<00:00:57.449> actually<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> define<00:00:59.160> their

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the players actually get to define their

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.580 
the players actually get to define their
own<00:00:59.370> abilities<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.480> choose<00:01:00.750> how

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
own abilities so they can choose how

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.340 
own abilities so they can choose how
they<00:01:01.620> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.219> complete<00:01:02.820> whatever<00:01:03.690> test<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
they want to complete whatever test of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.080 
they want to complete whatever test of
inset<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.039> then<00:01:05.339> suddenly<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.940> this

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
inset and then suddenly we have this

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.460 
inset and then suddenly we have this
concept<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.050> this<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.549> kind<00:01:09.360> of

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
concept it in here this this kind of

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.050 
concept it in here this this kind of
idea<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.740> approaching<00:01:11.250> platform<00:01:11.640> goes<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
idea of approaching platform goes from a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.240 
idea of approaching platform goes from a
different<00:01:12.360> direction<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.530> bolted

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
different direction and kind of bolted

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.630 
different direction and kind of bolted
together<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:16.350> result<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.130> we're

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
together and the result is there we're

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.680 
together and the result is there we're
under

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:50.520 

you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.780 

it<00:01:51.100> took<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.460> very<00:01:51.640> simple<00:01:52.600> idea<00:01:53.400> and<00:01:54.400> wanted<00:01:54.729> to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
it took a very simple idea and wanted to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
it took a very simple idea and wanted to
combine<00:01:56.940> pieces<00:01:57.940> with<00:01:58.119> different<00:01:58.420> abilities

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
combine pieces with different abilities

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.430 
combine pieces with different abilities
but<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.190> beauty<00:02:01.180> of<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.420> concept<00:02:01.840> was<00:02:01.900> the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
but the beauty of the concept was the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.190 
but the beauty of the concept was the
black<00:02:02.710> could<00:02:02.979> combine<00:02:03.250> those<00:02:03.640> pieces<00:02:04.000> in<00:02:04.960> any

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
black could combine those pieces in any

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.499 
black could combine those pieces in any
order<00:02:05.440> they<00:02:05.650> wanted<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.850> then<00:02:07.119> at<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.479> end

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
order they wanted to and then at the end

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.919 
order they wanted to and then at the end
of<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.840> whatever<00:02:08.289> they<00:02:08.500> created<00:02:09.100> he<00:02:10.000> put<00:02:10.690> into

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
of it whatever they created he put into

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.860 
of it whatever they created he put into
the<00:02:11.020> game<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:12.489> would<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:12.640> work<00:02:13.060> for<00:02:13.750> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
the game it would just work for the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.670 
the game it would just work for the
player<00:02:14.080> wouldn't<00:02:14.290> be<00:02:14.470> too<00:02:16.080> kind<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.140> calculate

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
player wouldn't be too kind of calculate

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.250 
player wouldn't be too kind of calculate
very<00:02:18.040> complicated<00:02:18.670> processes<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.870> suffer

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
very complicated processes to suffer

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.900 
very complicated processes to suffer
with<00:02:20.410> doing<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.550> thought<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:21.790> we

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
with doing that and I thought what we

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.390 
with doing that and I thought what we
build<00:02:22.120> Versailles<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.810> waveshape<00:02:23.310> have<00:02:24.310> you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
build Versailles the waveshape have you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.650 
build Versailles the waveshape have you
both<00:02:24.610> putting<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.090> game<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.570> would

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
both putting in the game and it would

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.640 
both putting in the game and it would
just<00:02:25.690> work<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:26.650> until<00:02:27.060> until<00:02:28.060> xbox<00:02:28.450> 360<00:02:29.170> we've

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
just work but until until xbox 360 we've

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.590 
just work but until until xbox 360 we've
never<00:02:29.800> had<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.040> piece<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.280> hardware<00:02:30.820> that's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
never had a piece of hardware that's

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.130 
never had a piece of hardware that's
