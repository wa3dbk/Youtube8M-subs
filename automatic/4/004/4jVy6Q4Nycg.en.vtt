decent form recently so it would be nice
to<00:01:27.060> continue<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.530> we

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to continue to do that here and we

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
to continue to do that here and we
actually<00:01:28.770> pick<00:01:29.159> up<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.460> penalty<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
actually pick up a penalty in the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.120 
actually pick up a penalty in the
opening<00:01:30.420> few<00:01:30.659> minutes<00:01:30.960> you'll<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.950> not

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
opening few minutes you'll see I'm not

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
opening few minutes you'll see I'm not
really<00:01:32.220> too<00:01:32.460> sure<00:01:32.630> why<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:34.170> given<00:01:34.320> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
really too sure why this was given I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.840 
really too sure why this was given I
think<00:01:34.710> Steven<00:01:34.860> Caulker<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.430> took<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> man

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
think Steven Caulker just took the man

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.090 
think Steven Caulker just took the man
out<00:01:35.970> off<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.479> ball<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> you'll<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.920> able<00:01:37.979> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
out off the ball and you'll be able to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.230 
out off the ball and you'll be able to
see<00:01:38.220> from<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> replay<00:01:38.759> although<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.090> not

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
see from the replay although it's not

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
see from the replay although it's not
overly<00:01:39.659> conclusive<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.770> slid<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.100> there

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
overly conclusive so you slid in there

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
overly conclusive so you slid in there
and<00:01:41.520> took<00:01:41.670> Daniel<00:01:42.270> Sturridge<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.810> from

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and took Daniel Sturridge out from

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
and took Daniel Sturridge out from
behind<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.619> they're<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.310> too<00:01:44.549> much<00:01:44.670> contact

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
behind and they're not too much contact

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
behind and they're not too much contact
on<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> think<00:01:45.479> such<00:01:45.659> went<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:45.990> pretty<00:01:46.140> easily

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
on I think such went down pretty easily

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.319 
on I think such went down pretty easily
but<00:01:46.829> still<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.520> pick<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> penalty

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
but still we do pick up the penalty

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.359 
but still we do pick up the penalty
obviously<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.799> Steven<00:01:50.159> Sarah

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
obviously it's going to be Steven Sarah

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
obviously it's going to be Steven Sarah
to<00:01:50.579> take<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.240> he<00:01:51.329> stops<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.079> pulls

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
to take it but then he stops and pulls

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.170 
to take it but then he stops and pulls
I've<00:01:52.920> changed<00:01:53.159> player<00:01:53.430> he's<00:01:53.700> stopping<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
I've changed player he's stopping to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.490 
I've changed player he's stopping to
standing<00:01:54.659> next<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> ball<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> he's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
standing next to the ball and he's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.550 
standing next to the ball and he's
taking<00:01:55.950> forever<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.969> do<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.990> particular

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
taking forever to do this particular

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.350 
taking forever to do this particular
animation<00:01:59.189> which<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.610> backing<00:01:59.820> up<00:02:00.030> away<00:02:00.329> from

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.240 
but still got the pace and the ability
to<00:04:10.230> we're<00:04:10.410> whipping<00:04:10.650> some<00:04:10.860> balls<00:04:11.040> have<00:04:11.160> been

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
to we're whipping some balls have been

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.000 
to we're whipping some balls have been
taking<00:04:11.640> I'm<00:04:11.730> sure<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.030> will<00:04:12.120> be<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.390> main

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
taking I'm sure that will be the main

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.590 
taking I'm sure that will be the main
reasoning<00:04:14.010> behind<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.490> move<00:04:14.790> by<00:04:15.090> by<00:04:15.540> the

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
reasoning behind that move by by the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.650 
reasoning behind that move by by the
manager<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.260> we<00:04:16.350> have<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.590> try<00:04:16.770> our<00:04:16.920> best<00:04:17.070> again

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
manager so we have to try our best again

before<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.460> it's<00:04:38.580> worked<00:04:38.819> we're<00:04:39.330> going<00:04:39.449> to

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
before and it's worked we're going to

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.210 
before and it's worked we're going to
try<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.750> do<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.020> same<00:04:40.229> way<00:04:40.349> I<00:04:40.379> see<00:04:40.770> past<00:04:41.009> that

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
try and do the same way I see past that

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.619 
try and do the same way I see past that
ball<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.580> was<00:04:41.699> snuggling<00:04:42.150> but<00:04:42.270> he<00:04:42.330> ran<00:04:42.449> onto

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
ball that was snuggling but he ran onto

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.119 
ball that was snuggling but he ran onto
his<00:04:42.840> own<00:04:42.930> past<00:04:43.199> runs<00:04:43.440> all<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.650> way<00:04:43.770> through

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 
his own past runs all the way through

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.040 
his own past runs all the way through
and<00:04:44.340> unfortunately<00:04:45.270> that's<00:04:45.659> why<00:04:45.900> he's<00:04:46.020> a

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
and unfortunately that's why he's a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.600 
and unfortunately that's why he's a
holding<00:04:46.470> mid<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.800> not<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:46.919> striker<00:04:47.250> the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
holding mid and not a striker the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.510 
holding mid and not a striker the
finishing<00:04:48.360> was<00:04:48.840> definitely<00:04:49.680> subpar<00:04:50.280> there

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
finishing was definitely subpar there

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.129 
finishing was definitely subpar there
sadly<00:04:50.819> but<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.389> they<00:04:51.629> were<00:04:51.690> actually<00:04:51.840> going<00:04:52.050> to

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
sadly but so they were actually going to

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.270 
sadly but so they were actually going to
have<00:04:52.229> their<00:04:52.409> first<00:04:52.620> science<00:04:52.919> of<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.129> half

here screwing it into bentek it's a

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.469
