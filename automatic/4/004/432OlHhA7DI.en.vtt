00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.320
 with the amount of programs that we can find on the web it is sometimes difficult 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.140
 say which is the one that best suits our needs so in the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.309
 past we tried some that we thought for the useful pitcher 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.959
 min 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.829
 normally we imposed paralyzed hide sometimes with windows 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.960
 In return, we are not going to analyze a very special sopor because it has seemed very 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.660
 interesting and that especially 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.340
 we are sure that many of you search is on the internet it is a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.940
 small great program for mobile devices that have the system 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.810
 operative windows mobile 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.320
 sure many of you are worried I stole sample phone with 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.100
 so well with the remote tracker program this will no longer be a problem 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.199
 because in case it happens 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.199
 this program will help us recover your device 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.350
 The most usual thing when we steal the mobile phone is that they change the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.740
 sim card to insert it in quotes new owner 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.850
 well, remote traker is able to detect this change that does 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.449
 and automatically in day a text message to a number previously 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.920
 configured with the new phone number our terminal 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.540
 but that's not where it ends 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.280
 from that moment we will have a series of commands sent to 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.120
 through SMS will allow us to receive the contact list of the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.570
 thief 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.190
 to locate our phone in case it has gps 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.980
 After setting up our device with a phone 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.180
 emergency to which the information will be sent in case of tape change 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.270
 and a password so that only we can access 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.630
 we can send the commands with a format to say it 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.289
 these commands are for example position that after activating the 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.539
 gps unit of our device will send us a text message with the 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.960
 coordinates which is found 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.619
 also and with the help of the Audio 2 program that we will analyze in 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.659
 next programs 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.380
 we can receive a recording of the last calls issued and received 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.200
 in our email 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.039
 through the mouth fomh command 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.209
 our terminal will send us either by text message or through the 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.390
 email 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 the thief's contact list 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.240
 we can also, among other things, make an alarm sound in the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.389
 phone after delivering the terminal 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:15.399
 delete all the memory of it and even make the phone dial the 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.980
 phone number we want to use the micro of our 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.849
 phone and listen to everything that happens 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.080
 all of this is done, of course, completely invisible to the 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.549
 thief what will allow us without doubt to gather all the necessary information 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.919
