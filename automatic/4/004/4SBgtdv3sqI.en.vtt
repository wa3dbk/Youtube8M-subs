wasn't<00:00:41.940> turning<00:00:42.300> very<00:00:42.540> slowly<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:43.890> my

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
wasn't turning very slowly but like my

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.799 
wasn't turning very slowly but like my
thought<00:00:44.280> process<00:00:44.760> was<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.940> lot<00:00:45.239> slower<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
thought process was a lot slower and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
thought process was a lot slower and
then<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> usually<00:00:46.230> wasn't<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.039> wasn't<00:00:47.550> as

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
then it usually wasn't like I wasn't as

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.299 
then it usually wasn't like I wasn't as
um<00:00:48.260> what's<00:00:49.260> where<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.500> looking<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:52.309> wasn't

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
um what's where I'm looking for I wasn't

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
um what's where I'm looking for I wasn't
thinking<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.149> hard<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.350> guess<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:56.340> wasn't

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
thinking is like hard I guess it wasn't

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.970 
thinking is like hard I guess it wasn't
like<00:00:56.850> um<00:00:57.149> being<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.989> careful<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.829> look

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
like um being so careful to like look

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.340 
like um being so careful to like look
for<00:00:59.219> f<00:00:59.520> 12<00:00:59.940> pairs<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.390> such<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.899> recognize

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
for f 12 pairs and such and recognize

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.399 
for f 12 pairs and such and recognize
cases<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.510> whatever<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.080> care<00:01:04.320> what

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
cases so whatever I'm really care what

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.530 
cases so whatever I'm really care what
