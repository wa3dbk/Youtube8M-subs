00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
after that so you know pretty early if

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.290 
after that so you know pretty early if
you<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.280> over<00:01:02.490> the<00:01:02.580> first<00:01:02.730> couple<00:01:02.880> of<00:01:03.150> fences

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
like any hard fish you go through you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.930 
like any hard fish you go through you
analyze<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.680> afterwards<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> know<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> believe

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
analyze it afterwards you know I believe

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.600 
analyze it afterwards you know I believe
at<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> times<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.950> third<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> blowing<00:01:23.400> wind

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
at the times that third and blowing wind

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.010 
at the times that third and blowing wind
took<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> science<00:01:24.420> an<00:01:24.570> officer<00:01:24.840> can

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
took all the science an officer can

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
took all the science an officer can
Royal<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.530> didn't<00:01:25.950> look<00:01:26.040> back<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.550> wrist

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
Royal I didn't look back in the wrist

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219 
Royal I didn't look back in the wrist
and<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.180> should<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.050> should

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and think I should on this or I should

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.810 
and think I should on this or I should
or<00:01:28.440> not<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.830> that<00:01:29.250> might<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.610> made<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
or not that that might have made the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
or not that that might have made the
difference<00:01:29.940> between<00:01:30.330> winning<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:30.840> losing

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
difference between winning and losing

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
difference between winning and losing

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I mean sure if you don't win there's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.520 
I mean sure if you don't win there's
always<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.390> reason<00:01:33.630> why<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> could<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.320> better

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
always a reason why you could do better

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
always a reason why you could do better

liking<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.390> around<00:01:57.630> for

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
liking and then you go around for

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.260 
liking and then you go around for
circuit<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.860> hope<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.280> look<00:01:59.820> around<00:02:00.120> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
circuit and you hope you look around and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.970 
circuit and you hope you look around and
see<00:02:00.360> what's<00:02:00.690> going<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.110> what's<00:02:01.260> not<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
see what's going on what's not going and

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.590 
see what's going on what's not going and
you<00:02:02.250> way<00:02:02.400> up<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.670> options<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.240> pretty<00:02:03.420> much

I think if you're lucky enough to be in
the<00:02:45.599> position<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.440> win<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:47.340> don't<00:02:47.910> think

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the position you can win I don't think

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.280 
the position you can win I don't think
you<00:02:48.209> hear<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> noise<00:02:48.630> until<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.140> actually

you hear the noise until you actually

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.900 
you hear the noise until you actually
believe<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.160> whereas<00:02:50.790> I
