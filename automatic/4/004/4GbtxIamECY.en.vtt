00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 it's not a real recipe 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.029
 however half luxari great ingredients 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.160
 and two spaghetti 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.050
 you remember he made a pass 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.320
 of chickpeas remained half wurstel 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.299
 ok then cut this half into 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.779
 sense of length and you will get two 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.289
 pieces so ok support the part 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.390
 cut to the cutting board and now we will form 2 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.849
 bp then we will make a boy and one 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.939
 sissy we start in making the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.399
 boy then we cut the legs 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.530
 of the hotels in the middle and we will form pleta 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:43.190
 close we make two oblique cuts 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:46.410
 these side arms will be ok 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.980
 then with the knife with the knife that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.020
 I recommend sharp only the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.920
 I don't read the mouth cut only 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.920
 mouth cut 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.359
 ok and 2 all active for the eyes 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.030
 worried they are closed because in 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.830
 cooking will open your arms from your eyes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.900
 mouth all that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 so rest assured the important thing will be alone 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.350
 the cut almost then for a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.670
 green a spaghetti cut it of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.799
 most preferred length on the a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.250
 baby boy will have a lot of hair 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.100
 short then cut small pieces of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:32.579
 spaghetti more or less high in India 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 and then we will put them in the head in this 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.780
 simply the way you will go to 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.360
 place ok 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.360
 keep it up they look curly but then 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.450
 cooking inside the eni also 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.950
 this you can let the children do so 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 they enjoy us 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.009
 ok ok it's the boy is made of hair 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.390
 practically how many you prefer 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.390
 sell us some 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.820
 and this can be a cat for babies 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.830
 but complex you have guests where to 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.700
 surprise them with their own finding in the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.410
 dish is a funny thing 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.750
 here is our boy 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.530
 now we're going to be a sissy is 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.800
 same italy in the middle as in the legs 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:39.700
 ok 2 oblique cuts for the arms 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:47.140
 perfect then the mouth so the two 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.340
 eyes then to do the hair 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.500
 as the sissy 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.630
 we believe it is just longer not there 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.360
 worry if it was planted much the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.480
 English spaghetti will be straight as 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.670
 spaghetti precisely because the future is so 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.150
 they become soft they will tend to fall 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.320
 and make a good test our 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.320
 our miss gius 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.130
 ok also the snow we plant in the head in 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.550
 this way we put one in the meantime 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.459
 pot of water to boil if you have to do 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.480
 only these things only 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.880
 otherwise you can safely 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.970
 throw them in the partner like 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.209

 snowman aside, however, made spaghetti 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.190
 meshes withdrawn via first montella not 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:43.900

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.400

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.320
 let cook until the spaghetti 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.090
 the just will not be cooked and 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.900
 very soon, however, we can't get leibinger 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.230
 spaghetti will be cooked and you see 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.530

 small maybe I see are all 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.510
 nice things because in cooking it opens 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.870
 and therefore various can be formed 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.690
