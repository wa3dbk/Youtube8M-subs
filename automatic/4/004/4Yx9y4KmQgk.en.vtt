00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.570 

I<00:00:05.080> think<00:00:06.080> I<00:00:06.170> was<00:00:06.350> inspired<00:00:06.740> to<00:00:06.950> write<00:00:07.130> the<00:00:07.430> book

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
I think I was inspired to write the book

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.449 
I think I was inspired to write the book
the<00:00:07.759> developing<00:00:08.240> brain<00:00:08.389> birth<00:00:08.750> to<00:00:08.929> age<00:00:09.080> 8<00:00:09.459> with

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:10.459 
the developing brain birth to age 8 with

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.459 
the developing brain birth to age 8 with
the<00:00:10.610> birth<00:00:10.759> of<00:00:10.969> my<00:00:11.150> grandchildren<00:00:11.719> and<00:00:12.169> the

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
the birth of my grandchildren and the

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.549 
the birth of my grandchildren and the
fact<00:00:12.709> that<00:00:12.799> I<00:00:12.919> started<00:00:13.219> my<00:00:14.059> career<00:00:14.119> in<00:00:14.559> early

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
fact that I started my career in early

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:16.270 
fact that I started my career in early
childhood

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.280 
childhood

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.130 
childhood
I<00:00:16.309> taught<00:00:17.090> pre-kindergarten<00:00:17.929> and

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
I taught pre-kindergarten and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.529 
I taught pre-kindergarten and
kindergarten<00:00:18.590> and<00:00:19.300> I<00:00:21.609> experienced<00:00:22.609> some

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
kindergarten and I experienced some

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.659 
kindergarten and I experienced some
schools<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.289> some<00:00:24.470> classrooms<00:00:25.009> that<00:00:25.369> I

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
schools and some classrooms that I

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.849 
schools and some classrooms that I
thought<00:00:26.119> you<00:00:26.630> know<00:00:26.750> needed<00:00:27.050> some<00:00:27.230> change<00:00:27.560> I

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
thought you know needed some change I

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.489 
thought you know needed some change I
didn't<00:00:28.130> know<00:00:28.189> what<00:00:28.369> that<00:00:28.400> change<00:00:28.789> was<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:29.539> as

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:30.499 
didn't know what that change was and as

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.409 
didn't know what that change was and as
I<00:00:30.650> continued<00:00:31.070> my<00:00:31.099> career<00:00:31.669> went<00:00:32.119> through

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
I continued my career went through

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.620 
I continued my career went through
teaching<00:00:33.430> primary<00:00:34.430> middle<00:00:34.700> school<00:00:35.060> in<00:00:35.360> high

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
teaching primary middle school in high

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.790 
teaching primary middle school in high
school<00:00:36.130> I<00:00:37.130> decided<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:38.300> kids<00:00:39.110> were<00:00:39.230> changing

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
school I decided that kids were changing

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.950 
school I decided that kids were changing
and<00:00:40.040> at<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.790> time<00:00:41.000> we<00:00:41.330> really<00:00:41.630> weren't<00:00:41.810> sure

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
and at the time we really weren't sure

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.660 
and at the time we really weren't sure
that<00:00:42.080> the<00:00:42.380> brain<00:00:42.650> had<00:00:43.100> anything<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.460> do<00:00:43.640> with

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
that the brain had anything to do with

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.620 
that the brain had anything to do with
learning<00:00:44.150> but<00:00:45.020> as<00:00:45.320> I<00:00:45.410> did<00:00:45.650> research<00:00:46.600> as<00:00:47.600> a

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
learning but as I did research as a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.830 
learning but as I did research as a
survival<00:00:48.320> skill<00:00:48.560> actually<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.790> know<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:49.970> deal

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
survival skill actually you know to deal

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.920 
survival skill actually you know to deal
with<00:00:51.080> inner-city<00:00:51.770> kids<00:00:52.130> and<00:00:52.690> not<00:00:53.690> just

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
with inner-city kids and not just

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.170 
with inner-city kids and not just
inner-city<00:00:54.320> kids<00:00:54.620> but<00:00:54.830> actually<00:00:55.250> affluent

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
inner-city kids but actually affluent

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.780 
inner-city kids but actually affluent
kids<00:00:56.390> who<00:00:56.810> were<00:00:57.290> were<00:00:57.770> missing<00:00:58.130> something<00:00:58.400> who

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
kids who were were missing something who

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.120 
kids who were were missing something who
just<00:00:59.300> I<00:00:59.600> think<00:01:00.110> I'm<00:01:00.290> just<00:01:00.470> a<00:01:00.590> whole<00:01:00.800> child

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
just I think I'm just a whole child

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.760 
just I think I'm just a whole child
person<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.710> started<00:01:03.710> doing<00:01:03.890> research<00:01:04.400> and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
person and started doing research and

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.580 
person and started doing research and
found<00:01:06.770> brain<00:01:07.190> research<00:01:07.550> to<00:01:07.790> be<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.720> key<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.380> a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
found brain research to be the key to a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.130 
found brain research to be the key to a
lot<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.490> issues<00:01:10.940> that<00:01:10.970> I<00:01:11.450> was<00:01:11.630> facing<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
lot of the issues that I was facing and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.550 
lot of the issues that I was facing and
other<00:01:12.260> teachers<00:01:12.620> were<00:01:12.770> facing<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.750> as<00:01:14.750> I

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
other teachers were facing and as I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.220 
other teachers were facing and as I
continued<00:01:16.070> my<00:01:16.220> research<00:01:16.630> they<00:01:17.630> started<00:01:18.050> going

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
continued my research they started going

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.620 
continued my research they started going
with<00:01:18.950> younger<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:19.580> younger<00:01:19.730> kids<00:01:20.270> and

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
with younger and younger kids and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.350 
with younger and younger kids and
finally<00:01:21.409> there<00:01:21.650> was<00:01:21.770> some<00:01:21.980> concrete<00:01:22.520> brain

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
finally there was some concrete brain

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.530 
finally there was some concrete brain
research<00:01:23.780> out<00:01:24.020> there<00:01:24.220> for<00:01:25.220> early<00:01:26.090> childhood

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
research out there for early childhood

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.680 
research out there for early childhood
and<00:01:26.930> since<00:01:27.860> that's<00:01:28.100> where<00:01:28.640> we<00:01:28.850> really<00:01:29.240> need<00:01:29.570> to

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
and since that's where we really need to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.260 
and since that's where we really need to
start<00:01:29.900> with<00:01:30.260> all<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.620> this<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:31.100> decided<00:01:32.000> to

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
start with all of this I decided to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.050 
start with all of this I decided to
pursue<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.260> track<00:01:33.680> at<00:01:34.010> this<00:01:34.250> at<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.760> time

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
pursue that track at this at this time

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.280 
pursue that track at this at this time
and<00:01:36.850> really<00:01:37.850> found<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:38.900> could<00:01:39.080> follow

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
and really found that we could follow

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.730 
and really found that we could follow
brain<00:01:39.800> development<00:01:40.659> year<00:01:41.659> by<00:01:41.810> year<00:01:42.229> from

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
brain development year by year from

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.920 
brain development year by year from
birth<00:01:42.950> through<00:01:43.640> age<00:01:43.729> eight<00:01:44.120> actually<00:01:44.690> you

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
birth through age eight actually you

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.090 
birth through age eight actually you
know<00:01:45.020> much<00:01:45.260> later<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:45.950> I<00:01:46.909> found<00:01:47.540> that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
know much later but I found that

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.730 
know much later but I found that
combining<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.310> child<00:01:49.850> development

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
combining that with child development

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.580 
combining that with child development
with<00:01:51.740> cognitive<00:01:52.280> psychology<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:54.350> could

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
with cognitive psychology that I could

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.250 
with cognitive psychology that I could
put<00:01:54.799> together<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:55.670> pretty<00:01:56.060> good<00:01:56.240> snapshot<00:01:56.960> of

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
put together a pretty good snapshot of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.719 
put together a pretty good snapshot of
what<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.920> child

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
what a child

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.810 
what a child
each<00:01:59.030> age<00:01:59.330> would<00:01:59.810> look<00:02:00.080> like<00:02:00.320> with<00:02:01.159> milestones

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
each age would look like with milestones

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.680 
each age would look like with milestones
that<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:03.020> course<00:02:03.290> vary<00:02:04.130> because<00:02:04.520> frames<00:02:05.420> are

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
that of course vary because frames are

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.539 
that of course vary because frames are
not<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.110> same<00:02:06.320> age<00:02:06.560> at<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> same<00:02:07.100> time<00:02:07.340> even

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
not the same age at the same time even

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.999 
not the same age at the same time even
though<00:02:08.080> chronologically<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.110> children<00:02:09.769> are

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
though chronologically the children are

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.119 
though chronologically the children are
that<00:02:10.249> age<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:11.329> just<00:02:11.629> to<00:02:12.139> give<00:02:12.290> teachers<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
that age but just to give teachers and

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.130 
that age but just to give teachers and
even<00:02:13.700> parents<00:02:14.180> orange

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
even parents orange

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.650 
even parents orange
an<00:02:15.200> idea<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.980> what<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.880> look<00:02:16.910> for<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.540> their

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
an idea of what to look for in their

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.870 
an idea of what to look for in their
child<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.410> what<00:02:18.530> expectations<00:02:19.100> they<00:02:19.670> might

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
child and what expectations they might

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.930 
child and what expectations they might
have<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.830> know<00:02:21.920> not<00:02:22.220> really<00:02:22.490> what<00:02:22.790> to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.480 
have and you know not really what to
worry<00:02:23.210> about<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:23.870> what<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.200> look<00:02:24.530> for<00:02:24.830> or<00:02:25.040> be

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
worry about but what to look for or be

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.000 
worry about but what to look for or be
concerned<00:02:25.970> about<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.810> children<00:02:27.590> weren't

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
concerned about if children weren't

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.400 
concerned about if children weren't
reaching<00:02:28.580> certain<00:02:28.790> milestones<00:02:29.540> within<00:02:30.380> a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
reaching certain milestones within a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.550 
reaching certain milestones within a
year<00:02:30.740> or<00:02:30.830> two<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.820> age<00:02:32.120> development<00:02:32.870> so

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
year or two of that age development so

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.699 
year or two of that age development so
it<00:02:33.890> was<00:02:34.070> an<00:02:34.310> exciting<00:02:34.850> journey<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.570> I<00:02:36.290> get<00:02:36.530> to

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
it was an exciting journey and I get to

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.949 
it was an exciting journey and I get to
interview<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.160> lot<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.400> children<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.750> lot<00:02:38.900> of

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
interview a lot of children and a lot of

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.949 
interview a lot of children and a lot of
teachers<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.030> I'm<00:02:41.030> hoping<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.540> book<00:02:41.720> will

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
teachers and I'm hoping that book will

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.670 
teachers and I'm hoping that book will
make<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.140> difference<00:02:42.590> for<00:02:42.680> them<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.190> think<00:02:43.940> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
make a difference for them I think that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.440 
make a difference for them I think that
the<00:02:45.680> way<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:45.830> structured<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.790> developing

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the way I structured the developing

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.440 
the way I structured the developing
brain<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:48.620> first<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.550> all<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.910> give<00:02:50.060> teachers

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
brain was first of all to give teachers

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.620 
brain was first of all to give teachers
I<00:02:50.750> believe<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.709> need<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.980> know<00:02:52.130> why<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:53.270> I

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
I believe that we need to know why so I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.840 
I believe that we need to know why so I
offer<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.530> background<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.520> what's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
offer the background this is what's

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.760 
offer the background this is what's
going<00:02:56.030> on<00:02:56.209> in<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.450> brain<00:02:56.720> these<00:02:57.530> are<00:02:57.709> the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
going on in the brain these are the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.740 
going on in the brain these are the
possible<00:02:58.190> implications<00:02:58.550> for<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.390> growth

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
possible implications for that growth

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.010 
possible implications for that growth
that's<00:03:00.170> taking<00:03:00.650> place<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.510> these<00:03:02.720> are<00:03:02.900> the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
that's taking place so these are the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.199 
that's taking place so these are the
these<00:03:03.320> are<00:03:03.350> for<00:03:03.980> language<00:03:04.340> development<00:03:04.370> for

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
these are for language development for

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.990 
these are for language development for
instance<00:03:05.570> depending<00:03:06.110> on<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.459> background

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
instance depending on the background

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.449 
instance depending on the background
knowledge<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:09.440> environment<00:03:09.980> they've<00:03:10.130> had<00:03:10.340> at

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
knowledge the environment they've had at

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.050 
knowledge the environment they've had at
home<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.690> will<00:03:11.900> determine<00:03:12.489> perhaps<00:03:13.489> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
home that will determine perhaps the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.110 
home that will determine perhaps the
size<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.450> their<00:03:14.570> vocabulary<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:16.880> take

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
size of their vocabulary and to take

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.110 
size of their vocabulary and to take
that<00:03:17.420> information<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.620> know<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:19.120> with

that information and to know that with

that information and to know that with
some<00:03:20.420> children<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.110> we<00:03:21.260> have<00:03:21.290> classrooms

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
some children and we have classrooms

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.199 
some children and we have classrooms
full<00:03:22.459> of<00:03:22.730> diversity<00:03:23.390> these<00:03:24.140> days<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.940> some

full of diversity these days that some

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.680 
full of diversity these days that some

has ever heard and what does that mean
you<00:03:42.680> know<00:03:42.769> when<00:03:43.190> when<00:03:44.030> most<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:44.780> us<00:03:44.950> have<00:03:45.950> our

the first week and we're holding that
child<00:03:51.410> in<00:03:51.620> our<00:03:51.739> arms<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.940> child<00:03:53.180> is

child in our arms and the child is
feeling<00:03:53.650> comfort<00:03:54.650> in<00:03:54.829> love<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.459> security<00:03:55.790> and

there's<00:04:04.130> some<00:04:04.310> research<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.640> says<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.150> child

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
there's some research that says a child

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.080 
there's some research that says a child
needs<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:05.900> hear<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.440> thousand<00:04:07.370> books<00:04:07.519> before

so when they get to school this is

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.540 
so when they get to school this is
really<00:04:28.280> the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
really the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.670 
really the
beginning<00:04:28.940> for<00:04:29.180> them<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:30.110> how<00:04:30.260> do<00:04:30.320> we<00:04:30.440> make

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
beginning for them so how do we make

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.000 
beginning for them so how do we make
that<00:04:30.980> first<00:04:31.520> book<00:04:31.910> as<00:04:32.350> special<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.710> child

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.900 
that first book as special to the child
at<00:04:34.340> age<00:04:34.730> 4<00:04:35.240> or<00:04:35.390> 5<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:36.590> was<00:04:37.250> made<00:04:37.520> for<00:04:37.820> the
