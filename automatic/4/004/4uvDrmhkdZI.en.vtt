00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.290
 or 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello guys and compass and welcome to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
 another new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.260
 unboxing title of watch docs so is 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.630
 As you are seeing, I already have what is going 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.429
 doing the wake stoxx game and what 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.590
 I just bought a little bit ago it does not 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.570
 like an hour or something like that then we go 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.369
 to start and unfortunately right now not 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 I can be using my video camera 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.420
 because I'm missing an adapter and nothing else 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.949
 I bought that adapter and I'll use it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 ok but not while we're going to start 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.000
 with the unboxing so they can see that it has 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.489
 do not add I open the game we're going to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.080
 remove the labels here as you see I do not know 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.370
 if someone noticed it but I bought it in the 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.380
 sanborns store that's where 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.420
 I usually buy the games since it 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.399
 It makes it very easy for me to go ok so let's go 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 remove all this to see if it is not 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.110
 moving here is here and we're going to take it 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.520
 Carefully label the xbox and 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.379
 now they will see what the game contains 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.750
 inside not to see first let me what 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.329
 I open and how they see it here tells us some 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.579
 little things and let me remove these things that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.289
 I have it right here and right now is the taught 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 you have to put the followed here as 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.010
 always all xbox tags do not 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.899
 I know why they can be vital to me 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.670
 a guarantee I always put them here and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.500
 as you can see here we have the watch game 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.010
 docs and right now I'm going to put it on gel and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.540
 in him 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 to get installed because these games 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.130
 in case they take a long time to install ok 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.330
 and as you see it here here we have the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.150
 same box then I'm going to make a 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.560
 comparison of what I know how to say in 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.750
 a comparison of the new generation 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 against the other generation and as they see it 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.930
 here here tells us over 90 awards 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.220
 3 and nominations awards 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.310
 then we see that it is a pretty game 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.020
 good and if we see it from behind it does not take off 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.550
 several things not of play that I think that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.680
 is the system that will be used for games 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.479
 line and more things forgive because this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.580
 camera does not get to see the hd very well 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.530
 but because something is something I did not want 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.450
 bring them this and then he did not give me time to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.430
 go get the adapter and as not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 see here we have the west box now we go 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.240
 to proceed with the others already saw more 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.450
 that nothing here brings us some leaflets 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.340
 says assassin's creed 4 black flag and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.040
 other things not to who gloriously tells us 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.780
 spectacular ign and also brings us 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.810
 enough little things the pnc and how they see it 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.000
 says plays for you play then already 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.250
 We saw that your server will be to 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.680
 play so to speak and bring many more 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.160
 little things not here as they see it tells us the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.830
 season 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.870
 and other things and I think there's going to be a 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.940
 if they are peace of ward's docs so then 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.680
 I'll tell you a little about that and how 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.050
 do not see here it brings us enough little things 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.320
 not in the three main languages ​​that 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.610
 they would be Portuguese Spanish and French I 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.830
 I think this is practically 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.510
 because it's Latin America then from there 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.310
 will also bring us English and look 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.640
 here we have another little game that also 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.680
 brings us you have enrolled four of the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.220
 white but I think this is nothing more 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.870
 a simple one simple how to tell them a 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.640
 instructive there is no here already brings us what 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.350
 what is doing in white sox and is everything 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.060
 what do you think it brings me days of golf 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.250
 It's something I expected to bring to 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.600
 less about two days three days of testing 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.490
 of goal but this one does not bring anything 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.070
 comparison of the other of the other games 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.900
 yes they are there mestre as they see it here 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.250
 it brings us little things but it does not show and nothing 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.500
 they already saw what brings more than anything 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.120
 game here is the pretty pretty box 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.070
 the box the truth is that it is very beautiful 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.080
