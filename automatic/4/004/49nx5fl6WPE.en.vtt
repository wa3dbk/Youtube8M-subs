00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.150
 prepared a new creepy pasta 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.150
 pokemon for today 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.010
 this time based on band &amp; the pokemon 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.349
 ghost introduced in the third 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.750
 generation of pokemon without further 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.210
 add it will be better to start with the video 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.580
 I wait for the moment I have to ask you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 something before and what do you want 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.949
 ask how the devil do you think in idea 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.470
 for every three missing that's something 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.960
 single I just choose the pokemon indicated 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.850
 in my mind begins to work but for 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.750
 you will not know what is happening 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.750
 inside my mind 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.660
 You're a fucking deranged stop 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.320
 question my mental faculties and 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.930
 better help me with the video ok but if you 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.390
 I'm paying for that I want an increase 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.879
 How can you ask for an increase if 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.519
 you do not even do anything because I will not work 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.550
 Until you give me the son of a bitch raise 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.489
 finally let's start with the cree peep up 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.430
 today's creepy pasta is titled smile 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.280
 a smile is the most common expression of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.530
 happiness and joy that usually the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.320
 causes happy things like love 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.149
 friendship and companionship feelings 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.619
 that govern the soul of the human being and of 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.679
 all living beings on the planet 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.319
 including the pokemon but that's not 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.840
 more than an excuse a ridiculous excuse and 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.360
 meaningless I 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.850
 You want to know why my smile in 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.610
 you really want to know then I'll tell you 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.159
 I will tell a long time ago I lived and 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.440
 I was fighting with my coach he was a 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.409
 simple and simple person very happy and 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.600
 happy we were both traveling through the world of 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.480
 one place to another looking for battles against 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.640
 other coaches and their pokemon 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.830
 some battles will be arduous and 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.440
 difficult others will be simple and 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.990
 simple but little by little together we went 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.720
 improving until we become very strong 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.700
 but from the beginning I felt that something 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.430
 I was missing I felt incomplete 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.050
 I felt dissatisfied so I convinced 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.640
 to my coach to enter that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.830
 competition that he and the other humans 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.170
 they called pokemon league I did it thinking 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 that the emptiness I felt would disappear 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.730
 so we went from gym to gym 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.190
 challenging the leaders and winning medals 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.780
 but for every battle we had and the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.880
 compliments and congratulations 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.850
 we received from the leaders and their pokemon 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.580
 I felt more dissatisfied but 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.800
 finally we had achieved 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.480
 come to the pokemon league and for luck 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.670
 mine, we were the first to fight 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.250
 our first opponent was a girl 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.470
 with their bloat they did not represent a challenge 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.750
 for us so we win easily 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.390
 one after another the opponents we had 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.760
 they were defeated the competition was tough 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.760
 and there were formidable rivals but we could 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.069
 win we win the pokemon league 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.739
 but I still felt dissatisfied it was not 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.659
 enough needed something more once 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.819
 won the cup my coach and I 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.920
 we started the trip back home 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.019
 but on the way we find 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.810
 some strange men called themselves 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.390
 rocket team we had never heard 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.000
 of them but because of their appearance they seemed 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.250
 be similar to mag mag team one of 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.709
 them that apparently was their leader already 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.560
 that he dressed in an elegant and formal way 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.030
 approached my coach and told him 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.890
 boy we have been following you and 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.500
 we have noticed that you have a very pokemon 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.870
 strong so I would be very glad that I 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.940
 they delivered it my coach refused to 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.560
 accept what this man was proposing to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.959
 which reacted with a battle 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.450
 pokemon the man and his two henchmen 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.819
 they took three with two I got ready to 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.829
 face them alone so the three 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.470
 conduits attacked together making 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.620
 combined attacks attacked me from 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.540
 multiple addresses attacking non-stop 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.519
 I quickly take them away from me with a 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.190
 shadow ball but they kept attacking 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.500
 without stopping there was something in this battle that 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.150
 it made it different from the others I knew that 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.670
 there was something different in 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.500
 since I was finally enjoying the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.019
 battle like never before 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.030
 but from one moment to another one of the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.310
 condoms attacked my coach but I 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.650
 I managed to hit him with a shadow ball but 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.110
 from one instant to another everything turned red 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.329
 it was the blood of lyon dun what had 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.489
 killed that brought me a twisted 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.409
 fun and for a few moments there was 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.079
 forgotten the emptiness I felt inside 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.820
 me so without thinking twice I killed 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.340
 quickly to the other two with two 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.080
 remaining see the furious faces of the 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.240
 rocket team to see their valuable 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.270
 murdered pokemon I thought a whole 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.310
 comedy so why not I set out to 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.800
 kill the rocket team but my 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.780
 coach stopped me saying no what 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.449
 do you already win we do not have to do 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.150
 this you all you have is thirst for 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.760
 blood I can not allow you to do that 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.349
 then it just turns me from where 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.560
 was the thread attack with a ball 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.630
 shadow piercing his stomach he fell to the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.759
 I'm bleeding slowly until I create 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.770
 a huge pool of blood he looked at me 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.840
 fixedly with tears dripping from 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.360
 his eyes while saying to me with a voice 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.389
 weak 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.120
 I thought we were friends, those were his 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.729
 last words that I did what is it that 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.610
 I've done why I did not do it 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.039
 before poor naive see those tears 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.159
 It was totally fun to see how that 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.689
 poor naive gave his last sighs 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.060
 now there is no one who can stop my 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.430
 fun now I can play forever 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.710
 so I immediately went after him 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.069
 horrified rocket team shredding 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.599
 the slowly member to member 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:30.270
 devouring their miserable and rotten souls 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.039
 I realized how addictive and fun of 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.139
 the darkness and the conflict of the 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.689
 human feelings so I decided 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.360
 rot this world in darkness fill 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:41.129
 every corner every crack every heart of 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.800
 those negative feelings that the 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.259
 mortals call evil but it is not 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.090
 I need to make an effort at all 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.279
 that mortals are perverse by 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.460
 nature are nothing but losers 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.229
 arrogant or cowardly imbeciles they use 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.139
 these feelings as an excuse for 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.879
 to be able to shine their own evil 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.740
 thus creating misfortunes for their own 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.529
 and selfish desires that for some 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.349
 cause sad joy 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:09.229
 and it gives pain and love everything turning in a 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:12.019
 eternal endless cycle a vortex of chaos 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.239
 and dementia drowning in its own sea 

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:16.309
 anguish and suffering hate those 

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:19.009
 negative aspects that I like so much 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:21.529
 so I plant that chaos that madness 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.149
 everywhere I go and thanks to me 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.699
 hundreds of innocents have died 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:28.099
 cruelly pure souls have turned 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.959
 sadistic and perverse but what more 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.029
 enjoy is seeing the pain of children 

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:34.099
 which I take this suffering to see 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:36.079
 like your young and innocent minds 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:38.389
 they go mad because they can not handle what 

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:40.339
 I put anguish before their eyes 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.849
 who suffer makes their souls the 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:46.339
 more delicious to devour my reason not me 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.929
 I do not have pathetic excuses, I do it for 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:49.909
 the fact of being able to see that madness and 

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:52.069
 dementia that all humans have and 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.169
 living beings of this planet so that the 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:56.629
 blood drips from my hands and thus fill 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.649
 the heart of every man woman children and 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:00.049
 pokémons alike 

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:02.929
 corrupt those weak souls that at 

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:05.419
 end they become a delicious delicacy that 

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:07.399
 really it makes me feel very happy me 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.979
 it makes you feel happiness so great that 

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:10.610
 I can not stop smiling that emptiness that 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.520
 felt 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.319
 interior has gone has disappeared and 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.270
 all I had to do was spill 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:19.219
 a little blood maybe I'm 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.650
 rotting from the inside out but not 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:24.379
 I care what it is to continue 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.930
 seeing such a magnificent act but why 

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:29.689
 you're seeing me like that why do you think that 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.599
 from me do not make me laugh even if you deny it 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:35.419
 I know that you also have a dark side 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:37.789
 I know it I know it with certainty of nothing 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:39.650
 deny it just look inside you at the most 

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:42.349
 deep in your heart is that 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.449
 darkness longing to go out and have fun and 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:46.819
 I will be there waiting for that to happen 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:49.099
 since you have not seen the last of me 

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:51.759
 I'll be there waiting waiting with a 

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:51.759
 smile
