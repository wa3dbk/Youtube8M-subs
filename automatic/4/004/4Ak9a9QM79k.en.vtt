00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
that's looks likely whole line up there

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.609 
that's looks likely whole line up there
yeah<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.840> gotta<00:02:06.990> look<00:02:07.079> at<00:02:07.229> all<00:02:07.320> those<00:02:07.439> guys

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
that's that's pretty sweet so we got in

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.020 
that's that's pretty sweet so we got in
all<00:02:31.450> players<00:02:31.780> pack<00:02:32.170> two<00:02:32.950> gold<00:02:33.190> packs<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.820> a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
reward pack so let's start off small

assuming<00:02:40.240> because<00:02:40.450> it's<00:02:40.720> bronze<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:41.260> probably

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
assuming because it's bronze is probably

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500 
assuming because it's bronze is probably
the<00:02:41.710> least<00:02:42.460> out<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.910> all<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.060> them<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:46.420> this

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the least out of all of them I like this

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.610 
the least out of all of them I like this
little<00:02:46.660> animation<00:02:47.200> though<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:47.470> good

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
little animation though it's good

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:57.300

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
animation and what we have here it's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.930 
animation and what we have here it's
decent<00:02:57.850> striker<00:02:58.510> therefore<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.080> bronze<00:02:59.380> team

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
was expecting to say the least so we got

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.559 
was expecting to say the least so we got
a<00:05:52.779> centre-back<00:05:53.259> there<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.800> good<00:05:54.460> winger<00:05:54.819> uh<00:05:55.000> I

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
a centre-back there a good winger uh I

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.700 
a centre-back there a good winger uh I
like<00:05:55.960> that<00:05:56.110> we'll<00:05:56.919> use<00:05:57.159> him<00:05:57.400> definitely<00:05:57.639> and

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
like that we'll use him definitely and

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.110 
like that we'll use him definitely and
there<00:05:59.710> we<00:05:59.800> got<00:05:59.889> some<00:06:00.069> actual<00:06:00.250> contract<00:06:00.819> cards
