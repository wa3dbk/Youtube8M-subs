00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
like so and there's your courgette or

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.479 
like so and there's your courgette or
zucchini<00:02:50.660> seed<00:02:51.920> now<00:02:52.920> all<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.130> need<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.310> do

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
zucchini seed now all you need to do

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.360 
zucchini seed now all you need to do
with<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:54.170> what<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.200> generally<00:02:55.560> do<00:02:55.950> with<00:02:56.099> mine

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
with this what I generally do with mine

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.759 
with this what I generally do with mine
is<00:02:56.750> put<00:02:57.750> them<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.959> piece<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.290> paper<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
is put them on a piece of paper like a

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.140 
is put them on a piece of paper like a
piece<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.220> paper<00:02:59.459> toweling<00:02:59.880> works<00:03:00.269> quite<00:03:00.599> well

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
piece of paper toweling works quite well

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.570 
piece of paper toweling works quite well
put<00:03:03.150> them<00:03:03.269> at<00:03:03.390> separate<00:03:03.750> apart

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
put them at separate apart

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.979 
put them at separate apart
and<00:03:05.580> let<00:03:05.670> me<00:03:05.760> example<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.299> bit<00:03:06.510> better<00:03:06.630> so

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
and let me example this a bit better so

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.039 
and let me example this a bit better so
say<00:03:07.920> for<00:03:08.160> example<00:03:10.099> I've<00:03:11.099> got<00:03:11.459> my<00:03:11.580> piece<00:03:11.790> of

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
say for example I've got my piece of

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.390 
say for example I've got my piece of
tail<00:03:13.049> just<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:13.799> this<00:03:14.040> alright<00:03:15.000> sites<00:03:15.329> here

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
tail just like this alright sites here

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.699 
tail just like this alright sites here
now<00:03:17.400> what<00:03:17.609> I<00:03:17.640> do<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> seeds<00:03:18.480> I'll<00:03:19.109> place

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
now what I do with the seeds I'll place

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.870 
now what I do with the seeds I'll place
them<00:03:19.920> down<00:03:20.220> at<00:03:20.489> intervals<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.670> piece<00:03:23.850> of

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
them down at intervals on the piece of

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.960 
them down at intervals on the piece of
paper<00:03:24.150> say<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.350> say<00:03:25.620> three<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.250> do

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
paper say like so say three and do

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.479 
paper say like so say three and do
different<00:03:27.690> rows<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.350> might<00:03:28.470> get<00:03:28.560> 12<00:03:28.920> say

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
different rows so you might get 12 say

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.030 
different rows so you might get 12 say
on<00:03:29.609> this<00:03:29.700> piece<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.060> paper<00:03:30.709> let<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.799> dry<00:03:32.010> out

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
on this piece of paper let it dry out

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.220 
on this piece of paper let it dry out
out<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.880> direct<00:03:33.180> sunlight<00:03:33.329> now<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:33.959> actually

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
out of direct sunlight now I actually

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.650 
out of direct sunlight now I actually
had<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.590> article<00:03:35.430> published<00:03:35.790> recently<00:03:36.090> in

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
had a article published recently in

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.870 
had a article published recently in
grassroots<00:03:37.140> magazines<00:03:37.859> about<00:03:38.160> drying<00:03:38.459> things

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
grassroots magazines about drying things

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.150 
grassroots magazines about drying things
etc<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.660> there<00:03:40.079> was<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.230> typo<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:41.040> in

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
etc and there was a typo in it in

regards or in regards to drying herbs

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.059 
regards or in regards to drying herbs
but<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.359> did<00:03:45.510> mention<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.620> herb<00:03:46.829> should

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
but it did mention that the herb should

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.910 
but it did mention that the herb should
be<00:03:47.160> put<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.519> direct<00:03:47.910> sunlight<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.420> dry<00:03:48.769> which<00:03:49.769> I

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
be put in direct sunlight to dry which I

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.860 
be put in direct sunlight to dry which I
was<00:03:50.069> mortified<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:51.269> when<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.450> saw<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.720> because

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
was mortified at when I saw it because

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.199 
was mortified at when I saw it because
it's<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.230> typo<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.950> should<00:03:53.430> be<00:03:53.519> left<00:03:53.700> out<00:03:53.850> of

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
it's a typo that should be left out of

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.000 
it's a typo that should be left out of
direct<00:03:54.450> sunlight<00:03:54.720> they're<00:03:55.049> nice<00:03:55.260> dry<00:03:55.650> airy

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010

place<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.209> can<00:03:57.450> do<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:58.700> just<00:03:59.700> like<00:03:59.880> so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
place so you can do this just like so

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.840 
place so you can do this just like so
put<00:04:01.139> it<00:04:01.260> somewhere<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.829> just<00:04:01.980> let<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.160> dry<00:04:02.519> out

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
put it somewhere and just let it dry out

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.789 
put it somewhere and just let it dry out
just<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:03.150> its<00:04:03.299> own<00:04:03.420> like<00:04:03.750> on<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.930> bookshelf<00:04:04.200> or

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
just on its own like on a bookshelf or

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:05.780 
just on its own like on a bookshelf or
you<00:04:05.040> know<00:04:05.130> somewhere<00:04:05.400> out<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.549> direct

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
you know somewhere out of direct

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.000 
you know somewhere out of direct
sunlight<00:04:05.989> that'll<00:04:06.989> dry<00:04:07.200> out<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.680> when<00:04:07.920> the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
sunlight that'll dry out and when the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.190 
sunlight that'll dry out and when the
moisture<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.430> gone<00:04:08.639> you<00:04:09.359> can<00:04:09.510> fold<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:09.989> whole

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
moisture is gone you can fold this whole

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.410 
moisture is gone you can fold this whole
thing<00:04:10.410> up<00:04:10.560> or<00:04:10.709> roll<00:04:10.889> it<00:04:11.100> up<00:04:11.220> put<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.150> what

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
thing up or roll it up put it in it what

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.390 
thing up or roll it up put it in it what
I<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:12.930> put<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.319> an<00:04:13.410> envelope<00:04:13.560> then<00:04:14.370> I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
I do is I put it in an envelope then I

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.000 
I do is I put it in an envelope then I
just<00:04:14.579> put<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.850> aside<00:04:14.970> for<00:04:15.180> my<00:04:15.480> other<00:04:15.600> seeds

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
just put it aside for my other seeds

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.240 
just put it aside for my other seeds
next<00:04:17.010> year<00:04:17.190> when<00:04:17.370> I'm<00:04:17.459> going<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.639> plan

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
next year when I'm going to plan

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.510 
next year when I'm going to plan
zucchinis<00:04:19.090> again<00:04:19.420> I<00:04:19.630> just<00:04:20.220> unfold<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.340> piece

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
zucchinis again I just unfold the piece

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.970 
zucchinis again I just unfold the piece
of<00:04:21.670> paper<00:04:21.850> which<00:04:22.810> pretty<00:04:23.110> much<00:04:23.290> stays<00:04:23.560> intact

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
of paper which pretty much stays intact

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.150 
of paper which pretty much stays intact
because<00:04:24.670> it<00:04:24.760> hasn't<00:04:24.910> had<00:04:25.090> moisture<00:04:25.480> contact

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
because it hasn't had moisture contact

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.630 
because it hasn't had moisture contact
plant<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.310> into<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.640> ground<00:04:27.880> see<00:04:28.560> 20<00:04:29.560> mil<00:04:29.740> 25

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
plant it into the ground see 20 mil 25

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.120 
plant it into the ground see 20 mil 25
mil<00:04:30.880> dip<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.330> you'll<00:04:32.200> find<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.890> seeds

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
mil dip and you'll find that the seeds

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.510 
mil dip and you'll find that the seeds
will<00:04:33.280> just<00:04:33.430> come<00:04:33.580> up<00:04:33.700> nicely<00:04:34.030> evenly<00:04:34.870> spaced

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
will just come up nicely evenly spaced

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.390 
will just come up nicely evenly spaced
so<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.550> works<00:04:36.970> out<00:04:37.180> brilliantly<00:04:37.420> so<00:04:38.410> that's

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
so that works out brilliantly so that's

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.370 
so that works out brilliantly so that's
pretty<00:04:39.610> much<00:04:39.790> how<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.060> save<00:04:40.360> seeds<00:04:40.720> if<00:04:41.170> you

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
pretty much how to save seeds if you

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.640 
pretty much how to save seeds if you
don't<00:04:41.650> want<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.890> use<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.160> paper<00:04:42.370> towel<00:04:44.970> Theory

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
don't want to use the paper towel Theory

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.290 
don't want to use the paper towel Theory
what<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.740> can<00:04:47.950> do<00:04:48.130> is<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:49.060> put<00:04:49.240> the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
what you can do is just put the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.480 
what you can do is just put the
individual<00:04:49.780> seeds<00:04:50.080> if<00:04:50.290> you've<00:04:50.800> got<00:04:50.980> a<00:04:51.010> plastic

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
individual seeds if you've got a plastic

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.620 
individual seeds if you've got a plastic
tray<00:04:51.760> or<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:53.040> plastic<00:04:54.040> cutting<00:04:54.760> board<00:04:55.120> that

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
tray or a plastic cutting board that

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.420 
tray or a plastic cutting board that
works<00:04:55.840> brilliantly<00:04:56.170> because<00:04:56.890> they<00:04:57.040> tend<00:04:57.340> not

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
works brilliantly because they tend not

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.040 
works brilliantly because they tend not
to<00:04:57.580> stick<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.330> because<00:04:58.540> there's<00:04:58.690> no<00:04:58.840> kind

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
to stick to it because there's no kind

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.670 
to stick to it because there's no kind
of<00:04:59.340> adhesive<00:05:00.340> stick<00:05:00.990> process<00:05:01.990> going<00:05:02.230> on<00:05:02.440> and

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
of adhesive stick process going on and

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.960 
of adhesive stick process going on and
then<00:05:03.100> once<00:05:03.280> they've<00:05:03.460> dried<00:05:03.610> out<00:05:03.820> they

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
then once they've dried out they

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.000 
then once they've dried out they
generally<00:05:04.390> just<00:05:04.510> flick<00:05:04.810> off<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.800> then<00:05:05.920> you

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
generally just flick off and then you

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.070 
generally just flick off and then you
can<00:05:06.130> just<00:05:06.220> put<00:05:06.400> them<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.640> jar<00:05:06.910> or<00:05:07.270> whatever

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
can just put them in a jar or whatever

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.710 
can just put them in a jar or whatever
keep<00:05:09.070> until<00:05:09.310> next<00:05:09.460> year<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:10.000> moisture<00:05:10.570> that

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
keep until next year the moisture that

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.350 
keep until next year the moisture that
kills<00:05:11.020> them<00:05:11.230> and<00:05:11.380> creates<00:05:11.770> mold<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.640> they<00:05:13.150> go

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
kills them and creates mold and they go

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.790 
kills them and creates mold and they go
off<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:13.900> that's<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.170> main<00:05:14.380> thing<00:05:14.590> make<00:05:14.770> sure

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
off so that's the main thing make sure

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.700 
off so that's the main thing make sure
they<00:05:15.070> are<00:05:15.220> properly<00:05:15.520> dried<00:05:16.270> out<00:05:16.570> okay<00:05:17.050> but<00:05:17.500> not

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
they are properly dried out okay but not

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.440 
they are properly dried out okay but not
direct<00:05:18.040> sunlight<00:05:18.280> like<00:05:18.610> we're<00:05:18.790> in<00:05:18.910> today<00:05:19.060> just

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
check them so that's how to save seeds

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.630 
check them so that's how to save seeds
