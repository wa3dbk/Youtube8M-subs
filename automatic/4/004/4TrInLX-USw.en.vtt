00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 this year I use refrigeration 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.970
 setting something vault for 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.509
 low room temperature 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.509
 Here is a box hanging outside 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.789
 condensate must flow off somewhere 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.500
 electronic control allows 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.640
 set the temperature to the tenth 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.850
 degrees well and full automatic here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.890
 he defrosts himself as they say 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.180
 turned on 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.050
 set the temperature it works 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.020
 fully automatically me now 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.780
 Exposed + 6 degrees we difference 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.030
 interval works from 3 degrees 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.140
 when it reaches 9 degrees it turns on 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.350
 and 3 plus 6 will turn off 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.300
 the installation works like this 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.010
 so fast 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.600
 relatively quickly decreases 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.150
 the temperature inside the chamber is literally in 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.800
 for a few minutes the temperature 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.830
 drops nine to six degrees 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.650
 when large degrees compressor itself 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.720
 will turn off 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.720
 now let's wait a few seconds 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.719
 Well, he turned off but this green 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.470
 sensor shows what's inside working 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:44.320
 a fan inside the chamber 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.829
 unit and it turns out that this one 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.920
 fan from below drives the air inside 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.220
 cameras but here it comes out already 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.399
 chilled ie air outside is not 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.740
 sucked chases inside 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.869
 through this setup in a circle 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.920
 Well, there are times when this one 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:11.830
 the fan turns off completely we 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:18.360
 installation is resting here fan 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:21.900
 stopped and now there will be silence 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.019
 Such conditions are perfectly kept frame and 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.989
 pergolas and perga herself 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:36.609
 I'm storing apples and all that 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:38.530
 it pleases the bags when the wax drown and then no one 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:43.120
 the same mole can be got, that is, everything is all 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.209
 Everything here I have is stored 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.380
 characteristics of this unit to whom 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.380
 interesting can read 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.330
 such installations and 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.310
 different characteristics of my case can 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.500
 set the temperature to minus five 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:13.269
 degrees well and they are designed for different 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.959
 volume so everyone can choose in 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.140
 depending on your sata repository 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:24.790
 suitable installation is controlled by all 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.000
 easy and affordable here I again exhibit 6 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.000
 degrees 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.040
 but now there is a temperature of eight 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.980
 half anyway on large 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.970
 apiaries, I recommend to pay attention 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.970
 on such equipment
