hello and welcome to the underground
game<00:00:08.920> design<00:00:09.340> course<00:00:09.700> today<00:00:10.389> I'm<00:00:10.539> going<00:00:10.570> to<00:00:10.809> be

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
game design course today I'm going to be

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.240 
game design course today I'm going to be
looking<00:00:11.049> at<00:00:11.410> some<00:00:11.769> of<00:00:11.799> the<00:00:11.920> differences

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
looking at some of the differences

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.220 
looking at some of the differences
between<00:00:12.430> the<00:00:12.910> unreal<00:00:13.299> development<00:00:13.420> kit<00:00:13.840> and

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
between the unreal development kit and

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.670 
between the unreal development kit and
unreal<00:00:15.160> tournament<00:00:15.309> 3<00:00:16.109> now<00:00:17.109> you'll<00:00:17.470> notice

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
unreal tournament 3 now you'll notice

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.040 
unreal tournament 3 now you'll notice
that<00:00:17.920> we're<00:00:18.340> using<00:00:18.580> the<00:00:19.090> unreal<00:00:19.930> development

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
that we're using the unreal development

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.429 
that we're using the unreal development
kit<00:00:20.439> or<00:00:20.769> UDK<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:22.390> the<00:00:22.599> basis<00:00:22.929> of<00:00:23.050> all<00:00:23.169> of<00:00:23.320> our

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
kit or UDK as the basis of all of our

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.749 
kit or UDK as the basis of all of our
projects<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.269> what<00:00:25.630> reason<00:00:26.019> do<00:00:26.769> we<00:00:26.800> have<00:00:27.099> for

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
projects so what reason do we have for

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.030 
projects so what reason do we have for
using<00:00:28.300> UDK<00:00:28.779> over<00:00:29.739> the<00:00:30.099> editor<00:00:30.609> that<00:00:30.880> comes

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
using UDK over the editor that comes

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.540 
using UDK over the editor that comes
standard<00:00:33.040> with<00:00:33.100> unreal<00:00:33.850> tournament<00:00:34.060> 3<00:00:35.550> all

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
standard with unreal tournament 3 all

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.400 
standard with unreal tournament 3 all
right<00:00:36.760> here<00:00:37.030> we<00:00:37.060> have<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.600> unreal

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
right here we have the unreal

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.290 
right here we have the unreal
development<00:00:38.620> kit<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:41.110> should<00:00:41.290> all<00:00:41.440> be

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
development kit you should all be

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.060 
development kit you should all be
getting<00:00:43.300> slightly<00:00:43.660> familiar<00:00:43.900> with<00:00:44.320> this<00:00:44.530> with

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
getting slightly familiar with this with

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.680 
getting slightly familiar with this with
this<00:00:45.900> particular<00:00:46.900> interface<00:00:47.580> so<00:00:48.580> let's<00:00:49.510> have

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
this particular interface so let's have

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.530 
this particular interface so let's have
a<00:00:49.750> look<00:00:49.840> at<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.470> Unreal<00:00:51.310> editor<00:00:51.850> for<00:00:52.390> the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
a look at the Unreal editor for the

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.900 
a look at the Unreal editor for the
Unreal<00:00:53.110> Tournament<00:00:53.170> 3<00:00:53.620> engine<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:56.310> yes<00:00:57.310> this

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
Unreal Tournament 3 engine now yes this

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.780 
Unreal Tournament 3 engine now yes this
is<00:00:58.350> actually<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.380> different<00:01:00.010> program<00:01:00.220> to<00:01:00.670> the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
is actually a different program to the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.460 
is actually a different program to the
to<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.120> one<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:01.540> you<00:01:01.690> were<00:01:01.870> looking<00:01:02.200> at

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
to the one that you were looking at

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.780 
to the one that you were looking at
before<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.820> just<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.860> cursory<00:01:06.579> glance

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
before but just from a cursory glance

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.520 
before but just from a cursory glance
you<00:01:07.119> can<00:01:07.299> see<00:01:07.570> that<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.700> actual

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you can see that the the actual

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.120 
you can see that the the actual
interface<00:01:11.530> is<00:01:12.010> very<00:01:12.220> similar<00:01:12.790> in<00:01:13.659> fact<00:01:14.130> at

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
interface is very similar in fact at

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.980 
interface is very similar in fact at
first<00:01:15.460> glance<00:01:15.610> it<00:01:16.060> might<00:01:16.540> even<00:01:16.780> look

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
first glance it might even look

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.350 
first glance it might even look
identical<00:01:17.230> there<00:01:18.070> are<00:01:18.220> some<00:01:18.460> small

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
identical there are some small

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.469 
identical there are some small
differences<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:21.040> order<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.090> buttons

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
differences the order of the buttons

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.180 
differences the order of the buttons
above<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.930> viewport<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.530> number<00:01:23.830> of<00:01:23.950> buttons

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
above the viewport the number of buttons

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.580 
above the viewport the number of buttons
over<00:01:24.850> here<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.570> toolbox<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.320> along<00:01:26.500> the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
over here in the toolbox and along the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.969 
over here in the toolbox and along the
toolbar<00:01:27.040> at<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.250> top<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:29.380> for<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.710> most<00:01:29.890> part

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
toolbar at the top but for the most part

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.000 
toolbar at the top but for the most part
these<00:01:30.909> buttons<00:01:31.330> do<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.350> same<00:01:32.590> thing<00:01:32.890> they

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
these buttons do the same thing they

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.469 
these buttons do the same thing they
have<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.220> same<00:01:33.430> functionality<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.299> both

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
have the same functionality in both

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.920 
have the same functionality in both
programs<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.190> question<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:36.760> why<00:01:37.420> would

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
programs so the question is why would

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.570 
programs so the question is why would
you<00:01:38.140> choose<00:01:38.440> udk<00:01:39.370> over<00:01:40.360> unreal<00:01:41.229> tournament<00:01:41.380> 3

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.980 

well<00:01:45.580> one<00:01:46.150> of<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.299> main<00:01:46.450> differences<00:01:46.930> between

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
well one of the main differences between

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.359 
well one of the main differences between
UDK<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.070> ut3<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:49.540> least<00:01:49.840> from<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.320> poor<00:01:50.860> and

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
UDK and ut3 at least from a poor and

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.920 
UDK and ut3 at least from a poor and
underprivileged<00:01:51.790> students<00:01:52.360> point<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.780> view

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
underprivileged students point of view

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.789 
underprivileged students point of view
is<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:54.150> udk<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:55.659> free<00:01:57.030> now<00:01:58.799> unreal

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
is that udk is free now unreal

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.170 
is that udk is free now unreal
tournament<00:02:00.070> is<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.710> does<00:02:02.979> cost<00:02:03.220> money<00:02:03.460> but<00:02:03.729> it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
tournament is it does cost money but it

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.000 
tournament is it does cost money but it
doesn't<00:02:04.510> cost<00:02:04.720> as<00:02:04.990> much<00:02:05.020> money<00:02:05.380> as<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.590> used<00:02:05.890> to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
doesn't cost as much money as it used to

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.630 
doesn't cost as much money as it used to

some cases as little as thirty dollars
you<00:02:16.090> can<00:02:16.120> get<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.980> from

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
you can get it from

you can get it from
well<00:02:19.580> i'm<00:02:19.730> not<00:02:19.880> sure<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.270> still<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.840> but

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
you used to be able to get it off steam

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.050 
you used to be able to get it off steam
and<00:02:24.070> play<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.100> downloadable<00:02:25.730> copy<00:02:26.980> for<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.310> very

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
and play a downloadable copy for a very

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.670 
and play a downloadable copy for a very
small<00:02:29.270> amount<00:02:29.570> of<00:02:29.660> money<00:02:29.840> some<00:02:30.140> sometimes

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
small amount of money some sometimes

unreal tournament three four is just so
that<00:06:42.420> you<00:06:42.510> have<00:06:42.690> a<00:06:42.900> largest<00:06:43.410> selection<00:06:43.830> of

weapons well there's more to it than

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.720 
weapons well there's more to it than
that<00:06:47.100> because<00:06:47.880> not<00:06:48.210> only<00:06:48.890> do<00:06:49.890> you<00:06:49.920> have<00:06:50.220> access

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
that because not only do you have access

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.920 
that because not only do you have access
to<00:06:50.760> those<00:06:51.030> weapons<00:06:51.270> right<00:06:51.600> from<00:06:51.750> the<00:06:51.870> start

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
to those weapons right from the start

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.990 
to those weapons right from the start
you<00:06:52.200> also<00:06:52.500> have<00:06:52.650> access<00:06:52.860> to<00:06:53.310> the<00:06:53.430> code<00:06:53.730> for

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
you also have access to the code for

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.400 
you also have access to the code for
those<00:06:54.150> weapons<00:06:54.410> so<00:06:55.410> say<00:06:55.950> you<00:06:56.010> wanted<00:06:56.580> to

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
those weapons so say you wanted to

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.310 
those weapons so say you wanted to
create<00:06:58.410> a<00:06:58.440> gun<00:06:58.830> that<00:06:58.860> uses<00:06:59.610> the<00:07:00.390> the

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
create a gun that uses the the

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.740 
create a gun that uses the the
projectile<00:07:01.860> of<00:07:02.010> the<00:07:02.130> bio<00:07:02.340> rifle<00:07:02.970> or<00:07:03.120> uses<00:07:03.600> that

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
projectile of the bio rifle or uses that

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.770 
projectile of the bio rifle or uses that
sort<00:07:04.080> of<00:07:04.140> functionality<00:07:05.180> perhaps<00:07:06.180> instead<00:07:06.600> of

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
sort of functionality perhaps instead of

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.830 
sort of functionality perhaps instead of
causing<00:07:07.050> damage<00:07:07.620> you<00:07:08.160> want<00:07:08.370> a<00:07:08.580> bio<00:07:09.150> rifle<00:07:09.720> that

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
causing damage you want a bio rifle that

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.650 
causing damage you want a bio rifle that
fires<00:07:10.170> blue<00:07:10.830> goop<00:07:11.070> instead<00:07:11.820> of<00:07:11.940> green<00:07:12.360> goop

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
fires blue goop instead of green goop

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.670 
fires blue goop instead of green goop
and<00:07:13.190> and<00:07:14.190> it<00:07:14.400> freezes<00:07:15.080> players<00:07:16.080> when<00:07:16.650> they

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
and and it freezes players when they

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.720 
and and it freezes players when they
touch<00:07:16.980> it<00:07:17.720> well<00:07:18.720> if<00:07:19.440> you<00:07:19.950> are<00:07:20.100> going<00:07:20.460> to<00:07:20.580> do

touch it well if you are going to do

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.940 
touch it well if you are going to do
that<00:07:20.880> in<00:07:21.000> UDK<00:07:21.510> you'd<00:07:21.810> have<00:07:22.020> to<00:07:22.200> find<00:07:22.620> all<00:07:22.830> the

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.190 
code from that in ut3 you'd have to port

code from that in ut3 you'd have to port
it<00:07:26.310> across<00:07:26.640> you'd<00:07:27.330> have<00:07:27.540> to<00:07:27.780> get<00:07:28.140> it<00:07:28.260> to<00:07:28.500> to
