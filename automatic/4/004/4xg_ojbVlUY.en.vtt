00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.270
 and what's up, people I'm watered her and we're 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.100
 back in modern warfare 3 and in this 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.620
 occasion we go to the top map for 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.019
 show you another kind of let's say that of 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.099
 demonic head and good as always 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.650
 before starting as the video and the 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.390
 he tried explaining could you could 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.950
 relate a little to the subject 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.270
 illuminati for the satanic subject as in 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.070
 most of the videos in which 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.890
 Devils appear because it's the usual 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.290
 the illuminatis are satanic and they 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.580
 can relate a little to that subject and 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.410
 well first of all I also want 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.149
 thank you all for everything that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.260
 you are helping with this series because the 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.149
 The truth is that the quantity is incredible 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.120
 of messages that you send me all 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.949
 days for youtube for tuenti 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.870
 facebook everywhere and the truth is 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.730
 I am very happy to see that 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.710
 you collaborate and that you like so nothing 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.629
 thank you for the truth because it is 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.510
 one of the things that motivates me to follow 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.429
 doing this kind of series of videos 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.109
 so well nothing we are already in this 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.989
 room is where this is 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.579
 sort of devil idea and here is the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.530
 drawing you see it well is a kind of 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.999
 how a skull looks a bit like 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.350
 although good depends how it looks can 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.570
 look like a physical face rather than a 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.369
 I do not know if you understand me, well, it's good 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.080
 a kind of arrows crossed by the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.580
 back I do not know very well what he wants 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.440
 saying this the truth is that it gives you many 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.170
 turns and I have not found any 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.729
 relationship but not what I found in 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.860
 the reaction sorry with the subject 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.149
 Illuminati is this from here and look very 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.720
 good face, you can see that it is not 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.430
 face 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.039
 let's say that very happy is rather a 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.320
 little diabolical to say it of some 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.119
 way and well the interesting point is 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.850
 on the sides as you can always see 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.009
 here we are aiming well has a 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.440
 kind of horn because the truth is 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.640
 which has very in the form of an aspect of 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.289
 good horn on one side the side 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.330
 left and also on the right side 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.220
 as you see and good as always with that 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.130
 you can relate this to the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.630
 illuminati theme on the part of which are 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.789
 satanic as I say in all the videos 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.860
 the emigrants are satanic this in case 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.390
 Some do not believe me or you want to confirm 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.250
 with you you can search it in google 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.289
 on youtube you will see many videos 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.560
 where can you find it so nothing 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.299
 basically this because they put it then I 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.490
 honestly I do not know why they put it not 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.500
 I have never spoken with a definitive law 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.570
 neither activation nor anything 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.890
 well, I'll upload a video soon 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.080
 my personal opinion which is what I 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.480
 I think about this issue of importing 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.280
 these things in video games and nothing 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.600
 practically up to here the video as 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.980
 I always hope you liked life 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.890
 favorite you know how it helps a lot 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.480
 very much and nothing we see in the next 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.070
 remember also that if you want 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.570
 participate in the next episode of 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.490
 questions and answers you can do it 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.290
 by twitter with the hashtag question for 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.000
 risk there you can ask me what 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.760
 you want and nothing I think 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.800
 someday I will get to exploit the c4 to the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.090
 first but not while I'm going to continue 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.290
 trying it so I do not expect anything that you 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.130
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.130
 goodbye
