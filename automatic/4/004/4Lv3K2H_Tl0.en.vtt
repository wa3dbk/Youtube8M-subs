00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
primer is huge like red flag to me um I

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.900 
primer is huge like red flag to me um I
don't<00:04:37.840> know<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.260> just<00:04:38.350> as<00:04:38.770> very<00:04:39.550> pumped<00:04:39.730> about

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
don't know I just as very pumped about

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.840 
don't know I just as very pumped about
it<00:04:40.060> um<00:04:40.800> but<00:04:41.800> I'm<00:04:41.920> still<00:04:42.130> gonna<00:04:42.250> keep<00:04:42.520> using<00:04:42.670> it

because it's the most beautiful color
better<00:04:44.170> at<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:45.490> second<00:04:46.480> product<00:04:46.690> would<00:04:47.080> be<00:04:47.140> the

jeans<00:04:50.050> on<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.830> guess<00:04:51.640> I'll<00:04:51.820> compare<00:04:52.210> both<00:04:53.110> of

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.810 
jeans on I guess I'll compare both of
them<00:04:53.470> next<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.860> each<00:04:53.920> other<00:04:54.100> um<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.800> buxom<00:04:57.580> is

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
them next to each other um the buxom is

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.060

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
it as a base it um it's a little too

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.560 
it as a base it um it's a little too
much<00:05:53.200> for<00:05:53.530> an<00:05:53.590> all-over<00:05:53.770> like<00:05:54.280> color<00:05:54.520> in<00:05:54.850> just

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
much for an all-over like color in just

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.460 
much for an all-over like color in just
for<00:05:55.720> my<00:05:55.840> stellar<00:05:56.200> skin<00:05:56.560> um<00:05:57.510> it<00:05:58.510> has<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:59.050> sneaky

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
for my stellar skin um it has the sneaky

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.020 
for my stellar skin um it has the sneaky
clear<00:05:59.710> base<00:05:59.950> like<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.310> other<00:06:00.430> one<00:06:00.640> but<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.820> feel

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
clear base like the other one but I feel

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.020 
clear base like the other one but I feel
like<00:06:01.060> it's<00:06:01.300> not<00:06:01.450> as<00:06:01.600> bad<00:06:01.840> because<00:06:02.830> it's<00:06:03.220> the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
like it's not as bad because it's the

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.660 
like it's not as bad because it's the
circumference<00:06:04.480> of<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.780> circle<00:06:04.810> of<00:06:05.140> larger<00:06:05.670> um

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
circumference of the circle of larger um

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.990 
circumference of the circle of larger um
and<00:06:08.550> honestly<00:06:09.750> um<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:11.710> this<00:06:12.100> base<00:06:12.340> is<00:06:12.370> larger

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
and honestly um the this base is larger

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.890 
and honestly um the this base is larger
but<00:06:13.350> they<00:06:14.350> have<00:06:14.500> like<00:06:14.680> the<00:06:14.830> same<00:06:15.540> height<00:06:16.540> of

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
but they have like the same height of

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.510 
but they have like the same height of
eyeshadow<00:06:17.290> in<00:06:17.530> them<00:06:17.710> so<00:06:17.980> this<00:06:18.190> one<00:06:18.370> I<00:06:18.400> think

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
eyeshadow in them so this one I think

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.950 
eyeshadow in them so this one I think
definitely<00:06:18.910> has<00:06:19.270> more<00:06:19.450> I<00:06:19.510> wish<00:06:19.720> I<00:06:19.810> would<00:06:19.930> have
