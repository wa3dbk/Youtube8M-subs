00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.740
 Welcome to another review in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.450
 our channel today again because 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.040
 the small hover tripod that I once 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.450
 have shown in an unboxing for you 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.590
 I've done the effort and one 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.269
 few made any recordings for you 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.040
 I have the tripod now 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.719
 some have some use some time 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.369
 positive things also a few 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.810
 little things that are not so good 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.699
 but it is a good thing 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.960
 Tripod is really well built 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.850
 as you can see, it really is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.560
 Everything made of metal and everything really 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.390
 nice grip and it really makes a lot 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.470
 so much fun to work further 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.119
 we still have a small spirit level 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.099
 which is integrated and of course the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.749
 put off before adjusting screw for the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.249
 Cameras when screwing I have to 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:38.940
 say that is unfortunately negative 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:41.969
 noticed at a nikon 5200 country 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.139
 Unfortunately, the pilot hole does not mean that 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.210
 I always have such a small one 

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:46.859
 washer in between to create 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.809
 That's right for two of my gopro 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.569
 Again, that does not really mean it 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.369
 Depends on what kind of camera you have 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:55.049
 In any case, the 5200 is like that 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.299
 that in any case slight problems 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.249
 otherwise it can happen 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.479
 Tripod before processing really 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.879
 top you can that's really 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.650
 some poses and everything is out of it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.789
 really well balanced when you are 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.289
 a bit hard and that 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.700
 really everything is already balanced 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.740
 and everything needs to be beautiful 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.299
 setup to my setup and getting one 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.750
 slightly the weight slightly to the left 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.789
 and push left up and is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.890
 then tighten around the 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.780
 compensate for a pivoting 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.429
 display otherwise really happens 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.409
 Totally you can really very soft 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.890
 Movements with it are very much because of me 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.460
 the camera 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.109
 Camera is running to perform the gopro 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.939
 fits in very well as well 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.159
 can and through this moving 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.350
 Kugelkopf it is really total 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.200
 can really be used flexibly 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.969
 move very freely without big 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.840
 Of course it must be clear 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.030
 you look at it a bit more 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.460
 Exercise steadycam to run properly 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.929
 but there is also the little one 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.969
 spirit level would really be a small one 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.950
 help you really always ready 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.569
 You can really do the weights too 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.369
 very easy dusting shows more important 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.810
 are really totally easy you can do that 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.240
 a lot of weight to do as you need 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.389
 and if it is supposedly too much 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 then lose weight again or 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.579
 Another must I give to do 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.190
 I am very good 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.890
 if necessary but otherwise everything fits 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.540
 and as I said of the quality would have 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.269
 really top so there I have none 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.829
 A shaky that really has everything super 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.170
 works and really everything 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.359
 very clean we saw that was too 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.219
 show by and large of the small one 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.109
 review by me of course you have it 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.909
 a really good buy recommendation me 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.680
 Hope, of course , gives us that 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.450
