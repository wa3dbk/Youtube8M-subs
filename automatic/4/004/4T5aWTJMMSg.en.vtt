 requests then see how it is 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 possible to do it in an institution of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.870
 dermatology of a large hospital 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.420
 Roman to totally erase a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.040
 dark period of my life is one thing 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.830
 as belonging or what they are 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.220
 now they are repented the tattoo 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 1 out of 3 tired after a while I think about it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
 the most difficult tattoos to eliminate are 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.609
 definitely professional tattoos 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 as in our case of emiliano these 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.500
 tattoos have a large amount of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.059
 pigment the pd wind is fed into 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 depth in the dermis 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.860
 moreover they are often colored as in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.559
 this case is more colors there is red 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 yellow and green which are difficult colors 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.149
 to remove tribal ones with color 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.160
 unique the most superficial amateur ones 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.870
 give as there is less wire to the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 dermatologist who besides having the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.440
 suitable tools to delete them can 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.809
 face them in the best way 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.629
 any allergies or side effects 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.609
 currently lasers are used e 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.410
 the others are on the sidelines that happens 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.470
 they pool that extremely high 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.360
 power in the order of nanoseconds in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.820
 so as not to damage the tissues 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.240
 surrounding and therefore not to be provoked 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.560
 enrico scarring is felt pain and no 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.390
 a light flea god is like a needle 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.640
 inside, however, the beauty is no longer strong in 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.799
 also painful of the world I did it yes 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.900
 can apply a local anesthetic for 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.270
 relieving discomfort is necessary 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.860
 from 6 to 10 sessions, and if the tattoo 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.659
 of medium size but between 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.710
 another application is needed 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.509
 spend at least a month 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.430
 therefore for the more elaborate the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.470
 treatment can last for years 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 after the right treatment in the stool 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.850
 side effects first of all 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.220
 a redness of the treated part a 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.619
 bulge and the formation of small 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.810
 caves that usually disappear in 7 10 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.540
 days after tattoo removal 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.860
 small scars may remain 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.050
 or they can stay 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.330
 the areas of epochs feeding olic e 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.580
 therefore mentazione ie of the more zones 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.590
 light or darker than the skin if di 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.220
 forehead spontaneously resolve in the turn 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.220
 a few months
