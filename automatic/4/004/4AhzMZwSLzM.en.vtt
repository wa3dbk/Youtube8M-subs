00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
literally famous and I think that's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.180

completely<00:03:21.959> wrong<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.620> know<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.860> doesn't<00:03:23.010> have

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
completely wrong I know it doesn't have

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.100

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
a lot to do with con control but I think

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.470 
a lot to do with con control but I think
it's<00:03:25.230> completely<00:03:25.410> wrong<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.610> make<00:03:27.269> these

they<00:03:32.760> were<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.269> way<00:03:33.360> they<00:03:33.390> work<00:03:33.630> um<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.590> think

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
they were the way they work um I think

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.130 
they were the way they work um I think
that<00:03:35.220> more<00:03:35.459> needs<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.880> go<00:03:36.060> into<00:03:36.269> preventing

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
that more needs to go into preventing

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.440 
that more needs to go into preventing
this<00:03:37.320> type<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.620> stuff<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.220> not<00:03:38.430> celebrating<00:03:39.299> I

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
this type of stuff and not celebrating I

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.699 
this type of stuff and not celebrating I
don't<00:03:39.630> obviously<00:03:40.049> they<00:03:40.170> weren't<00:03:40.290> celebrating

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
don't obviously they weren't celebrating

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.699 
don't obviously they weren't celebrating
it<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:42.269> can<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.570> put<00:03:43.110> those<00:03:43.290> people<00:03:43.560> in

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
it but you can just put those people in

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.770 
it but you can just put those people in
the<00:03:43.830> limelight<00:03:44.040> because<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.269> think<00:03:45.690> it

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the limelight because it I think it

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.750 
the limelight because it I think it
ignites<00:03:46.170> something<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.950> other<00:03:47.100> people<00:03:47.549> that

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
ignites something and other people that

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.320 
ignites something and other people that
makes<00:03:48.030> them<00:03:48.330> want<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.610> follow<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.790> path<00:03:51.090> i

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
makes them want to follow that path i

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.199 
makes them want to follow that path i
guess<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.890> as<00:03:52.890> far<00:03:53.160> as<00:03:53.280> how<00:03:53.430> easy<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.030> to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
guess and as far as how easy it is to

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.180 
guess and as far as how easy it is to
get<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.420> gun<00:03:54.630> in<00:03:54.750> America<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.680> one<00:03:55.920> thing

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
get a gun in America that is one thing

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.979 
get a gun in America that is one thing
that<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.400> think<00:03:56.730> should<00:03:57.030> change<00:03:57.360> do<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.630> think

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
that I think should change do I think

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.130 
that I think should change do I think
people's<00:03:58.769> weapons<00:03:59.340> should<00:03:59.549> be<00:03:59.700> taken<00:04:00.060> away<00:04:00.150> no

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
people's weapons should be taken away no

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.360 
people's weapons should be taken away no
I<00:04:01.500> believe<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.400> Second<00:04:02.760> Amendment<00:04:02.820> and

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
I believe in the Second Amendment and

I believe in the Second Amendment and
obviously<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.549> Second<00:04:05.880> Amendment<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.330> like

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
obviously the Second Amendment is like

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.470 
obviously the Second Amendment is like
200<00:04:06.989> plus<00:04:07.140> years<00:04:07.380> old<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.480> obviously

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
200 plus years old and it's obviously

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.509 
200 plus years old and it's obviously
times<00:04:09.810> have<00:04:10.019> changed<00:04:10.530> i<00:04:10.680> mean<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.040> second

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
times have changed i mean the second

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.830 
times have changed i mean the second
amendment<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:11.910> actually<00:04:12.299> if<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.450> read<00:04:12.690> it

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
amendment is actually if you read it

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.590 
amendment is actually if you read it
it's<00:04:12.989> about<00:04:13.400> having<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.610> right<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.970> bear<00:04:15.180> arms

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
it's about having the right to bear arms

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.659 
it's about having the right to bear arms
and<00:04:15.810> start<00:04:16.290> your<00:04:16.440> own<00:04:16.620> militia<00:04:16.890> or<00:04:17.400> whatever

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
and start your own militia or whatever

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.069 
and start your own militia or whatever
and<00:04:17.820> be<00:04:17.940> able<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.150> fight<00:04:18.600> in<00:04:18.750> your<00:04:18.870> little

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
and be able to fight in your little

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.400 
and be able to fight in your little
group<00:04:19.350> or<00:04:19.680> whatever<00:04:19.799> but<00:04:20.160> um<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.150> think<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.200> gun

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
group or whatever but um I think the gun

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.460 
group or whatever but um I think the gun
laws<00:04:22.560> now<00:04:22.890> they<00:04:23.370> they<00:04:23.850> should<00:04:23.880> be<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.690> think

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
laws now they they should be I think

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.409 
laws now they they should be I think
they<00:04:25.620> could<00:04:25.770> be<00:04:25.800> more<00:04:26.040> strict<00:04:26.400> do<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.150> think

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
they could be more strict do I think

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.880 
they could be more strict do I think
people<00:04:27.570> should<00:04:27.720> not<00:04:27.960> be<00:04:28.140> able<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.410> get<00:04:28.650> a

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
people should not be able to get a

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.240 
people should not be able to get a
certain<00:04:29.820> guns<00:04:30.030> no<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.660> think<00:04:31.289> that<00:04:31.470> if<00:04:31.650> you're<00:04:31.890> a

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
certain guns no I think that if you're a

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.890 
certain guns no I think that if you're a
person<00:04:32.550> who<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.390> sane<00:04:34.200> and

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
you know I think that it's not a bad

things should be done in the lines of

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.480 
things should be done in the lines of
preventing<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.820> depression<00:05:04.780> suicide<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:06.039> and

preventing a depression suicide and and
just<00:05:07.060> overall<00:05:07.590> analyzing<00:05:08.590> these<00:05:08.740> people<00:05:09.190> that

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
just overall analyzing these people that

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.070 
just overall analyzing these people that
are<00:05:09.460> buying<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.910> guns<00:05:10.120> because<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.690> don't

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
are buying the guns because I don't

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.529 
are buying the guns because I don't
think<00:05:11.139> it's<00:05:11.350> fair<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.620> take<00:05:11.979> away<00:05:12.310> guns<00:05:12.539> from

think it's fair to take away guns from

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.390 
think it's fair to take away guns from
99<00:05:14.050> percent<00:05:14.410> of<00:05:14.500> people<00:05:14.590> just<00:05:14.919> because<00:05:15.070> of

99 percent of people just because of

99 percent of people just because of

that less than one percent that fucked

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.900 
that less than one percent that fucked
it<00:05:17.740> up<00:05:17.830> for<00:05:17.889> everybody<00:05:18.070> you<00:05:18.460> know<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:18.669> don't

it up for everybody you know I don't

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.779 
it up for everybody you know I don't
think<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:19.300> that's<00:05:19.449> necessarily<00:05:19.810> right<00:05:20.789> but

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
think that that's necessarily right but

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.219 
think that that's necessarily right but
I<00:05:21.820> think<00:05:21.910> more<00:05:22.240> could<00:05:22.479> be<00:05:22.600> done<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.050> line

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
I think more could be done in the line

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.520 
I think more could be done in the line

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.960 
shoot up an elementary score something
like<00:05:47.380> I'm<00:05:48.010> not<00:05:48.220> sure<00:05:48.430> how<00:05:48.580> that<00:05:48.729> would<00:05:48.789> really

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
like I'm not sure how that would really

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.210 
like I'm not sure how that would really
work<00:05:49.090> but<00:05:49.660> at<00:05:49.870> least<00:05:49.990> it's<00:05:50.260> a<00:05:50.349> step<00:05:51.010> in<00:05:51.159> the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
work but at least it's a step in the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.490 
work but at least it's a step in the
right<00:05:51.430> direction<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:52.210> obviously<00:05:52.659> I<00:05:53.080> actually

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
right direction and obviously I actually

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.219 
right direction and obviously I actually
heard<00:05:53.889> that<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:55.060> guy<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.479> did<00:05:55.960> the

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
heard that the the guy that did the

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.529 
heard that the the guy that did the
horrible<00:05:56.800> Sandy<00:05:57.280> Hook<00:05:57.400> shooting<00:05:57.550> um<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.360> heard

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
horrible Sandy Hook shooting um I heard

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.719 
horrible Sandy Hook shooting um I heard
the<00:05:58.720> guns<00:05:58.960> weren't<00:05:59.260> even<00:05:59.440> his<00:05:59.650> and<00:06:00.280> I<00:06:00.490> think

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
the guns weren't even his and I think

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.070 
the guns weren't even his and I think
that<00:06:00.849> it's<00:06:01.000> very<00:06:01.060> important<00:06:01.750> to<00:06:01.780> have<00:06:02.020> people

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
that it's very important to have people

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.750 
that it's very important to have people
lock<00:06:02.620> up<00:06:02.860> their<00:06:03.010> guns<00:06:03.190> I<00:06:03.430> think<00:06:03.639> it's

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
lock up their guns I think it's

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.430 
lock up their guns I think it's
important<00:06:04.240> for<00:06:04.330> every<00:06:04.599> gun<00:06:04.870> owner<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.229> have<00:06:05.409> a

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
important for every gun owner to have a

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.040 
important for every gun owner to have a
safe<00:06:05.770> with<00:06:06.099> with<00:06:06.699> a<00:06:06.729> password<00:06:07.030> that<00:06:07.330> only<00:06:07.690> they
