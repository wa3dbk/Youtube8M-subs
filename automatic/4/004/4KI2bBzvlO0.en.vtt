00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.170
 hello my favorite viewers today 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.699
 we will make mittens from the old jumper 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.380
 First of all we do such a stencil 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:38.510
 we lead the pencil and somewhere on 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.559
 centimeter we will increase this size 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.559
 so take on the hunt 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:57.650
 introduced 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:59.410
 and now we take scissors and this one is ours 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.990
 stencil 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.890
 cut it we will need in order 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.620
 to attach to the old jumper 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.700
 jumper desirable to take so warm 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.980
 mittens but they were warm here 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.020
 stencil here is my jigurda 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:24.650
 I lay around and we have the body of evil I'm fed up 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.330
 he is made of wool and plus there in my angorka 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.479
 just the risks will be warm 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.520
 we put our stencil 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.460
 You see, the child's riven kashuba 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.720
 a little more what our mittens were 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.140
 longer so that they are still warmer 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.600
 our pen was protected by the cold 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.660
 we fix with 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.000
 Needles so that a hook doesn't hover on astra 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.310
 I do not have time so it will be more convenient 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.840
 3 not so I fix not because so 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.410
 more conveniently we straighten everything and now 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 begin to fly cut we will leave 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:14.070
 somewhere one centimeter is to 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.330
 how do you say you decide that's here is here 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.330
 the distance is about one centimeter 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.500
 so we fly 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.629
 and then give a finger neatly cut out 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.260
 so now we take the second part yukata 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.750
 jumper back and we will 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.569
 only apply a stencil 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.670
 side note this moment because we 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:56.110
 roll over poured and also all 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:59.980
 we fix everything with needles to us 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:05.049
 the actor didn't spin 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.209
 we exterminate and cut out nothing complicated and 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.400
 not only the same girl when will 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.440
 faceless more beats don't forget it is worth 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.690
 one centimeter to allowances so these 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.019
 storm on scotch now we have before 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:24.910
 two front parts here to them 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:30.579
 we put one part on one side 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:34.150
 also cut out all the attention 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.819
 We pay our finger now for the second 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.389
 the front part is also attached 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:48.359
 forget to turn our stencil 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.359
 so here we see but two parts are ready 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.560
 we look at the rules so that everything is 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.120
 rovnenko and begin to sew 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.370
 turning the mittens to the other side 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:08.519
 You can do it of course on a typewriter 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:11.799
 but it 's somehow faster and more convenient for me manually 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:15.010
 We are doing here so here suture needle forward 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.850
 I think this shock is called first 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:23.979
 convenient because it secures our edges 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.860
 that is, they will not decay and plus 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:30.160
 He is very good, as it were, immediately flashing 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.910
 that is, we will do overlock and flash 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.949
 i'm dude there is of course a machine that 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.729
 does this all this it will be much 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.560
 faster than i mess around here but i have too 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.570
 not rotten this current time with me 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.699
 it happened too quickly gets 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.620
 very carefully so that's not his Reputation 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.620
 see so 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.740
 now ship and seams and stayed there 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.180
 turn mitten here will turn out 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.939
 we turn everything up 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:10.090
 we twist our finger a little lower and 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:21.560
 come out and twist the kites and here 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:26.389
 Mitten ready hat Stream here she is 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.750
 ready you can wrap this 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.150
 would not advise doing this because 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.949
 for example, to answer -30 of these 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.289
 mittens i think will be warm by and a 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.199
 why I thought up sewing because we have 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:42.199
 very hall and as I said and here in 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:46.129
 gloves which days are natural and 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:50.029
 very cold and I think they will call 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:52.550
 still be warmer for a long time I wanted it 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:55.550
 do and here it is somewhere you are the keeper 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:01.159
 appeared think not bad on how you 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:05.419
 think here are 2 mittens I already sewed but this 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:06.349
 quickly very quickly everything happens on 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.759
 your eyes 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:12.669
 arc all neat and i hope that on 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:17.940
 he is kindly warm 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:20.650
 I will not freeze in every 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:28.200
 here now showing again 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:31.930
 It took 2 parts of the back of insults and two parts 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:36.510
 notice the tenant I did below 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.510
