that's under power of cards and see you

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.210 
that's under power of cards and see you
didn't<00:03:46.949> get<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.160> there<00:03:47.370> maybe<00:03:48.359> not<00:03:48.980> maybe<00:03:49.980> it's

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
really worth you know the money and then

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.010 
really worth you know the money and then

and there's a whole bunch of extra money

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.480 
and there's a whole bunch of extra money
that<00:05:01.110> kind<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.380> thrown<00:05:01.710> at<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.160> cut<00:05:02.370> and

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
that kind of thrown at you to cut and

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.670 
that kind of thrown at you to cut and
keep<00:05:02.610> on<00:05:02.790> purchasing<00:05:03.300> stuff<00:05:04.020> through<00:05:04.470> their

keep on purchasing stuff through their

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.260 
keep on purchasing stuff through their
app<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.040> it's<00:05:05.190> really<00:05:05.370> littered<00:05:05.850> with<00:05:05.880> in-app

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
app so it's really littered with in-app

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.090 
app so it's really littered with in-app
purchases<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:07.020> makes<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.590> buy<00:05:07.740> into<00:05:07.890> their

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
purchases and makes you buy into their

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.470 
purchases and makes you buy into their
system<00:05:08.400> it<00:05:08.490> has<00:05:08.610> some<00:05:08.790> cool<00:05:08.940> effects<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.360> it's

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
system it has some cool effects and it's

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.520 
system it has some cool effects and it's
a<00:05:09.510> fun<00:05:09.690> little<00:05:09.810> game<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.110> mess<00:05:10.260> around<00:05:10.380> with

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
a fun little game to mess around with

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.970 
a fun little game to mess around with
but<00:05:10.860> overall<00:05:11.720> again<00:05:12.720> it's<00:05:13.020> something<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:13.920> think

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
but overall again it's something I think

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.430 
but overall again it's something I think
that<00:05:14.220> you<00:05:14.840> don't<00:05:15.840> really<00:05:15.960> need<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.200> pick<00:05:16.350> up

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
that you don't really need to pick up

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.690 
that you don't really need to pick up
through<00:05:16.650> all<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.860> universe's<00:05:17.340> if<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.550> wanna

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
through all the universe's if you wanna

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.100 
through all the universe's if you wanna
try<00:05:17.820> it<00:05:17.850> out<00:05:18.000> pick<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:18.330> up<00:05:18.450> have<00:05:18.630> some<00:05:18.780> fun<00:05:18.930> with

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
try it out pick it up have some fun with

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.720 
try it out pick it up have some fun with
it<00:05:19.200> with<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.410> basic<00:05:19.710> stuff<00:05:19.890> definitely<00:05:20.400> worth

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
it with the basic stuff definitely worth

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.240 
it with the basic stuff definitely worth
trying<00:05:20.910> but<00:05:21.240> again<00:05:21.420> in<00:05:22.350> my<00:05:22.560> opinion<00:05:22.980> it's<00:05:23.130> a

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
trying but again in my opinion it's a

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.220 
trying but again in my opinion it's a
not<00:05:23.520> buy<00:05:23.850> so<00:05:24.300> again<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:24.690> can<00:05:24.780> find<00:05:24.990> this<00:05:25.080> in

not buy so again you can find this in

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.780 
not buy so again you can find this in
the<00:05:25.260> App<00:05:25.410> Store<00:05:25.620> this<00:05:25.740> is<00:05:25.890> kick<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.580> buddy
