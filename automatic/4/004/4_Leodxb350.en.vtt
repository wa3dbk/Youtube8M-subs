00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
consider it Valbuena 84 face 81 pattern

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.940 
consider it Valbuena 84 face 81 pattern
and<00:02:05.700> 83<00:02:06.299> driven<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.350> he<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.680> very

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and 83 driven and then he is very

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.650 
and 83 driven and then he is very
underrated<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> game<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.300> he
