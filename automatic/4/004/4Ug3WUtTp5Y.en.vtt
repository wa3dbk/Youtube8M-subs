very<00:00:35.980> interested<00:00:36.460> in<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:37.000> history<00:00:37.150> of<00:00:37.420> the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.300 
very interested in the history of the
area<00:00:37.780> and<00:00:38.110> it<00:00:38.770> was<00:00:38.920> a<00:00:38.950> little<00:00:39.160> embarrassing

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
area and it was a little embarrassing
