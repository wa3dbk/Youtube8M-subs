00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
another reason why I use it because my

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.540 
another reason why I use it because my
skin<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.330> sensitive<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.280> scar

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
skin is so sensitive that and the scar

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.270 
skin is so sensitive that and the scar
is<00:04:27.639> very<00:04:27.850> easy<00:04:28.240> so<00:04:28.680> when<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.710> get<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:29.949> bump<00:04:30.160> like

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
is very easy so when I get a bump like

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.219 
is very easy so when I get a bump like
if<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.490> break<00:04:30.669> out<00:04:30.850> once<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.270> month<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.990> get<00:04:32.199> a

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
if I break out once a month and I get a

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.469 
if I break out once a month and I get a
bump<00:04:32.500> it's<00:04:32.740> just<00:04:33.610> going<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:33.850> leave<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.000> scar
