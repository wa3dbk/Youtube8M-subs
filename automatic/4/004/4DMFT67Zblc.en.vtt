00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:10.139
 [music] 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.049
 hello to all lately often asked 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.269
 on the channel questions about recipes for my 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.840
 multicookers moulinex ce4000 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.430
 as the recipe book is not very tricky 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.310
 I decided to show you today one 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.650
 easy recipe he is very tasty my 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.010
 family loves he is called fish 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.689
 in Russian here are all the ingredients that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.540
 we need it somewhere around 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.110
 one and a half two kilograms of potatoes any 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.590
 fish of the cod family salt pepper 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.570
 sour cream and vegetable oil recipe 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.120
 takes very little time and therefore 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.789
 Now I will prepare all the ingredients so 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.559
 how they should be and show you how 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.300
 directly all this in a slow cooker 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.640
 will look and how it is prepared 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.120
 I prepared all the ingredients as you can see 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.370
 I cut fish into slices 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.890
 just cut in portions 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.460
 in the original recipe still provided 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.460
 broad gull but since my son does not eat onions I 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.070
 it does not add like a bow, she, too, 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.259
 delicious nonsense too delicious 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.360
 cook at least that way if you want 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.850
 can add onions onions cut either 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.610
 rings or semirings now we all 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.570
 it will be with you in the multicooker bowl 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.210
 layered at the bottom we pour 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.310
 cooking oil so we have it all 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.520
 not burnt begin to spread 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:45.350
 we lay out a layer of potatoes so that he 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.350
 closed the bottom distribute the bottom 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.580
 Well, by the eye here as if someone like me 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.370
 I am looking for I take the fish usually more because 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.190
 that they love me fish I take I get 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.570
 bigger fish 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.430
 that is, I had six here right now 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.260
 Fish in principle could be 4 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.850
 it was enough for so many 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.330
 potatoes we take small fish also from above 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.080
 we lay out just portions 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.080
 to make a layer 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:34.080
 and what doesn't want to happen here 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.530
 somewhere on 2 layers of fish pieces and me 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:43.890
 somewhere about here and so 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:52.930
 add each layer 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:54.670
 in general, ideally, the lady will spoil 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.110
 there is here too, in principle, everything is in the eye 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:05.050
 who loves how and our family tears up pasta I 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:08.500
 pour a little more black pepper again 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.350
 a layer of potatoes on top 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.350
 fish laid 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.739
 I love the process even this one 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.769
 laying out because smells here 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.319
 mixed she's not even ready yet 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.959
 smells good and when cooked 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.730
 the aroma is not described at all 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.389
 very sorry that the camera does not smell 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.769
 passes and so very very very tasty 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:41.469
 smells lay out again my layer 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:46.290
 potato as if repeating previous 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.290
 live fish action 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.519
 but I already cut the kitchen 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.760
 scissors all fins and tails and 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.469
 crop the fact is, here in this way for 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.269
 I like it better because they 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:10.750
 anyway multicookers do not fall apart 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:23.940
 then swim around it all close 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:27.610
 a layer of potato salt i'm at the very end 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.789
 some layers can just be poured into 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.000
 principle between which i love like you 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.340
 yet finale top close salt 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.889
 debts 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:44.500
 already set preparing in general and recipe 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.800
 This is originally Russian he was preparing in food 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.550
 that is, it is all ruined his chain of 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.159
 so here was Santana on top by the way such 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.979
 small council owner multivarok 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.729
 and pressure cookers exactly that is you can 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.139
 cook any recipes you like 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.599
 just cooking time you need 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.789
 cut two and a half times 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.669
 There is a prescription at all here is this thing 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.800
 preparing somewhere around 40 minutes if 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.250
 you cook in the pan on 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.310
 when you cook in a slow cooker 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.810
 pressure cooker I will leave 10 minutes and 10 minutes 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.949
 enough for all this 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.949
 salt is cooked now 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:37.539
 sleeping copy of about 3 teaspoons 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:40.030
 weight is half and itâ€™s necessary so how 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.699
 now I'll put it all in 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.819
 Multicooker I today without a husband 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.169
 so hands only 2 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.810
 Now further cooking process 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.460
 show you here how would all this already 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.039
 is in a slow cooker it's all just 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:11.940

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:14.650
 water to slightly closed 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.289
 Jump our multicooker necessarily 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.449
 check valve valve multicooker 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:25.300
 so that it is closed and set the time 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:30.610
 cooking i take high pressure 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.889
 put and set 10 minutes not 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.719

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:39.849
 total cooking time is now somewhere 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:41.560
 It will probably be about 16-20 minutes I 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.139

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:50.680
