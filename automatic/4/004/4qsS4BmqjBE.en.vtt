acrylic colors that I just mentioned I
first<00:01:14.660> begin<00:01:15.550> creating<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.820> silhouettes<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.780> a

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
first begin creating a silhouettes of a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.139 
first begin creating a silhouettes of a
trees<00:01:18.200> there<00:01:18.860> is<00:01:18.890> going<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.190> be<00:01:19.280> two<00:01:19.490> trees<00:01:19.850> on

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
trees there is going to be two trees on

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.600 
trees there is going to be two trees on
on<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.229> left<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.800> right<00:01:21.950> side<00:01:22.340> and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
on the left and on the right side and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.990 
on the left and on the right side and
I'm<00:01:23.509> using<00:01:23.750> yellow<00:01:24.290> color<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.369> highlight

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
I'm using yellow color to highlight

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.710 
I'm using yellow color to highlight
where<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.020> tree<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.320> going<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.710> be<00:01:27.830> located

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
where the tree is going to be located

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.249 
where the tree is going to be located
and<00:01:29.720> also<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.110> will<00:01:30.259> treat<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.970> ground<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.360> base

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
and also I will treat a ground a base

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.469 
and also I will treat a ground a base
for<00:01:33.619> those<00:01:33.740> trees<00:01:34.009> I'm<00:01:34.880> using<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.300> same

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
for those trees I'm using the same

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.889 
for those trees I'm using the same
colors<00:01:36.640> throughout<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.119> entire<00:01:38.420> canes

colors throughout the entire canes

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.059 
colors throughout the entire canes
so<00:01:39.649> both<00:01:40.429> trees<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.509> ground<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:42.140> yellow

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
so both trees and the ground have yellow

well the next step in the process is to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.610 
well the next step in the process is to
add<00:02:46.200> dark<00:02:46.530> green<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:47.070> will<00:02:47.700> add<00:02:48.209> our<00:02:48.600> green<00:02:48.870> to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
add dark green I will add our green to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.640 
add dark green I will add our green to
the<00:02:49.770> leaves<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.910> trees<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.320> will

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the leaves on the trees so that will

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.130 
the leaves on the trees so that will
have<00:02:52.830> some<00:02:53.150> color<00:02:54.150> depth<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.900> painting<00:02:57.140> I'm

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
have some color depth in painting I'm

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.990 
have some color depth in painting I'm
just<00:02:59.300> gonna<00:03:00.410> bottom<00:03:01.410> center<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.250> trees<00:03:02.610> as

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
just gonna bottom center of the trees as

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.990 
just gonna bottom center of the trees as
well<00:03:03.209> as<00:03:03.269> on<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.570> ground<00:03:03.980> for<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.100> shadows<00:03:05.430> of

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
well as on the ground for the shadows of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.710 
well as on the ground for the shadows of
the<00:03:06.180> trees

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
the trees

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.800 
the trees
next<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.560> will<00:03:08.620> use<00:03:08.740> my<00:03:09.130> small<00:03:09.910> brush<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.480> pack

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
next I will use my small brush to pack

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.390 
next I will use my small brush to pack
into<00:03:10.990> my<00:03:11.200> small<00:03:11.410> brush<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.680> kind<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.190> just

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
into my small brush and kind of just

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.580 
into my small brush and kind of just
manipulate<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.970> paint<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.300> way<00:03:13.480> in<00:03:14.380> all

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
manipulate the paint this way in all

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.570 
manipulate the paint this way in all
different<00:03:14.800> directions

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
different directions

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:49.650 
different directions
adding<00:03:16.420> abstract<00:03:17.110> elements

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.080 

now<00:03:50.660> we're<00:03:51.170> ready<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.470> create<00:03:52.250> tree<00:03:52.700> trunks

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
now we're ready to create tree trunks

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.900 
now we're ready to create tree trunks
we'll<00:03:53.660> use<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.290> bottle<00:03:54.709> premix<00:03:55.220> with<00:03:55.280> wind<00:03:55.640> and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
we'll use a bottle premix with wind and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.340 
we'll use a bottle premix with wind and
water<00:03:56.650> 30%<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.800> water<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.790> 60%<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.870> paint<00:04:00.110> and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
water 30% of water and 60% of paint and

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.890 
water 30% of water and 60% of paint and
then<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.709> usually<00:04:00.860> shake<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.370> up<00:04:01.660> before<00:04:02.660> I

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
then I usually shake it up before I

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.600 
then I usually shake it up before I
begin<00:04:03.530> painting<00:04:03.920> with<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:06.489> because<00:04:07.489> the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
begin painting with it and because the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.199 
begin painting with it and because the
bottles<00:04:07.880> have<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:08.450> then<00:04:08.870> nag<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.040> I'm<00:04:10.580> able

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
bottles have but then nag to it I'm able

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.790 
bottles have but then nag to it I'm able
to<00:04:11.330> create<00:04:11.660> this<00:04:11.870> thin<00:04:12.170> lines

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
to create this thin lines

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.500 
to create this thin lines
elegant<00:04:13.790> tree<00:04:14.270> trunks<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:16.880> now<00:04:17.030> we<00:04:17.090> have<00:04:17.329> this

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
elegant tree trunks so now we have this

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.039 
elegant tree trunks so now we have this
two<00:04:17.750> beautiful<00:04:18.049> trees<00:04:19.120> now<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.630> next<00:04:20.930> thing

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
two beautiful trees now the next thing

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.140 
two beautiful trees now the next thing
is<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.230> add<00:04:21.650> more<00:04:21.680> contrast<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.940> leaves

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
is to add more contrast to the leaves

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.600 
is to add more contrast to the leaves
I'm<00:04:23.390> going<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.660> use<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.110> same<00:04:24.290> bottles<00:04:24.650> premix

the final step will be to add the Sun

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.920 
the final step will be to add the Sun
elements<00:05:13.379> of<00:05:13.559> the<00:05:13.740> painting<00:05:14.360> kind<00:05:15.360> of<00:05:15.569> bring

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
elements of the painting kind of bring

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.950 
elements of the painting kind of bring
out<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.379> focal<00:05:16.680> point<00:05:16.860> there<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:17.689> this<00:05:18.689> will

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
out the focal point there and this will

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.649 
out the focal point there and this will
conclude<00:05:19.199> this<00:05:19.409> video<00:05:19.740> lesson<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:20.249> again<00:05:20.879> the
