 hello that such welcome thank you for the 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.170
 tuning in this occasion we are going to talk 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.200
 of the matter 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.389
 for samsung galaxy s 39,300 the 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.180
 Clod is based on Android 4.4 points 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.189
 3 for this terminal is android kurt no 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.570
 has escape personalization only 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.970
 comes with 2 group launcher the we are going to 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.980
 select the one that we like the most 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.840
 rom will be a little more fluent more 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.509
 ease the terminal the only point 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.009
 negative in the battery section 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.500
 but we can solve that with a 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.530
 card that we're going to see a video 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.269
 later we will also see what 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.030
 it's being the rumba shows what it is 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.910
 settings to show the little about the 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.530
 device phone information 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.739
 as you can see here we have what it is 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.030
 Android 4.4 point 3 in the version of 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.870
 this rom the 1.3 point 5 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.699
 version 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.309
 is based on a version of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.949
 cyanogenmod which they have taken it from 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.350
 god and have modified it to use it 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.560
 in this rom this rom comes with a 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.790
 without number of what has been 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.799
 configurations or customization that 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.240
 we can only see once visualized 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.950
 that we install here we can see that 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.860
 has the two launcher the try widget and 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.990
 the google now that we can select 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 at the beginning that we install the rom when 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.280
 we installed the rom and restarted by 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.770
 first time, why not make us a picture 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.470
 of dialogue and to us warns us which one 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.789
 of the two slices we are using as 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.250
 can see here we have the option to 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.930
 put me in black because we put it in this 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.860
 color or we put it in January as 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.020
 we want 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.030
 what the animation control of what 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.520
 which are the displacement of above 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.440
 down the sliding windows 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.030
 that we will look at each one of us 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.830
 once the classroom account robben the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.870
 we want to customize like us 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.320
 we want what the topics are here 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.000
 we can add packages of themes from 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.000
 us that we like in 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.100
 google play there is a catalog of themes of 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.990
 cyanogenmod that can also find it 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.550
 our website there we go 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.500
 to find there I'll leave it for him 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.780
 Take a look and you can add it to 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.700
 this rom or rom that have installed 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.620
 to be the forum which is to be 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.209
 want today in mod 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.970
 how can you see that what in the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.739
 interface this area you what's coming 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.440
 being this error what I have contributed to 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.500
 that error in the status bar panel 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.379
 adjustments blocking notifications 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.530
 screen all this option to the we can 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.840
 visualize or we can configure it as 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.470
 we want also includes 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.160
 to zone options and suites that you like 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.900
 and rum enabled here because that's what 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.530
 does this function is enable us what 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.600
 what is being 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.370
 of task manager and we delete it 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.930
 Well, it takes us out of there and completely 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.240
 what is being the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.890
 ram memory let's go administrator 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.280
 of tasks as you can see here we have 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.040
 used 388 megs of a day that has 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.360
 this terminal in what is the bar 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.700
 been like finding what's coming 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.860
 being the adjustments we already know which 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.500
 are we can also add the some 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.000
 adjustments that we want we are going to 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.090
 work what is being what it is 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.800
 Flashlight 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.810
 now let's try what is being 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.330
 the camera the camera works 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.970
 correctly the rom of pure android 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.769
 it has much more fluency than the other 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.810
 rom with sansÃ³n customizations 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.940
 that is a point that I want to clarify that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.590
 the people directions that the rom that 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.170
 they have samsung personalization 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.420
 tend to slow down the terminal so 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.180
 that has many many configurations 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.760
 and a lot of personalization charged in the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.590
 ram, that's why you get a little 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.989
 slow the phone sometimes you close the 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.690
 applications or sometimes the terminal is 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.250
 it stays locked and what it does 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.920
 is a memory dump by restarting the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.750
 terminal what what that produces 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.400
 because the terminal, as you can see 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.290
 does not have enough memory to do 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.049
 some some tasks that you have put 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.610
 then restart and continue to remove everything 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.040
 what has been the applications that 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.019
 has in memory and restarts 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.000
 from scratch that's why I always recommend you 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.430
 that I look I think the rice what is the 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.230
 rom that we are going to use if it is personal 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.120
 of with personalization or is pure android 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.350
 I always recommend what are android 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.180
 pure so that they have no problem 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.340
 to execute what some application or 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.600
 some game or some other things well 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.700
 let's put what is being the 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.670
 installation of the rom let's turn off the 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.520
 device we're also going to go into what 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.870
 that in a recovery mode I will leave you in the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.000
 description of the video what is the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.310
 link what are the files for 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.770
 download them well once we are 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.450
 in the recovery mode we're just going to 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.720
 make the three hits gÃ¼ipe data invoice 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.790
 and roots that are the most 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.830
 important let's do what the 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.120
 guest cache partition we are doing 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.580
 the web is to do an installation 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.830
 clean and have nothing installed 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.360
 the host terminal to vic h are the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.860
 three guys that are more recommended for 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.070
 install a rom we just go 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.410
 they say such if we look for the microsd memory 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.020
 where it says ok well I 'll find it 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.220
 where do I have my microsd memory 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.140
 you can create such a folder 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.400
 which I have as I can 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.160
 observe here we have what comes 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.430
 being the rom and what are the modules 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.110
 mini modular that are the most the most 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.060
 you can better use those that 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.700
 more we use in this community because 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.110
 does not have any and much neither of what 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.210
 what are the services of google play 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.460
 but it has the services that 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.310
 we can use more often well we're going 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.990
 to install what has been the rom 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.240
 now let's shoot what's coming 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.420
 being what services are 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.020
 google and then on the page it's a pity 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.040

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.740
