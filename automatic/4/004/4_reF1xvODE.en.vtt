00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the attachments look like but here is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.179 
the attachments look like but here is
the<00:01:02.879> gold<00:01:03.539> let<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> into<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> sort

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the gold let me just get it into a sort

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
the gold let me just get it into a sort
of<00:01:05.220> nice<00:01:05.460> light<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.030> um<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.439> all<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of nice light it's um it's like all the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
of nice light it's um it's like all the
other<00:01:07.830> guns<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.700> black<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.330> gold<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
other guns it's a black and gold so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
other guns it's a black and gold so
that's<00:01:10.650> probably<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> best<00:01:11.040> way<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.250> could<00:01:11.369> see

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that's probably the best way I could see

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.219 
that's probably the best way I could see
so<00:01:12.119> at<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> front<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> gun<00:01:12.869> you've<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.280 
so at the front of the gun you've got it
a<00:01:13.290> bit<00:01:13.560> black<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> muzzle<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.290> DM
