00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.240
 hello everyone how about today I bring you another 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:14.150
 review in this case is from this base of 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.640
 makeup of the 'photo finish' and 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.990
 If you want to know my opinion are to 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.490
 see is good I imagine you already know 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.329
 this base of surplus value has been made 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.829
 quite famous for youtube and blogs 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:31.100
 and well I was looking for something that some basis 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:33.880
 that was good for photographing 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.280
 that would leave a natural finish juice cited 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.140
 and of course it was not very expensive as 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.260
 it fulfills everything I was looking for in 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.950
 a base I liked or 699 is the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.400
 bought me in a perfumery in prieto 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.900
 in Valencia the tone 010 that cost me a 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.100
 Little find him because he was exhausted 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.100
 all over 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.450
 30 milliliters 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.780
 and put what is good here 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.150
 that lasts 18 hours, so long does not the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.130
 I have taken to piggyback is not so many 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.950
 hours made up but if I say that 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.950
 I will show you how it is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.039
 It is not very fluid that is very pasty 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.039
 but that exquisite 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.020
 has a coverage 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.140
 the titan discovers enough to have 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.730
 a high coverage do not leave your face 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.980
 and if you wore a mask it 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.780
 is a base that adapts very well to 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.580
 skin tone at least to me this 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.890
 particular tone the truth is that I 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.340
 it looks pretty good I do not see it 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.230
 dark or light is what I wear 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.570
 today and well I like it a lot as I said 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.690
 I do not know if it lasts 18 hours but 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.290
 Holds pretty well 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.440
 It leaves a quite natural finish and 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.750
 juicy but without being very bright is very 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.380
 outrageous I have tried other bases or 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.450
 bicrim that leave that nice finish but 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.920
 plus 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.020
 more songs or let's say a little more 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.040
 Bright is I really like it 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:33.040
 leave me I always wear it with this 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:36.580
 costal brush is flat not dense os 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.610
 I'm going to leave a bit of life where I 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.800
 He applied this base with this brush and 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.010
 good if you can see the before and the 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.010
 afterwards and the finishing they left brought 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.720
 or not 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.239
 Y 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.670
 ah 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.250
 i 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.900
 i 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.900
 i 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.530
 ah 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.060
 ah 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.640
 Y 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.640
 ah 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.120
 or 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.909
 in 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.909
 Y 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.909
 ah 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.410
 I have seen that it has a coverage 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.560
 quite acceptable the finish as os 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.870
 I say is quite natural and without being so 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.280
 very bright it's worth to me not just me 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.120
 like that juicy finish but too 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.670
 bright let's say I do not know what else 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.350
 commented because the truth is that 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.390
 is a base that does not find any 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.460
 paste I do not notice that it oxidizes after 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.830
 it gets darker as I tell you it's me 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.010
 it adapts super well the tone I say no me 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.680
 I notice it neither lighter nor darker is 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.530
 that I'm delighted by 699 does not teach me 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.720
 that is exhausted let's go that I like 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.670
 so much that I could take a hit 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.680
 and it is that to me 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.630
 in glass containers I do not like anything 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.370
 I do not like anything because this falls out 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.730
 to the ground and goodbye base unless it's 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.500
 very resistant and does not break badly but 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.420
 well I am very given that I break the 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.100
 that I drop things because I am a 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.720
 little hands, but I'm telling you that's the 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.290
 only downside that could put the truth 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.510
 is that the boat is cool but I do not 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.280
 like it to be crystal 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.750
 it seems to me that there are five tones because I do not know 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.139
 they run and if I'm wrong I think there 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.719
 five tones and 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.460
 and that is the clearest as I said and 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:38.099
 well I think it's the first time that I 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.430
 I buy the lightest shade and it looks good 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.199
 I usually buy, I do not know what 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.860
 be a base that has all the 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.110
 different 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.180
 I do not usually buy more clarito 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.030
 and I have to stay in this case not in 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.000
 this case fits me very well 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.530
 I'm not going to tell you that I'm cold good what 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.530
 you have all the information here 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.789
 here he says he has pigments 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.830
 Reflective light that lasts 18 hours 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.460
 is today cold and dermatologically of 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:16.940
 been and right now of the bases that 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.520
 I have this is the best I have of 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.770
 done if I'm going to use makeup base 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.930
 we put this on or if not for 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.910
 day by day I lived creel and nothing I'm 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.940
 I love it very much and I recommend it 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.319
 100% and nothing else that has been my opinion 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.199
 On this basis I hope that I have 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:36.460
 served what you liked and see you 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.460
 the next video chao
