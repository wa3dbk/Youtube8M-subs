00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
just highlight him i think is teh but

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.250 
just highlight him i think is teh but
he's<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.730> left-back<00:03:46.150> but<00:03:46.360> use<00:03:46.480> for<00:03:46.720> star<00:03:46.959> skills

he's a left-back but use for star skills

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.259 
he's a left-back but use for star skills
so<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.130> alternative<00:03:48.730> if<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:48.940> wanted<00:03:49.209> I

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
so is it alternative if you wanted I

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
well you can see who the Aussies I

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.009 
well you can see who the Aussies I
thought<00:03:57.489> mentioned<00:03:57.820> before<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.420> very<00:03:58.930> good
