 that's why we want 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.749
 in a town of 4 thousand inhabitants, it did not contribute a thousand people, it is said that 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.780

 efe 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:49.150
 with the help of Turkish with the help of darío grandinetti and good 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.699
 emilio and with the 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.519
 collaboration of the sea was published boccanera 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.019
 the truth that it is a pleasure to do it 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.349
 but I do not know monetarista of soccer 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.849
 this one must be sold in the theater but I'm naturally a commentator 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.239
 soccer by radio and 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.149
 It is also a great pride to be able to contribute 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.779
 literature to the writer and what 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.379
 that the football fans and that is the final message of my programs and 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.869
 show 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.509
 the final message would be 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:21.229
 soccer fans are not only people we talk about the ball and the play 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.229
 we are also people who get involved in popular culture 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:26.940
 that we do not know emotionally with a poem 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.069
 we are not all energetic and violent 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.739
 when he announced recently how was the beginning to the show the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.999
 link with darío 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.709
 He also remembered that it is a prologue there is behind that bad 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.290
 revealed on Thursday that's a bit too like the start you do not get them 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:44.389
 a previous antecedent to everything with affection that was 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.599
 a tribute to that football 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.649
 I want today 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:51.359
 let's say the synthesis took that in vaduz and could do it in 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.540
 in memory with so many forgetfulness that football has for that thing the sou that 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.099
 now has television and 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:06.049
 fano quequé capparé dike that freckles that the same and danel menem 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.150
 they help kerry 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.309
 play because I look young but I'm not so young 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.299
 this 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.599
 have enriched the history of soccer ediberto reguetón was made 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.659
 I say 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.700
 this show finally what you do 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.499
 thank those guys who have built 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:27.560
 to the historic Argentine soccer that is located in world football in 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.559
 a very high place and it seems to me that everyone has built it 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.170
 and football commentators, even though we were born a lot here, I am a 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.349
 relatively young man but not so young 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.619
 efe I have the obligation although I have not seen him to know who was the charro 

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:48.279
 dark to know who was tito bisutti to know who was labruna angel of 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.830
 know who was the art of xavi 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.009
 because if not politicians the boy is now born of puel 86 and john o'shea 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:56.930
 Maradona 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.440
 the history that's why we have an obligation 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.180
 of knowing and the acute effect to do is to repair some forgetfulness 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.419
 I think that is to say a bit and also Argentine football 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.530
 has been made of history 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.050
 and many players have enriched 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.319
 although good also remembered the show again will premiere the 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.540
 Blissful human history 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.340
 he remembered read that anecdote of a man who once described a commanded 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.320
 a document letter to the radio and being the rival area of ​​the area 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.969
 genius genius day arrived 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.550
 and tell me fabiana forget soon alameda a letter document says it 

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:33.379
 they gave an account then 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.330
 and now you say 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.020
 I used to have a Saturday army and the sidewalk would fall asleep late 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.930
 peribán all 7 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.979
 as I kill the witch of the witch tables and let's be something going to come out 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.150
 Now, in doing so with its integration, you must forget the 8 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.279
 the witch companies to barreda let's say anything but 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:55.949
 then you sued 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.740
 so I owe at 7 o'clock 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.129
 a wonder of a tripod 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.259
 they still listen to us accompany us at the time of deceased much their lenses and others 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.570
 like holland - with the three points of him 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.120
 also the interior has letters left telling him that one way one for 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.960
 the boys get hooked listening when the kun 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.990
 Teachers and teachers and teachers from all over the country ask us 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.180
 a lot of bibliography I tell you football because it's the way 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:25.199
 first to agree that your world invites you to read 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.990
 is not a world is like the world of art the world of the world of the 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.969
 computing is not a world that 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.870
 that came up to an armchair in your house and they tell you look at it metete the 

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:38.360
 fascinating adventure see a book 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.870
 the 2 mm many women and many men across the country detect that the boys 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.240
 with waiting for tito with the story of fontanarrosa the pigeon of credit 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.450
 with the old gazale 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.919
 they get hooked on the story time of reading a story 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.680
 and if we 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.940
 we infect a person in a world that limits us so that we do 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.599
 we feel satisfied 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.059
 thank you very much for everything and hopefully I do but I doubt very much about 

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:07.789
 pleasure and a lot of grace because emotional side will leave soon 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.650
 I'm going to go well it could be a little bit what the show proceeds that is 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.900
 sit down he joined the wolf war got to count some friend stretch 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.240
 of track that will mark jousse hand or fellow lottery 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.500
 i the truth that football is also made those stories that seem 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.050
 football only 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.270
 but ultimately to life and 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.060
 our boys there was cake always like to be taken
