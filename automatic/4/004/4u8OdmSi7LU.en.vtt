00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.520
 Welcome to this episode "Weather Cold Knowledge" 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.360
 Hong Kong's spring is a foggy season 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.360
 Remember that in the past when there was heavy fog 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.760
 The steamboat inside the harbor will ring the flute. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.240
 When the ferry is a lot, it will be suspended. 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.840
 Today and today due to the development of marine radar 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.480
 Therefore, it is quite rare to stop because of the fog. 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.560
 Fog means floating in the atmosphere 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 But close to the ground, some visible and tiny water droplets 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.000
 When it accumulates a lot 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.680
 Will affect visibility 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.680
 The difference between clouds and fog is mainly that the fog is close to the ground. 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.440
 The cloud does not touch the ground. 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 According to the rules of the World Meteorological Organization 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.040
 When the visibility drops to 1 km, it is called fog. 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.920
 1 to 5 km is called mist. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.640
 On the weather map, we will use three horizontal lines and two horizontal lines to represent fog and mist. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.240
 The formation mechanism of fog is mainly due to the drop in air temperature. 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.400
 Saturation of water vapor to form suspended water droplets 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.280
 When Hong Kong is spring, many times it will turn south. 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.000
 We call it back to Nantian 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.360
 When these warm and humid south winds come to Hong Kong 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 Meet the colder sea 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:56.280
 The air on the cold sea water is condensed to form some fine droplets. 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.440
 The advection fog is produced in this way. 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.280
 Other than this 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.000
 Radiation fog formed by radiation cooling 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.200
 Or perhaps because of the relationship between the terrain 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.480
 Uphill fog formed by the air being forced to rise 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.040
 Can also be seen in Hong Kong 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 Don't tell me 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.720
 In winter time 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.840
 We will breathe some white water vapor from our mouth and nose. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.800
 In fact, its formation mechanism is the same as fog. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.920
 This way, the fog seems to cause inconvenience to our lives. 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.280
 In fact, the fog also has its good side. 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.240
 In some countries of the world 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.280
 Especially in places with high mountains 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.800
 Because the infrastructure is not developed 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.680
 So tap water is very extravagant for them. 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.080
 These countries will install fog collectors on the mountains. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.200
 The mist collector looks like a badminton net 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.680
 But denser 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.720
 These mist collectors will collect the water 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.800
 For local residents and tourists 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.080
 Hong Kong's spring is foggy and damp 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.280
 I don't know if the mist collector is useful to us? 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.200
 This episode "Weather Cold Knowledge" ends here 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.480
 See you next time.
