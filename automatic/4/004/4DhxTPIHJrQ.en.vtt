00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.000

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.660

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.940
 today is a day and then a 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.850
 neo pro cooking our faces if the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.340

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.190
 anti age to that of the link you 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.440

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.030

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.050
 and then I bought you in another 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.199
 which may be more than a 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.610
 little bit more sensitive well than if 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.390
 I just said it's good for 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.549
 sensitive skin 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.159

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.020

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.789
 also takes them on magazines 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.969
 specialized that we receive so we 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.209
 add a few times a little bit our 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:37.630

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:40.420

 in the summer in the evening not the day why 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.509
 because me the essential oils 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.670
 with the sun I have trouble I do not want 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.299
 no and I'm a little bit 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.359
 cormier so you know i think 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.789
 always we prepare his position 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.520

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.849

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 at small she is formed in silence all 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:13.150
 little one just sees in with the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.150

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.090

 wrinkles that tasks so 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.150

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:33.030
 the essential oil in the day to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.219
 contract I banish them completely even 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.650
 the most harmless but if my opinion 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.840
 to me it is not universal - meaning for 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.590
 I do it take but everyone is 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.040
 free to do as he wants so that's it 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.840
