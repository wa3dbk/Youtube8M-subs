00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.230
 hi everyone today i want to tell 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.009
 about the dryer 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:13.950
 fruit dryer vegetables I very much 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:16.500
 I looked in the y-tube about dried and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.869
 I chose Scarlett myself 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.019
 why did she take it in the first place I 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.009
 wanted a small-small compact 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 secondly, I wanted the pallets 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:35.950
 were wide there is a pallet which narrow 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.699
 why I wanted wide because apples 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.230
 pears here on compote when you have it all 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:47.800
 don't you cut so fine yes then they 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.579
 dry up but still somehow sit and 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.010
 finely cut well i think frivolously i 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:59.829
 I already dried pepper 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:03.809
 and the squares of the case and the tubes of the case 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:08.409
 here it turned out so dry 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:13.479
 small but when you lie in the dish she 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:16.990
 swell pear apples nasushit nasushit 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.400
 already made compote you know and even dried 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.049
 Here are some grapes 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:30.520
 carrot carrot even here I have now 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:32.740
 here too dried up here 5 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.200
 containers, but now I have three 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.990
 container 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.040
 served in a dish who knows who saw already 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.590
 also watched on y tube that all this 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.320
 swell everything is ok good carrot 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.640
 the same thing we buy spices in 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.229
 shop and it is better to buy a dryer once 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.210
 for fruits and vegetables and dry at home by yourself 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.689
 or buy to walk these little ones 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.040
 rub the bags yes for 40 rubles I think 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.560
 profitable here are 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.619
 see for yourself how you like someone 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.940
 like narrow pallets but i like 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.989
 wide but she is small 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.840
 small and compact so here's 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:30.860

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:35.430
