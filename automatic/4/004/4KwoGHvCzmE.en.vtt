00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.689
 hello how welcome are you to my channel 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.689
 today I will show you a small 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.860
 by those who use the trailer that 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.400
 yes 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.740
 if this application is used that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.560
 supposedly he was winning 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.560
 points every time they see in a video and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 they're still given points as they can 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.250
 see and having a certain amount of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.050
 points can fall with iTunes itunes and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 other cards that are found here 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.789
 he taught them 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.510
 amazon being there all this exposes the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.829
 have 10,000 points reaches 110 dollars 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.609
 it's a little boring to be watching 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.609
 all the video of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.500
 the videos are being watched so that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.140
 give them a point that is a bit slow 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 it takes a long time that is a waste of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.780
 time the truth only between I 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.049
 found a way to do a little 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.229
 make it a little simpler and it's 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.380
 that is called supposedly that is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.399
 that advances it a little faster for 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.830
 that less time lasts there is living 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.200
 with God the first thing we have to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.840
 to do is to leave like this day 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.840
 and by searching and searching 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.460
 for the tweet called fast 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.460
 do not pronounce 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.350
 is 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.310
 do not have to add or in a 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.490
 repository 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.850
 and bring it from the effect with the sun from afar 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.850
 once 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.860
 confirm and what system 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.250
 then a summary of his 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.250
 device 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.290
 let us pledge 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.930
 what 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.260
 now if we go 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.770
 to look for anything that is just open the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.210
 application 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.460
 and here, we will only activate this 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.340
 was already on my 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.280
 berlin we only activate that if it's 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.470
 so they need it because it's not very 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.780
 nice to see you our videos 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.660
 forward they need fast this later 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.830
 that we activate after we go to 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.200
 configuration 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.900
 here you can configure what speed 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.900
 he wants the video to go 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.570
 I really do not like to wait long 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.930
 so I put 12 do not put 20 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.150
 why 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:33.190
 I do not think what I do not know if it works 12 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.720
 the most I can put 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.720
 when will I do 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.360
 if they are fixed 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.360
 mine has 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:51.520
 1260 about these and this will give me 43 are 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:55.320
 he just pushed him 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.320
 see and receive points 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:06.630
 perfect to this average the points and not 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.630
 I had to see wait to see everything in trelew 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.950
 what it takes to give you points is 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.760
 a boredom only presses 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.760
 see him 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.770
 and ready 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.170
 well in less than a minute 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.520
 I see all those who are up to date 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.520
 available for which nothing points 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.430
 This is how I found 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.430
 be a little easier 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.259
 do not cost this will not help them up 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.590
 get so many points because when you see 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:00.780
 all those who give 5 supposedly 5 to 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.780
 all three times or they stop giving 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.930
 they stop giving me the points and so they commit 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.979
 two as you can see 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.949
 but it 's a good way to go 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:19.520
 accumulating points and without spending 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.520
 the good time I hope you liked it
