that's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.549> huge<00:01:54.210> difference<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> maybe<00:01:56.399> you're

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that's a huge difference so maybe you're

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.289 
that's a huge difference so maybe you're

all<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.240> just<00:02:24.480> isn't<00:02:24.960> working<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.700> but

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
all this just isn't working you know but

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.180 
all this just isn't working you know but
then<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.500> bit<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.950> fine

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
then you just go in just a bit of fine

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.740 
then you just go in just a bit of fine
tuning<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.880> only<00:02:30.030> boom<00:02:30.360> you've<00:02:30.600> got<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
tuning it's only boom you've got a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.470 
tuning it's only boom you've got a
perfect<00:02:31.260> picture<00:02:31.640> because<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> second<00:02:33.360> goes

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480

all fuzzy and all fuzzy and then you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.440 
all fuzzy and all fuzzy and then you
know<00:02:35.580> someone<00:02:35.790> goes<00:02:35.880> ever<00:02:36.030> goes<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.180> here<00:02:36.330> let

know someone goes ever goes in here let

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.200 
know someone goes ever goes in here let
me<00:02:36.540> try<00:02:36.660> Duke<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.890> sending<00:02:38.460> one<00:02:38.610> perfect

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
me try Duke and sending one perfect

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.510 
me try Duke and sending one perfect
picture<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:40.710> how<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:40.950> can<00:02:41.070> be<00:02:41.250> you

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
picture and that's how it can be you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.040 
picture and that's how it can be you
know<00:02:41.580> I'm<00:02:42.000> sure<00:02:42.300> you've<00:02:42.450> been<00:02:42.540> trying<00:02:42.810> hard

and you try to loads of different things

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.180 
and you try to loads of different things
but<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.260> probably<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.830> little<00:02:46.980> tweak

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
but it's probably just a little tweak
