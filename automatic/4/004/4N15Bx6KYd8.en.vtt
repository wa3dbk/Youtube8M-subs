 here radiator 15 days there 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.219
 approximately what was made the exchange

 You're going to gradually do it. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:27.869
 would give a little damage to this 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:32.850
 motor once it arrives at this point but 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.150
 most of the time the problem of finding 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.659
 that will give me walk will put a
