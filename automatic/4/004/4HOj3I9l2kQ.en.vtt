00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.219 

okay<00:00:01.859> I<00:00:02.180> think<00:00:03.180> I<00:00:03.390> figured<00:00:03.450> out<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.930> problem

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:04.229 
okay I think I figured out the problem

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:05.570 
okay I think I figured out the problem
with<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.410> rat<00:00:04.560> fail<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.160> what<00:00:05.310> we're<00:00:05.399> going<00:00:05.490> to

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
with the rat fail so what we're going to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.780 
with the rat fail so what we're going to
do<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.850> go<00:00:05.970> ahead<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.299> fly<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:06.629> again<00:00:06.990> and

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
do is go ahead and fly it again and

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.680 
do is go ahead and fly it again and
hopefully<00:00:08.790> not<00:00:09.060> have<00:00:09.210> any<00:00:09.360> more<00:00:09.510> problems

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
hopefully not have any more problems

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.110 
hopefully not have any more problems
with<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.110> pitch<00:00:10.350> down<00:00:10.560> so<00:00:11.000> there<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.090> go

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
with that pitch down so there you go

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:42.790 
with that pitch down so there you go
baby<00:00:19.100> strapped<00:00:23.510> nothing<00:00:26.300> ready<00:00:27.300> yep

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:01:06.950 

hard<00:00:43.399> barely<00:00:44.090> fair

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:23.420 

stass<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:10.090> quick

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:42.630 

a<00:01:27.410> little<00:01:28.410> bit

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.900 

create

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:56.310 

what<00:01:48.910> else<00:01:49.120> you<00:01:49.210> drive

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:10.820 

when<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.010> wreaking<00:01:57.340> havoc<00:01:57.700> on<00:01:57.820> ya

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:22.100 

Olivia<00:02:11.830> ha<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.420> can<00:02:13.600> video<00:02:13.960> nah

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:39.240 

landing<00:02:23.110> yeah<00:02:26.070> yeah<00:02:29.190> quickly<00:02:30.190> yeah<00:02:31.410> yeah<00:02:38.250> go

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
landing yeah yeah quickly yeah yeah go

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:55.370 
landing yeah yeah quickly yeah yeah go
around

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.660 

want<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.440> see<00:02:56.530> what<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.680> vertical<00:02:57.100> capability

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
want to see what a vertical capability

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.800 
want to see what a vertical capability
was<00:03:02.790> kind<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:03.940> pain<00:03:04.120> in<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.270> ass<00:03:04.420> because<00:03:04.630> I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
was kind of a pain in the ass because I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:15.150 
was kind of a pain in the ass because I
got<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.960> crosswind<00:03:05.380> landing<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:12.150> wise<00:03:14.160> good

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
got a crosswind landing so wise good

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.730 
got a crosswind landing so wise good
airplane<00:03:15.540> it's<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.690> lot<00:03:16.870> easier<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.380> fly<00:03:17.590> than

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
airplane it's a lot easier to fly than

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.140 
airplane it's a lot easier to fly than
my<00:03:17.890> year<00:03:18.100> old<00:03:18.220> fighter<00:03:18.460> and<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.820> super

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
my year old fighter and the super

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.010 
my year old fighter and the super
morning<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.540> thought<00:03:19.690> Super<00:03:20.080> Hornet<00:03:20.350> was<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:22.690> I

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
morning I thought Super Hornet was it I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.800 
morning I thought Super Hornet was it I
guess<00:03:23.650> my<00:03:24.130> last<00:03:24.490> recommendation<00:03:24.790> about<00:03:25.420> this

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
guess my last recommendation about this

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.740 
guess my last recommendation about this
plane<00:03:26.080> being<00:03:26.290> too<00:03:26.530> hard<00:03:26.740> to<00:03:26.800> fly<00:03:27.570> which<00:03:28.570> is

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
plane being too hard to fly which is

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.320 
plane being too hard to fly which is
based<00:03:28.990> on<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.350> center<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.650> gravity<00:03:29.710> issues

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.710 

now<00:03:37.330> one<00:03:37.600> thing<00:03:37.630> at<00:03:37.870> one<00:03:38.170> point<00:03:42.600> when<00:03:43.600> you're

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
now one thing at one point when you're

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.790 
now one thing at one point when you're
flying<00:03:43.990> this<00:03:44.230> plane<00:03:46.230> one<00:03:47.230> thing<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.530> want<00:03:47.710> to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
flying this plane one thing you want to

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.040 
flying this plane one thing you want to
do<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:50.610> score<00:03:51.610> out<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.970> foam<00:03:52.210> so<00:03:52.780> go<00:03:52.900> ahead<00:03:52.960> and

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
do is score out the foam so go ahead and

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.290 
do is score out the foam so go ahead and
get<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.230> shot<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:53.830> here<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:55.030> only<00:03:55.180> way

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
get a shot of that in here the only way

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.960 
get a shot of that in here the only way
to<00:03:55.360> get<00:03:55.540> this<00:03:55.630> plane<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.960> fly<00:03:56.200> right<00:03:56.670> is<00:03:57.670> to

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
to get this plane to fly right is to

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.170 
to get this plane to fly right is to
shift<00:03:58.600> its<00:03:58.810> center<00:03:59.080> of<00:03:59.110> gravity<00:03:59.170> back<00:04:00.150> quite<00:04:01.150> a

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
shift its center of gravity back quite a

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.990 
shift its center of gravity back quite a
bit<00:04:01.800> by<00:04:02.800> scoring<00:04:03.250> out<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.400> foam<00:04:03.730> on<00:04:03.970> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
bit by scoring out the foam on the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.250 
bit by scoring out the foam on the
inside<00:04:04.090> here<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:06.130> if<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.610> don't<00:04:06.790> do<00:04:06.970> this

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
inside here so if you don't do this

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.150 
inside here so if you don't do this
you're<00:04:08.260> not<00:04:08.410> going<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.590> give<00:04:08.709> center<00:04:08.920> gravity

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
you're not going to give center gravity

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.960 
you're not going to give center gravity
right<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.700> mean<00:04:10.060> I've<00:04:10.180> tried<00:04:10.420> everything<00:04:10.690> and

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
right I mean I've tried everything and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.670 
right I mean I've tried everything and
well<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.560> what<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.780> how<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:16.840> doing
