00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.340
 the ideal job for me it's a job 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.200
 which would allow me to accomplish badly at 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.039
 guess what I want is to 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.760

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.350

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.940
 I finished school of the best sound 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.740
 today's Roman job can only 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.570

 both working for the milky way 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.900
 So I can not wait to see what 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.700
 they have in a day how 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.700
 is their job the donors 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.160
 finally we have the role of tintin schweiter 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 was to do the data entry 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.619
 at the customers or if we do the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.060
 accounts rocks persist so we attend 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.430
 the producers during the truce for 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.280
 welcome the peaceful ones and take the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 samples or sip wished was going away 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.700
 were found French so he gave 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.270
 we sell all the data of the producer 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.040
 production control glem and then 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.630
 we manage the relationship with the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.490
 producer we want to leave him at the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 end of our live 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.330
 for me it's at first 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.490
 technician comes to do the deals with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.130
 we because we are in control 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.320
 so supervise the accuracy of the data 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.299
 it's important that things are 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.310
 well done that the data is well 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.130
 taken san fermin a fair bit and with 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.990
 the customer like a hoof like years who 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.390
 is advanced during his harvests as 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.490
 wound the closure more pawn by this 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.360
 moment the good wine detect weaknesses 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.189
 what is ray in new york 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.290
 we take the time to weigh the va on 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.780
 his brothers data for them 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.520
 advisors so that they prefer 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.820
 the most adequate diet for for 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.610
 the cows too that allows me good 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.429
 duty in my books are in good 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.890
 condition he maintain I could offend 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.260
 it's really an observation I think 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:21.599
 that we will serve rather advised that he 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:23.400
 went in ice like what marked me the 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.959
 more of me if the day with 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.430
 marie-hÃ©lÃ¨ne the technician is 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.560
 really their privileged relationship we 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.360
 can have with the producer it is 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.299
 we are really pampered 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.459
 collaborate with this person there which 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.310
 is really great that's so many 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.220
 able to gather information at 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.319
 the winged validated in the barn to see in 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.640
 contact with animals contact with 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.640
 he misses it's really great 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.170
 and 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.200
 so for me the valacta advisor 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.390
 it's really a very very being 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.060
 important for reaching our 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.590
 Goals on the farm is the person 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.750
 which happens to us with a package of 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.220
 documents with a data package that 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.650
 were taken from our controls 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.330
 confers every month and who will come 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.330
 to give us no information 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.780
 first of all it's mostly because we have 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.520
 a large field of expertise we have several 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.810
 skills that starts that range from 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.720
 feeding to planning 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.460
 dairy in raising heifers too 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.750
 so we can advise producers on 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.610
 the number of heifers that should raise 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.920
 by year we can also work on 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.780
 rations of wrongs we have a lot of 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.100
 skills that we also have a lot of 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.690
 people who can help us we have 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.490
 shevell resources actors at the level 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.440
 economic also because we can 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.900
 touch all the plans on 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.280
 the company finally against the author 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.270
 concrete at the tables only at the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.600
 financial to passers-general from 3.4 to 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.720
 moore share discussed everything together 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.280
 surrounding that is the controls duration 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.620
 in milk whether it's the cells 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.720
 somatic that this wish so it's 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.790
 really an overview of our 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.980
 herd a view that really helps us 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.170
 to make breeding decisions 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.770
 management decisions very important to 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.770
 our enterprise 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.240
 the benefits of working at bahl 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.100
 actors are many to start one 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.200
 has a lot of continuing education I 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.630
 think that's the big point the who 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.300
 promotes who promotes our knowledge 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.680
 continues I think it exists in 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.030
 all the medieval companies actors 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.560
 deviate regular is what makes 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.900
 we may be a little bit before 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.940
 guard compared to others we have 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.890
 also our profits when I 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.260
 personally consider very important 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.660
 it's the fact that you can do it yourself 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.160
 will have beaten his horror as a result of 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.290
 what we dare we can reconcile 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.880
 easily the other personal life then 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.650
 the work then also it's really 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.060
 contact with the producers do it in 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.160
 so that we can help them achieve 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.510
 their goals it's really big 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.750
 benefits can find the advice 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.970
 I like a lot 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.710
 contact with animals contact 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.410
 with that they were not dealing with 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.210
 phone we are a lot on the ground 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.510
 by the whimsical and and dynamic 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.730
 if we come back a bit like 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.310
 producers it's good but is nice 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.260
 everyone is happy immo and tax 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.870
 people are a little my table but also 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.720
 been a girl I find it fun because 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.270
 that we can arrange our schedules in 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.240
 function a little bit of our way of life 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.580
 it was very very long motivating 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.620
 work because you adapt our 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.540
 work and our schedule finally the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.850
 profits adviser positions are 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.280
 many first but we have the chance to 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.350
 do a lot of ground then also 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.030
 many offices charge 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.500
 hide the person search it can 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.570
 do a little bit more than a little bit more 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.130
 the other one but I think we have this 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.380
 reconcile easily we can work 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.650
 as much the farm as we do fax 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.300
 braids and very flexible like oran then 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.950
 also it's really contact with the 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.060
 producers make it so that one can 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.280
 help them achieve their goals 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.150
 it's really big profits 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.150
 would track the board 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.800
 I found it really great 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.050
 interesting I could see a little bit 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.880
 more explored was what their job 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.610
 very specific for sure these two 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.500
 jobs that are well divided m is very 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.330
 complementary in lots so we 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.310
 does not work well without the other but this 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.020
 which I preferred above all 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.300
 today is to see the complicity 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.980
 that we can have with the producer these 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.830
 people there who have these postulates it's 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.510
 really excellent to walk 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.010
 the producer see his goals 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.250
 really if what I like most my 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.250
 day 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:56.889
 you 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.830
 he 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.750
 I am now part of the big 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.220
 valacta team am really satisfied 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.990
 because it totally responds to my 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.569
 needs to the expectations that I had created 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.949
 me who is a dynamic girl they 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.500
 always looking for challenges 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:15.990
 really I have a job that is that there is 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.370
 daily challenges there is not a 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.960
 place that's the same as the water that has 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.000
 not a month it's the same 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.380
 my visits are really different 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.990

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.280
 flexibility and in addition to that at valve 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.710
 act one is really very very good 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.690
 surrounded we have ongoing training at 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.789
 the year we are followed by 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.220
 specialists we always have someone 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:38.389
 still needed need could have 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.389
 amassed something that I appreciate
