00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.950
 12 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.720
 we will ask our questions to these little ones 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.190
 Americans who to see do not understand 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.770
 a word of French and we will enjoy 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.400
 to troll a little bit between us 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.720
 claudie tell us what you liked I 'm 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.700
 see there he liked the shovel have that 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.730
 my athletes 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.500
 ok he liked the toilet it's perfect 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.740
 but we will say that it is a vehicle when 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.820
 even 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.620
 so you 'll tell us a little bit 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.230
 they convey you liked in need 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.040
 for speed 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.050
 it's true that tactics were really 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.530
 good to go really fast I lifted them 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.530
 speed 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.660
 now we will ask them this is 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.770
 what the biggest mytho they have loved 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.330
 on the outputs but fears to hope 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.190
 that it takes on the highways to the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.150
 comets going down 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.750
 it's a real see photos 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:07.190
 to dodge is a bit like that it's 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.420
 really cool than now in the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.170
 exits which can fly go in 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.399
 other galaxies 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.260
 it's really nice and it makes us 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.190
 think a little bit about star wars we're going 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.630
 ask them how do they 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.050
 play year without speed is what they 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.350
 are 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.740
 ac I would say lost to lose what 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.740
 i love ti 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:58.300
 in any case what we feel a little 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:09.130
 too fast and great attention to that is 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:10.540
 of the interview problem that it's me 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.160

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.610
 jessains not in the end i'll ip so there 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.769
 I am going to custom and mabuchi 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.610
 we will change the wheels in a first 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.670
 time there are so many things that we 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.200
 can exchange 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.530
 I love my sins will feel 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.530
 all is 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.939
 ok we'll take that 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.939

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.300
 we will change the bumper we will change 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.300
 the color side the same time 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.930
 ok here we are the buddies we are on the base 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.040
 of los angeles the little boxes of 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.010
 night so we'll see what this your 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.880
 I took a driving not too much rift 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.340
 Does that mean that you have two 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.060
 possibilities you can take care 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.860
 a 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.810
 a completely drifting driving is so 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.690
 you are when skids are they from 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.920
 driving about normal real where he 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.480
 must still braked to take the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.069
 bends 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.709
 I prefer to brake but we can very 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.630
 to take the drifts properly is normally 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.440
 it's as effective far as our 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.510
 Hockey I come to wear my crate we did not 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.010
 nothing seen we did not see anything in that one 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.600
 this is going to have a great story we will have 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.549
 a lot of cutscenes really irl 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.600
 shot as a short film and in 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.160
 all scenes will have your car 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.110
 but your your car 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.550
 in game and it's great to do 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.930
 do not even notice the difference and 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.790
 big information as good this is 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.669
 on speed is that normally it's a 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.889
 project but it's a big thing I had 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.419
 the license agreement for maybe 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.460
 embedded my logo and my name in the 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.320
 play if it means that you 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.930
 will be able to create the super car 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.610
 asshole in speed zones with my 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.590
 style my logo as in my chain so 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.419
 we will see is not sure yet but 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.680
 Normally we can do it so we 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.540
 will be two cars super asshole 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.110
 so if you have the game you will see 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.780
 in cities 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.130
 if if if there is my little head and my 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.639
 little logo we'll see it will be small 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.220
 surprise 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.400
 what I hope there is so let go yet 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.660
 sliced you pursued by the police 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.520
 we talk a little bit about the game bat sitting 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.380
 like the old and without icy rain 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.320
 in open world in los angeles 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.610
 it will be only night so for 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.039
 to be more in the race universe 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.300
 prosecution with the police 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.259
 I also want online in a little black 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.310
 with friends to go shopping 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:29.370
 prosecution so that it can be the trunk 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:32.380

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.380

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.380

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.550
 we will ask each lynskey one 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.020

 play need for speed 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.510
 good even though I planted a lot of 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.310
 times but the gameplay remains accessible 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.320
 it's very simple to play graphically 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.030
 it's very nice I must admit the 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.950
