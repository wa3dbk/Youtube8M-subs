probably<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:19.330> most<00:00:19.509> important<00:00:20.170> part<00:00:20.439> of<00:00:20.590> our

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
probably the most important part of our

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.650 
probably the most important part of our
sport<00:00:21.099> is<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.550> work<00:00:21.700> we<00:00:21.880> do<00:00:22.029> actually<00:00:22.480> before

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
sport is the work we do actually before

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.580 
sport is the work we do actually before
the<00:00:22.960> rally<00:00:23.110> which<00:00:23.650> we<00:00:23.830> called<00:00:24.040> a<00:00:24.160> wreck

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the rally which we called a wreck

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.370 
the rally which we called a wreck
so<00:00:26.590> we<00:00:26.770> drive<00:00:27.040> in<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.430> normal<00:00:27.849> car<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.300> low<00:00:29.050> speed

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
so we drive in a normal car a low speed

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.920 
so we drive in a normal car a low speed
to<00:00:29.619> make<00:00:29.800> our<00:00:30.309> notice<00:00:30.640> missus<00:00:31.119> what<00:00:31.599> I<00:00:31.630> have<00:00:31.899> a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
to make our notice missus what I have a

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.680 
to make our notice missus what I have a
selection<00:00:32.349> of<00:00:32.649> in<00:00:33.160> front<00:00:33.430> of<00:00:33.579> me<00:00:33.700> here

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
selection of in front of me here

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.750 
selection of in front of me here
and<00:00:34.870> we're<00:00:35.200> allowed<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.530> do<00:00:35.829> every<00:00:36.250> stage<00:00:36.489> two

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
and we're allowed to do every stage two

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.299 
and we're allowed to do every stage two
times<00:00:37.059> first<00:00:38.020> time<00:00:38.290> we<00:00:38.530> start<00:00:38.829> with<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.010> blank

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
times first time we start with a blank

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.280 
times first time we start with a blank
book<00:00:39.610> if<00:00:39.940> it's<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.239> new<00:00:40.390> stage<00:00:40.660> not<00:00:40.989> be<00:00:41.140> used

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
book if it's a new stage not be used

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.150 
book if it's a new stage not be used
from<00:00:41.589> another<00:00:42.579> year<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:44.260> drive<00:00:44.500> slowly<00:00:44.829> and

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
from another year we drive slowly and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.310 
from another year we drive slowly and
yes<00:00:45.339> he<00:00:45.489> tell<00:00:46.089> me<00:00:46.300> he<00:00:46.629> tried<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:47.019> describe

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
yes he tell me he tried to describe

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.739 
yes he tell me he tried to describe
every<00:00:47.769> corner<00:00:48.190> every<00:00:48.429> straighten<00:00:49.359> every

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
every corner every straighten every

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.799 
every corner every straighten every
crest<00:00:50.379> all<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.370> information<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:52.300> help<00:00:52.329> us<00:00:52.600> to

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
crest all the information to help us to

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:04.969 
crest all the information to help us to
drive

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.569 

so<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.939> write<00:01:06.240> everything<00:01:06.570> down<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.549> like<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
so I write everything down and my like a

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.300 
so I write everything down and my like a
shorthand<00:01:08.969> way<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.390> writing<00:01:09.829> so<00:01:10.829> on<00:01:11.039> the<00:01:11.130> rally

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
shorthand way of writing so on the rally

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.880 
shorthand way of writing so on the rally
it's<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.539> give<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.229> notes<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.710> some

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it's if I give this these notes to some

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.649 
it's if I give this these notes to some
other<00:01:14.009> guy<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.490> probably<00:01:14.939> difficult<00:01:15.149> for

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
other guy it's probably difficult for

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.109 
other guy it's probably difficult for
them<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.350> read<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.679> and<00:01:16.890> also<00:01:17.399> for<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> driver

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
them to to read it and also for a driver

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.569 
them to to read it and also for a driver
to<00:01:18.270> understand<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.860> everybody<00:01:20.189> has

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
to understand it because everybody has

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.350 
to understand it because everybody has
their<00:01:20.789> own<00:01:21.890> keep<00:01:22.890> an<00:01:23.039> excerpt<00:01:23.429> into<00:01:24.119> write

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
their own keep an excerpt into write

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:35.190 
their own keep an excerpt into write
five

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.720 

so<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:36.650> is<00:01:36.800> a<00:01:36.830> selection<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.550> notes

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
so this is a selection of the notes

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.900 
so this is a selection of the notes
we've<00:01:37.910> made<00:01:38.120> today<00:01:38.360> actually<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:40.700> can<00:01:40.880> look

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
we've made today actually you can look

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.130 
we've made today actually you can look
you'll<00:01:41.510> see<00:01:42.610> when<00:01:43.610> we<00:01:43.760> when<00:01:44.390> we<00:01:44.510> go<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.780> second

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
you'll see when we when we go the second

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.170 
you'll see when we when we go the second
time<00:01:45.260> we<00:01:45.380> make<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.620> lot<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.890> change<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.910> it's<00:01:47.090> a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
time we make a lot of change so it's a

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.200 
time we make a lot of change so it's a
big<00:01:47.360> mess<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.070> ever<00:01:49.070> nearly<00:01:49.430> every<00:01:49.760> corner<00:01:49.940> you

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
big mess so ever nearly every corner you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.660 
big mess so ever nearly every corner you
must<00:01:50.390> must<00:01:50.660> have<00:01:50.720> had<00:01:50.870> some<00:01:51.230> small<00:01:51.980> more<00:01:52.280> more

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
must must have had some small more more

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.550 
must must have had some small more more
information<00:01:53.270> or<00:01:53.510> change<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.050> corner<00:01:54.410> maybe

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
information or change the corner maybe

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:08.369 
information or change the corner maybe
slightly<00:01:55.070> slower<00:01:55.310> or<00:01:55.550> one<00:01:55.730> step<00:01:56.000> faster

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.410 

you<00:02:09.379> see<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.830> lot<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.429> information<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> lot<00:02:11.390> of

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
you see a lot of information on a lot of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.559 
you see a lot of information on a lot of
work<00:02:11.629> but<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.860> most<00:02:13.069> important<00:02:13.519> part<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:14.000> if

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
work but the most important part is if

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.119 
work but the most important part is if
you<00:02:14.690> don't<00:02:14.900> have<00:02:15.019> this<00:02:15.170> job<00:02:15.440> done<00:02:15.709> well<00:02:15.890> and

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
you don't have this job done well and

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:26.020 
you don't have this job done well and
sure<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:16.670> don't<00:02:16.879> drive<00:02:17.090> well<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.569> rally

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.090 

you
