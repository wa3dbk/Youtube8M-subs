that you guys can get a bit of a sense
for<00:01:10.030> how<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.840> looks<00:01:11.050> directly<00:01:11.320> out<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.070> hub

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
for how it looks directly out of the hub

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.030 
for how it looks directly out of the hub
same<00:01:12.730> camera<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:14.080> first<00:01:14.350> couple<00:01:14.620> of<00:01:14.770> flights

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
same camera the first couple of flights

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.860 
same camera the first couple of flights
i<00:01:15.250> had<00:01:15.870> really<00:01:16.870> had<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.430> two<00:01:18.870> little

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
i had really had one of two little

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.740 
i had really had one of two little
crashes<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.800> couldn't<00:01:21.340> get<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.479> plane

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
crashes and couldn't get the plane

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.880 
crashes and couldn't get the plane
stable<00:01:23.170> at<00:01:23.530> all<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.720> after<00:01:25.720> reading<00:01:26.590> up<00:01:26.740> a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
stable at all and after reading up a

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.980 
stable at all and after reading up a
little<00:01:27.100> bit<00:01:27.250> more<00:01:27.490> about<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.180> spy<00:01:28.450> hope<00:01:28.720> one

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
little bit more about the spy hope one

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.030 
little bit more about the spy hope one
of<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.229> things<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.710> i<00:01:30.159> found<00:01:30.970> was<00:01:31.360> that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
of the things that i found was that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.410 
of the things that i found was that
people<00:01:33.040> told<00:01:33.460> me<00:01:33.549> that<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.970> center<00:01:34.390> of

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
people told me that the center of

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.310 
people told me that the center of
gravity<00:01:34.570> in<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:36.430> stock<00:01:36.940> model<00:01:37.299> is<00:01:37.600> too<00:01:38.080> much

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
gravity in the stock model is too much

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.160 
gravity in the stock model is too much
towards<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.950> rear<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.640> i<00:01:40.299> think<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:41.020> that's

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
towards the rear and i think that that's

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.740 
towards the rear and i think that that's
party<00:01:41.650> also<00:01:41.890> because<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.640> battery<00:01:43.090> being<00:01:43.390> so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
party also because the battery being so

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.190 
party also because the battery being so
small<00:01:44.200> lens<00:01:45.040> so<00:01:45.400> little<00:01:45.760> weight<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:47.170> front

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
small lens so little weight to the front

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.620 
small lens so little weight to the front
of<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.920> airplane<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:49.030> kind<00:01:49.299> of<00:01:49.360> had

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
of the airplane that you kind of had

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.140 
of the airplane that you kind of had
this<00:01:49.900> waiting<00:01:50.470> in<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.920> aft<00:01:51.220> part<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:52.000> the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
this waiting in the aft part of the

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.740 
this waiting in the aft part of the
airplane<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:53.590> couldn't<00:01:54.369> penetrate

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
airplane and it couldn't penetrate

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.500 
airplane and it couldn't penetrate
through<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:56.770> even<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.460> small<00:01:57.790> breeze<00:01:58.090> even

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
through into even a small breeze even

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.859 
through into even a small breeze even
with<00:01:58.630> full<00:01:58.930> power<00:01:59.229> and<00:01:59.650> I<00:02:00.610> really<00:02:01.540> didn't

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
with full power and I really didn't

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.780 
with full power and I really didn't
solve<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.530> problem<00:02:02.920> by<00:02:03.040> changing<00:02:03.520> anything

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
solve the problem by changing anything

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.600 
solve the problem by changing anything
around<00:02:04.180> except<00:02:04.990> getting<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.070> slightly<00:02:06.280> bigger

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
around except getting it slightly bigger

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.179 
around except getting it slightly bigger
battery<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.409> is<00:02:08.439> one<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:08.979> ordered

look how that fits in absolutely

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.780 
look how that fits in absolutely
perfectly<00:02:30.999> in<00:02:31.209> there<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.719> it<00:02:32.709> lends<00:02:33.280> up<00:02:33.609> in

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
perfectly in there and it lends up in

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.209 
perfectly in there and it lends up in
just<00:02:34.090> enough<00:02:34.389> weight<00:02:34.689> to<00:02:34.719> the<00:02:35.019> front<00:02:35.189> so<00:02:36.189> that

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
just enough weight to the front so that

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.420 
just enough weight to the front so that
the<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.420> center<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.810> gravity<00:02:38.379> is<00:02:38.620> perfect<00:02:39.129> not

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
the the center of gravity is perfect not

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.670 
the the center of gravity is perfect not
you<00:02:39.700> can<00:02:39.879> see<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:41.129> headed<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.900> cannot

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
you can see that I headed this cannot

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.659 
you can see that I headed this cannot
disconnect<00:02:45.129> but<00:02:45.669> move<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.569> camera<00:02:47.499> module<00:02:48.489> a

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
disconnect but move the camera module a

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.140 
disconnect but move the camera module a
little<00:02:49.030> bit<00:02:49.379> off<00:02:50.379> its<00:02:50.919> footing<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.849> foam

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
little bit off its footing in the foam

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.110 
little bit off its footing in the foam
over<00:02:52.569> here<00:02:52.750> net<00:02:52.959> was<00:02:53.109> easily<00:02:53.530> done<00:02:54.120> because

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
over here net was easily done because

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.459 
over here net was easily done because
when<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.389> crash<00:02:55.629> the<00:02:55.780> plane<00:02:55.900> once<00:02:56.199> or<00:02:56.379> twice

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.469 
when you crash the plane once or twice

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.229 
when you crash the plane once or twice
it<00:02:56.769> comes<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.099> little<00:02:57.129> loose<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.879> pulled<00:02:58.150> it

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
it comes a little loose so I pulled it

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.629 
it comes a little loose so I pulled it
out<00:02:58.419> and<00:02:58.689> then<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.530> battery<00:02:59.919> fits<00:03:00.159> perfectly

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
out and then the battery fits perfectly

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.409 
out and then the battery fits perfectly
in<00:03:00.849> there<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.439> man<00:03:02.439> with<00:03:03.189> the<00:03:03.489> with<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.209> top

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
in there and man with the with the top

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.759 
in there and man with the with the top
on<00:03:04.629> that<00:03:05.169> just<00:03:05.439> fits<00:03:05.650> over<00:03:05.859> there<00:03:06.189> and<00:03:07.769> voila

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
on that just fits over there and voila

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.399 
on that just fits over there and voila
and<00:03:09.760> I'll<00:03:09.879> tell<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.540> has<00:03:10.870> been<00:03:11.109> fantastic
