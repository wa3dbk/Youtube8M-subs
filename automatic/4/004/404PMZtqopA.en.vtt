little bit lighter mainly because the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.450 
little bit lighter mainly because the

have<00:01:11.550> started<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:12.600> more<00:01:13.020> aerodynamically

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
have started think more aerodynamically

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
have started think more aerodynamically
I<00:01:13.980> mean<00:01:14.130> aerodynamics<00:01:14.790> hadn't<00:01:15.000> meant<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.210> thing

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
I mean aerodynamics hadn't meant a thing

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.010 
I mean aerodynamics hadn't meant a thing

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:40.100 
but the b12 just sounds absolutely
fantastic

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.660 

I<00:02:40.140> was<00:02:40.410> asked<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> drive<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> car<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.340> was<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.550> bit

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
I was asked to drive a car I was a bit

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.190 
I was asked to drive a car I was a bit
surprised<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.000> find<00:02:42.270> out<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.720> engine<00:02:43.080> in

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
surprised to find out that the engine in

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.900 
surprised to find out that the engine in
fact<00:02:43.410> had<00:02:43.620> been<00:02:43.800> rebuilt<00:02:44.010> by<00:02:44.430> Traco

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
fact had been rebuilt by Traco

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.880 
fact had been rebuilt by Traco
and<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.270> California<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.930> had<00:02:46.080> given<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.560> GT

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and in California I had given the GT

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.680 
and in California I had given the GT
forties<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:47.460> were<00:02:47.580> very<00:02:47.940> easy<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.420> drive

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
forties which were very easy to drive

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.720 
forties which were very easy to drive
this<00:02:49.320> car<00:02:49.560> wasn't<00:02:49.950> quite<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.280> easy<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.550> drive

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
this car wasn't quite as easy to drive

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.160 
this car wasn't quite as easy to drive
but<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.270> bit<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.660> step<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:52.080> in

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
but it was a bit of a step up in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.540 
but it was a bit of a step up in
performance<00:02:52.710> obviously<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.190> lot<00:02:53.340> quicker

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
performance obviously was a lot quicker

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.260 
performance obviously was a lot quicker
than<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.910> gt40

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.800 

we<00:03:01.080> were<00:03:01.200> doing<00:03:01.440> roundabout<00:03:01.860> 206<00:03:02.610> 208<00:03:03.270> when<00:03:03.660> we

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
we were doing roundabout 206 208 when we

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.420 
we were doing roundabout 206 208 when we
hit<00:03:03.930> NASCAR<00:03:04.680> turn<00:03:04.980> three

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
had a nasty habit of hitting on the roof

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.979 
had a nasty habit of hitting on the roof
especially<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.700> bumpy<00:03:36.000> tracks<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.510> Sebring

especially on bumpy tracks like Sebring
had<00:03:37.650> my<00:03:37.769> head<00:03:37.920> on<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.129> side<00:03:38.340> nice<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.580> have<00:03:38.819> to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
had my head on the side nice I have to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.119 
had my head on the side nice I have to
slump<00:03:39.209> down<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.540> seat<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.530> had<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.920> funny

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129

rear view mirror on the on the roof mark

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.080 
rear view mirror on the on the roof mark
thought<00:03:44.190> it'd<00:03:44.280> be<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.400> good<00:03:44.519> idea<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:45.000> would

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
thought it'd be a good idea that would

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.190 
thought it'd be a good idea that would
cut<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> hole<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.660> roof<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.049> could

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
cut a hole in the roof and you could

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.170 
cut a hole in the roof and you could
look<00:03:46.409> at<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.739> rear<00:03:47.010> view<00:03:47.400> by<00:03:47.790> looking<00:03:48.090> through

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
look at the rear view by looking through

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.360 
look at the rear view by looking through
the<00:03:48.299> hole<00:03:48.450> in<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.840> room<00:03:48.989> which<00:03:49.980> for<00:03:50.190> him<00:03:50.310> was

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
the hole in the room which for him was

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.800 
the hole in the room which for him was
all<00:03:50.670> right<00:03:50.819> for<00:03:50.849> me<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.269> wasn't<00:03:51.510> too<00:03:51.599> good

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
all right for me it wasn't too good

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.150 
all right for me it wasn't too good
because<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.049> was<00:03:52.230> up<00:03:52.379> another<00:03:52.799> couple<00:03:53.129> of
