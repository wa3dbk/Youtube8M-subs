build<00:02:31.180> quality<00:02:31.319> speak<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.500> down<00:02:32.650> there<00:02:32.920> and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
build quality speak it down there and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.880 
build quality speak it down there and
first<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.860> all<00:02:35.980> we<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:36.970> put<00:02:37.060> my<00:02:37.209> sim<00:02:37.360> card<00:02:37.390> in

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
first of all we just put my sim card in

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.309 
first of all we just put my sim card in
so<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> comparison<00:02:39.459> between<00:02:39.489> two<00:02:40.390> sims<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.110> top

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
so a comparison between two sims the top

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.640 
so a comparison between two sims the top
one<00:02:41.500> there<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.250> regular<00:02:43.030> sim<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.780> that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
one there is the regular sim and that

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.710 
one there is the regular sim and that
one<00:02:44.799> there's<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.220> market<00:02:45.549> assume<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.359> at

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
one there's the market assume that at

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.759 
one there's the market assume that at
the<00:02:46.810> moment<00:02:46.959> only<00:02:47.739> be<00:02:48.190> iphone<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:50.620> the

and the little casing pop out can you
get<00:03:11.609> some<00:03:12.609> code

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.890 

so<00:03:22.209> about<00:03:22.360> this<00:03:22.510> everyone<00:03:24.540> should<00:03:25.540> do<00:03:25.780> this
