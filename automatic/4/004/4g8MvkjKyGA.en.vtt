00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.519
 I definitely want to have half story conversations she has her own app slimmer 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.109
 line and practice 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:14.169
 it is and that I know this subplan more about before we enter that party arena then 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.639
 get out again 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.489
 she owns a diet program but we go on first 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:24.109
 christmas eve you come from nursing how did you make the switch? 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.759
 from nursing after a slimming egg joseph well I am 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.160
 I think four years ago I was just before I was 50 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 and I still want to lose a few pounds so that's why I eat this 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.360
 program have discovered that both of them have successfully lost a second time 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.360
 and then his girlfriend told me that you can't do that with you yourself 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.450
 ultimately a bit of entrepreneurship yourself and you're ready to go 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.190
 most experience to be avoided 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.430
 so not yet clear but to think briefly and then my own line 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.330
 arise 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.870
 Miami's line has its own 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.590
 bread you see diet 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.630
 what can you say there is a little more clarity about how 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.050
 that works well yes it is an instant of protein diet supplemented with them the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.150
 correct nutritional supplements because the purchases always arise 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.940
 with the protein diet 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.900
 our products that have not been selected are highlighted as it were 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.700
 jacob himself at the supplier may test 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 That is why we have achieved this year also our own 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.660
 Trademark law has been introduced and, as a crowning glory at work, actually one 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.790
 piece of own packaging which makes the product very unique in itself 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.970
 so it actually sticks out head and shoulders above others 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.250
 average porters who eat and you actually have four meals a day 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.890
 And then you are talking about everything about shopping about hot drinks 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.860
 meals 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.829
 boats anp also pancakes 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.619
 jester reports hartford the spaghetti you can have it so it all sounds nice 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.859
 I do not consider whether you have but the temporary with the necessary ground and 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.880
 the supplements of course do 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.570
 and with that actually very good at being the names the emphasis is on a leaky one 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.430
 that we also advise and guide people and what it is of course 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.160
 on your own it is very difficult to sustain 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.869
 he of course needed a stick behind the door 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.129
 but the advice and guidance to do this in a correct manner 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.310
 to do that is of course very important because there are always contra 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.339
 indications people use medication etcetera 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:22.739
 so you have to be knowledgeable to get people on the road properly and responsibly 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.239
 and also keep a different diet that can learn to 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.949
 being able to keep on weight 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.949
 well actually we have only been last year 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.539
 do you come that there are different people from all around who are grabbing 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.819
 always find my own line of concepts 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.529
 because other people are of course also very successful with our concept 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.459
 lost weight 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.700
 and hence that idea came up to start a branch so good people 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.429
 to search 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:52.459
 train them properly and actually keep them elsewhere with the right expertise 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.749
 let people lose weight with our own line concept and it is now 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:00.879
 in the meantime in gorcum and a new card and in mariaheide 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.979
 five bans 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.969
 a stupid one can be started a few weeks ago 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.849
 10 then there are more waiting for the nomination as the why with the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.889
 successful concept 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.779
 in the meantime we are working on the road who now certainly thanks a lot for this interview 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.810
 I wish you a very Merry Christmas and good luck the distance practice thanks 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.970
