know<00:02:03.030> it'll<00:02:03.210> work<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.390> fine<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.049> way<00:02:04.259> too

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
know it'll work just fine that way too

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.910 
know it'll work just fine that way too
so<00:02:04.950> there<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.909> go<00:02:06.090> take<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> look<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.439> mount

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
so there you go take a look at the mount

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.880 
so there you go take a look at the mount
itself<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.670> currently<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.599> backwards

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
itself I currently have it backwards

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.500 
itself I currently have it backwards
which<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.920> awesome<00:02:11.489> actually<00:02:12.150> does<00:02:12.420> really

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
which is awesome actually does really

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.280 
which is awesome actually does really
matter<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> cool

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
matter is the cool

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.440 
matter is the cool
thing<00:02:13.469> about<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.099> it's<00:02:14.909> pretty<00:02:15.180> much

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
thing about this is it's pretty much

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.149 
thing about this is it's pretty much
infinitely<00:02:16.110> adjustable<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.829> mount<00:02:16.980> it

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
infinitely adjustable you can mount it

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.110 
infinitely adjustable you can mount it
this<00:02:17.340> way<00:02:17.609> if<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:17.939> like<00:02:18.180> or<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:19.290> way<00:02:19.590> or<00:02:20.120> you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
this way if you like or this way or you

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.619 
this way if you like or this way or you
know<00:02:21.299> perhaps<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> windshield<00:02:23.579> and<00:02:23.879> mount

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
know perhaps to the windshield and mount

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.509 
know perhaps to the windshield and mount
it<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.959> way<00:02:25.230> there<00:02:25.859> are<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.010> lot<00:02:26.159> of<00:02:26.189> different

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
it this way there are a lot of different

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.179 
it this way there are a lot of different
ways<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.359> can<00:02:27.569> go<00:02:27.689> ahead<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.989> mount<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.829> so

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
ways you can go ahead and mount this so

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.460 
ways you can go ahead and mount this so
you<00:02:29.819> should<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.209> able<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.480> find<00:02:30.689> a<00:02:30.810> spot<00:02:31.109> in

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
you should be able to find a spot in

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.069 
you should be able to find a spot in
your<00:02:31.769> car<00:02:32.310> where<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.390> gonna<00:02:33.540> work<00:02:33.840> pretty

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
your car where this is gonna work pretty

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.110 
your car where this is gonna work pretty
well<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.430> there<00:02:35.609> you<00:02:35.730> go<00:02:35.879> that's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
well for you so there you go that's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.009 
well for you so there you go that's
pretty<00:02:36.540> awesome<00:02:36.829> so<00:02:38.480> adjusting<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:39.750> quite

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
pretty awesome so adjusting it is quite

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.039 
pretty awesome so adjusting it is quite
simple<00:02:40.439> you<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.920> dial<00:02:41.370> here<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:42.049> this

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
simple you have a dial here and this

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.619 
simple you have a dial here and this
mounts<00:02:43.709> basically<00:02:44.219> on<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> ball<00:02:44.760> joint<00:02:44.790> which

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
mounts basically on a ball joint which

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.660 
mounts basically on a ball joint which
allows<00:02:45.659> it<00:02:46.109> to<00:02:46.139> swivel<00:02:46.590> around<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:47.099> so<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
allows it to swivel around like so and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.289 
allows it to swivel around like so and
also<00:02:48.150> rotate<00:02:48.769> 360<00:02:49.769> degrees<00:02:50.609> you<00:02:50.730> can<00:02:50.909> spin<00:02:51.180> it

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
also rotate 360 degrees you can spin it

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.569 
also rotate 360 degrees you can spin it
around<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:52.739> it's<00:02:52.919> infinitely<00:02:53.400> adjustable

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
around so it's infinitely adjustable

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.369 
around so it's infinitely adjustable
that<00:02:54.510> way<00:02:56.450> put<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.629> back<00:02:57.780> together<00:02:57.959> here

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
that way put that back together here

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.580 
that way put that back together here
again<00:03:00.230> easy<00:03:01.230> no<00:03:02.129> tool<00:03:02.579> required<00:03:03.500> kind<00:03:04.500> of

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
again easy no tool required kind of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.170 
again easy no tool required kind of
thing<00:03:04.769> going<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.099> here<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.819> then<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.060> have

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
thing going on here and then you have

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.990 
thing going on here and then you have
this<00:03:06.329> one<00:03:06.569> rest<00:03:07.560> knob<00:03:07.769> right<00:03:08.040> here<00:03:08.099> which

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
this one rest knob right here which

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.199 
this one rest knob right here which
allows<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.319> adjust<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.829> angle<00:03:11.209> basically

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
allows you to adjust the angle basically

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.929 
allows you to adjust the angle basically
that<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.629> it<00:03:12.810> mounted<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.489> there<00:03:14.760> you

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
that you have it mounted on so there you

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.879 
that you have it mounted on so there you
go<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.269> can<00:03:15.329> mount<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.989> this<00:03:16.230> way

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
go you can mount it this way

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.309 
go you can mount it this way
and<00:03:16.980> then<00:03:17.669> also<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.750> adjustment

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
and then also you know the adjustment

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.080 
and then also you know the adjustment
built<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.829> way<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.069> there's<00:03:20.519> quite<00:03:20.729> a<00:03:20.819> bit

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
built in that way so there's quite a bit

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.659 
built in that way so there's quite a bit
of<00:03:21.419> adjustment<00:03:21.870> built<00:03:22.650> into<00:03:22.979> this<00:03:23.129> thing<00:03:23.430> so

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
of adjustment built into this thing so

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:28.369 
of adjustment built into this thing so
let's<00:03:24.510> go<00:03:24.690> ahead<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:26.510> take<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.690> out<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
let's go ahead and take it out to the

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.449 
let's go ahead and take it out to the
car<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.900> show<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.959> how<00:03:31.169> it<00:03:31.290> looks<00:03:31.319> when<00:03:32.280> it's
