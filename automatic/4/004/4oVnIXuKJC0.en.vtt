00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
pretty easily but I acknowledge that it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.410 
pretty easily but I acknowledge that it
is<00:00:36.750> quite<00:00:37.469> rare<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.460> find<00:00:38.489> amongst<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
various weapons that you can get now

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.549 
various weapons that you can get now
from<00:00:41.250> helicopter<00:00:41.969> crash<00:00:42.180> science<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.410> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
from helicopter crash science now this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.139 
from helicopter crash science now this
weapon<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:43.950> relatively<00:00:44.399> new<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.940> game

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
weapon is relatively new to the game

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.729 
weapon is relatively new to the game
it's<00:00:45.480> been<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.719> there<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> while<00:00:46.230> now<00:00:46.530> but

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it's been in there for a while now but

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.010 
it's been in there for a while now but
it<00:00:47.520> wasn't<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.910> there<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> original<00:00:48.390> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it wasn't in there in the original it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
it wasn't in there in the original it
was<00:00:49.079> only<00:00:49.440> released<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.520> last<00:00:51.000> couple<00:00:51.300> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
was only released in a last couple of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.069 
was only released in a last couple of
patches<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.160> pretty<00:00:53.489> new<00:00:53.699> weapon<00:00:54.090> it's

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
patches so it is pretty new weapon it's

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.580 
patches so it is pretty new weapon it's
a<00:00:55.140> great<00:00:55.260> addition<00:00:55.590> I'd<00:00:55.890> say<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.789> its

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
a great addition I'd say because of its

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.930 
a great addition I'd say because of its
unique<00:00:58.590> ability<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.340> having<00:00:59.609> two<00:00:59.820> different

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
unique ability of having two different

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.290 
unique ability of having two different
scopes<00:01:00.390> I'll<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.930> into<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.920> sec<00:01:02.300> about

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
scopes I'll go into that in a sec about

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.740 
scopes I'll go into that in a sec about
ammunition<00:01:04.080> its<00:01:04.379> primary<00:01:05.570> ammunition<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
ammunition its primary ammunition is a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.320 
ammunition its primary ammunition is a
g36<00:01:07.439> mag<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.280> also<00:01:08.340> take<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.970> stand

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
g36 mag but it can also take the stand

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.890 
g36 mag but it can also take the stand
mags<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> stand<00:01:10.500> SD<00:01:10.979> mags<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.479> weapon

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
mags and the stand SD mags the weapon

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.649 
mags and the stand SD mags the weapon
itself<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.920> both<00:01:14.330> close<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
itself is good for both close and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.830 
itself is good for both close and
medium-range<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.939> guess<00:01:18.270> I'll<00:01:18.420> sure<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
medium-range and I guess I'll sure the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.039 
medium-range and I guess I'll sure the
medium<00:01:19.710> range<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.490> close<00:01:20.670> range<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.330> so

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
medium range the close range now so

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.620 
medium range the close range now so
you've<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.740> standard<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:24.180> default

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
you've got your standard the default

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.270 
you've got your standard the default
scope<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.439> oom<00:01:25.560> den<00:01:25.770> 1<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.220> if

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
scope is like this is oom den 1 but if

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
scope is like this is oom den 1 but if
you<00:01:26.369> hit<00:01:26.520> forward<00:01:26.850> slash<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you hit forward slash on it you go to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.520 
you hit forward slash on it you go to
the<00:01:29.310> close<00:01:29.520> range<00:01:29.820> mode<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.200> drop<00:01:31.409> this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the close range mode now just drop this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.399 
the close range mode now just drop this
zombie<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:33.110> there<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:36.140> now<00:01:37.140> pissed

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
zombie here there we go and now pissed

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.140 
zombie here there we go and now pissed
off<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:37.979> well

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.940 

and<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.600> other<00:01:42.720> guy<00:01:42.990> he<00:01:43.470> doesn't<00:01:43.740> seem<00:01:43.830> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and this other guy he doesn't seem to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.040 
and this other guy he doesn't seem to
give<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> fuck<00:01:44.160> all<00:01:45.120> right<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:45.870> a

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
give a fuck all right so that's a

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.010 
give a fuck all right so that's a
close-range<00:01:46.470> scope<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:48.020> extremely

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
close-range scope it's extremely

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.160 
close-range scope it's extremely
effective<00:01:49.730> had<00:01:50.730> this<00:01:50.880> weapon<00:01:51.300> because<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.810> its

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
effective had this weapon because of its

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.680 
effective had this weapon because of its
ability<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.710> toggle<00:01:52.920> between<00:01:53.100> different

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
ability to toggle between different

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.630 
ability to toggle between different
distances<00:01:54.690> so<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.440> you're<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.620> a<00:01:55.680> city<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.490> can

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
distances so if you're in a city you can

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.010 
distances so if you're in a city you can
toggle<00:01:56.880> Odin<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.330> if<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.480> person's<00:01:57.810> running

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
toggle Odin and if a person's running

long distance version of it and stomp me

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.710 
long distance version of it and stomp me
it's<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.190> 12<00:02:05.190> circles<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.910> think<00:02:06.090> he's<00:02:06.210> stuck

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
it's just 12 circles I think he's stuck

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.820 
it's just 12 circles I think he's stuck
in<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.080> um<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.880> light<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.210> that<00:02:09.590> there<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.740> go

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
in that um the light of that there we go

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.910 
in that um the light of that there we go
another<00:02:11.250> headshot<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:12.360> also<00:02:12.600> as<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.680> see

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
another headshot now also as you can see

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.700 
another headshot now also as you can see
there's<00:02:14.720> three<00:02:15.720> different<00:02:15.840> markers<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
there's three different markers in the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.280 
there's three different markers in the
center<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.520> first<00:02:17.790> marker<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.390> pretty<00:02:19.080> close

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
center the first marker is pretty close

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.350 
center the first marker is pretty close
range<00:02:19.620> actually<00:02:20.370> you're<00:02:20.640> pretty<00:02:20.760> much<00:02:20.880> better

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
range actually you're pretty much better

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.540 
range actually you're pretty much better
off<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.780> switching<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.130> other<00:02:23.220> scope

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
off just switching to the other scope

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.790 
off just switching to the other scope
for<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.630> range<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.380> want<00:02:25.560> it's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
for that range but if you want it's

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.910 
for that range but if you want it's
mainly<00:02:26.340> between<00:02:26.600> 100<00:02:27.600> 200<00:02:27.930> meters<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.830> then

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
mainly between 100 200 meters and then

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
mainly between 100 200 meters and then
you<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.130> slowly<00:02:29.370> work<00:02:29.580> your<00:02:29.730> way<00:02:29.910> down

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
you want to slowly work your way down

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.120 
you want to slowly work your way down
the<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.430> first<00:02:32.430> one<00:02:32.880> down<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.560> 600<00:02:34.560> meters<00:02:34.860> if

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the the first one down is 600 meters if

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.820 
the the first one down is 600 meters if
you<00:02:35.400> got<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.120> right<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> zombie's<00:02:37.440> head<00:02:37.590> or<00:02:37.770> a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
you got it right on a zombie's head or a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.040 
you got it right on a zombie's head or a
player's<00:02:38.070> head<00:02:38.340> at<00:02:38.580> 600<00:02:39.480> meters<00:02:39.720> you'll<00:02:39.870> get

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
player's head at 600 meters you'll get

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.290 
player's head at 600 meters you'll get
it<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:41.220> second<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.140> 900<00:02:43.140> meters<00:02:43.440> and

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
it and the second one is 900 meters and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.660 
it and the second one is 900 meters and
so<00:02:45.300> it's<00:02:45.870> effective<00:02:46.290> range<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.770> 400<00:02:47.340> meters

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
so it's effective range is 400 meters

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.030 
so it's effective range is 400 meters
but<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.120> does<00:02:48.300> give<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:49.170> little<00:02:49.470> element

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
but it does give that a little element

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.690 
but it does give that a little element
of<00:02:50.280> some<00:02:50.550> long<00:02:50.730> range<00:02:50.760> firing<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.080> really

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
of some long range firing if you really

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.360 
of some long range firing if you really
if<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.209> target<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.709> not<00:02:55.709> moving<00:02:56.100> at<00:02:56.190> all<00:02:56.220> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
if you the target is not moving at all a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.979 
if you the target is not moving at all a
completely<00:02:56.970> stationary<00:02:57.209> then<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.780> can

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
completely stationary then you can

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.780 
completely stationary then you can
really<00:02:58.350> pick<00:02:58.560> off<00:02:58.680> people<00:02:59.070> with<00:02:59.370> these<00:02:59.610> little

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
really pick off people with these little

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.380 
really pick off people with these little
gauges<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:01.280> honestly<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.700> you'll<00:03:03.300> be

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
gauges but honestly it's you'll be

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.600 
gauges but honestly it's you'll be
hard-pressed<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:04.530> really<00:03:04.890> hit<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.100> person<00:03:05.340> at

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
hard-pressed to really hit a person at

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.940 
hard-pressed to really hit a person at
that<00:03:05.760> range<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.330> weapon<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.830> know

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
that range with this weapon but you know

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.490 
that range with this weapon but you know
the<00:03:08.580> option<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.060> there<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.870> pretty<00:03:10.080> nifty

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the option is there so it's pretty nifty

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.370 
the option is there so it's pretty nifty
thing<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.550> weapon<00:03:12.380> another

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
thing to have with the weapon another

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.710 
thing to have with the weapon another
thing<00:03:14.190> about<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.760> which<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.209> pretty<00:03:15.360> much<00:03:15.480> it's

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
thing about it which is pretty much it's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.080 
thing about it which is pretty much it's
only<00:03:16.050> criticism<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.100> weapon<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.940> it

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
only criticism of this weapon is that it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.020 
only criticism of this weapon is that it
is<00:03:18.269> freaking<00:03:18.870> massive<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.650> takes<00:03:19.890> hub<00:03:20.160> what

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
is freaking massive it takes hub what

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.190 
is freaking massive it takes hub what
about<00:03:21.380> 22<00:03:22.380> h<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.830> three-eighths<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
about 22 h the three-eighths of the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.490 
about 22 h the three-eighths of the
screen<00:03:25.200> it's<00:03:25.320> pretty<00:03:25.560> pretty<00:03:26.340> massive<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:28.350> put

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
screen it's pretty pretty massive to put

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.259 
screen it's pretty pretty massive to put
it<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.680> comparison<00:03:29.190> here's<00:03:29.430> like<00:03:29.580> my<00:03:29.790> sidearm

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
it to comparison here's like my sidearm

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.720 
it to comparison here's like my sidearm
look<00:03:31.110> how<00:03:31.230> much<00:03:31.350> space<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.830> takes<00:03:32.040> up<00:03:32.250> like

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
look how much space that takes up like

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.270 
look how much space that takes up like
tiny<00:03:33.480> tiny<00:03:34.019> bit<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.560> then<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.830> just<00:03:34.980> get<00:03:35.160> to

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
tiny tiny bit and then you just get to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.570 
tiny tiny bit and then you just get to
this<00:03:35.400> weapon<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.600> bottom<00:03:37.560> right<00:03:37.800> side<00:03:38.280> of

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
this weapon and the bottom right side of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.910 
this weapon and the bottom right side of
the<00:03:38.670> screen<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:39.330> gone<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.500> guess<00:03:40.739> if

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
the screen is just gone but I guess if

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.979 
the screen is just gone but I guess if
you<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.250> wanted<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.790> walk<00:03:42.269> around<00:03:42.420> currently

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
you just wanted to walk around currently

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.170 
you just wanted to walk around currently
like<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.890> even<00:03:44.160> then<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.910> in

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
like that and even then like in

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.280 
like that and even then like in
comparison<00:03:45.959> like<00:03:46.470> that's<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.340> yeah<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.260> a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
comparison like that's just yeah it is a

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.069 
comparison like that's just yeah it is a
big<00:03:49.650> gun<00:03:49.889> like<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.670> don't<00:03:50.820> think<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.359> sum<00:03:52.019> of

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
big gun like I don't think the sum of

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.860 
big gun like I don't think the sum of
the<00:03:52.139> sniper<00:03:52.380> rifles<00:03:52.859> really<00:03:53.130> compared<00:03:53.579> to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
the sniper rifles really compared to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.530 
the sniper rifles really compared to
how<00:03:54.049> biggest<00:03:54.470> weapon<00:03:54.769> is<00:03:54.890> but<00:03:55.250> with<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.360> it

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
how biggest weapon is but with that it

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.930 
how biggest weapon is but with that it
does<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.349> know<00:03:57.409> you<00:03:57.500> sacrifice<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.250> kind<00:03:58.849> of

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
does you know you sacrifice that kind of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.740 
does you know you sacrifice that kind of
situational<00:03:59.810> awareness<00:03:59.900> with<00:04:01.629> having<00:04:02.629> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
situational awareness with having the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.369 
situational awareness with having the
ability<00:04:02.930> just<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.379> toggle<00:04:03.650> yeah<00:04:04.450> user<00:04:05.450> which<00:04:06.080> I

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
ability just to toggle yeah user which I

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.860 
ability just to toggle yeah user which I
reckon<00:04:06.890> is<00:04:07.099> a<00:04:07.129> awesome<00:04:07.580> feature<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.299> have<00:04:08.420> this

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
reckon is a awesome feature to have this

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
reckon is a awesome feature to have this
is<00:04:09.110> pretty<00:04:09.739> rare<00:04:09.950> with<00:04:10.340> weapons<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.269> g<00:04:12.200> 36<00:04:12.500> k

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
is pretty rare with weapons the g 36 k

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.910 
is pretty rare with weapons the g 36 k
has<00:04:13.250> it<00:04:13.459> as<00:04:13.579> well<00:04:14.230> like<00:04:15.230> i<00:04:15.319> said<00:04:15.349> the<00:04:15.799> only

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
has it as well like i said the only

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.740 
has it as well like i said the only
differences<00:04:16.790> between<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.329> weapon<00:04:17.660> the

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
differences between this weapon the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.120 
differences between this weapon the
other<00:04:17.870> one<00:04:18.079> that's<00:04:18.229> why<00:04:18.410> I'm<00:04:18.500> completely<00:04:18.889> I'm

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
other one that's why I'm completely I'm

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.830 
other one that's why I'm completely I'm
really<00:04:19.489> including<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.239> two<00:04:20.359> weapons<00:04:20.690> even

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
really including the two weapons even

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.200 
really including the two weapons even
though<00:04:21.049> i<00:04:21.079> don't<00:04:21.260> have<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.590> g<00:04:21.769> 36<00:04:22.070> k<00:04:22.490> on<00:04:22.699> me<00:04:22.910> i'm

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
though i don't have the g 36 k on me i'm

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.090 
though i don't have the g 36 k on me i'm
including<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.750> two<00:04:23.900> together<00:04:24.050> because<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.949> is

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
including the two together because it is

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.020 
including the two together because it is
just<00:04:25.490> so<00:04:26.270> similar<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.870> two<00:04:27.020> weapons<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:28.030> its

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
just so similar the two weapons and its

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.350 
just so similar the two weapons and its
fire<00:04:29.539> rate<00:04:29.780> is<00:04:29.930> pretty<00:04:30.430> pretty<00:04:31.430> good<00:04:31.639> so<00:04:31.850> in

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
fire rate is pretty pretty good so in

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.469 
fire rate is pretty pretty good so in
terms<00:04:32.630> of<00:04:32.870> using<00:04:33.199> this<00:04:33.289> for<00:04:33.620> both<00:04:34.460> say<00:04:35.210> player

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
terms of using this for both say player

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.990 
terms of using this for both say player
killing<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.350> just<00:04:37.039> getting<00:04:37.250> around<00:04:37.340> places

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
killing and just getting around places

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.330 
killing and just getting around places
this<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.270> probably<00:04:38.449> one<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.840> high<00:04:39.020> end

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
this is probably one of the high end

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.100 
this is probably one of the high end
medium<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.610> short<00:04:40.639> range<00:04:41.240> weapons<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:41.990> you

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
medium to short range weapons that you

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.250 
medium to short range weapons that you
can<00:04:42.260> get<00:04:42.470> like<00:04:43.160> ash<00:04:43.760> jose<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.330> probably<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:44.900> the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
can get like ash jose is probably in the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.070 
can get like ash jose is probably in the
the<00:04:45.530> top<00:04:45.680> three<00:04:46.039> in<00:04:46.280> terms<00:04:46.789> of<00:04:47.090> getting<00:04:47.870> around

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
the top three in terms of getting around

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.570 
the top three in terms of getting around
so<00:04:48.470> it's<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.830> really<00:04:49.100> high-end<00:04:49.970> weapon<00:04:51.250> if<00:04:52.250> it

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
so it's a really high-end weapon if it

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.379 
so it's a really high-end weapon if it
got<00:04:52.940> very<00:04:53.150> lucky<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:53.630> get<00:04:53.750> this<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.410> fast<00:04:54.440> and

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
got very lucky to get this so fast and

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.180 
got very lucky to get this so fast and
without<00:04:56.389> having<00:04:56.840> anyone<00:04:57.110> kill<00:04:57.380> me<00:04:57.560> over<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:57.919> so

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
without having anyone kill me over it so

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.150 
without having anyone kill me over it so
hit<00:04:59.060> so<00:04:59.360> yeah<00:04:59.750> it's<00:04:59.900> pretty<00:05:00.050> much<00:05:00.229> all<00:05:00.860> i<00:05:00.919> have

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
hit so yeah it's pretty much all i have

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.029 
hit so yeah it's pretty much all i have
to<00:05:01.220> say<00:05:01.310> about<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:02.289> once<00:05:03.289> again<00:05:03.410> helicopter

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
to say about it once again helicopter

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.589 
to say about it once again helicopter
crash<00:05:04.250> sites<00:05:04.520> is<00:05:04.910> the<00:05:05.000> only<00:05:05.120> place<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:05.479> can

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
crash sites is the only place you can

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.909 
crash sites is the only place you can
find<00:05:05.660> it<00:05:06.139> got<00:05:06.770> toggle<00:05:07.450> zoom<00:05:08.560> which<00:05:09.560> is<00:05:09.710> great

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
find it got toggle zoom which is great

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.490 
find it got toggle zoom which is great
and<00:05:10.160> it<00:05:10.490> really<00:05:10.700> takes<00:05:10.970> about<00:05:11.210> two<00:05:11.690> two<00:05:12.200> shots

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
and it really takes about two two shots

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.920 
and it really takes about two two shots
to<00:05:12.620> kill<00:05:12.800> a<00:05:12.860> player<00:05:13.099> and<00:05:13.370> as<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:14.539> can<00:05:14.660> see<00:05:14.690> like

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
to kill a player and as you can see like

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.839 
to kill a player and as you can see like
one<00:05:15.139> shot<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.410> killer<00:05:15.590> zombie<00:05:15.950> so<00:05:16.220> it's<00:05:16.820> a

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
one shot the killer zombie so it's a

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.210 
one shot the killer zombie so it's a
great<00:05:17.000> weapon<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:18.349> great<00:05:18.710> addition<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:19.099> the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220
