00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
the ocean swimming is a very

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.469 
the ocean swimming is a very
individualized<00:00:32.719> sports<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:33.620> surfing<00:00:34.069> you<00:00:34.640> you

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:35.479 
individualized sports so surfing you you

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.270 
individualized sports so surfing you you
pick<00:00:35.690> one<00:00:35.870> way<00:00:35.989> if<00:00:36.109> you<00:00:36.199> want<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.409> catch<00:00:36.559> you

for them

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.529 
for them
I<00:02:00.130> think<00:02:01.130> it's<00:02:01.399> very<00:02:01.520> important<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.450> know

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
I think it's very important to you know

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.510 
I think it's very important to you know
to<00:02:02.600> be<00:02:02.840> comfortable<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.830> not<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.100> ring<00:02:04.340> and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
to be comfortable and not to ring and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.670 
to be comfortable and not to ring and
how<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.670> are<00:02:04.910> and<00:02:05.149> you<00:02:06.050> know<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.289> shows<00:02:06.530> in

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
how you are and you know that shows in

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.680 
how you are and you know that shows in
surfing<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.100> it's<00:02:07.369> not<00:02:07.580> like<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:08.450> going

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
surfing that it's not like just going

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.150 
surfing that it's not like just going
out<00:02:08.840> there<00:02:08.989> having<00:02:09.200> fun<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.679> think<00:02:09.739> if<00:02:10.009> you

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
out there having fun and I think if you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.320 
out there having fun and I think if you
are<00:02:10.250> as<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.489> find<00:02:10.700> then<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:11.000> feel

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
are as you find then you feel

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.030 
are as you find then you feel
comfortable<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.900> what<00:02:12.080> you're<00:02:12.260> doing<00:02:12.530> you

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
comfortable and what you're doing you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.530 
comfortable and what you're doing you
automatically<00:02:13.600> pretty<00:02:14.600> good

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
automatically pretty good

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.480 
automatically pretty good
you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490
