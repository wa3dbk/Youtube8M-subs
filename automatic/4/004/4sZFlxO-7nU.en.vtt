four<00:02:02.799> habits<00:02:03.189> that<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.549> used<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.880> fly<00:02:04.149> on<00:02:04.390> the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
four habits that I used to fly on the

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.990 
four habits that I used to fly on the
belly<00:02:04.719> of<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.200> Phantom<00:02:05.710> but<00:02:06.130> when<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.520> put<00:02:06.850> it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
belly of the Phantom but when I put it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.259 
belly of the Phantom but when I put it
here<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.570> know<00:02:08.560> there's<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.009> increased<00:02:09.910> and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
here I know there's a increased and

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.470 
here I know there's a increased and
video<00:02:10.690> distance<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.069> could<00:02:12.459> be<00:02:12.580> flying<00:02:13.209> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
video distance so I could be flying a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.320 
video distance so I could be flying a
little<00:02:13.870> bit<00:02:14.200> far<00:02:14.590> further<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> matter<00:02:16.269> of

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
little bit far further as a matter of

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.860 
little bit far further as a matter of
fact<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.690> was<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.989> lot<00:02:17.200> further<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.660> more

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
fact it was a lot further so if the more

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.410 
fact it was a lot further so if the more
you<00:02:19.989> have<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.410> VTX

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you have this VTX

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.900 
you have this VTX
more<00:02:22.420> out<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.380> Phantom's<00:02:24.040> body<00:02:24.370> whole

batteries and I'm gonna be trying out

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.790 
batteries and I'm gonna be trying out
that<00:04:34.620> yeah<00:04:34.860> total<00:04:35.280> 50<00:04:35.789> 400<00:04:36.389> milliamps<00:04:37.289> in

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
that yeah total 50 400 milliamps in

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.080 
that yeah total 50 400 milliamps in
comparison<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:39.270> Phantom<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:40.110> my<00:04:40.710> has<00:04:40.889> a

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
comparison to the Phantom to my has a

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.480 
comparison to the Phantom to my has a
5200<00:04:42.090> milliamp<00:04:42.990> battery<00:04:43.080> we'll<00:04:44.070> see<00:04:44.280> how<00:04:44.430> that

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
5200 milliamp battery we'll see how that

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.850 
5200 milliamp battery we'll see how that
goes<00:04:44.850> and<00:04:45.210> in<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.960> future<00:04:46.410> video

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
goes and in a future video
