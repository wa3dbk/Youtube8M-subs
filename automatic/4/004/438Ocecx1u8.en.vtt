you look up to grown-up you 90 on the
court<00:02:18.200> playing<00:02:19.200> against<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:21.110> we<00:02:22.110> probably

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
court playing against so we probably

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.259 
court playing against so we probably
like<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.160> couple<00:02:23.280> more<00:02:23.550> guys<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.849> play

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
against them but it's just a different

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.039 
against them but it's just a different
feeling<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.150> at<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.269> same<00:02:27.450> time<00:02:27.599> it's<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.900> good

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
feeling but at the same time it's a good

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
got is rookie that's so much to learn

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.440 
got is rookie that's so much to learn
and<00:03:28.440> hadn't<00:03:29.160> spent<00:03:29.670> any<00:03:29.730> time<00:03:29.849> out<00:03:30.239> there<00:03:30.389> in

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
and hadn't spent any time out there in

and hadn't spent any time out there in
the<00:03:30.510> preseason<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.849> you<00:03:32.849> see<00:03:33.420> video<00:03:33.750> of

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
the preseason and you see video of

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.229 
the preseason and you see video of
yourself<00:03:33.989> they<00:03:34.650> critique<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.519> obviously<00:03:35.940> so

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
yourself they critique it obviously so

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.720 
yourself they critique it obviously so
that<00:03:36.930> be<00:03:37.109> somewhat<00:03:37.829> difficult<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.340> do<00:03:38.489> that

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
that be somewhat difficult to do that

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.009 
that be somewhat difficult to do that
when<00:03:39.829> expected<00:03:40.829> adjust<00:03:41.700> dami<00:03:42.239> yeah<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:42.750> mean

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
when expected adjust dami yeah I mean

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.620 
when expected adjust dami yeah I mean

definitely because you know like us the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.900 
definitely because you know like us the
coaches<00:03:45.870> say<00:03:46.340> they'd<00:03:47.340> rather<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.730> make

mistake<00:03:48.269> playing<00:03:48.510> hard<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.840> make<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.019> mistake

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
mistake playing hard to make a mistake

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.039 
mistake playing hard to make a mistake
and<00:03:49.590> not<00:03:49.889> playing<00:03:50.160> hard<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.579> we<00:03:50.819> naturally<00:03:51.569> I

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
and not playing hard so we naturally I

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.740 
and not playing hard so we naturally I
go<00:03:52.349> back<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.680> my<00:03:53.239> natural<00:03:54.239> instincts<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.599> in

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
go back to my natural instincts like in

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.449 
go back to my natural instincts like in
college<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.230> defense<00:03:55.919> purple<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.310> way

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
college the defense purple is way

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.449 
college the defense purple is way
different<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.720> when<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:57.989> get<00:03:58.169> tired<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:58.560> go<00:03:59.310> back

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
different so when I get tired I go back

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.650 
different so when I get tired I go back
to<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.730> because<00:03:59.910> it's<00:04:00.150> when<00:04:00.269> it's<00:04:00.359> naturally

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
to that because it's when it's naturally

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.050 
to that because it's when it's naturally
mean<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.900> know<00:04:01.019> but<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.470> think<00:04:01.799> once<00:04:02.130> i<00:04:02.400> get

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
mean you know but I think once i get

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.400 
mean you know but I think once i get
used<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.329> this<00:04:03.450> more<00:04:03.720> keep<00:04:03.989> playing<00:04:04.169> at<00:04:04.319> this
