00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
a few minutes between about 300 and 350

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.580 
a few minutes between about 300 and 350
and<00:05:08.600> now<00:05:08.750> I'm<00:05:08.840> going<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.020> check<00:05:09.200> it<00:05:09.320> out<00:05:09.410> we'll

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
and now I'm going to check it out we'll

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.320 
and now I'm going to check it out we'll
take<00:05:09.710> four<00:05:09.979> and<00:05:10.400> we're<00:05:10.520> gonna<00:05:10.610> go<00:05:10.729> find<00:05:11.000> a<00:05:11.150> pic

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
take four and we're gonna go find a pic

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.900 
take four and we're gonna go find a pic
piece<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:11.979> we'll<00:05:12.979> put<00:05:13.160> fork<00:05:13.490> in<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.700> will

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
piece and we'll put fork in it will

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.219 
piece and we'll put fork in it will
twist<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.300> little<00:05:14.330> bit<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:14.780> it's<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:15.080> to

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
twist it a little bit and it's on to

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.120 
twist it a little bit and it's on to
separate<00:05:15.590> like<00:05:15.740> that

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
separate like that

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.190 
separate like that
you<00:05:16.520> see<00:05:16.700> that's<00:05:16.760> separate<00:05:17.210> now<00:05:17.389> that<00:05:17.990> means

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
you see that's separate now that means

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.540 
you see that's separate now that means
it's<00:05:18.380> ready<00:05:18.590> now<00:05:18.680> some<00:05:19.039> of<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.190> stick<00:05:19.340> ones

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
it's ready now some of the stick ones

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.800 
it's ready now some of the stick ones
that<00:05:19.639> we<00:05:19.700> stick<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.030> see<00:05:20.180> it's<00:05:20.270> still<00:05:20.479> rubbery

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
that we stick it see it's still rubbery

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.570 
that we stick it see it's still rubbery
so<00:05:21.440> that<00:05:21.590> one<00:05:21.740> still<00:05:21.919> needs<00:05:22.010> one<00:05:22.130> more<00:05:22.190> time<00:05:22.430> to

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
so that one still needs one more time to

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.860 
so that one still needs one more time to
cook<00:05:22.700> with<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:23.000> smaller<00:05:23.330> ones<00:05:23.600> you'll<00:05:23.720> see

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
cook with you smaller ones you'll see

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.629 
cook with you smaller ones you'll see
they're<00:05:24.020> actually<00:05:24.380> about<00:05:24.470> ready<00:05:24.830> don't

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
they're actually about ready don't

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.129 
they're actually about ready don't
overcook<00:05:26.210> them<00:05:26.360> okay

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
overcook them okay

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.900 
overcook them okay
the<00:05:27.260> trick<00:05:27.470> is<00:05:27.620> taking<00:05:27.919> two<00:05:28.070> spatulas<00:05:28.370> instead

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
the trick is taking two spatulas instead

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.640 
the trick is taking two spatulas instead
of<00:05:29.000> one<00:05:29.180> what<00:05:29.960> those<00:05:30.110> are<00:05:30.229> try<00:05:30.350> to<00:05:30.410> get<00:05:30.560> up

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
of one what those are try to get up

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.740 
of one what those are try to get up
under<00:05:30.889> it<00:05:31.300> sometime<00:05:32.300> this<00:05:32.419> gets<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.690> little

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
under it sometime this gets a little

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.330 
under it sometime this gets a little
hard<00:05:32.990> but<00:05:33.050> if<00:05:33.260> you<00:05:33.620> put<00:05:33.770> enough<00:05:33.979> of<00:05:34.160> that

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
hard but if you put enough of that

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.370 
hard but if you put enough of that
sticky<00:05:34.820> stuff<00:05:35.030> on<00:05:35.180> there<00:05:35.389> usually<00:05:35.930> and<00:05:36.229> break

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
sticky stuff on there usually and break

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.120 
sticky stuff on there usually and break
it<00:05:36.500> loose<00:05:36.530> just<00:05:37.070> like<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:37.550> then<00:05:38.360> scoop<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:38.870> up

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
it loose just like so then scoop it up

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.260 
it loose just like so then scoop it up
if<00:05:40.130> he's<00:05:40.250> kind<00:05:40.460> of<00:05:40.490> close<00:05:40.669> to<00:05:40.820> each<00:05:40.910> other<00:05:41.060> and

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
if he's kind of close to each other and

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.210 
if he's kind of close to each other and
that's<00:05:41.330> to<00:05:41.450> do<00:05:41.570> a<00:05:41.599> little<00:05:41.919> maneuvering<00:05:42.919> to<00:05:43.039> get

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
that's to do a little maneuvering to get

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.890 
that's to do a little maneuvering to get
them<00:05:44.229> switch<00:05:45.229> around<00:05:45.560> here<00:05:45.800> get<00:05:46.250> this<00:05:46.400> guy

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
them switch around here get this guy

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.249 
them switch around here get this guy
here<00:05:47.080> we'll<00:05:47.770> pick<00:05:47.979> him<00:05:48.100> up<00:05:48.419> real<00:05:49.419> carefully

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
here we'll pick him up real carefully

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.840 
here we'll pick him up real carefully
and<00:05:50.440> land<00:05:50.650> on<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.919> plate<00:05:51.130> yeah<00:05:51.400> we<00:05:51.669> go<00:05:51.820> to

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
and land on the plate yeah we go to

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.640 
and land on the plate yeah we go to
another<00:05:53.400> again<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.520> trick<00:05:54.759> is<00:05:54.970> enough<00:05:55.630> Pam<00:05:56.320> so

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
another again the trick is enough Pam so

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.499 
another again the trick is enough Pam so
you<00:05:56.710> put<00:05:56.889> enough<00:05:57.039> ham<00:05:57.250> in<00:05:57.430> there<00:05:57.580> makes<00:05:58.389> it

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
you put enough ham in there makes it

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.760 
you put enough ham in there makes it
easy<00:05:58.690> lift<00:05:59.500> it<00:05:59.620> up<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:01.360> set<00:06:01.690> on<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.840> fleet<00:06:02.110> is

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
easy lift it up and set on the fleet is

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.680 
easy lift it up and set on the fleet is
