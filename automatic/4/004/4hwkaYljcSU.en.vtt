00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.119
 Today I have a menu of pea porridge with meat. 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.900
 For this you will need to peas. I pre-soaked him for 15 minutes. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.829
 I cut the beef in small pieces. 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.509
 Chopped carrots and cut onions. 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.569
 We set to warm up the pot. She had already been warmed up. 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.320
 We check the warming up, dripping on the bottom with water. 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.480
 The droplets are already rolling like balls. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.640
 Here we load the meat. 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.210
 Distribute on the bottom of the pan. 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.630
 We press to the meat a little stuck. 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.600
 Fry for about 2 minutes. 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.690
 Turn the meat over. It is easily behind. 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.180
 Even reddened. 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.700
 So here we turn it over. 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.800
 More fry for about two minutes. Also on medium heat. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.470
 Add 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the meat. 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.470
 Add carrots and onions. 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.500
 Stir. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 You can immediately salt it. 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.480
 And pepper. 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.600
 Taste. 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.000
 Enough. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 Stir and fry over medium heat for 3 minutes. 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.600
 Stirring occasionally. 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.069
 We set aside. 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.069
 Pour peas here. 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:32.600
 Need some water necessarily. 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.049
 Pour water a little higher peas. 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.139
 That's how it will be enough. 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.749
 I will trim a little. 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.829
 I'll cook under the lid-pressure cooker. 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.119
 With its help, peas are cooked 2 times faster. 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:55.529
 Cover with a lid. 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.689
 Turn it around. 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.000
 Staples grabbed the edge of the pan. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.079
 We put on fire. 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.829
 I turn on the biggest fire. 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.200
 Watching the pressure indicator - behind this red flag. 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.200
 When he jumps up - you can turn down the fire. 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.819
 The red flag went up and steam went. 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.800
 We put fire on the smallest. 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.000
 Cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes. 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.909
 Turn off the fire. 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.700
 We are waiting for the pressure indicator to go down. 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.200
 When the indicator is raised, the lid cannot be opened. 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.900
 In the pot a lot of pressure. 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.369
 We will see what happened. 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.199
 Checkbox dropped. 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:48.149
 Open the lid. She sucked slightly. 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.749
 Porridge turned out, in principle. 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:56.329
 Stir. 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.009
 It turned out just porridge. 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.500
 Porridge with meat. 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.739
 That's what I got pea porridge with meat. 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.500
 Enjoy your meal!
