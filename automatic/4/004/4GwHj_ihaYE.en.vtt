00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.159
 hello friends welcome recipes 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.930
 light and today we are going to do for 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.730
 beach is a typical dish of the province 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.320
 of manabi that is based on green banana 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.419
 and in this case I'm going to make fillings 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.799
 of delicious fish that is called the 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.799
 low to the ingredients 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.580
 ah 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.020
 let's see 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.189
 in this case we are going to use three 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.700
 bananas 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.190
 I calculate that more weeks the same 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.910
 68 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.910
 corbis 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 organ of the 7th 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.180
 the color part we avoid 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:05.440
 knead a lot so that the mixture is 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.440
 gentle depends a lot on age because 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.120
 when it cools off to get a little 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.740
 do 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.210
 well we have named it since it is 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.750
 enough for it to be compacted with the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.540
 cache or we're going to you and this I'm going to 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.150
 to give with a trick we dissolve the peanut 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.340
 the peanut paste in a little water or 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.690
 of broth what does the mass want for 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.020
 structures 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.180
 a little more but when it cools 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.670
 especially we were going to take a little 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.310
 of peanuts dissolved in water or in broth 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.640
 it can be and we do the same 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.490
 procedure we knead it so that it 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.490
 integrate well and then let it rest 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.700
 The mannequin gives a unique taste a flavor 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.700
 exquisite 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.780
 and now we let the dough rest 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.920
 and let's make the reflector 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.870
 to make the fried we should have 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.810
 careful not to put too much oil is not 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.700
 I need a lot of oil not sealed me 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.670
 we let warm the reflection 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.240
 practically boil to place 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.170
 the ingredients correspond to the rehash 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.170
 we have onion pepper 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.069
 Peeled tomato, chopped and seeded 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.940
 put on a low heat to prevent 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.690
 let me loose flavor 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.530
 all of a sudden it will not leave much time 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.959
 approximately 10 minutes is enough 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.959
 while you are watching our district 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.489
 well I'll put a little cumin 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.569
 a little bit of salt I always remember them 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.420
 try not to abuse the salt 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.290
 and also 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.290
 Pepper 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.709
 on the front line in many seafood 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.659
 either 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.849
 add too much salt or condiments 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.349
 because it loses the natural flavor 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.380
 seafood itself, especially when the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.030
 Sea fish already comes with its weapons 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.870
 then there is no need to increase 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.880
 even more it gets very little this is the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.330
 precise moment to add in this 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.920
 case our fish because if it is cooked 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.920
 more can be burned 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.370
 now if we miss the sin 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.020
 Y 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.770
 well now we proceed to cover and leave 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.500
 medium fire 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.720
 high for we get that steam that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.150
 is formed inside the pan or the 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.239
 container where we cook allows 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.800
 cook with your own juice we see 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.100
 always been he was taking no 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.030
 exists it is changed pink 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.030
 I'm interested in white 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.289
 now we put a little peanut 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.469
 that not sure 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.569
 we will return this is the final good phase 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.780
 we removed from the game and now we are going to 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:42.300
 proceed 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.300
 to shape it by bugs 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.580
 curiously the banana is almost worked 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.680
 like the flour dough we have a 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.139
 more or less large formation in the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.960
 tubular formation and we will highlight the 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.159
 small pieces calculating the cut that 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.509
 let's go to sport we're going to make them 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.770
 the amount of combis that we 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.770
 It depends on the cut 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.729
 and then we're going to fill 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.559
 we hope it cools down a bit 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.930
 more or less this is part that we are going to 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:19.660
 do 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.280
 He said enough if we want it in the 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.060
 large use more squares there is no 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.060
 no problem 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.120
 Well now we are going to fill in better 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.120
 bitches we make the center 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.220
 that the dough is not split so that the 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.220
 time to close 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.410
 we take a little 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:02.770
 of the rehash and place inside 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.919
 and we close 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.479
 and up and we proceed with all the good 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.060
 now we are going to fry the 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.390
 treats 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.000
 in this case 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.280
 I will fry them if they see that they are used 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.050
 a more or less amount of oil 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.770
 in any case if we want to avoid 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.729
 use a lot of oil we can cut 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.729
 it's optional 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.590
 Y 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.389
 hello friends are ready the
