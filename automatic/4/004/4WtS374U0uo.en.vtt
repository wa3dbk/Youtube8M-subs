wearing a green shirt right now so it's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.750 
wearing a green shirt right now so it's
kind<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.820> reflecting<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.779> face<00:00:22.260> mask<00:00:22.760> but

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
kind of reflecting on the face mask but

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.050 
kind of reflecting on the face mask but
that's<00:00:23.939> platinum<00:00:25.220> and<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.519> different

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that's platinum and I see different

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.810 
that's platinum and I see different
angle<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.779> there<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:27.990> go<00:00:28.490> see<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
angle and there we go see that's a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.799 
angle and there we go see that's a
reflection<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.510> my<00:00:31.189> arm<00:00:32.189> right<00:00:32.460> there<00:00:32.809> anyways

second<00:01:41.869> it's<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:43.049> blurred<00:01:43.909> we<00:01:44.909> go<00:01:45.649> here's<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
second it's a bit blurred we go here's a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.109 
second it's a bit blurred we go here's a
sword<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:48.229> on<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.619> fetters<00:01:50.130> outside<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
sword and on the fetters outside or the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
sword and on the fetters outside or the
blade<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:52.140> gunmetal<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> inside

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
blade it's gunmetal but on the inside

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.149 
blade it's gunmetal but on the inside
part<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.630> actually<00:01:55.229> platinum<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
part that's actually platinum so you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.810 
part that's actually platinum so you
have<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.479> really<00:01:57.479> nice<00:01:57.719> transition<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.820> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
have a really nice transition there and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.330 
have a really nice transition there and
I'm<00:02:00.240> still<00:02:00.570> thinking<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:01.049> i<00:02:01.200> should<00:02:01.340> paint

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
I'm still thinking if i should paint

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.719 
I'm still thinking if i should paint
this<00:02:02.700> horn<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:04.409> chrome<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.430> another

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
this horn here we chrome that's another

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.969 
this horn here we chrome that's another
layer<00:02:06.000> time<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.049> apply<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.560> metallic

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
layer time need to apply a metallic

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.410 
layer time need to apply a metallic
green<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
green so

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.819 
green so
you'll<00:02:10.420> see<00:02:10.569> that<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:10.989> my<00:02:11.230> demonstration<00:02:11.799> a

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
you'll see that on my demonstration a

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:22.589 
you'll see that on my demonstration a
bit<00:02:11.950> later<00:02:12.209> oops<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:16.290> there's<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.530> one<00:02:21.599> it's

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
bit later oops and there's the one it's

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.679 
bit later oops and there's the one it's
a<00:02:22.689> really<00:02:22.930> nice<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.310> wetter<00:02:24.310> effect<00:02:24.760> and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
airbrushing and the ice for the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.569 
airbrushing and the ice for the
nightingale<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:32.170> metallic<00:02:32.590> blue<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:33.010> think<00:02:33.489> I
