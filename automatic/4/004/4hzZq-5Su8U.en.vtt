00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
move too so here's a simple practice to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
move too so here's a simple practice to
keep<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.479> own<00:01:12.659> energy<00:01:12.960> bright<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.770> clear

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
keep your own energy bright and clear

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.060 
keep your own energy bright and clear
and<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.570> anywhere<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and you can do it anywhere and in just a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.280 
and you can do it anywhere and in just a
few<00:01:17.310> minutes<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.759> day<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:18.299> exactly<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
few minutes a day that's exactly what I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.810 
few minutes a day that's exactly what I
use<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.560> myself<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> teach<00:01:21.180> others

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you so the first thing to do is scan

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.609 
you so the first thing to do is scan
your<00:01:44.909> energy<00:01:45.299> field<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.960> want<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.409> in

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
your energy field you want to do this in

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.740 
your energy field you want to do this in
your<00:01:46.740> mind's<00:01:47.040> eye<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> energy<00:01:48.540> field

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
your mind's eye so see you energy field

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.569 
your mind's eye so see you energy field
on<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:48.990> mind's<00:01:49.170> eye<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.979> find<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
on your mind's eye if you find it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.580 
on your mind's eye if you find it
difficult<00:01:50.729> try<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:51.990> aura<00:01:52.200> like

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
difficult try and see your aura like

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.410 
difficult try and see your aura like
it's<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> shape<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> house<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.240> as<00:01:54.390> a

it's a shape like as a house or as a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.389 
it's a shape like as a house or as a
two-dimensional<00:01:55.259> object<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> circle

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
two-dimensional object like a circle

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.550 
two-dimensional object like a circle
I'll<00:01:57.060> continue<00:01:57.420> using<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> metaphor<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
