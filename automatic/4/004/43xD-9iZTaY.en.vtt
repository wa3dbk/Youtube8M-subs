00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
this is now about two and a half months

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.179 
this is now about two and a half months
on<00:00:17.490> from<00:00:17.970> when<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> bought<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.570> tank<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.380> I've

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
on from when I bought the tank and I've

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.279 
on from when I bought the tank and I've
lost<00:00:20.580> since<00:00:21.330> I've<00:00:21.480> had<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.660> I've<00:00:21.869> only<00:00:22.020> lost

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
lost since I've had it I've only lost

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.160 
lost since I've had it I've only lost
one<00:00:22.680> cardinal<00:00:23.580> neon<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.930> he<00:00:25.019> was<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
one cardinal neon and I think he was a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.990 
one cardinal neon and I think he was a
bit<00:00:25.320> poorly<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.430> bought<00:00:26.730> him

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
bit poorly when I bought him

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.749 
bit poorly when I bought him
so<00:00:27.960> I've<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.640> as<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:31.610> one<00:00:32.610> two

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
so I've got as you can see there one two

log on the right hand side and you see
at<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> bottom<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:50.969> some<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.329> white

browning<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.449> color<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:56.460> know<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
browning in color you know you know that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.590 
browning in color you know you know that
will<00:00:57.539> happen<00:00:57.570> over<00:00:58.050> time<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.390> what<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.539> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
will happen over time and what I do is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.420 
will happen over time and what I do is
I'll<00:01:00.750> gradually<00:01:01.050> clean<00:01:01.379> them<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.129> go<00:01:02.309> along

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I'll gradually clean them as I go along

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.950 
I'll gradually clean them as I go along
I<00:01:03.530> do<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:06.470> cleaning<00:01:07.470> through<00:01:08.420> an<00:01:09.420> app<00:01:09.630> on

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I do all my cleaning through an app on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.039 
I do all my cleaning through an app on
the<00:01:10.170> iPad<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> tells<00:01:12.299> me<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> change

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the iPad and it tells me when to change

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.980 
the iPad and it tells me when to change
the<00:01:13.350> carbon<00:01:14.000> when<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.180> clean<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> ornaments

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the carbon when to clean the ornaments

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.080 
the carbon when to clean the ornaments
when<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> change<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> water<00:01:16.770> etc<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.000> I've

when to change the water etc so I've

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
when to change the water etc so I've
just<00:01:18.270> followed<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.619> religiously

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
just followed that and not religiously

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.030 
just followed that and not religiously
but<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:21.150> much<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.619> when<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.740> tells

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040

instance<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.299> change<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> carbon<00:01:27.990> cleaned<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
instance I change the carbon cleaned the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
instance I change the carbon cleaned the
bio<00:01:28.829> max<00:01:29.100> cleaned<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> filter<00:01:29.939> cleaned<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
bio max cleaned the filter cleaned the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.969 
bio max cleaned the filter cleaned the

ornaments and cleaned the glass and when

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.100 
ornaments and cleaned the glass and when
you<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.880> set<00:01:36.659> routine

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
you do it like that on a set routine

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.679 
you do it like that on a set routine
it's<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:38.159> not<00:01:38.310> sure<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.939> takes<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.540> few

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it's it's not sure it takes just a few

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.440 
it's it's not sure it takes just a few
minutes<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.100> all<00:01:41.250> good<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.939> overall<00:01:42.299> I'm

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
minutes and it's all good so overall I'm

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.630 
minutes and it's all good so overall I'm
loving<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> tank<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.590> only<00:01:44.040> downside<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
loving the tank the only downside I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
loving the tank the only downside I
think<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.119> tank<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> top

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
think with this tank is because the top

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.859 
think with this tank is because the top
is<00:01:46.079> open<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.000> I'll<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.180> try<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.570> show<00:01:48.810> you

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
is open and I'll just try and show you

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.830 
is open and I'll just try and show you
that<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:50.299> there<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.840> brighten

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that now there you go it's just brighten

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.859 
that now there you go it's just brighten
that<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.110> little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:56.149> because<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.479> top<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that up a little bit because the top it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.660 
that up a little bit because the top it
is<00:01:57.899> open<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:59.030> where<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> LEDs<00:02:00.630> are<00:02:01.189> it<00:02:02.189> does

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
is open there where the LEDs are it does

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.889 
is open there where the LEDs are it does
lose<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.570> fair<00:02:04.049> bit<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> water<00:02:05.390> yeah<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.600> not

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
lose a fair bit of water yeah that's not

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
lose a fair bit of water yeah that's not
the<00:02:07.200> end<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> world<00:02:08.330> because<00:02:10.250> it's<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.430> good

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the end of the world because it's a good

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.880 
the end of the world because it's a good
indication<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.330> when<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.569> start<00:02:12.810> hearing

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
indication that when you start hearing

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.280 
indication that when you start hearing
