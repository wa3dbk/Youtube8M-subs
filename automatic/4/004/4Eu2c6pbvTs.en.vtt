00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
let's talk about what happens when we

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
let's talk about what happens when we
put<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> ink<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.040> top<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.939> media<00:01:12.090> during

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
put the ink on top of the media during

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350 
put the ink on top of the media during
the<00:01:12.780> printing<00:01:12.960> process<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> ink<00:01:14.729> itself<00:01:14.909> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the printing process the ink itself is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.109 
the printing process the ink itself is
mainly<00:01:15.960> made<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.500> three<00:01:16.680> components<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.850> ink

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
mainly made of three components the ink

mainly made of three components the ink
vehicle<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.439> mainly<00:01:19.860> water<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.610> that's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
vehicle which is mainly water and that's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
vehicle which is mainly water and that's
the<00:01:20.970> key<00:01:21.270> aspect<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> technology<00:01:22.110> because

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the key aspect of the technology because

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
the key aspect of the technology because
this<00:01:23.280> allows<00:01:23.640> us<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.659> eco<00:01:24.990> level<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this allows us to have the eco level and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.310 
this allows us to have the eco level and
in<00:01:25.950> fact<00:01:26.159> allows<00:01:26.549> us<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.270> prints<00:01:27.689> touch

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
in fact allows us to have prints touch

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
in fact allows us to have prints touch
down<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> smell<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:30.240> other<00:01:30.509> component<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
down a smell the other component of the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.249 
down a smell the other component of the
in<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.009> pigments<00:01:32.250> pigments<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.990> gives

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
in the pigments pigments are what gives

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.770 
in the pigments pigments are what gives
color<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.920> ink<00:01:35.130> they<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.820> big<00:01:36.119> particles

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
color to the ink they are big particles

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
color to the ink they are big particles
that<00:01:37.079> are<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.320> suspension<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> water<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that are in suspension in the water and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.539 
that are in suspension in the water and
are<00:01:38.939> very<00:01:39.420> resistant<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.560> only<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> UV

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
are very resistant not only to the UV

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.450 
are very resistant not only to the UV
light<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.299> also<00:01:42.479> resistant<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> ozone<00:01:43.710> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
light but also resistant to the ozone so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.490 
light but also resistant to the ozone so
the<00:01:44.610> prints<00:01:44.850> are<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> smell<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the prints are not going to smell the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
the prints are not going to smell the
prints<00:01:46.799> are<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> last<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> long<00:01:48.479> time

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
prints are going to last for a long time

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.590 
prints are going to last for a long time
but<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> revolution<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.610> starts<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.570> we

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
but the revolution really starts when we

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
but the revolution really starts when we
have<00:01:51.899> been<00:01:52.020> able<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.439> add<00:01:52.530> something<00:01:52.770> else

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
have been able to add something else

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
have been able to add something else
onto<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> ink<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.360> been<00:01:54.600> able<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.869> add

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
onto the ink we have been able to add

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.160 
onto the ink we have been able to add
the<00:01:55.619> latex<00:01:56.100> that's<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.000> polymer<00:01:57.360> does<00:01:57.899> not

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the latex that's a polymer does not

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.620 
the latex that's a polymer does not
natural<00:01:59.100> latex<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.790> polymer<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.540> are

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
natural latex it's a polymer that we are

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.289 
natural latex it's a polymer that we are
adding<00:02:00.810> there<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> let's<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.250> why<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:03.090> added

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
adding there and let's see why we added

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.749 
adding there and let's see why we added
the<00:02:03.750> latex<00:02:04.259> let's<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> latex

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the latex let's see what is the latex

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.449 
the latex let's see what is the latex
exactly<00:02:06.299> doing<00:02:06.570> into<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> print<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.099> put

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
exactly doing into the print so we put

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.089 
exactly doing into the print so we put
the<00:02:08.759> drops<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.179> ink<00:02:09.300> onto<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.720> mat

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
the drops of ink onto the mat

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.100 
the drops of ink onto the mat
and<00:02:10.519> then<00:02:10.879> bring<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.599> printing<00:02:11.900> process

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
and then bring the printing process

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.319 
and then bring the printing process
there<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.709> first<00:02:13.099> step<00:02:13.519> we<00:02:13.790> call<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.209> a

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
there is a first step we call it a

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.199 
there is a first step we call it a
dragging<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.920> happens<00:02:16.400> inside<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.000> printer

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
dragging that happens inside the printer

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.800 
dragging that happens inside the printer
and<00:02:18.109> what<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.769> doing<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.219> removing<00:02:19.849> all<00:02:20.299> the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
and what is doing is removing all the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.259 
and what is doing is removing all the
water<00:02:21.019> from<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.500> print<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:22.010> evaporating<00:02:22.939> all

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
water from the print is evaporating all

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.910 
water from the print is evaporating all
the<00:02:23.659> water<00:02:23.870> from<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.409> drink

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
the water from the drink

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.599 
the water from the drink
so<00:02:25.760> when<00:02:26.180> drying<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.750> done<00:02:26.930> no<00:02:27.560> water<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.250> left

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
so when drying is done no water is left

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.599 
so when drying is done no water is left
behind<00:02:28.849> we<00:02:29.599> have<00:02:29.629> a<00:02:29.989> dry<00:02:30.230> print<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.340> have<00:02:31.579> a

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
behind we have a dry print but we have a

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.460 
behind we have a dry print but we have a
still<00:02:31.849> not<00:02:32.090> finish<00:02:32.480> there<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.049> a<00:02:33.079> very

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
still not finish there is a very

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.080 
still not finish there is a very
important<00:02:34.099> second<00:02:34.489> step

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
important second step

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.720 
important second step
that's<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.629> curing<00:02:35.989> step<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:36.889> the<00:02:37.040> media<00:02:37.310> goes

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
that's the curing step so the media goes

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.459 
that's the curing step so the media goes
into<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.180> different<00:02:38.540> area<00:02:38.689> inside<00:02:39.139> the<00:02:39.260> printer

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
into a different area inside the printer

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.099 
into a different area inside the printer
to<00:02:40.159> be<00:02:40.310> cured<00:02:40.819> what<00:02:41.209> we<00:02:41.329> are<00:02:41.420> doing<00:02:41.569> here<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.079> we

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
to be cured what we are doing here is we

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.440 
to be cured what we are doing here is we
are<00:02:42.290> putting<00:02:42.769> heat<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:43.519> top<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.209> print

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
are putting heat on top of the print

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.649 
are putting heat on top of the print
this<00:02:45.139> heat<00:02:45.439> goes<00:02:45.769> directly<00:02:46.489> into<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.060> latex

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
this heat goes directly into the latex

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.860 
this heat goes directly into the latex
the<00:02:48.319> latex<00:02:48.680> melts<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.549> forms<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.450> kind<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.780> a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
the latex melts and forms a kind of a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.409 
the latex melts and forms a kind of a
film<00:02:51.169> is<00:02:51.379> not<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.560> perfect<00:02:52.099> film<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.060> forms

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
film is not a perfect film but it forms

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.990 
film is not a perfect film but it forms
a<00:02:53.510> kind<00:02:53.629> of<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.840> film<00:02:54.139> which<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:55.000> encapsulating

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
a kind of a film which is encapsulating

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.960 
a kind of a film which is encapsulating
that<00:02:56.480> pigment<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.109> this<00:02:57.799> gives<00:02:58.280> great

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
that pigment and this gives great
