 Speak there, everyone, everything good, everything boutique. 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.980
 bringing various curiosities about the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.719
 world the tac nerd correcting a small 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.940
 previous video detail 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.340
 noc honored door originally was 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.160
 composed by bob dylan and bands like 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.380
 guns n'roses eric clapton and ours 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 dear zé ramalho made curves of this 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.010
 music 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.869
 so, now, stay, check everything 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.869
 you did not know about anime 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.059
 You thought waking up one day with your voice 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 more feminine 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.350
 some male characters in fact 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.600
 has the most feminine voice 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 there are many male characters 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.100
 which are dubbed by women 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.440
 some of these lucky ones are eduardo eric 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.930
 Optimist smoke block by romy 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.019
 pacu that also makes the voice of temarii of 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.180
 noticed that although sanchez is dublado 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.280
 for wisdom to bring greater and even our 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.589
 dear coconut has entered the list being 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 dubbed by massaco nozal to clear that 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.750
 this does not take merit from any of the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.180
 works but it's still bizarre 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 If you gave up watching Luis by 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.650
 have more workouts then 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.880
 believe there is a much more line 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.159
 long 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.259
 these areas are animals long 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.869
 story with a little more of your 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.560
 humble 2,550 episodes emmy and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 transmitted since 1969 and as if it no longer 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.930
 still displayed until today 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.480
 now we know where our dear law 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.270
 strip takes so much inspiration for the 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.000
 episode so without a doubt the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.580
 plot of São luiz x or orani quentin 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.740
 is extremely rich in information 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.990
 I basically attended there having a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 history and indeed we have many 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 true elements in the classic 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 starting with our protagonist george 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.360
 was based on a rite that would 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.830
 true one of the main details 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 March boat pains 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.659
 nobody leaves kawakami she walks was 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.450
 master who jutsu known as china 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.610
 in the iririú referring to the item mitsuru rio 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.950
 used because china cheers your 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.110
 physical similarities were also large 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.239
 the two are short people we have 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.920
 more feminine traits 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.799
 another character who helps make the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.290
 anime most real possible and raj me saito 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.970
 that both in the middle and indeed he 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.159
 was the leader of the third 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.530
 policemen in the x 100 m 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.260
 there are many other similarities that I 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.090
 I will bring the success of 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.590
 Dynamic manga started right at the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.810
 first editions 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.580
 its history began to influence both 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.340
 his fans who had an increase 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.250
 considerable number of smokers in Japan 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.410
 account of addiction 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.180
 Then there's the personal tip . 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.730
 it's not because your favorite character 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.070
 like mushrooms and polinter turtles that 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.260
 You'll do the same but I think this 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.300
 moment has a very eccentric way 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.850
 to refer to some names 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.280
 famous in japan some of the toads that 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.680
 appear at the top have names referring to 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.690
 some famous actors range ass does 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.480
 reference to butt sucks the air 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.790
 protagonist of the movie gingnac tatá carne 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.190
 and gave his voice is to choose and links to 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.620
 enter the role of the narrator of the two of 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.420
 undoes in the fantasy range who does 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.760
 reference to the fifth that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.790
 who is famous for the movies operation and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.580
 accuses and black rain and lastly we have the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.800
 old apas estimates that Chinese reference 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.370
 and the shoot known to have acted in the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.370
 goku movie I give a touch one of the biggest 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.260
 names of the formula 1 the great airton sena 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.290
 had a huge success both in 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.630
 how off the tracks and japan he was 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.220
 extremely dear and his form yielded 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.110
 something very unusual 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.750
 if you were not the protagonist in manga 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.970
 finance with ayrton senna we did not have in 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.060
 1 that depicts the beginning of formula 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.340
 1990s the great riders of the season 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.130
 are portrayed in the manga as emerson 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.860
 fittipaldi roberto moreno I'm the rival 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.160
 alan prost and the most ironic of all this 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.239
 is that Senai br nor manga shadow 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.880
 appeared by these lands is ld seal 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.030
 death note is a very 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.250
 singular 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.019
 after all it's not every day that you see someone 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.090
 sitting there like that 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.090
 another striking feature of it is the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.459
 his gluttony for sweets his short list of 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.890
 glucose throughout the anime was five 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.780
 Pieces of cake three chocolates two 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.960
 portions of jelly a donut 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.560
 sugar a radio a sugar cube one 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.800
 banana 1 pudding 1 tablespoon ice cream 16 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.229
 coffees and 12 black teas says he should 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.810
 have consumed behind the curtains more 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.270
 three live episodes he had been 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.850
 diabetes victim not of death note 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.340
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.420
 liked the new channel frame 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.730
