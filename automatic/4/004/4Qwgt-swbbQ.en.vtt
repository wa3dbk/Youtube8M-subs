00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.750
 The traveling fans celebrated at the end 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.100
 Of course, left out in the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.440
 weary face of the team 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.240
 on the other hand her unlimited relief 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.580
 see that it does not end up yet 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.630
 went wrong 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.920
 in the meantime, the evl led ne 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.390
 mix with six to two 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.669
 but delivered in the final section 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.250
 ravensburg a rally and its cord 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.630
 but partie again on compensation 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.559
 Ravensburg is all or nothing 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.550
 played and it was all the gates 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.829
 fake shots latest design 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.450
 tied gone through in order to me for luck 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.110
 and the 17-year-old has concluded 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.210
 closed 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.640
 as the youngster stefan loibl says 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.520
 only 28 seconds after just seen 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.770
 56 by matt kelly in powerplay the 7 too 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.320
 5 and thus his most important goal so far 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.270
 The career achieved this hit in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 the 53 minute started 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.200
 certain stop sign for the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.030
 Ravensburger on project who knows how 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.680
 would have gone out if not this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.989
 quick response would have succeeded 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.570
 It was still trembling until the end 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.090
 announced because daniel amount in the 55th 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.950
 minute the re-connection to the 67 for 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 by the way, the tower stars arrive 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 correct hit because the stop is not 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.070
 over the shoulder was with luck and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.600
 Skill brought land to this 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.540
 Leap then over time 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.229
 I believe that in the beginning very tight 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.490
 game was 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.510
 everyone thought today it would be 2 1 3 2 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.460
 1 0 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.340
 but most of the time it's personal games 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.430
 comes the 76 I still believe in the second 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.790
 third under par at very very good 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.619
 played and cold exploited yes we 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.350
 have driven very hopefully that 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.520
 momentum was on our side 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.140
 Of course, Ravensburg was maybe on 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.440
 Start of last game a bit 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.030
 beaten or hurt here but the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.770
 just did not hit 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.260
 given and they have until the last 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.810
 minute fought from the start goose bumps 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.460
 feeling in the with 2600 spectators not 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.270
 completely sold out ravensburger 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.189
 ice sports hall 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.170
 it was clear that it would not be easy 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.880
 would this fortress after the 3 2 am 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.510
 friday a second time within a short time 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.790
 time to storm 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.470
 but it went well from martin da covered 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.510
 uses world class pass from Peter 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.910
 Abstreiter the second eva in powerplay 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.280
 of the evening to the early 1 0 in the 6 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.170
 minute but the answer of the tower stars 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.330
 after all, the best in the main round 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.140
 home team of the dl 2 did not last long 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.090
 wait for you 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.040
 also in Moravian superiority 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.220
 meets justin kelly directly from the bully 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.720
 just three minutes later to 1 1 more 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.580
 Two minutes had the hosts 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.590
 the game then even turned the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.630
 Lift with a lot of survey and 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.600
 that would have probably also menges grandma 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.830
 made 2 1 for Ravensburg 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.630
 that was it from passage one of the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.090
 middle section were quite in the sign 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.080
 the evl first of all a lightning start 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.610
 after 30 seconds 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.110
 Abstreiter just will not 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.440
 attacked and then I think that 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:58.330
 I'll just balance it out 2 24 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.820
 Minutes later part of Morris on Elia 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.010
 Ostwald, as before Abstreiter relatively 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.930
 remains unmolested then comes the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.670
 slice to stefan pockets of the room 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.610
 Pulling the angle was for a monster 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.950
 lobster for 3 2 landshut had the lot 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.480
 turned back again 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.380
 this shot is in any case still 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.150
 times a slow motion , then the well 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.640
 crucial scene in this lot 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.680
 Ravensburg's nation deck with a rare 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.450
 stupid action high stick against there 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.730
 we the children 33 minutes 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.320
 you do not want to accuse but that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.290
 looks damned to purpose 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.390
 at least both then out david 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.040
 the clothes hurt dek completely rightly 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.040
 with playing time under the shower 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.920
 Meanwhile punished the whole then 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.750
 his style then in the following 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.260
 five-five are three 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.209
 hit 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.799
 that took off with his second goal of the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.659
 in the evening in the 34th 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.510
 and routinier bieli tour with one 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.209
 double pack in the 36 and 37 minute 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.650
 put on 62 and thus the soft 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.650
 finally on victory 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.510
 Although it still made the tower stars 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.920
 once exciting because they are in 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.720
 final section all on one card 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.000
 put and by a double beat of 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.269
 marko friedrich and the cameron in 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.890
 the 45 47 minute and the entrance 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.750
 already seen hits by matt kelly 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.000
 came dangerously close once again 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.220
 in the end, the event crowned his 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.380
 sensational series comeback with the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.380
 semi-final must be the team 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.880
 big compliment we were 3 1 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.320
 against in the series behind 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.360
 Everyone already has us 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.190
 written off about the series turns 4 3 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.780
 against a very good opponent and the 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.580
 team make a big compliment 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.800
 however, there is plenty of time to celebrate 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.200
 not on friday is already going on 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.210
 the first game in the semifinal occurs 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.650
 meanwhile, in the preliminary round winner fischtown 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.650
 pinguins bremerhaven
