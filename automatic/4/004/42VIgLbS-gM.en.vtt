airbrushed<00:04:45.680> feel<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:47.330> only<00:04:47.360> problem

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
airbrushed feel to it the only problem

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.650 
airbrushed feel to it the only problem
is<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.230> hands<00:04:48.740> that<00:04:49.550> are<00:04:49.880> used<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.360> hold<00:04:50.570> the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
is the hands that are used to hold the

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.810 
is the hands that are used to hold the
weapons<00:04:50.990> are<00:04:51.380> kind<00:04:51.980> of<00:04:52.040> poorly<00:04:52.250> done<00:04:52.550> because

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
weapons are kind of poorly done because

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.080 
weapons are kind of poorly done because
the<00:04:53.000> peg<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:53.750> see<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:55.220> is<00:04:55.400> used<00:04:55.640> to<00:04:55.850> be

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
the peg that you see that is used to be

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.230 
the peg that you see that is used to be
inserted<00:04:56.570> in<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.780> weapon<00:04:57.080> holes<00:04:57.470> is<00:04:58.240> designed

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
inserted in the weapon holes is designed

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.750 
inserted in the weapon holes is designed
a<00:04:59.360> little<00:04:59.480> too<00:04:59.750> big<00:05:00.020> for<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.950> holes<00:05:01.160> so<00:05:01.700> you

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
a little too big for the holes so you

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.670 
a little too big for the holes so you
have<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.150> it's<00:05:02.870> hard<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.170> get<00:05:03.320> them<00:05:03.410> in<00:05:03.500> there

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
have a it's hard to get them in there

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.050 
have a it's hard to get them in there
and<00:05:03.860> when<00:05:04.160> you're<00:05:04.310> trying<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.550> force<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:04.910> in

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
and when you're trying to force it in

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.280 
and when you're trying to force it in
you'll<00:05:05.300> never<00:05:05.480> set<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.780> peg<00:05:05.960> will<00:05:06.080> start

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
you'll never set the peg will start

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.460 
you'll never set the peg will start
moving<00:05:06.440> around<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:07.360> just<00:05:08.360> yeah<00:05:09.020> it's<00:05:09.200> really

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
moving around and just yeah it's really

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.220 
moving around and just yeah it's really
an<00:05:09.560> almost<00:05:10.190> impossible<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.700> get<00:05:10.820> it<00:05:10.940> in<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.420> my

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
an almost impossible to get it in so my

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.900 
an almost impossible to get it in so my
suggestion<00:05:12.590> is<00:05:12.800> maybe<00:05:13.130> just<00:05:13.220> cut<00:05:13.490> off<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.730> peg

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
suggestion is maybe just cut off the peg

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.180 
suggestion is maybe just cut off the peg
and<00:05:13.940> hold<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.420> hold<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.630> weapon<00:05:14.780> that<00:05:15.020> way<00:05:15.190> but

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
and hold the hold a weapon that way but

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.230 
and hold the hold a weapon that way but
other<00:05:16.340> than<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.520> it's<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:16.850> pretty<00:05:17.000> decent

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
other than that it's a pretty decent

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.840 
other than that it's a pretty decent
figure<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:17.870> $39.99<00:05:18.800> that's<00:05:19.040> out<00:05:19.190> there<00:05:19.370> get<00:05:19.760> it

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
figure so $39.99 that's out there get it

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.350 
figure so $39.99 that's out there get it
while<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.000> can

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
while you can

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:30.950 
while you can
so<00:05:20.570> until<00:05:21.170> next<00:05:21.290> time<00:05:21.440> see<00:05:21.740> you<00:05:22.370> then

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.020 

you
