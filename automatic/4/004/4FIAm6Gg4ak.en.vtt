00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
cover a brand new gimbal head now why do

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.329 
cover a brand new gimbal head now why do
we<00:00:44.970> need<00:00:45.089> a<00:00:45.150> new<00:00:45.239> gimbal<00:00:45.690> head<00:00:45.900> let<00:00:46.769> me<00:00:47.100> show

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
we need a new gimbal head let me show

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.509 
we need a new gimbal head let me show
you<00:00:47.399> why<00:00:48.500> should<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.589> a<00:00:49.620> little<00:00:49.710> fanfare<00:00:50.010> going

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
about that I'm sure if you look at that

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
about that I'm sure if you look at that
texture<00:00:59.429> right<00:00:59.640> there<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.960> might<00:01:01.260> recognize

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
texture right there you might recognize

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.249 
texture right there you might recognize
it<00:01:02.300> carbon<00:01:03.300> fiber

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
it carbon fiber

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.440 
it carbon fiber
this<00:01:05.070> puppy<00:01:05.399> is<00:01:05.429> just<00:01:05.670> about<00:01:05.820> half<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.300> weight

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
this puppy is just about half the weight

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.139 
this puppy is just about half the weight
of<00:01:06.509> most<00:01:06.899> gimbal<00:01:07.289> heads<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.679> marketplace

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
of most gimbal heads on the marketplace

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.050 
of most gimbal heads on the marketplace
half<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.690> weight<00:01:09.960> that's<00:01:10.890> huge<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.550> days

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
half the weight that's huge these days

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.660 
half the weight that's huge these days
I<00:01:12.090> mean<00:01:12.810> gimbal<00:01:13.380> heads<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.740> pretty<00:01:14.220> darn

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
I mean gimbal heads are pretty darn

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.230 
I mean gimbal heads are pretty darn
heavy<00:01:14.970> things<00:01:15.330> not<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:16.850> but<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:17.970> not

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
heavy things not this one but that's not

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.380 
heavy things not this one but that's not
it<00:01:18.479> there's<00:01:18.780> more<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.409> than<00:01:19.649> just<00:01:19.710> having<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
it there's more to it than just having a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.699 
it there's more to it than just having a
lightweight<00:01:21.390> carbon<00:01:22.110> fiber<00:01:22.190> really<00:01:23.190> cool

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
lightweight carbon fiber really cool

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.830 
lightweight carbon fiber really cool
gimbal<00:01:25.709> head<00:01:26.149> what<00:01:27.149> you've<00:01:27.300> got<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> hear<00:01:27.690> some

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
gimbal head what you've got I hear some

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.620 
gimbal head what you've got I hear some
amazing<00:01:27.989> controls<00:01:28.500> you're<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.220> pan<00:01:29.550> feature<00:01:29.910> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
amazing controls you're a pan feature it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
amazing controls you're a pan feature it
takes<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:31.050> little<00:01:31.229> movement<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.890> put<00:01:32.099> this

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
takes very little movement just put this

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.930 
takes very little movement just put this
straight<00:01:32.489> up<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.330> I<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.569> pan<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.399> smooth<00:01:35.399> as

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
straight up and I can pan that smooth as

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.790 
straight up and I can pan that smooth as
silk

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
silk

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.320 
silk
even<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:37.860> bubble<00:01:38.220> level<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.550> here<00:01:38.789> in<00:01:39.119> case

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
even a bubble level in here in case

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.779 
even a bubble level in here in case
you're<00:01:39.509> trying<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.899> some<00:01:40.140> panning<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
you're trying to do some panning for the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.150 
you're trying to do some panning for the
video<00:01:42.030> head<00:01:42.239> you<00:01:42.599> can<00:01:42.750> level<00:01:42.989> it<00:01:43.050> out<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.410> really

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
video head you can level it out a really

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.830 
video head you can level it out a really
cool<00:01:44.369> feature<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:45.080> have<00:01:47.149> your<00:01:48.149> pitch<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.630> yaw

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
cool feature you have your pitch and yaw

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.529 
cool feature you have your pitch and yaw
knob<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:50.039> like<00:01:50.190> any<00:01:50.340> other<00:01:50.459> Gambel<00:01:51.390> head

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
knob just like any other Gambel head

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.600 
knob just like any other Gambel head
you're<00:01:52.259> gonna<00:01:52.379> rotate<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.979> until<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.459> have<00:01:53.550> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
you're gonna rotate it until you have a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.089 
you're gonna rotate it until you have a
nice<00:01:53.879> smooth<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.959> to<00:01:55.080> kind<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.619> push<00:01:55.860> it

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
nice smooth you have to kind of push it

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.740 
nice smooth you have to kind of push it
action<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.270> don't<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.569> to<00:01:57.629> have<00:01:57.720> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
action you don't want to have a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.010 
action you don't want to have a
chattering<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.979> nice<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.280> smooth<00:02:00.020> just

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
chattering just nice and smooth just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.139 
chattering just nice and smooth just
like<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> panning<00:02:01.950> knob<00:02:02.099> it<00:02:02.729> takes<00:02:02.940> very

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
like the panning knob it takes very

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.660 
like the panning knob it takes very
little<00:02:03.330> rotation<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.800> pitch<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.520> yaw

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
little rotation of the pitch and yaw

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.910 
little rotation of the pitch and yaw
knob<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.479> find<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.050> perfect<00:02:07.319> spot<00:02:07.649> for<00:02:07.679> your

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
knob to find that perfect spot for your

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.790 
knob to find that perfect spot for your
big<00:02:08.069> glass<00:02:08.599> but<00:02:09.599> what's<00:02:09.810> even<00:02:09.929> more<00:02:10.110> important

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
big glass but what's even more important

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.280 
big glass but what's even more important
what's<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.310> amazing<00:02:11.640> about<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.290> carbon

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
what's really amazing about this carbon

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.260 
what's really amazing about this carbon
fiber<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.040> can't<00:02:14.280> say<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.459> enough<00:02:14.670> carbon

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
fiber I can't say that enough carbon

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.470 
fiber I can't say that enough carbon
fiber<00:02:15.569> cable<00:02:16.050> Hill<00:02:16.200> head<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.970> little

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
fiber cable Hill head is that little

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.420 
fiber cable Hill head is that little
