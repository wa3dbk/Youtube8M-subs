00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
tunnels in my tapers etc I started off

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
tunnels in my tapers etc I started off
with<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.040> 14<00:00:14.610> gauge<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.030> went<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.509> my<00:00:15.660> local

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
with the 14 gauge I went to my local

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.200 
with the 14 gauge I went to my local
piercer<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.590> got<00:00:16.920> these<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.130> these<00:00:18.090> are

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
piercer I got these in these are

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.300 
piercer I got these in these are
metallic<00:00:18.420> blue<00:00:18.720> they're<00:00:19.199> pretty<00:00:19.800> nice<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.279> I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
metallic blue they're pretty nice but I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
metallic blue they're pretty nice but I
paid<00:00:20.460> $40<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> thought<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.600> big<00:00:21.990> ripoff

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
paid $40 and I thought was a big ripoff

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.200 
paid $40 and I thought was a big ripoff
so<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.859> didn't<00:00:23.369> go<00:00:23.430> back<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:23.789> piercer<00:00:24.090> they

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
so I didn't go back to my piercer they

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.400 
so I didn't go back to my piercer they
said<00:00:24.390> come<00:00:24.720> back<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:24.960> three<00:00:25.080> weeks<00:00:25.260> or

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
said come back in three weeks or

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.080 
said come back in three weeks or
whatever<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.670> didn't<00:00:26.820> bother<00:00:26.910> going

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
whatever so and I didn't bother going

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.279 
whatever so and I didn't bother going
back<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.599> too<00:00:27.689> expensive

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
back it was too expensive

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.939 
back it was too expensive
I<00:00:28.320> waited<00:00:29.130> through<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> whole<00:00:30.210> three<00:00:30.420> weeks<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
I waited through the whole three weeks I

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.069 
I waited through the whole three weeks I
stretched<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> 10<00:00:32.910> gauge<00:00:33.149> you're<00:00:33.989> not

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
stretched to a 10 gauge you're not

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.690 
stretched to a 10 gauge you're not
supposed<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> skip<00:00:34.559> sizes<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.460> really

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
supposed to skip sizes but I really

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.770 
supposed to skip sizes but I really
didn't<00:00:35.910> know<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.300> time<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:36.719> I

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
didn't know that at the time because I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200 
didn't know that at the time because I
was<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.930> newbie<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.620> stretching<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
was a newbie for stretching so I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.290 
was a newbie for stretching so I
stretched<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> 14<00:00:40.649> gauge<00:00:40.890> mean<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.670> 14<00:00:42.059> when

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
stretched to a 14 gauge mean a 14 when

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.170 
stretched to a 14 gauge mean a 14 when
we<00:00:42.420> talk<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.600> 10<00:00:43.469> gauge<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.030> these<00:00:45.030> are

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
we talk about 10 gauge and these are

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.330 
we talk about 10 gauge and these are
pretty<00:00:45.300> cool<00:00:45.539> though<00:00:45.690> they're<00:00:45.960> metallic

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
pretty cool though they're metallic

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.590 
pretty cool though they're metallic
tapers<00:00:48.110> metal<00:00:49.110> too<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.149> it<00:00:51.149> hurt<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
tapers metal too and it hurt like a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.049 
tapers metal too and it hurt like a
bitch<00:00:52.079> when<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> first<00:00:52.949> put<00:00:53.430> stretched<00:00:53.910> with

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
bitch when I first put stretched with

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.139 
bitch when I first put stretched with
these<00:00:54.180> tapers<00:00:55.340> because<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> skipped<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> side

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
these tapers because I skipped the side

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.060 
these tapers because I skipped the side
it's<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.449> knowing<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.559> hurt<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
it's not knowing that so it hurt like a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.889 
it's not knowing that so it hurt like a
bitch<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.550> bled<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:00:59.910> bit<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.809> I'm

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
bitch and it bled a little bit but I'm

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.560 
bitch and it bled a little bit but I'm
alright<00:01:01.160> then<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.309> waited<00:01:02.550> two<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> half

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
alright then I waited two and a half

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
alright then I waited two and a half
weeks<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.589> cage<00:01:06.740> these<00:01:07.740> ones<00:01:07.979> are

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
weeks to go to a cage these ones are

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.480 
weeks to go to a cage these ones are
pretty<00:01:08.540> cool<00:01:09.540> they're<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:10.010> palm<00:01:11.010> trees<00:01:11.159> or

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
pretty cool they're like palm trees or

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.030 
pretty cool they're like palm trees or
we<00:01:12.090> marijuana<00:01:12.900> plant<00:01:13.170> print<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.890> them

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
we marijuana plant print on them

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.580 
we marijuana plant print on them
whatever<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.670> waited<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.479> week<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.140> stretch<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
whatever I waited a week to stretch to a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.450 
whatever I waited a week to stretch to a
six<00:01:19.590> gauge<00:01:20.930> these<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.110> six<00:01:22.320> gauges<00:01:22.770> my

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
six gauge these are my six gauges my

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.560 
six gauge these are my six gauges my
tapers<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.060> plugs<00:01:24.659> whatever<00:01:26.299> these<00:01:27.299> hurt

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
tapers and plugs whatever these hurt

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.170 
tapers and plugs whatever these hurt
pretty<00:01:27.780> bad<00:01:28.049> too<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.619> waited<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.610> week

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
pretty bad too because I waited a week

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.819 
pretty bad too because I waited a week
to<00:01:30.240> stretch<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.049> supposed<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.650> that

so then I wait like two weeks I went to
a<00:01:36.360> four<00:01:36.869> gauge<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.670> lost<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> plugs<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.600> they

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
a four gauge I lost the plugs that they

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
a four gauge I lost the plugs that they
came<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.500> got<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:40.740> on

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
came with because I got these on

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.460 
came with because I got these on
Spencer's<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:43.280> bus<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.520> 4<00:01:45.000> gauge

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
Spencer's these are the bus off 4 gauge

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.300 
Spencer's these are the bus off 4 gauge
tunnels<00:01:47.479> they<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.680> then<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> waited<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.100> two

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
tunnels they have then I waited like two

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.120 
tunnels they have then I waited like two
weeks<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.729> stretch<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.720> gauge<00:01:51.960> my<00:01:52.259> whole

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
weeks to stretch to a to gauge my whole

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.410 
weeks to stretch to a to gauge my whole
collection<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.790> gauge<00:01:53.939> plugs<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.689> tunnels

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
collection of to gauge plugs and tunnels

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.149 
collection of to gauge plugs and tunnels
I<00:01:59.390> like<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> whole<00:02:01.049> idea<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> double

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I like the whole idea of the double

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.880 
I like the whole idea of the double
flared<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.670> got<00:02:03.329> these<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:04.229> knowing<00:02:04.590> how<00:02:04.710> big

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
flared I got these not knowing how big
