 How are you doing today? 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.650
 weak challenge kaiser plus in wing james 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.720
 where we have to overcome three 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.960
 opponents wing and hammer is a 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.029
 game distributed by data is in 1954 in 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.870
 the relative I only played session 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.910
 recreational I do not know if any version 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.339
 well apart from adn ojeo in another 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.690
 platform since it 's the same so 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.420
 let's insert a credit we put 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.850
 let's do it 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.530
 in the character that I play with the most 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.100
 the espanyol for the shot he had of 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.219
 fire 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 we started with so german go web to see 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.850
 how well does it come out 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.350
 I also have several gameplay that ends 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.690
 with subscribers and seen playing wigan 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.830
 online to see how it works out now 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.160
 much with the game do not lose forgiveness what 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.160
 I feel 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.170
 but more better this game is that the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.909
 machine reaches everything 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.909
 and when I take the characters I do not 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.990
 I take a lot 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.979
 I got one of three but go this 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.979
 set I have no loss 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.729
 do not win the set to the right 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.420
 good buf I do not know if I could get to win 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 three players the truth 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.390
 I remember that as a dwarf I spent evenings 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.180
 afternoons evenings afternoons and evenings in this 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.400
 game 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.110
 many afternoons but you have to 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.920
 recognize him that I'm pretty bad 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.970
 lost a lot of practice in this game 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.010
 take that 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.380
 many afternoons that cast this game the 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.830
 relative that there was next to home not 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.830
 I know why 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.890
 shit 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.890

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.700
 let's give him cane come now I can 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.450
 lose the first one 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.730
 so how can I go 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.870
 although it has arcade games in you 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.870
 you can leave a game well 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.739

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.739
 what is 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.910
 often but in the long run the marked ones 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.130
