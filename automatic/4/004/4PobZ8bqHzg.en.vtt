00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.150
 lift-emv now 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.939
 drink it a little more 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.139
 above 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.849
 We really had a little problem with the cable roll down here 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.490
 both the camera 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.900
 at the worst possible time 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.449
 the wind begins to blow with greater intensity I had the drug 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.789
 but we lost control of everything 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.720
 after months of closing today's session 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 watch that it works correctly 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.840
 those who maneuver the ropes struggle to regain control of the actions 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.040
 r 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.160
 but for colon 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.610
 and add the rope 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 I have ridden not continue climbing and be as high as possible we are in trouble 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.600
 here 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.860
 some that manage to stabilize the blades continued in the headquarters 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.880
 the crane transports the blades very slowly 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 to prevent them from gaining speed 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.100
 remember do not talk mind we still have 10 or 15 meters more ahead 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 what we have to do is verify that everything works correctly 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.430
 the blades reach 2 133 meters high 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.980
 very well 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.440
 this is done until there are boys 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.500
 now the bridge staff takes control ' 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.860
 chemical twist quickly 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.710
 now there is a lot of tension 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.650
 shortly before the wind blows harder 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.650
 now to download them 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 but at least now we do not have to control it 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 finished 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 squares act 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.369
 is already placed 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.149
 Caracas 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.069
 ian sotelo that's 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.589
 well done boys 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:19.079
 odarda thanks thanks is very intuitive without testing today the sound that produces 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.299
 the air when I came into contact with the turbine 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.299
 I could not feel on the bridge 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.899
 ovation 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.959
 carefully 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.980
 we are already lowering the ropes roots of the cranes can be removed 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.869
 women we're finished here so we can go the workers can 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.869
 go back to work so I'll go have a cup of tea 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.539
 the mails of the places move away from a procedure 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:07.369
 the dream of the world's first skyscraper with wind energy is very 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.369
 near 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.779
 but there is still a final test 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:24.009
 still missing that these turbines want to see if truly the dream 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.009
 devised by submitted works 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.579
 spend eight months 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.579
 and the building is practically finished 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.609
 analysis of how everything is by law 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.930
 the systems that allow the operation of the turbines are already 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.930
 installed 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.619
 but what is missing is that the blades begin to arrive 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.409
 it is the moment of the decisive test 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.169
 the turbines will be able to withstand in real conditions 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.139
 maya two alternates true if it's fine 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.600
 they are chile and the Danish team returned to validate the years of research 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.860
 and verify that siemens engineering solutions cabinet 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.729
 since then it is the first test and among many people here eager to see 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:19.829
 what will happen 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.150
 because it's something new for them 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.220
 not only dead there is not much movement now to make sure everything is 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.860
 ready for the final test crimes we could be making history here 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.309
 in fact we are making history 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.469
 then we make history 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:36.640
 but again 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.509
 the perfect wind conditions of tíncer 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.509
 If the wind is weak the turbine could not turn 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.099
 but if it blows very hard the test could be dangerous guest in 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.619
 this time the wind speed is around 8 or 9 meters per 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:53.619
 second is fine to do the test 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.960
 finally the lowest turbine is ready to play 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.890
 racket 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.890
 It planned 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
 the Danes sultán the brake of the turbine 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.529
 and let the wind 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.360
 its beautiful 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.509
 absolutely beautiful I can not believe it's working it spent so much time 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.330
 from the first valence sketch to standing here with the turbines 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.440
 working is amazing when I say it's amazing 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.910
 once the turbines are fully operational the blades will rotate 38 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.129
 times per minute 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.739
 maybe because of this it is simply wonderful it means that for 

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:54.739
 long time we expect this 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.400
 in the next two months the highest turbines will come into operation 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.400
 one to one 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.860
 the first year of operation will be to make the necessary adjustments 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.689
 The team will also monitor the turbines in operation by 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.689
 remote control from copenhagen 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.559
 these turbines will turn here as a source of renewable energy 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.939
 generating about 1,300 megawatts per hour of electricity each year 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.900
 This is the annual equivalent of approximately 2 million tons 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.970
 few coal and 6 million barrels of oil 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.960
 started with the vision of an architect before cnn a hundred extremely attracted 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.449
 to achieve this type of integration the buildings I thought twice 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.249
 so much for me and I do not want to show that it is possible to achieve it only once now 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:51.750
 I just want to demonstrate 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.600
 what can be done more and more times here in different buildings with another 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.430
 type of solutions 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.980
 it is difficult to predict whether skyscrapers powered by wind power 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.509
 will mark an important trend 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.360
 but the team showed that it's possible I'm sure although the architects in 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.419
 the future will consider wind power as an option because there is a 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.419
 precedent as then why not repeat it 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:21.879
 maybe the village delegate the moment to focus only symbolic 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:26.310
 the base because the most important message of the building is that it was 

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:28.919
 designed thinking and fiscal sustainability 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.919
 the place very conscious but also very aesthetic 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:35.330
 yarn 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.779
 they are already working on another skyscraper powered by wind energy 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.360
 istúriz in the neighbor his country 

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:46.879
 in a region where the energy 

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:48.830
 if synonymous with oil 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.740
 chicago
