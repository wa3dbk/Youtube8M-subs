00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:19.830
 and yes that's my first bbc yes he does 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:24.830
 goes to 30.09 yes m that are believable 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.320
 me how much room people the 17 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.300
 So you have almost 13 days of time 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.230
 two weeks 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:42.149
 and yes, tasks are an elvis 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:46.860
 paint with a small accessory for 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:53.000
 example of this monkey here with this 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.449
 bottle so which paper is painted 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.010
 no matter 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.559
 just look for something m who 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.060
 more to sausage or more patchwork lies 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.610
 extra points so then the second 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.070
 task is a little short film brings 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.840
 somehow baking for three to five minutes 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.680
 so the upload is not so long 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.000
 lasts but it does not matter if he's over 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.790
 love if he is sad or scary 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.650
 or quite normal that's your fantasy 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.299
 Freerunning 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:33.750

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:44.939
 music video to bring yes what song 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:46.020

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.290
 yes, that is entirely up to you and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.430
 the last task and therefore also the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.680
 hardest so if someone does a lot 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:05.270
 brave the task is something for 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.849
 tinker the lps 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.330
 yes, for example, an armchair made of clay and 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:17.650
 then paint or what do I know 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.610

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.340
 if he just shows 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.740
