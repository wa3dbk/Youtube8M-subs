00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
we go ahead and pick temperature and we

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750 
we go ahead and pick temperature and we
see<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> teal<00:01:13.500> color<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.250> outside<00:01:14.549> air

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
see a teal color the outside air

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480 
see a teal color the outside air
temperature<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.420> 61<00:01:15.900> degrees<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.369> it's

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
temperature is 61 degrees and so it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.270 
temperature is 61 degrees and so it's
showing<00:01:17.700> between<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.060> green<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> blue<00:01:19.280> we

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
showing between a green and a blue we

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.570 
showing between a green and a blue we
can<00:01:20.400> also<00:01:20.520> check<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> UV<00:01:21.330> index<00:01:21.540> outside<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
can also check the UV index outside and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.359 
can also check the UV index outside and
the<00:01:23.580> UV<00:01:23.850> index<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.270> low<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.900> two<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the UV index is low at two and so the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.469 
the UV index is low at two and so the
orb<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.759> glowing<00:01:27.450> green<00:01:28.820> we<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.970> also<00:01:30.090> choose

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
orb is glowing green we can also choose

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.020 
orb is glowing green we can also choose
