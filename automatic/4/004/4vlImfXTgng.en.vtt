00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.640 
this thing I just saw and picked it up
okay<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> bunch<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> egg<00:01:08.360> cheese<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.560> I

okay so it's a bunch of egg cheese and I

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.990 
okay so it's a bunch of egg cheese and I
thought<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:11.040> might<00:01:11.189> put<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.580> some<00:01:11.790> sausage

taco<00:01:20.430> meat<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:22.110> saw<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.320> they
