00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
on installing a more realistic road and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.080 
on installing a more realistic road and
parking<00:01:41.440> lot<00:01:41.590> around<00:01:41.799> our<00:01:42.010> Milwaukee<00:01:42.400> station

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
parking lot around our Milwaukee station

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.520 
parking lot around our Milwaukee station
complex<00:01:43.479> down<00:01:43.840> there<00:01:44.020> because<00:01:44.140> when<00:01:44.409> we

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
complex down there because when we

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.950 
complex down there because when we
initially<00:01:44.740> got<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:46.240> layout<00:01:46.450> going<00:01:46.690> we<00:01:46.780> just

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
initially got the layout going we just

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.690 
initially got the layout going we just
basically<00:01:47.080> painted<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.770> plywood<00:01:48.190> black<00:01:48.430> and

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
basically painted the plywood black and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.430 
basically painted the plywood black and
it<00:01:48.790> needs<00:01:49.210> some<00:01:49.390> upgrading<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.140> terms<00:01:50.320> of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
it needs some upgrading to in terms of

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.530 
it needs some upgrading to in terms of
realism<00:01:50.860> in<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:51.460> there's<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.729> lot<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:51.970> little

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
realism in so there's a lot of little

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.899 
realism in so there's a lot of little
spots<00:01:52.840> on<00:01:53.200> this<00:01:53.439> massive<00:01:54.040> Milwaukee<00:01:54.549> and

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
spots on this massive Milwaukee and

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.730 
spots on this massive Milwaukee and
northwestern<00:01:55.510> layout<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:56.290> need<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.500> little

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
northwestern layout that need a little

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.740 
northwestern layout that need a little
bit<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:56.920> upgrading<00:01:57.520> exactly<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.420> that's<00:01:58.600> why

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
bit of upgrading exactly and that's why

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.050 
bit of upgrading exactly and that's why
we're<00:01:58.960> here<00:01:59.110> wait<00:01:59.380> am<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.799> railroad<00:02:00.220> coming<00:02:00.880> up
