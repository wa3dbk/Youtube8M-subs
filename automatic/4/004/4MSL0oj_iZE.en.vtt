00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Dude, I played my classes a lot . 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.189
 literature son has no idea how much 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.920
 the java and preschool and sat in the chair 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.719
 and reading by reading and in those things 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.719
 I'll speak more clearly in the video 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.380
 She's the table. I'm Luiz. Goalkeeper does not read. 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.599
 and today I have seen a little comment about the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.550
 my frustrating experiences of 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.130
 PSDB victory as a child in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.110
 School, I decided to make this video more 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.670
 with a criticism of the method of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.129
 teaching literature in schools 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.320
 mainly with poison 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.660
 secondary education, but mainly the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.050
 elementary school because every 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.930
 world reads not even 40 students worldwide 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.950
 where is worth the devil where it is worth and no 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 needed 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.660
 need not be so because it is a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 very cool thing especially when 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.190
 Are you at that age that you are? 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.829
 beginning to enter that the problem may 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.539
 begin to enter this world of books 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.479
 and especially from the literature 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.180
 and juvenile children who are very 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.510
 Nice but not everyone 's worth and 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.520
 for a simple reason that I think 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.670
 this is the reason why it does not read 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.320
 this kind of book until today that are the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.560
 classic literature books 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.500
 Brazilian and Portuguese guy tells me 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.790
 thing because a 13-year-old child 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.680
 6th grade 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.380
 needs a damn of the ax of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.140
 or know if you're a damn 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.750
 of the capital was betraying the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.390
 or not old brain says a 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.369
 mistake in my head this and that's what 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.079
 literature teachers wanted 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.210
 We learned man, I got one. 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.430
 damn job of the 5th grade and the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.310
 5th 8th obtained signal that this work 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.710
 in Portuguese literature called 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.189
 Literary summary I will never forget 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.420
 of this devil for a two-month period. 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.640
 I had to read a book, it's a job. 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.860
 individual is not black the people who gave 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.120
 a school library book and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.130
 summarizes it 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.980
 bruno final with which his opinion on 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.070
 that book and abnt's standards were 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.080
 It's a good thing, it's very easy, that's what the 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.730
 people had to do by hand but she did not 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.440
 see btt cover against cover abstract index is 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.660
 Summary nectar development was the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.490
 summary conclusion that it was his opinion that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 you had to have a brake book mo 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.680
 graphite is to put the data of the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.360
 final and here it was very annoying he has no concept 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.740
 this is not always an ax of 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.300
 so you had to read it 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.010
 but for example there is something that never 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.440
 It will be good of the head that the damn 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.960
 Old trails collection I ended up losing 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.120
 with all my strength of my soul 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.920
 this precarious condition are books 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.840
 olds it's okay that they have a footprint 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.880
 more as a juvenile but are books 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.190
 very old face that the kids did not 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.620
 I want to read I still remember the vehicle 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.050
 I took the guitar and read it so much 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.300
 I'm so deadly hateful and I stay 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.000
 thinking today that I like to read 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.450
 What is the intention of doing this? 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.850
 want to read more and learn to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.580
 I like reading because it does not give a 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.160
 blessed of a 'harry potter' for these 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.680
 blessed of these children from grades 5-8 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.600
 because he does not give a profile of jackson is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.550
 also precise is that it does not even exist 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.680
 at the time but pox harry potter already 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.080
 Expensive, I started reading harry potter. 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.489
 I counted on the 4th grade, but not the people. 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.110
 had to read the classics of literature 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.420
 Brazilian and Portuguese 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.239
 of course I do not understand why 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.340
 Even in high school you have to read the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.930
 books the college entrance exam, you have to read 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.810
 because you will not pass the test 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.540
 but what does teacher of literature cost? 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.810
 the Portuguese is to buy a book that 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.480
 guys like mela first seconds 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.300

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.340
 face of thing you like to read of 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.650
 read that she had that 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.440
 When I was a kid, I liked 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.840
 thriller I liked even more 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.190
 one of the brown the vinci code that 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.130
 At that time I went to 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.950
 fucking a johnny chan than picking up 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.640
 no classic poetry literature 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.709
 I do not know 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.500
 so why not to the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.740
 Portuguese literature teachers 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.860
 leave the children even if they want 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.910
 exa le prince jackson lets read what else 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.790
 I have told 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:25.040
 The Chronicles I seek to leave the galley goal 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:27.710

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.780
 live face says let the children 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.670
 Have fun reading later. 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.540
 front began in the third year of 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.520
 high school 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.260
 they actually started picking up these 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.930
 literature to check 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.450
 even understand more because I got 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.640
 Dude, I did not understand the shit that 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.980
 I was reading I picked up today 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.630
 alive then I went there is one more outburst 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.150
 make a time that I wanted to do this 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.470
 video is that we have started basic in 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.810
 something we like 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.420
 then this deepest in this question 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.210
 called literature that is very broad 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.520
 very engaging and that certainly makes 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.860
 well a lot of people since it was known to 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.290
 inject this taste of knowledge 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.270
 from little in the child 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.880
 teen and everything else one more 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.960
 as an adult there, remember that 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.720
 the great classics of literature 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.940
 Brazilian and Portuguese, and then there 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.400
 critical thinking really to know 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.160
 if the catch only an invention in the head 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.390
 or if it was not for me to like 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.640
 of this video galera 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.190
 leave the comments you think 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.230
 children really have to finally 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.420
 you have to start reading from the 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.150
 these great authors or if they 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.670
 You just like I can give. 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.730
 a loophole leaves them tired that they 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.280
 They want more ahead of us. 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:46.100
 discussing about books is important but 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.950
 about books with more critical 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.300
 I think it 's just leave your like 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.510
 share that helps a lot in 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.610
 dissemination of the channel and until the 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.080
 I remembered another real estate sergeant of 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.490
 Ministers, I had to fucking fail 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.490
 was 100 because it might contain
