right<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:42.300> holder

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
right here you have a little holder

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.790 
right here you have a little holder
right<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.110> says<00:01:43.230> stick<00:01:43.500> pick<00:01:43.680> this

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
right here and it says stick pick this

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.020 
right here and it says stick pick this
is<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.980> size<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.370> supposed<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.790> facing

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
is the size it's supposed to be facing

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.430 
is the size it's supposed to be facing
you<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.600> you're<00:01:45.750> holding<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.020> trekking<00:01:46.290> pole

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
you when you're holding a trekking pole

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.430 
you when you're holding a trekking pole
then<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.310> little<00:01:47.490> screw<00:01:48.440> washer

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
then you have this little screw washer

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.110 
then you have this little screw washer
plastic<00:01:50.100> washer<00:01:50.400> type<00:01:50.580> thing<00:01:50.760> now<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.000> is

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
plastic washer type thing now this is

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.370 
plastic washer type thing now this is
actually<00:01:51.240> very<00:01:51.450> important<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.140> would<00:01:52.260> think

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
actually very important you would think

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.680 
actually very important you would think
that<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.580> a<00:01:53.610> digital<00:01:53.970> camera<00:01:54.120> this

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
that if you have a digital camera this

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.330 
that if you have a digital camera this
case<00:01:54.900> I'm<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> use<00:01:55.290> my<00:01:55.440> Olympus<00:01:55.800> 770

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
case I'm going to use my Olympus 770

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.500 
case I'm going to use my Olympus 770
that<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.550> could<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.820> screw<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.150> on<00:01:57.300> but

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
that you could just screw this on but

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.820 
that you could just screw this on but
the<00:01:57.600> thing<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:57.900> this<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.620> you<00:01:58.710> screw

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
the thing about this is if you screw

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.610 
the thing about this is if you screw
this<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.220> there's<00:02:00.000> no<00:02:00.180> way<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> tell<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:01.440> what

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
this on there's no way to tell at what

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
this on there's no way to tell at what
point<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.610> will<00:02:02.790> stop<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.360> might<00:02:03.660> stop

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
point this will stop it might stop

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.350 
point this will stop it might stop
perpendicular<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> way<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.120> you<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
perpendicular this way and you have the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.650 
perpendicular this way and you have the
camera<00:02:06.570> facing<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> wrong<00:02:07.170> way<00:02:08.090> because<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
camera facing the wrong way because the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.330 
camera facing the wrong way because the
threads<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.110> every<00:02:10.349> camera<00:02:10.769> are<00:02:10.950> different

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
threads on every camera are different

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.650 
threads on every camera are different
and<00:02:11.490> stops<00:02:11.760> at<00:02:11.940> different<00:02:12.210> links<00:02:12.420> so

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and stops at different links so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.060 
and stops at different links so
basically<00:02:13.380> what<00:02:13.530> you're<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.770> use<00:02:13.830> is

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
basically what you're going to use is

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.050 
basically what you're going to use is
you're<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> use<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.550> little<00:02:14.730> washer

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
you're going to use this little washer

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.960 
you're going to use this little washer
here<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.690> tie

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
here to tie

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.360 
here to tie
up<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:17.080> order<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.560> your<00:02:17.860> camera<00:02:18.160> facing

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
up in order to have your camera facing

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.250 
up in order to have your camera facing
the<00:02:19.090> right<00:02:19.210> way<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:19.420> basically<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.020> screw

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the right way so basically you screw

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.860 
the right way so basically you screw
this<00:02:20.350> on<00:02:20.670> not<00:02:21.670> all<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.880> way<00:02:22.000> down<00:02:22.180> then<00:02:22.780> I'm

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
this on not all the way down then I'm

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.150 
this on not all the way down then I'm
going<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.050> screw<00:02:23.200> my<00:02:23.350> camera<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.830> basically

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
going to screw my camera and basically

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.370 
going to screw my camera and basically
what<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:24.940> want<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.330> for<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> camera<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.350> be

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
what you want is for the camera to be

what you want is for the camera to be
facing<00:02:26.710> this<00:02:27.400> side<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.530> I'm<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.800> screw

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
facing this side so I'm going to screw

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.340 
facing this side so I'm going to screw
this<00:02:32.550> your<00:02:33.550> lanyard<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.210> help<00:02:34.450> me<00:02:34.630> screw<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.200> on

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
it so the camera is pretty stable so it

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.240 
it so the camera is pretty stable so it
won't<00:03:01.900> jiggle<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.560> won't<00:03:02.709> turn<00:03:02.890> as<00:03:03.160> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
won't jiggle and it won't turn as you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.190 
won't jiggle and it won't turn as you
can<00:03:03.370> see<00:03:03.490> now<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.760> camera<00:03:04.209> is<00:03:04.660> facing<00:03:04.780> this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
can see now the camera is facing this

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.910 
can see now the camera is facing this
side<00:03:05.459> now<00:03:06.459> take<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.209> stick<00:03:07.420> pic<00:03:07.800> take<00:03:08.800> your

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
side now take the stick pic take your

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.310 
side now take the stick pic take your
trekking<00:03:09.190> pole<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:10.180> wedge<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.660> on<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.900> left

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
trekking pole you wedge it in on a left

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.230 
trekking pole you wedge it in on a left
and<00:03:11.560> kind<00:03:11.709> of<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.040> rocking<00:03:12.430> motion<00:03:12.790> now

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
and kind of like a rocking motion now

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.880 
and kind of like a rocking motion now
since<00:03:13.810> trekking<00:03:14.170> poles<00:03:14.350> are<00:03:14.470> different<00:03:14.709> sizes

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
since trekking poles are different sizes

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.230 
since trekking poles are different sizes
there<00:03:15.130> are<00:03:15.190> different<00:03:15.430> sizes<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.790> stick<00:03:16.030> pick

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
there are different sizes of stick pick
