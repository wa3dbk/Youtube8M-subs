00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.840
 medals can be redistributed but 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.849
 communes 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.409
 when and for what reason exploring our

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:42.539
 Jamaicans 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.159
 instead promising gold medals won 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.680
 american olympic gold 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.470
 and what's important is won be not 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.170
 in such a way that all so received 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.740
 way therefore 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.860
 really no emotion 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.310

 false testimony to federal agents 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.840

 in a number of these frames of educational film 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.569
 it's hard to imagine how you can replace 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.020
 or slip 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.310

 esoteric go for it 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.340
 the so-called doping endurance 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.840
 after the victory the competitions were held 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.840
 the second was positive 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.669
 I'll say all the time what it was 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.290
 who mistake biathletes dmitry 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.210

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.390
 responsibility on other russian 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.909

 athletes are responsible for 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.889
 all that goes into his body 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.809
 apparently because 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:46.059
 he himself found it somewhere someone gave it to him and what 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.449
 that told 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.209
 the truth is it always soothes 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.279
 think 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:52.249
 before you do something 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:54.699
 water reserves expected program 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.349
 the road cost them all sports life 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.849
 celebrated a little and now remember 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:00.650
 do not want 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.269
 and often say that the most important thing 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.450
 went up in the stadium and in the courtroom 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.730
 in 2000, the coach testified against 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.730
 sports leadership former 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.099
 rdr and they were sentenced to two years 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.749
 the conclusion is not quite what I was waiting for 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.840
 I wanted them to stay exactly 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.729
 the end of the century the internet but not 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.699
 happened twice the leader blamed 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.509
 sports officials in that 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.039
 became a man ilyich eighties and site 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.770
 sportswomen by last name or not 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.160
 did the champion 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.670
 pills and also does not regret what the results 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.230
 Russia with male hormones 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.880
 programs I was in the role of women in men 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.800
 the appearance of the proportion of male women left me 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.970
 under the ground 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.140
 and if you need to make your name 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.780
 in 31 countries, the crisis did not commit suicide 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.780
 rescued sex change operation 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.399
 when the day of the Soviet sport for big 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:53.709
 doses close attention to the Russian 

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:55.050
 athletes today 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.780
 this is partly natural 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.800
 when Russia record is by leaps and bounds 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.080
 I recommended the moment I always say at my place 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.419
 no athlete caught the world 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.419
 date setting records are all alive healthy 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.740
 so I said he had a big dose 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.910
 it is harmful and what could be ounces impotence 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.949
 true and other stuff other 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.889
 Ivana Bandera knows how to grow 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:19.849

 his players played Olympiad gold 12 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.169
 russia bulgaria man legend and 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.539
 outstanding coach and although Bulgarian

 to their athletes except for the barbell enemies 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.460
 gave nothing you know the secret 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.770
 Bulgarian weightlifters 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.310
 capable of techniques and without directives

 grueling workouts 59 m year 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.780
 we won Russian 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.680
 but we didn't use it more healthy 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.680
 everything happened naturally 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.279
 d 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.839

 he trained weightlifters 

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:06.099
 Bulgaria collapse is clear that he is not the best 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.099
 at the moment when you could recruit 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.009
 acid 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:09.819

 Mid Russia recognizes on some physical 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.860
 data most people are far from 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.749
 run away today is more important to find 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:19.050
 athletes scientific approach state 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.479
 take place in Vancouver Chinese

 national team in Beijing 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.590
 many saw 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.940
 new technology advanced 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.690
 river special mortar then work 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.009
 only socks 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.389
 Only here is the working form well sport 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.759
 and only at the stage secured said that 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.639
 even small companies a biochemist can 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.919
 make changes elena hurt staged 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.439
 so another dozen 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.389
 to discover 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.900
 the first question that continues to work 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.610
 in the championship pursuit 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.360
 the candidate said and I will stay 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.569
 always talked chasing first 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.199
 invent then catch sometimes already 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.770
 after the completion of a career therefore totals 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.629
 Olympiad can change even then 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.029
 the games themselves have become history 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.029
 due to 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.919
 here
