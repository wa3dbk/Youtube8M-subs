you about the Decameron 17 250 2.8 lens
with<00:00:18.330> vibration<00:00:18.900> compensation<00:00:19.460> normally<00:00:20.460> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
with vibration compensation normally I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.130 
with vibration compensation normally I
wouldn't<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.850> too<00:00:21.029> interested<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.869> lens

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the 17 255 an icon and they both work

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
the 17 255 an icon and they both work
great<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:30.300> 2.8<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.320> don't<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:31.800> feel

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
great at 2.8 and I don't really feel

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.209 
great at 2.8 and I don't really feel
like<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.000> VR<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:33.809> VC<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:35.010> that

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
like I have to have VR or VC with that

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
like I have to have VR or VC with that
lens<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.700> help<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.120> however<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.780> recently

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
lens to help out however I recently

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.100 
lens to help out however I recently
learned<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.430> d300s<00:00:39.149> does<00:00:39.750> use

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
learned that the d300s does use

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.470 
learned that the d300s does use
vibration<00:00:40.680> reduction<00:00:40.860> while<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.000> recording

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
vibration reduction while it's recording

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.340 
vibration reduction while it's recording
video<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> 17<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.370> 200<00:00:44.969> or

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
video so if you have the 17 to 200 or

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.529 
video so if you have the 17 to 200 or
this<00:00:46.350> lens<00:00:46.850> while<00:00:47.850> you're<00:00:48.059> walking<00:00:48.239> around

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
this lens while you're walking around

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.869 
this lens while you're walking around
the<00:00:49.050> vibration<00:00:49.559> compensation<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:50.610> does

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the vibration compensation really does

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.139 
the vibration compensation really does
help<00:00:51.329> steady<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> shots<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> we've<00:00:54.000> been

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
help steady the shots and so we've been

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.939 
help steady the shots and so we've been
using<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.600> handheld<00:00:55.050> we've<00:00:55.350> been<00:00:55.500> using<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.860> on

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
using it handheld we've been using it on

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.299 
using it handheld we've been using it on
a<00:00:55.980> tripod<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> pan<00:00:58.379> we

a tripod you know if you want to pan we

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.040 
a tripod you know if you want to pan we
also<00:00:59.430> use<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> on<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> Steadicam<00:01:00.270> Merlin<00:01:00.480> when

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
also use it on the Steadicam Merlin when

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
also use it on the Steadicam Merlin when
we're<00:01:01.199> walking<00:01:01.559> around<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.340> does<00:01:02.520> really

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
we're walking around and it does really

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
we're walking around and it does really
smooth<00:01:03.090> everything<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.290> wanted<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589

smooth everything out and I wanted to
show<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.979> really<00:01:05.489> quick<00:01:05.729> demonstration

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
show you a really quick demonstration

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.660 
show you a really quick demonstration
Patrick<00:01:07.560> who's<00:01:07.710> Manning<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> camera<00:01:08.460> feels

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
Patrick who's Manning the camera feels

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
Patrick who's Manning the camera feels
start<00:01:08.909> shaking<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> camera<00:01:09.740> vibration

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
start shaking the camera vibration

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.469 
start shaking the camera vibration
compensation<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
compensation is on right now so you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
compensation is on right now so you
should<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.869> able<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.920> bitty

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
should be able to see a little bitty

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.990 
should be able to see a little bitty
shake<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:15.210> ahead<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.479> flip<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.759> do

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
shake go ahead and flip it off and do

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
shake go ahead and flip it off and do
the<00:01:18.090> same<00:01:18.270> shake<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.920> now<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.979> should

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the same shake and now you should

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.280 
the same shake and now you should
probably<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.850> able<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.299> me<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> going

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
probably be able to see me kind of going

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.020 
probably be able to see me kind of going
wacky<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.520> more<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
wacky you can see a little bit more of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.560 
wacky you can see a little bit more of
the<00:01:24.270> jelly<00:01:25.080> effect<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.390> overall<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.540> just

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the jelly effect so overall I just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.780 
the jelly effect so overall I just
wanted<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> say<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> professionals<00:01:29.640> out

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
wanted to say a lot of professionals out

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
wanted to say a lot of professionals out
there<00:01:29.820> may<00:01:30.150> say<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.630> don't<00:01:31.020> need<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.380> lens

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
there may say I don't need this lens

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
there may say I don't need this lens
I've<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> Nikon<00:01:33.329> version<00:01:33.780> which<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
I've got the the Nikon version which is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.260 
I've got the the Nikon version which is
much<00:01:34.229> better<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:35.100> four<00:01:35.460> or<00:01:35.579> five<00:01:35.729> times<00:01:35.970> more

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
much better and four or five times more

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
much better and four or five times more
expensive<00:01:36.420> however<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.650> you're<00:01:37.829> doing<00:01:37.860> video

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
expensive however if you're doing video

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.789 
expensive however if you're doing video
I<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.180> lens<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.540> great<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.170> since<00:01:40.650> its

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
I think this lens is great and since its

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.319 
I think this lens is great and since its
2.8<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> great<00:01:42.060> job<00:01:42.270> for

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
2.8 it's going to do a great job for

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.569 
2.8 it's going to do a great job for
still<00:01:42.869> images<00:01:43.350> too<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> want<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.340> both

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
still images too if you want to do both

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.450 
still images too if you want to do both
so<00:01:44.909> don't<00:01:45.540> don't<00:01:45.899> um<00:01:46.200> knock<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.310> off

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
so don't don't um knock this one off

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.030 
so don't don't um knock this one off
your<00:01:47.670> list<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.090> let<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.750> yet<00:01:48.960> give<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
your list just let just yet give it a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.109 
your list just let just yet give it a
try<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:50.909> you'll<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.390> like

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.530 

and<00:01:56.200> awaken<00:01:57.200> your<00:01:57.890> weight<00:01:58.220> from<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.240> ground

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540
