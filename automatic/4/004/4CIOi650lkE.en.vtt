00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.740
 in years as they were welcome to a 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.170
 new video and good guys in this 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.180
 occasion we are in minecraft and 0.90 for 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.440
 cent is here and before starting them 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.670
 I want to ask a huge apology as 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.750
 I know many of you wanted me to 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.490
 did a gameplay of these the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.750
 but as you know, I do not have 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.860
 what is an android terminal so 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.599
 which I had to resort to my computer 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.099
 and I got off what is the program called 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.449
 bluestacks and for those who do not know 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.519
 is the blue is that is basically a 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.990
 program that serves to therefore emulate 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.939
 android and be able to play games of the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.980
 playstation and musician is the day of 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.780
 today I hope a very short video because 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.640
 Well I do not plan to give them all the bibio 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.590
 because we'll do that when the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 final version for them so then 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.370
 first of all I want to show you what 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.930
 is the new interface so to speak and 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.149
 presume that here and there in the area 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.829
 of the adjustments because they do not change anything with 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.420
 regarding the options with respect to 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.180
 the controls everything remains the same as the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.039
 steel point 8.1 the viewing distance 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.510
 it's still easy to graph so 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.010
 we'll be the day guys I want to tell you 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.500
 that I will only show you the new modes 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.750
 in micro speed 0.1 zero point that would be 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.810
 the lenderman the villager the slim the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.610
 silver fish and the wolf so why 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.990
 Here you can see that we have the option to 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.400
 worlds and on the right side we get 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.380
 now what is the weight of the world that if 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.119
 I'm not bad, as you progress 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.860
 it creates more weight for you now every first 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.899
 boy is that if we give in edit us 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.759
 comes out what is the seed the external 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.100
 because as always the name of the 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.960
 server the address and the port that 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.700
 has this part and if we give it in new 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.020
 Well, the whole option to create a new 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.570
 world can see that here we have 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.280
 then the part to put the name in 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.990
 this part we have now put in 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.700
 sen survival and creative and if 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.560
 we are on my computer can see that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.000
 if we give it in advanced then you can see 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.500
 that we have the option to put the type 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.289
 of the world that if we want it in mode 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.149
 old as in 0.8 in infinity or in 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.069
 plan ok but if we give it in plane then 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.569
 you already know here that you can only 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.830
 creative way to say that then 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.869
 we will go to the world guys that I already have 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.450
 here made to show the new 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.310
 mobs that minecraft and ok and well I think that 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.439
 it is very difficult to use the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.909
 Android because you can not use anything the 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.049
 keyboard simply with the monkey if 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.420
 you want now you can see here that we have 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.220
 to the villagers which if I'm not 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.439
 wrong since afterwards from build 2 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.849
 it is exposed to babies so for 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.590
 that we have them can see that their egg 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.720
 is this and if we give you first that we 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.519
 So it's random because it's a 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.440
 adult villager and you can see that this 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.450
 like ads because this our pc is 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.010
 as a village we do not look for you are not 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.750
 very nice handsome bianchi 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.010
 and then in this part you can see that we 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.129
 You can also leave what is an altra 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.659
 baby so it's over I should not go out 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.939
 a baby villager so here we have it 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.829
 it's like an adult villager but the mini 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.360
 so then continuing this way they can 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.489
 see that we now have the wolves the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 which are minecraft favorites themselves 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.180
 apart from the zombies and I will see that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.010
 here we have them guys and for 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.959
 train them for those who do not know not to 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.610
 so tame them what we have to 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.440
 to do is simply with a bone for 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.030
 here of general without without encounters egg 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.920
 that we have forgiveness yes while a 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.269
 little but I'm nervous so it's 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.560
 recording my computer then which 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.959
 I had never done so here if 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.090
 we give to the egg of the boy of this wolf 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.250
 boys can see that it does not come out and for 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.379
 be able to domesticate both what 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.319
 we have to do is take a little egg or 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.639
 in an egg do not take a bone and you 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.989
 we leave pressing on here 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.450
 boys and you can see that it would be 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.370
 our pet and it's very easy ok but 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.959
 remember that if there are wild wolves 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.090
 the street or through the forest you can see that 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.920
 if we put some accounts here if you hit 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.480
 to one or if there are several boats around here 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.700
 we can put a few because 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.500
 only babies come out ok if we hit one 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.480
 you can see that all absolutely everyone 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.040
 they are going to want to bite us why it happens 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.019
 this because they are not like that 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.849
 it's very defensive so mites ok 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.739
 this happens with the wolves are going to be me 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.810
 bothering a little but what will happen 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.189
 now with the area of ​​the line which 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.250
 it weighs here but I do not know why 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.290
 motive that was canceled from a child I'm going 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.569
 to have to download the ok the example here 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.359
 is doing a little body does not have ok and 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.609
 say I'm going to kill them I'm so sorry 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.840
 but they are playing with the wind and 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.060
 nice seriously I love these 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.950
 monsters and if you hit your pet 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.780
 Well clearly you will notice damages and that therefore 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.739
 over here you can see guys he does 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.659
 damage ok 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.579
 so in this part I had alex 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.500
 line let me look it over here you can see 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.810
 that your spawn egg is this for a 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.269
 we have change and we get it 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:10.280
 a month line and this one medium but so 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.599
 general then install it very large 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.299
 so for what can I put it 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.599
 boys if we put it you can see that 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.880
 it goes like this already and if we hit it like all 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.099
 that time we know you can see that 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.599
 will then the medium world then very 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.070
 so small that I come over here I will 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.110
 Pasting is online is very difficult in 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.240
 serious team remember that if you want more 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.350
 videos from the 0.1 points 0 me what 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.300
 You can let us comment 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.300
 boys in the comments 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.820
 and we give it about three strokes or two if not 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.950
 I'm bad then see and then attack 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.340
 I forgot to tell you this if you hit a 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.200
 zombie or something your wolf friend is going to 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.330
 defend so that since if he hit 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.430
 he is automatically going to hit him like this 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.560
 that did not happen but well that 's the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.300
 Well , the wolves gave us the ok 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.580
 here we have the line for that part 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.290
 we would have the red Franciscans who 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.210
 would be normal francisca but in his days 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.010
 so typical the administration with well 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.690
 that for here we have the girls 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.130
 guys who are normal can see that 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.110
 so that we have them and we can 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.690
 find only in the language of near 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.250
 only in the language of certain are they 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.230
 for this part we have the silver fish 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.610
 which I love and only know 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.980
 find in what would be the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.930
 strengths for the LED portal and if 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.030
 I'm not bad in the viu 3 they go up good in 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.410
 the viu you did not tell me that there was 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.850
 a ship in which then we are 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.440
 I recommend the floor and when you put 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.240
 in front of them you shut up then not 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.720
 I know how that is but you can see 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.220
 that are already working and all ok 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.900
 perfect we will now pass with whatever 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.639
 ascending man then which 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.699
 I think if they have a certain book because 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.870
 when I put one I do not know why the hell 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.449
 disappear a thousand times and the children are very 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.039
 stressful I do not know why I want that 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.509
 repair this but you can see that 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.250
 over here have a lot of egg which is 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.410
 black and it looks like a coal thing 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.180
 you can see that if we put it here it 's 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.009
 lenderman and well you already have the particles 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.530
 but the problem that I have with them 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.120
 is that many teleports are mine 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.250
 it does not go even 10 seconds and 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.539
 quite transporting you and good is 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.550
 something very very annoying in reality but 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.590
 you can see that we have here 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.180
 and build everything then nothing 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.160
 these would be the new musicians of the 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.440
 new version of minecraft and 0.9 point 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.760
 zero and then I think this would be all 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.560
 I hope you liked it you know that 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.880
 You can leave your like to com / fort like this 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.080
 who also remembers sharing it with 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.789
 all your accounts so they know with 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.830
 respect this channel that every day we are 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.870
 more in this family so it can be 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.669
 the boys a thousand apologies for taking so much 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.169
 but as you will always know, 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.940
 makes this difficult and believe me now 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.349
 I'm my computer then it's a bit 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.620
 difficult this controls but good 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:34.940
 yes if you want more videos from the 0.1 of 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.710
