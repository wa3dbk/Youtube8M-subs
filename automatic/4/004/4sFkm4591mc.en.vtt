Yakko<00:00:33.780> yes<00:00:34.530> miss<00:00:34.800> flamiel<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.489> want<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
Yakko yes miss flamiel I want you to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.560 
Yakko yes miss flamiel I want you to
multiply<00:00:36.750> 47<00:00:37.530> times<00:00:37.770> 83<00:00:38.239> seven<00:00:39.239> times<00:00:39.420> three

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
multiply 47 times 83 seven times three

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600 
multiply 47 times 83 seven times three
is<00:00:39.660> twenty-one<00:00:39.780> which<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> just

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
is twenty-one which as you know is just

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.610 
is twenty-one which as you know is just
two<00:00:41.760> tens<00:00:42.030> plus<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.079> put<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> 1

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
two tens plus one and so we put the 1

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
two tens plus one and so we put the 1
right<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.370> carry<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> two<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.120> left

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
right here and we carry the two one left

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.790 
right here and we carry the two one left
to<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> top<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.020> tens<00:00:46.230> place<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.649> next

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to the top of the tens place right next

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.350 
to the top of the tens place right next
door<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.250> put<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.640> top<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> number

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
door and we put it on top of the number

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.790 
door and we put it on top of the number
four<00:00:48.629> which<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.899> really<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.320> tens<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.710> we

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
four which is really for tens that we

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
four which is really for tens that we
multiply<00:00:50.250> times<00:00:50.640> three<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> ones<00:00:51.180> place

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
multiply times three in the ones place

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.180 
multiply times three in the ones place
and<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.809> why<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.680> 12<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.100> we

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and that's why we now have 12 which we

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.060 
and that's why we now have 12 which we
add<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> two<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.969> carry<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.510> 14

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
add to the two that we carry to get 14

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.360 
add to the two that we carry to get 14
see<00:00:56.070> how<00:00:56.190> easy<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.899> oh-ho<00:00:57.899> it's

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
see how easy that was oh-ho it's

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.100 
see how easy that was oh-ho it's
multiplication<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.789> math<00:01:00.000> education

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
multiplication it's math education

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.110 
multiplication it's math education
hey<00:01:01.440> Albert<00:01:01.890> Einstein<00:01:02.310> said<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
hey Albert Einstein said that it's so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.650 
hey Albert Einstein said that it's so
easy<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.540> do<00:01:03.900> it<00:01:04.710> simple<00:01:05.190> it's<00:01:05.400> crazy<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.420> fun

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
easy to do it simple it's crazy it's fun

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.770 
easy to do it simple it's crazy it's fun
and<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.110> easy<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:08.130> by<00:01:08.280> calculator<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.600> can

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and it's easy just by calculator you can

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
and it's easy just by calculator you can
multiply<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.510> second<00:01:16.050> digit<00:01:16.580> 7

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
multiply and now the second digit 7

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.790 
multiply and now the second digit 7
times<00:01:17.729> 8<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> 56<00:01:18.300> which<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.560> just

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
times 8 is 56 which as you know is just

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.980 
times 8 is 56 which as you know is just
five<00:01:20.160> pence<00:01:20.400> plus<00:01:20.580> 6n<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.390> flip<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> takes

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
five pence plus 6n so we flip the takes

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.540 
five pence plus 6n so we flip the takes
right<00:01:22.260> here<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> tens<00:01:22.860> place<00:01:22.950> left<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
right here in the tens place left of the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.520 
right here in the tens place left of the
1<00:01:23.670> carry<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> five<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.840> did<00:01:24.960> before<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
1 carry the five like we did before to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.780 
1 carry the five like we did before to
the<00:01:25.590> top<00:01:25.800> for<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> tens<00:01:26.220> place<00:01:26.280> next<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.760> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the top for the tens place next to the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.000 
the top for the tens place next to the
4th<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.270> multiply<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.080> 4<00:01:28.350> times<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.830> get

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
4th and multiply that 4 times a to get

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.190

32z<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.970> Miss<00:01:30.180> ways<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.660> add<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> five

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
32z is Miss ways and we add the five

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080 
32z is Miss ways and we add the five
that<00:01:31.410> we<00:01:31.500> carried<00:01:31.770> before<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.160> get<00:01:32.280> 37<00:01:32.760> then

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
that we carried before to get 37 then

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.490 
that we carried before to get 37 then
and<00:01:33.360> once<00:01:33.570> more<00:01:33.750> straight<00:01:33.990> down<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.350> get

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and once more straight down to get
