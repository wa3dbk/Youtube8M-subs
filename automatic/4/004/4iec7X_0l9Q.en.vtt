00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 it is said sausage or sausage comes from me 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.480
 laugh because when I hear you say 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.670
 sanctions makes me laugh because it is 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.130
 basically wrong is said 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.170
 sausage the correct term in 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.420
 Italian also according to the academy of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.850
 however, bran and sausage in the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.070
 Italian vocabulary found written 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.650
 both sausage and sausage because 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.109
 sausage, however, remains a variant 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.510
 popular especially used 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.640
 in dialects even sar ciccia in 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.370
 tuscany and in the central regions 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 Italy 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.280
 many people fall into error because 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.960
 believes it is unfair because sausage 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.460
 they see it composed of sal salt and fat 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.350
 which means meat in dialect while 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.829
 in reality it is not so because even 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.739
 I found out that sausage comes from a 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.909
 term of the late Latin that sausage 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.960
 with a c and is formed by sse in the south and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.689
 in Sicily I don't know what it means 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 sausage meatball as I said before is 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.979
 a term that remains more dialectical one 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 Popular variant presents as vi 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.210
 I said in the vocabulary and the academy 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.420
 of the coast recommends using 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.630
 this term more than anything else in contexts 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.689
 family members is not very formal 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.729
 obviously if you type it sanctions a text 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.530
 written a school theme in short I think 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.369
 that I punish you physically not 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.110
 joke for information for for 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.619
 foreigners above all who follow me and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.110
 who do not know what it is and lose one 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.820
 great thing the sausage is not 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.250
 nothing but a sausage is cannes 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.340
 it is practically a mixture of fat parts 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.579
 and mother parts of the animal of the flesh 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.460
 which can be pork chicken etc. that 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.829
 they are minced inserted in a casing 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.869
 what a profit that would be a gut 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.830
 natural you can choose if e 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.190
 eat 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.850
 they eat more than the addition of spices and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.080
 salt is therefore a kind of a mixed meat 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.980
 of delicious pieces of meat if 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.990
 Come in Italy 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.320
 but I know that we also eat outside 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:29.820
 you absolutely have to eat for example 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.280
 sausage potato sausage and beans ai 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:37.140
 very good so in short this video 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.900
 he just wanted to urge you not to say 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.480
 sausage because it is really ugly 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.040
 I recommend sausage 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.790
 greetings to all and see you at 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.790
