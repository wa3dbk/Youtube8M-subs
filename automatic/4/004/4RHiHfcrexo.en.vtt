00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
who was gonna go first and they're like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.570

the<00:01:20.700> first<00:01:20.880> pick<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.240> think<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the first pick and I think it was the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.320 
the first pick and I think it was the
Milwaukee<00:01:22.740> Bucks<00:01:23.100> coming<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:24.060> high

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
Milwaukee Bucks coming in really high

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.660 
Milwaukee Bucks coming in really high
percentage<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.960> twenty<00:01:25.229> five<00:01:25.409> percent

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
percentage of like twenty five percent

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.010 
percentage of like twenty five percent
compared<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> other<00:01:26.939> teams<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.390> Orlando

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
compared to the other teams like Orlando

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.010 
compared to the other teams like Orlando
Magic<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.619> los<00:01:28.950> angeles<00:01:29.159> lakers<00:01:29.780> utah<00:01:30.780> jazz

Magic the los angeles lakers utah jazz

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
Magic the los angeles lakers utah jazz
and<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.439> think<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.369> Boston<00:01:32.759> self-existing

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and I think the Boston self-existing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.700 
and I think the Boston self-existing
need<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.780> remembering<00:01:34.200> off<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> top<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.619> my

big<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:55.350> rare<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> come<00:01:55.770> by<00:01:55.920> these<00:01:56.100> days

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
big is very rare to come by these days

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.330 
big is very rare to come by these days
so<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.329> guess<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.590> might<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.920> trying<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.219> go

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
so I guess they might be trying to go

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.580 
so I guess they might be trying to go
for<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.820> that's<00:02:00.420> who<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.689> put<00:02:00.990> probably<00:02:01.350> go

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
for and be that's who I put probably go

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.069 
for and be that's who I put probably go
for<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.829> thousand<00:02:02.250> Cleveland<00:02:02.729> GM<00:02:03.119> step<00:02:03.899> back

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
for a thousand Cleveland GM step back

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
for a thousand Cleveland GM step back
jump<00:02:04.320> shot<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> face<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> defense<00:02:05.549> all

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
jump shot in the face of the defense all

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.580 
jump shot in the face of the defense all
this<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.119> anyway<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:07.530> they

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
this up anyway that's what I think they

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.380 
this up anyway that's what I think they
might<00:02:07.710> go<00:02:07.860> for<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.819> course<00:02:08.849> we're<00:02:09.209> playing

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
might go for and of course we're playing

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.850 
might go for and of course we're playing

even<00:02:12.760> am<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.320> my<00:02:14.590> opinion<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.190> don't<00:02:15.580> think

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
even am I in my opinion I don't think

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.520 
even am I in my opinion I don't think
he's<00:02:16.090> gonna<00:02:16.210> come<00:02:16.420> back<00:02:16.540> cleaver<00:02:16.900> not<00:02:17.290> just

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
yet anyway if he comes back he'll be the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.170 
yet anyway if he comes back he'll be the
later<00:02:19.750> date<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.170> his<00:02:20.260> career<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:21.310> how<00:02:21.760> NJ

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
just for the Wizards I think you might

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.090 
just for the Wizards I think you might
do<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:26.080> obviously<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.650> obviously<00:02:26.950> not

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
do that not obviously is obviously not

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.340 
do that not obviously is obviously not
gonna<00:02:27.190> retire<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.790> come<00:02:28.000> back<00:02:28.150> but<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.230> know

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
gonna retire and come back but you know

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.600 
gonna retire and come back but you know
that's<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.650> what<00:02:29.800> I'm<00:02:30.040> thinking<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.460> might

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
that's just what I'm thinking you might

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.240 
that's just what I'm thinking you might

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
thinking it's gonna be a high pick up

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.000 
thinking it's gonna be a high pick up
probably<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.600> beed<00:02:37.900> hype<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.740> when<00:02:38.830> it's<00:02:38.950> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
probably in beed hype it when it's a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.730 
probably in beed hype it when it's a
high<00:02:39.130> pick<00:02:39.690> probably<00:02:40.690> going<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.870> be<00:02:40.960> probably

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
high pick probably going to be probably

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.060 
high pick probably going to be probably
a<00:02:41.800> big<00:02:42.040> public<00:02:42.280> embiid<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:43.270> course<00:02:43.780> a

championship<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.160> think<00:02:45.310> Andrew<00:02:45.610> Wiggins<00:02:45.940> he's

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
championship I think Andrew Wiggins he's

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.520 
championship I think Andrew Wiggins he's
not<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.270> big<00:02:46.510> E's<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.810> small<00:02:47.020> 40s<00:02:47.440> and
