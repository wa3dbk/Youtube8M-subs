00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.430
 Let's see what you can see 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.590
 eye in the sky this week at dusk 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.630
 we can see the planet Mars in 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.070
 constellation of aquarium to the west 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.960
 mars visible until 9 pm 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.230
 jupiter is in the constellation of bull and 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.919
 It can be seen until two hours 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.660
 dawn 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.200
 we can see saturn from one hour 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.989
 to the east in the pound constellation on day 3 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.360
 the moon will be to the right of saturn at 6 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.940
 Venus appears in the constellation of 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 Sagittarius this is the last week for 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 see the brightest of the planets 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.370
 completing our series of programs 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.379
 about his chronic nomenclature 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.409
 Let's talk about how the clusters of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.199
 nebulous stars galaxies are named 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.180
 strictly speaking there is no specific rule 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.100
 many times these objects take only 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.619
 the name of conservation where they are 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.049
 as an orion nebula and the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.640
 galaxy of other andromeda 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.100
 astronomers get carried away by 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.380
 imagination inspired by the appearance of the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.330
 that they can see through the eyepiece of the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 hubble telescope clusters of 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.320
 butterfly stars beehive the duck 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.710
 the forms of the nebulae suggest 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.590
 the names of witch-headed tarantula and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.130
 California and distant galaxies already 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 received the names of sunflower tadpole and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.200
 hat but even with all the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.990
 imagination of the world would require a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.950
 eternity to give name to everything there is 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.440
 in the universe 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.750
 so the vast majority of objects 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.429
 celestial bodies is known only by its 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.229
 registration in a catalog 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.940
 there are thousands of catalogs 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.679
 astronomical data compiled from 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.970
 and which can be very 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.739
 specific 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.289
 we find today from catalogs of 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:07.050
 neutron stars to the galaxies 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.629
 peculiar but the most popular objects 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.790
 generally fall within two 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:17.190
 large catalogs of ms and ngc in 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.410
 1771 the French charles of being a hunter 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.030
 of comets that often confused 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.120
 with targets with nebulae 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.370
 I'm 103 nebulous-looking objects 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.800
 indicated by the letter m 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.599
 to this day these names are used by 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.810
 astronomers worldwide 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.709
 already the ngc or thousand general catalog was 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.019
 organized in 1888 by John Bray and 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.700
 gathers almost 8 thousand objects 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.610
 not satisfied with this task 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.580
 monstrous beach has still posted more 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.019
 two extensions to ngc known as 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.290
 catalogs index 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.019
 in total dryer listed more than 13 thousand 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.180
 objects looking at the sky 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.310
 you're probably going to spy on some 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.710
 object in these lists 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.710
 after observations in his books to all
