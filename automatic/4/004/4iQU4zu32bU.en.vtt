00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.820 
you know I think we're just picking it
or<00:00:24.750> putting<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.050> together<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.439> team<00:00:25.619> right

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
or putting it together as a team right

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.640 
or putting it together as a team right
now<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.570> also<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.810> know<00:00:27.929> having<00:00:28.199> germanium

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
now and also you know having germanium

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.679 
now and also you know having germanium
is<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> big<00:00:29.009> lift<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:30.029> our<00:00:30.119> confidence<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
is a big lift to to our confidence and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.380 
is a big lift to to our confidence and
that's<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.199> boost<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> team<00:00:32.240> but<00:00:33.240> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that's the boost of the team but you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.490 
that's the boost of the team but you
know<00:00:33.450> everyone's<00:00:33.780> playing<00:00:33.960> well<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.380> we're

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
know everyone's playing well that we're

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.869 
know everyone's playing well that we're
defending<00:00:34.920> hard<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:35.610> that's

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
defending hard and I think that's

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.549 
defending hard and I think that's
creating<00:00:36.480> chances<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> offensive<00:00:37.500> side

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
creating chances on the offensive side

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.830 
creating chances on the offensive side
yeah<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.670> personally<00:00:39.210> how<00:00:39.329> much<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.719> does

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
yeah for you personally how much it does

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.869 
yeah for you personally how much it does
that<00:00:40.020> defensive<00:00:40.590> pressure<00:00:40.949> gonna<00:00:41.550> lead<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that defensive pressure gonna lead to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
that defensive pressure gonna lead to
some<00:00:42.539> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> attacking<00:00:42.960> chances<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> mean

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
some of the attacking chances you mean

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.660 
some of the attacking chances you mean
okay<00:00:43.829> because<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.070> gives<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> bit<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.489> space

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
okay because it gives you a bit of space

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.139 
okay because it gives you a bit of space
