00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
seeming light it hits a little lower

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.180 
seeming light it hits a little lower
price<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.859> consider<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.100> as

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
good as while seems like while simulated

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.039 
good as while seems like while simulated
is<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.649> only<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.879> under<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.629> wild
