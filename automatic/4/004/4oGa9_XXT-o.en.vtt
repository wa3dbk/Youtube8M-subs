lifesaver for many patients but of
course<00:03:56.220> we're<00:03:56.850> always<00:03:57.000> interested<00:03:57.270> in

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
course we're always interested in

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.450 
course we're always interested in
improving<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.080> technology<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.890> there<00:03:59.340> are

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
improving the technology and there are

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.980 
improving the technology and there are
some<00:03:59.580> advances<00:04:00.150> thinking<00:04:00.540> about<00:04:00.780> replacing

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
some advances thinking about replacing

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.200 
some advances thinking about replacing
the<00:04:01.410> leads<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:02.370> systems<00:04:02.820> where<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.030> little

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
the leads so systems where a little

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.850 
the leads so systems where a little
receiver<00:04:03.690> can<00:04:03.960> be<00:04:04.050> implanted<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.680> heart

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
receiver can be implanted in the heart

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.530 
receiver can be implanted in the heart
and<00:04:05.070> an<00:04:05.490> alternating<00:04:06.090> magnetic<00:04:06.120> current

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
and an alternating magnetic current

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.810 
and an alternating magnetic current
could<00:04:07.050> be<00:04:07.140> used<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.620> turn<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.460> little

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
could be used to turn that little

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.330 
could be used to turn that little
receiver<00:04:09.150> into<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.570> peacemaker<00:04:10.190> there's<00:04:11.190> also

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
receiver into a peacemaker there's also

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.490 
receiver into a peacemaker there's also
biological<00:04:11.700> approaches<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.260> may<00:04:13.410> have

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
biological approaches so you may have

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.930 
biological approaches so you may have
heard<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.770> stem<00:04:14.010> cells<00:04:14.310> these<00:04:14.580> are<00:04:14.760> special

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
heard of stem cells these are special

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.670 
heard of stem cells these are special
cells<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.630> can<00:04:15.750> turn<00:04:15.959> into<00:04:16.020> any<00:04:16.350> kind<00:04:16.560> of

cells that can turn into any kind of
cell<00:04:16.890> on<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.100> body<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.850> there's<00:04:18.120> been

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
cell on the body and there's been

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.640 
cell on the body and there's been
interest<00:04:18.420> recently<00:04:18.780> in<00:04:19.109> looking<00:04:19.380> at<00:04:19.470> those

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
interest recently in looking at those

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.830 
interest recently in looking at those
cells<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.220> injecting<00:04:21.090> them<00:04:21.239> into<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.510> hearts

cells and injecting them into the hearts

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.659 
cells and injecting them into the hearts
and<00:04:22.020> so<00:04:22.260> far<00:04:22.440> these<00:04:22.590> are<00:04:22.710> only<00:04:22.830> animal<00:04:23.370> studies

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
and so far these are only animal studies

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.969 
and so far these are only animal studies
but<00:04:24.210> injecting<00:04:24.630> these<00:04:24.750> pacemaker<00:04:25.440> cells<00:04:25.680> into

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
but injecting these pacemaker cells into

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.590 
but injecting these pacemaker cells into
the<00:04:26.070> heart<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.669> take<00:04:26.850> over<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.120> function

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
the heart to take over the function

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.150 
the heart to take over the function
of<00:04:27.690> all<00:04:27.960> peacemaker<00:04:28.500> cells<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.920> are<00:04:28.980> no

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
of all peacemaker cells that are no

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.220 
of all peacemaker cells that are no
longer<00:04:29.370> working<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:30.600> there's<00:04:30.780> plenty<00:04:30.870> good

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
longer working so there's plenty good

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.410 
longer working so there's plenty good
news<00:04:31.410> on<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.650> horizon<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:33.240> next

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
news on the horizon and the next

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.780 
news on the horizon and the next
question<00:04:33.480> is<00:04:33.930> about<00:04:34.230> genetics<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.340> lifestyle

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
question is about genetics and lifestyle

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.300 
question is about genetics and lifestyle
and<00:04:36.060> which<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:36.540> two<00:04:36.750> can<00:04:37.170> explain<00:04:37.800> more<00:04:37.830> of

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
and which of the two can explain more of

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.490 
and which of the two can explain more of
heart<00:04:38.640> disease<00:04:38.880> well<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:40.020> answer<00:04:40.260> is<00:04:40.290> of

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
heart disease well the answer is of

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.460 
heart disease well the answer is of
course<00:04:40.530> both<00:04:41.720> genetics<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.870> lifestyle<00:04:43.290> both

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
course both genetics and lifestyle both

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.410 
course both genetics and lifestyle both
contribute<00:04:44.010> significantly<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:44.880> it's

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
contribute significantly and it's

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.580 
contribute significantly and it's
interesting<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.870> most<00:04:46.140> of<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.410> studies

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
interesting that most of the studies

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.810 
interesting that most of the studies
that<00:04:46.710> we've<00:04:46.980> looked<00:04:47.100> at<00:04:47.280> suggests<00:04:47.730> it

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
that we've looked at suggests it

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.150 
that we've looked at suggests it
probably<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.300> about<00:04:48.570> half<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.020> half<00:04:49.050> in<00:04:49.980> fact

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
probably is about half and half in fact

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.770 
probably is about half and half in fact
some<00:04:50.280> of<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.580> very<00:04:50.790> classic<00:04:51.210> studies<00:04:51.540> and

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
some of the very classic studies and

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.820 
some of the very classic studies and
these<00:04:51.900> were<00:04:52.050> ones<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.350> happened<00:04:52.740> even

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
these were ones that happened even

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.730 
these were ones that happened even
before<00:04:52.980> we<00:04:53.310> could<00:04:53.520> ever<00:04:53.670> sequence<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.210> genome

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
before we could ever sequence a genome

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.050 
before we could ever sequence a genome
happened<00:04:55.740> in<00:04:55.830> twins<00:04:56.100> as<00:04:56.730> you<00:04:56.850> might<00:04:57.000> know

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
happened in twins as you might know

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.120 
happened in twins as you might know
identical<00:04:57.780> twins<00:04:58.050> share<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.530> same<00:04:58.710> genome

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
identical twins share the same genome

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.420 
identical twins share the same genome
whereas<00:04:59.850> non-identical<00:05:00.810> chip<00:05:01.110> twins<00:05:01.440> have

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
whereas non-identical chip twins have

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.040 
whereas non-identical chip twins have
the<00:05:02.460> same<00:05:02.580> environment<00:05:03.300> but<00:05:03.570> a<00:05:03.630> completely

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
the same environment but a completely

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.350 
the same environment but a completely
different<00:05:04.350> genome<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:05.760> we<00:05:06.000> can<00:05:06.120> look<00:05:06.240> at

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
different genome and so we can look at

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.660 
different genome and so we can look at
those<00:05:06.570> two<00:05:06.810> things<00:05:06.960> together<00:05:07.170> and<00:05:07.530> see<00:05:08.340> and

those two things together and see and

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.580 
those two things together and see and
give<00:05:08.880> an<00:05:08.970> estimation<00:05:09.360> of<00:05:09.600> how<00:05:09.660> much<00:05:10.020> of<00:05:10.290> the
