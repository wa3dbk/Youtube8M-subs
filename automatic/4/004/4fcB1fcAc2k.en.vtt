life-sized a life-size look onto my
canvas<00:03:18.360> holding<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.570> out<00:03:21.480> straight<00:03:22.480> as<00:03:23.310> our

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:37.240 

measuring<00:03:27.700> measuring<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.600> widest<00:03:29.080> width

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.340 

and<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.790> says<00:03:38.090> why<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.990> base<00:03:39.770> looks<00:03:41.350> it's

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
and I says why is the base looks it's

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.610 
and I says why is the base looks it's
probably<00:03:42.770> about<00:03:42.950> as<00:03:43.310> wide<00:03:43.550> as<00:03:43.580> it<00:03:43.790> is<00:03:44.090> up<00:03:44.240> there

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
probably about as wide as it is up there

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.360 
probably about as wide as it is up there
okay<00:03:45.650> shucks

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.350 

yeah<00:03:49.370> this<00:03:49.610> is<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:50.380> little<00:03:51.380> bit<00:03:51.500> bigger

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
yeah this is a little bit bigger

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.400 
yeah this is a little bit bigger
it's<00:03:53.360> almost<00:03:53.510> life<00:03:54.050> starts

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.770 

which<00:03:59.980> is<00:04:00.160> okay<00:04:00.490> little<00:04:01.330> bit<00:04:01.420> bigger<00:04:01.630> than

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
which is okay little bit bigger than

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:12.930 
which is okay little bit bigger than
life-size<00:04:01.960> is<00:04:02.410> okay<00:04:09.960> let's<00:04:10.960> check<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.940> width

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
life-size is okay let's check the width

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.330 
life-size is okay let's check the width
of<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.270> hole<00:04:13.540> still<00:04:13.990> one<00:04:17.310> candle

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
of the hole still one candle

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:27.230 
of the hole still one candle
edge-to-edge

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.660 

followers<00:04:28.169> chatter<00:04:28.889> words

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:46.830 

I'm<00:04:33.150> closing<00:04:33.450> one<00:04:33.840> eyes<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.350> doing<00:04:34.620> this

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.870 

I've<00:04:47.260> got<00:04:47.440> some<00:04:47.650> border<00:04:48.100> on<00:04:50.370> like<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.669> but<00:04:51.850> I

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
I've got some border on like that but I

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.620 
I've got some border on like that but I
think<00:04:51.970> it'll<00:04:52.360> work<00:04:53.790> maybe<00:04:54.790> if<00:04:55.030> I<00:04:55.180> move<00:04:55.389> the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
think it'll work maybe if I move the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:08.270 
think it'll work maybe if I move the
bottle<00:04:56.169> on<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.380> little<00:04:56.650> bit<00:04:56.830> more

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.100 

the<00:05:09.280> existence<00:05:09.880> space<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:10.570> I'd<00:05:10.720> like<00:05:10.900> that

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
the existence space so I'd like that

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.969 
the existence space so I'd like that
have<00:05:11.500> some<00:05:11.740> board<00:05:12.010> more<00:05:12.340> border<00:05:12.760> than<00:05:12.910> that

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
have some board more border than that

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.810 
have some board more border than that
check<00:05:14.979> this<00:05:15.190> again<00:05:20.220> make<00:05:21.220> sure<00:05:21.460> I'm<00:05:21.639> on<00:05:21.760> the

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
check this again make sure I'm on the

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:36.780 
check this again make sure I'm on the
right<00:05:22.090> spots

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.390 

take<00:05:37.420> my<00:05:37.570> time<00:05:37.780> get<00:05:38.170> it<00:05:38.260> right<00:05:38.440> this<00:05:39.100> is<00:05:39.310> the

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
take my time get it right this is the

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.060 
take my time get it right this is the
most<00:05:39.580> important<00:05:40.150> part<00:05:40.420> and<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:41.710> painting

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
most important part and the painting

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.040 
most important part and the painting
process<00:05:42.220> is<00:05:42.820> getting<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.390> correct

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
process is getting the correct

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.180 
process is getting the correct
proportions<00:05:44.980> and<00:05:45.130> drawing<00:05:45.520> on<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:45.880> canvas

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
proportions and drawing on the canvas

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.860 
proportions and drawing on the canvas
otherwise<00:05:48.190> it<00:05:48.460> just<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:49.120> know<00:05:50.850> the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
otherwise it just you know the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.210 
otherwise it just you know the
representational<00:05:52.870> realistic<00:05:53.500> style<00:05:53.710> it's

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
representational realistic style it's

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.950 
representational realistic style it's
not<00:05:54.400> going<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:54.640> work<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:58.300> viewing<00:05:58.780> distance

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
not going to work the viewing distance

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.470 
not going to work the viewing distance
this<00:05:59.560> is<00:05:59.620> what<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.950> viewer<00:06:00.250> sees<00:06:00.610> is<00:06:01.420> what

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
this is what the viewer sees is what

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.120 
this is what the viewer sees is what
exactly<00:06:01.990> what<00:06:02.320> I'm<00:06:02.440> trying<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.830> get<00:06:02.980> on<00:06:03.100> the

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
exactly what I'm trying to get on the

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:12.730 
exactly what I'm trying to get on the
changes<00:06:06.630> that's<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.990> distance<00:06:10.260> okay

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
changes that's the distance okay

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.070 
changes that's the distance okay
so<00:06:13.280> what<00:06:13.460> I'm<00:06:13.550> going<00:06:13.670> to<00:06:13.760> use<00:06:14.330> is<00:06:16.600> this<00:06:17.600> China

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
so what I'm going to use is this China

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.210 
so what I'm going to use is this China
marker<00:06:18.710> white<00:06:21.670> and<00:06:23.320> eyeball<00:06:24.320> it's<00:06:24.560> a<00:06:24.770> hot<00:06:25.010> spot

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
marker white and eyeball it's a hot spot

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:34.030 
marker white and eyeball it's a hot spot
stores<00:06:25.730> that<00:06:26.060> over<00:06:26.540> here<00:06:29.920> walk<00:06:30.920> there<00:06:33.040> I'll

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
stores that over here walk there I'll

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.950 
stores that over here walk there I'll
put<00:06:34.250> them<00:06:34.310> up<00:06:34.490> here<00:06:36.910> so<00:06:37.910> this<00:06:38.090> is<00:06:38.300> why<00:06:38.570> is<00:06:38.630> my

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
put them up here so this is why is my

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.180 
put them up here so this is why is my
still<00:06:39.260> life<00:06:39.290> will<00:06:39.710> be<00:06:39.910> it'll<00:06:40.910> be<00:06:41.000> that<00:06:41.270> one<00:06:42.190> so

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
still life will be it'll be that one so

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.770 
still life will be it'll be that one so
I<00:06:43.250> got<00:06:43.490> this<00:06:43.730> border<00:06:45.580> now<00:06:46.580> how<00:06:47.000> high<00:06:47.240> do<00:06:47.300> I<00:06:47.480> want

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
I got this border now how high do I want

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.080 
I got this border now how high do I want
to<00:06:47.990> be<00:06:48.700> well<00:06:49.700> I<00:06:49.730> want<00:06:50.030> to<00:06:50.120> show<00:06:50.270> some<00:06:50.510> table

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
to be well I want to show some table

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.660 
to be well I want to show some table
possibly<00:06:53.090> the<00:06:53.210> cloth<00:06:54.070> going<00:06:55.070> over<00:06:55.370> to<00:06:55.460> cable

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
possibly the cloth going over to cable

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.060 
possibly the cloth going over to cable
so<00:06:58.670> I<00:06:58.730> want<00:06:59.180> to<00:06:59.240> leave<00:06:59.390> a<00:06:59.420> little<00:06:59.690> bit<00:06:59.900> of<00:07:00.070> the

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
so I want to leave a little bit of the

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.860 
so I want to leave a little bit of the
cloth<00:07:01.400> here<00:07:01.730> to<00:07:01.850> hang<00:07:02.060> over<00:07:02.210> the<00:07:02.390> table<00:07:02.690> so<00:07:02.780> I'm

thinking<00:07:04.090> this<00:07:05.090> is<00:07:05.360> will<00:07:05.540> be<00:07:05.780> the<00:07:05.960> edge<00:07:06.340> of<00:07:07.340> my

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:07.730 
thinking this is will be the edge of my

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.320 
thinking this is will be the edge of my
table<00:07:08.200> right<00:07:09.200> there<00:07:09.730> so<00:07:10.730> I<00:07:10.790> can<00:07:10.940> show<00:07:11.120> some

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
table right there so I can show some

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.440 
table right there so I can show some
cloth<00:07:12.320> flowing<00:07:13.130> over<00:07:13.310> the<00:07:13.490> table<00:07:14.000> down<00:07:14.150> there

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
cloth flowing over the table down there

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.450 
cloth flowing over the table down there
I<00:07:16.300> don't<00:07:17.300> you<00:07:17.450> can<00:07:17.570> see<00:07:17.750> that<00:07:17.930> part<00:07:18.110> or<00:07:18.320> not<00:07:18.460> one
