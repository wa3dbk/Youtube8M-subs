00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.220
 to keep people from drifting 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.220

 curiosity still further questions 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.770
 what are the Templars really looking for? 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.400
 order 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.140
 in the direction 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.670
 not more than that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.320
 you are all with this feeling 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.570
 of confusion 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.280
 from one time 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.610
 the assassins pursued a nobler one 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.970
 aim 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.390
 namely the peace 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.730
 Freedom is peace she is 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 call for chaos 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.600
 Just look at this revolution 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.490
 Your friends started I once stood 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.100
 before the continental congress and listened 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.450
 you stamp and shout everything in the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.090
 Names of freedom 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.400
 but it's just noise and that's why 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.930
 favors story understands the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.430
 needs of this would like nation 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.210

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.210
 to represent them 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.190

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.560
 milk drunk 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.350

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.060
 the washington will not have the people 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.470
 chosen 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.390
 It was a group of privileged people 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.340
 cowards who tried to enrich themselves 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.150

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.680
 decision that fit him they have it 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.220
 in nice words packed yet 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.110
 is it was not the difference dollar 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.550
 the only difference between me and 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.570

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.880

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:29.309
 Forest fires
