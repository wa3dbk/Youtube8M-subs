00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
thought I'd give you all a hardware look

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.440 
thought I'd give you all a hardware look
at<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.560> iphone<00:00:05.009> 5<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.370> show<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.150> guys<00:00:06.210> some

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
at the iphone 5 and show you guys some

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.490

of<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.569> new<00:00:06.629> features<00:00:06.660> some<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.259> hardware

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
of the new features some of the hardware

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.560 
of the new features some of the hardware
changes<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.189> basically<00:00:08.820> an<00:00:09.210> in-depth<00:00:09.510> look

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
changes and basically an in-depth look

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.089 
changes and basically an in-depth look
at<00:00:09.809> what<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.320> looks<00:00:10.469> like<00:00:10.590> from<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.070> outside

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
at what it looks like from the outside

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.030 
at what it looks like from the outside
so<00:00:11.790> right<00:00:12.570> off<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> bat<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.230> screen<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.799> does

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
so right off the bat the screen it does

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.770 
so right off the bat the screen it does
not<00:00:14.190> look<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.700> much<00:00:15.089> bigger<00:00:15.269> through<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
not look that much bigger through the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.970 
not look that much bigger through the
lens<00:00:15.960> through<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> camera<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.740> YouTube

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
lens through the camera on this YouTube

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.189 
lens through the camera on this YouTube
video<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:17.520> when<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.150> actually<00:00:18.390> hold<00:00:19.080> it

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
video but when you actually hold it

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.109 
video but when you actually hold it
side-by-side<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.890> your<00:00:20.160> hand<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> iphone

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
side-by-side in your hand to the iphone

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.870 
side-by-side in your hand to the iphone
for<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> 4s<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.529> quite<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.980> change<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
for the 4s it is quite a change the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.670 
for the 4s it is quite a change the
screen<00:00:24.060> itself<00:00:24.240> does<00:00:24.600> look<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> lot<00:00:25.170> better<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
screen itself does look a lot better I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.250 
screen itself does look a lot better I
think<00:00:26.010> colors<00:00:26.760> are<00:00:26.939> more<00:00:27.240> vibrant<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:28.080> look

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
think colors are more vibrant they look

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.529 
think colors are more vibrant they look
more<00:00:28.650> bold<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.910> looks<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> lot<00:00:30.359> better

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
more bold and it just looks a lot better

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.749 
more bold and it just looks a lot better
so<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.289> interesting<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.279> i<00:00:32.610> said

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
so we interesting to see like i said

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.360 
so we interesting to see like i said
side-by-side<00:00:33.390> comparison<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.890> colors

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
side-by-side comparison of the colors

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.100 
side-by-side comparison of the colors
the<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> maybe<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> movie<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.960> video

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the like a maybe a movie or video

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.720 
the like a maybe a movie or video
side-by-side<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.129> how<00:00:38.219> much<00:00:38.370> better<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
side-by-side just see how much better it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.310 
side-by-side just see how much better it
does<00:00:38.850> look<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.239> my<00:00:39.660> opinion<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.200> from

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
does look but my opinion just from

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.869 
does look but my opinion just from
looking<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.890> does<00:00:41.010> look<00:00:41.250> quite<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.700> bit

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
looking at it it does look quite a bit

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
looking at it it does look quite a bit
better<00:00:42.000> quite<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> bit<00:00:42.719> better<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.829> top

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
better quite a bit better on the top

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.709 
better quite a bit better on the top
here<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.570> change

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
here we do have a little bit of a change

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660 
here we do have a little bit of a change
with<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> camera<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> middle<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
with the camera in the middle but on the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
with the camera in the middle but on the
top<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.120> nothing<00:00:48.450> much<00:00:48.629> different<00:00:49.320> just

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
top really nothing much different just

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.410 
top really nothing much different just
has<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.920> ear<00:00:50.760> piece<00:00:50.910> right<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.180> your

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
has the ear piece right there your

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420 
has the ear piece right there your
camera<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> middle<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> nothing<00:00:52.860> else<00:00:53.010> on

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
camera in the middle and nothing else on

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
camera in the middle and nothing else on
the<00:00:53.640> bottom<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> same<00:00:54.420> old<00:00:54.629> home<00:00:54.870> button

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the bottom just the same old home button

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.630 
the bottom just the same old home button
but<00:00:55.350> down<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> new

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
but down here we do see the new

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
but down here we do see the new
lightning<00:00:57.059> connector<00:00:57.629> I'm<00:00:57.989> actually<00:00:58.289> really

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
lightning connector I'm actually really

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.170 
lightning connector I'm actually really
surprised<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.520> how<00:00:59.609> small<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
surprised at just how small the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.020 
surprised at just how small the
connector<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.219> it<00:01:02.219> doesn't<00:01:02.520> look<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.760> much

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
connector is it doesn't look that much

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.170 
connector is it doesn't look that much
smaller<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.899> video<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.559> does<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
smaller in the video but it does it is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.820 
smaller in the video but it does it is
quite<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> bit<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> change<00:01:07.439> definitely

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
quite a bit of a change definitely

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.200 
quite a bit of a change definitely
something<00:01:08.280> we're<00:01:08.369> not<00:01:08.520> used<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.760> seeing<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
something we're not used to seeing and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
something we're not used to seeing and
compared<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> 30<00:01:10.530> pin<00:01:10.830> connector<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
compared to the 30 pin connector this is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.660 
compared to the 30 pin connector this is
just<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.200> microscopic<00:01:13.200> two<00:01:14.100> speakers<00:01:14.430> down

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
just it is microscopic two speakers down

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.980 
just it is microscopic two speakers down
here<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> bottom<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.450> well<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.960> a

here at the bottom as well as a
headphone<00:01:16.470> jack<00:01:16.710> which<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.070> moved<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
headphone jack which was moved to the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.120 
headphone jack which was moved to the
bottom<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> top<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
bottom on the top here we just have the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
bottom on the top here we just have the
sleep/wake<00:01:20.490> button<00:01:20.520> same<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.119> always<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
left side we have volume up and down and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.539 
left side we have volume up and down and
the<00:01:24.750> silent<00:01:25.140> ringer<00:01:25.350> switch<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.890> does

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the silent ringer switch and it does

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.039 
the silent ringer switch and it does
look<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.060> did<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> same<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
look like they did the same with the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
look like they did the same with the
antennas<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.770> around<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> edge<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
antennas here around the edge of the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.770 
antennas here around the edge of the
phone<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.090> interesting<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.509> see<00:01:30.600> if

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
phone will be interesting to see if

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.440 
phone will be interesting to see if
there's<00:01:31.170> any<00:01:31.369> signal<00:01:32.369> issue<00:01:32.520> with<00:01:33.030> antennas

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
there's any signal issue with antennas

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
there's any signal issue with antennas
being<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> edge<00:01:33.900> still<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.310> be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
being on the edge still but that will be

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.980 
being on the edge still but that will be
something<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.150> sure<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.659> tested

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
something that I'm sure will be tested

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.020 
something that I'm sure will be tested
quite<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.000> have

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
quite a bit and right here we do have

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.929 
quite a bit and right here we do have
the<00:01:39.420> sim<00:01:39.720> tray<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.290> once<00:01:41.100> again<00:01:41.220> looks<00:01:41.790> like

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the sim tray and once again looks like

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.810 
the sim tray and once again looks like
more<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.840> antennas<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> back<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.130> we

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
more of the antennas on the back here we

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.630 
more of the antennas on the back here we
do<00:01:44.939> see<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> new<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> matte<00:01:46.740> finish<00:01:47.130> with

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
do see the new kind of matte finish with

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.370 
do see the new kind of matte finish with
the<00:01:47.820> shiny<00:01:48.149> Apple<00:01:48.509> logo<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.960> glass<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the shiny Apple logo the glass on the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410 
the shiny Apple logo the glass on the
top<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.130> bottom<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.640> thing<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> noticed

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
top and the bottom one thing I noticed

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.639 
top and the bottom one thing I noticed
right<00:01:51.630> off<00:01:51.750> about<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.079> guys<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.350> probably

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
right off about you guys can probably

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.380 
right off about you guys can probably
tell<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> video<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> back<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.790> very

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
tell on the video but the back is very

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.870 
tell on the video but the back is very
susceptible<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.439> fingerprints<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.759> kind

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
susceptible to fingerprints I just kind

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.130 
susceptible to fingerprints I just kind
of<00:01:56.969> noticed<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.360> playing<00:01:57.719> around<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
of noticed that playing around with it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.410 
of noticed that playing around with it
for<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.320> few<00:01:58.439> minutes<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.520> very<00:01:59.759> smudgy

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
for a few minutes here it's very smudgy

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.780 
for a few minutes here it's very smudgy
as<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.810> very<00:02:01.079> susceptible<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.159> fingerprints<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
as a very susceptible to fingerprints so

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.830 
as a very susceptible to fingerprints so
it's<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.329> thing<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> keep<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.780> mind

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it's one thing to keep in mind

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.090 
it's one thing to keep in mind
definitely<00:02:04.350> gonna<00:02:04.439> get<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> case<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:04.979> this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
definitely gonna get a case for this

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.230 
definitely gonna get a case for this
because<00:02:05.189> i<00:02:05.310> don't<00:02:05.430> want<00:02:05.460> fingerprints<00:02:06.000> all

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
because i don't want fingerprints all

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
because i don't want fingerprints all
over<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.469> little<00:02:07.890> disappointed<00:02:08.340> but

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
over this but a little disappointed but

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.999 
over this but a little disappointed but
it<00:02:08.520> does<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:09.780> nice<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.319> far<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:10.800> just

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it does look really nice as far as just

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.309 
it does look really nice as far as just
visually<00:02:11.430> without<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> finger

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
visually without the finger

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.039 
visually without the finger
at<00:02:12.499> least<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.920> said<00:02:13.670> bottom<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.359> top<00:02:14.569> are<00:02:14.840> our

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
at least I said bottom and top are our

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.129 
at least I said bottom and top are our
still<00:02:15.290> big<00:02:15.409> glass<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.790> camera<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.299> still

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.139 
still big glass and the camera is still

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.720 
still big glass and the camera is still
in<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.379> same<00:02:18.499> place<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.950> looks<00:02:19.069> relatively

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
in the same place it looks relatively

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.520 
in the same place it looks relatively
similar<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.450> what<00:02:20.599> it<00:02:20.689> was<00:02:20.780> on<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.989> iPhone<00:02:21.260> 4

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
similar to what it was on the iPhone 4

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.860 
similar to what it was on the iPhone 4
and<00:02:21.560> 4s<00:02:21.739> on<00:02:22.249> the<00:02:22.700> sapphire<00:02:23.060> lens<00:02:23.389> cover<00:02:23.689> it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
and 4s on the sapphire lens cover it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.059 
and 4s on the sapphire lens cover it
does<00:02:23.989> look<00:02:24.109> like<00:02:24.230> they<00:02:24.439> made<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> bit<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:24.950> a

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
does look like they made a bit of a

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.789 
does look like they made a bit of a
change<00:02:25.310> as<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:26.060> how<00:02:26.780> they<00:02:26.989> how<00:02:27.349> they<00:02:27.379> covered

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
change as to how they how they covered

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.199 
change as to how they how they covered
it<00:02:27.889> how<00:02:28.069> they<00:02:28.189> protected<00:02:28.639> the<00:02:28.670> camera<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.150> I

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
it how they protected the camera and I

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.910 
it how they protected the camera and I
think<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.959> would<00:02:30.049> be<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> lot<00:02:30.500> better<00:02:30.560> it

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
think that it would be a lot better it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.309 
think that it would be a lot better it
does<00:02:31.069> look<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.459> little<00:02:32.269> bit<00:02:32.569> different<00:02:32.959> but<00:02:33.109> so

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
does look a little bit different but so

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.259 
does look a little bit different but so
I<00:02:33.349> think<00:02:33.439> you<00:02:33.620> can<00:02:33.799> tell<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.670> difference<00:02:34.849> and

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
I think you can tell the difference and

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.449 
I think you can tell the difference and
see<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.079> change<00:02:36.319> there<00:02:36.590> I'm<00:02:37.129> just<00:02:37.280> got<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
see the change there I'm just got the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.830 
see the change there I'm just got the
flash<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.969> looks<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.239> another<00:02:38.359> microphone

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
flash it looks like another microphone

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.809 
flash it looks like another microphone
up<00:02:39.200> top<00:02:39.469> there<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:39.919> then<00:02:40.340> toward<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:40.639> bottom

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
up top there and then toward the bottom

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.209 
up top there and then toward the bottom
just<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.749> iphone<00:02:42.109> information<00:02:42.739> stuff<00:02:43.069> like

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
just the iphone information stuff like

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.699 
just the iphone information stuff like
that<00:02:43.249> and<00:02:43.519> then<00:02:43.999> we're<00:02:44.150> back<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:45.230> port

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
that and then we're back to the port

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.280 
that and then we're back to the port
there<00:02:45.859> so<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:47.150> far<00:02:47.419> as<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.780> iPhone<00:02:48.049> 5<00:02:48.260> is

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
there so as far as the iPhone 5 is

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.369 
there so as far as the iPhone 5 is
concerned<00:02:48.829> it<00:02:48.980> does<00:02:49.129> feel<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.790> lot<00:02:50.569> thinner<00:02:50.900> and

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
concerned it does feel a lot thinner and

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.679 
concerned it does feel a lot thinner and
a<00:02:51.439> lot<00:02:51.620> lighter<00:02:51.889> in<00:02:52.159> your<00:02:52.189> hand<00:02:52.689> it's

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
a lot lighter in your hand it's

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.149 
a lot lighter in your hand it's
definitely<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.199> bit<00:02:54.349> thinner<00:02:54.530> than<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.829> iphone

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
definitely a bit thinner than the iphone

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.220 
definitely a bit thinner than the iphone
4s<00:02:55.639> I<00:02:55.879> will<00:02:56.180> have<00:02:56.329> a<00:02:56.359> side-by-side<00:02:56.900> comparison

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
4s I will have a side-by-side comparison
