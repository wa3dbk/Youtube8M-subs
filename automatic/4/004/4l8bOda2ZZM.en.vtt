away from the rear wheel that gives us

we<00:02:49.980> also<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.460> incorporate<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> little<00:02:51.180> bit

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
we also have incorporate a little bit

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.449 
we also have incorporate a little bit
from<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> f1<00:02:52.350> technology

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
from the f1 technology

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.149 
from the f1 technology
and<00:02:53.849> that<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.689> we<00:02:54.810> have<00:02:55.049> a<00:02:55.379> third<00:02:55.890> brake

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
and that is that we have a third brake

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.559 
and that is that we have a third brake
light<00:02:56.189> it's<00:02:56.670> actually<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.120> we<00:02:57.209> call<00:02:57.239> our

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.599 
light it's actually what we call our
rain<00:02:57.780> light<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.620> when<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.890> actually<00:02:59.219> step<00:02:59.430> on

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609

the brakes you actually see another

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.610 
the brakes you actually see another
central<00:03:02.640> brake<00:03:03.209> light<00:03:03.450> which<00:03:04.109> gives<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
central brake light which gives it a

been able to change the engine this is

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.529 
been able to change the engine this is
the<00:04:35.680> more
