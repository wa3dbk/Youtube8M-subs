 hello to complete the text I wrote on the gum dichromate 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.240
 and which is on my site 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.189
 here are the different steps 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.189
 the construction of a hull 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.710
 gold it is better to arrange a dotted place they will be stored 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 especially chemicals the paper the necessary material 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 on the other hand it needs appropriate material 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.259
 firstly a balance 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.630
 pigments 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.669
 sparrow purses 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.940
 gum arabic 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.180
 when you have previously melted ice cubes in water 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.000
 and still potassium 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 sellotape 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.150
 paper 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.030
 and paper that has been previously disabled the lifting 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 in the physio forming the v 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.750
 and finally 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.700
 hunters 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.540
 a chassis with a levi-strauss board the chassis manufactures and 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.960
 with the register trial a clipboard 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.490
 p the negative 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.490
 of course we will have manufactured before 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.980
 after spotting the necessary dosages in greece 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.290
 know Latin 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.560
 he will be in France next 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.610
 immersed that's how we do about two hours Friday 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.400
 Benjamin who is then immersed in a bath Marie 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.710
 it will be worn 35 degrees maximum 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 and then he can only be title 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.050
 gelatin and pour into a metal tray in this case a tray from 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.080
 signed 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.920
 it is kept at temperature 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 the chart's share 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.890
 once immersed, we almost left for seven minutes in the gelatin 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.910
 here is recovering 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.560
 avoid the formation of bubbles on the surface of the paper then the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.610
 paper is put to dry
