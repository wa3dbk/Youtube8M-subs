00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 long before the gravel greets you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.240
 your up and today I bring you a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.360
 testing gameplay the big question is 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.710
 someone else plays steam and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.240
 streaming 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.430
 from minimums in this 2015 in this month 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.260
 May someone else plays forward 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.480
 of destiny and a good question by 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.869
 encourage the previous video and just 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.420
 spoke of kojima and all that and before that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.609
 nothing is a topic part good comments 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.279
 I love people when they comment well 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.380
 I hope to do this kind of videos 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 because sometimes I like to talk and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.000
 comment on the tm all the roll but 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.860
 selling the most interesting thing is the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.290
 comments 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.910
 Now we continue with the good as already 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.469
 know after the scores of many 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.870
 game websites over which no sting and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.989
 it went very well you can say ladies 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.750
 that you steam and it was not the game that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.690
 many we expected but so you have to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.470
 admit that destine insist so many 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.260
 good things 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.680
 for example gameplay look is very 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.020
 good 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.630
 play is not good the graphics are 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.490
 fantastic the luing system is very 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.840
 interesting in the subject of the last but 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.160
 you also have to admit that the system 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.760
 of combat 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.380
 sometimes it gets boring after a 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.320
 long time 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.740
 20 hours 30 hours out there in the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.930
 true for lack of very history if people 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.270
 has no history mode is like the titan 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.399
 folk do not just play multiplayer 10 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.770
 says your story but has no way 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.380
 history because the lack of very history 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.360
 no people clarified no love story 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.460
 by sight like this has a story no no 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.929
 they say it is that they see you do not have it but 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.670
 well he's always saying if he does not have 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.880
 that titan was neither has history 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.799
 you only play multiplayer and 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.959
 ok I say just 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.369
 the game becomes empty without history or 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.849
 it's like it's good for you this is 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.899
 a game with multiplayer and already the people 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.060
 we are now a time where everything 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.909
 our life modem or story now all 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.770
 It is multiplayer but we already know that it has 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.750
 that go a story mode for those 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.310
 that we like to play in that part for 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.739
 example I'm good for the people of 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.420
 bungee talk about the subject of very 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.099
 story that will play very empty and said what 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.079
 next you can play for more than 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.329
 20 hours you will see the difference in the 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:24.230
 game but we all know what a difference 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:27.409
 It will never mean anything good 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.810
 Sting and the game is not much fun 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.819
 they perform the same missions one and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.489
 again and have seen it streaming 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.290
 but the only reward after 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.860
 do these missions is that your character 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.650
 get good equipment 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.250
 good weapons armor artifacts 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.420
 level status 19 is the power but the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.730
 problem are the missions are 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.830
 repetitive to the game that do the same 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.140
 what destination but the difference is that 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.840
 they are more fun as the case that 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.730
 gentlemen for roland teasing does almost what 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.680
 same as destination or detainees and the same 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.870
 that teasing but borderlands is more 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.000
 fun they give you a huge variety of 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.160
 weapons as well as destiny but the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.160
 missions are not so repetitive do not you 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.490
 they say one thing or another the truth is not 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.590
 feel offended I'm not saying that 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.960
 that you embroider better or better only 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.880
 compared the mission system if there 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.120
 more fun in borderlands ok 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.260
 clarifying alive in case it stops its 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.760
 game that is still in progress 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.780
 boys and I'm sure this is going 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.970
 to improve more and more and more 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.350
 even the second expansion is coming 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.060
 called house of war 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.190
 is very good and the trailer the halo 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.490
 world this expansion will have many 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.990
 missions like history the same as if 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.810
 just be multiplayer and if not 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.640
 qatar samples of this speaks again 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.990
 game mode there may be one that is 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.640
 call the sand in which you enter 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.920
 some players think kill several 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.170
 bikers is very good and good there 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.300
 apart from new weapons object be all 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.870
 new more information you can see it in 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.590
 the bungee page ok good one thing 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.500
 also curious is that destiny raised 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.870
 500 million dollars on his first day 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.900
 of launch and that showed the super 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.790
 high that I had but in the end many of us 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.420
 we disappointed the game after 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.420
 some hours 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.840
 I could say that destiny is a good 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.609
 game but it's not the big game that I play 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.430
 I really expected and expected something a lot 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.660
 bigger I'm sure they go and we're going 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.790
 to surprise more with the following 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.130
 expansion I'm sure I 'd like 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.750
 say that destination is one of the best 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.400
 game of this new generation of 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.440
 consoles 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.270
 good console not only to play 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.100
 4 who knows suddenly I do not believe but 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.780
 well I hope it is second expansion 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.280
 to a good job and keep attracting more 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.820
 players or the conclusion the video 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.800
 is that this can improve in many 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.110
 things still the game is still in development 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.280
 the people of Albania say for sure that what 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.590
 of vanquish know 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.660
 he knows that they did not do very well and they have 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:09.320
 put a lot of desire to the expansion 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.320
 house of world to bring more players 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.710
 I hope this brings more players 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.499
 I want to play sting and that is not the 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.240
 same mission and please do not have 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.639
 environmental or something similar does not 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.610
 let's say kill the giant monster that 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:29.330
 is in the area of Eastern Europe clock 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.849
 or kill him now kill him and this is going to be 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.229
 a meat is needed from the cave and it's 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.360
 something similar to the giant mallet has 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.729
 put has to vary has to vary 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.409
 and I hope that you destine make a good 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.449
 work I'm sure it's going to 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.400
 perform I'm completely sure but 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.889
 good to see to believe 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.870
 good people I say goodbye I was educational 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.240
 I hope you liked a little 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.129
 short video is even a question in 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.740
 twitter saying is rinse destiny and 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:57.139
 many people when a lot of me 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.129
 they said how good if I play it sometimes 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:03.319
 that I do not play it that much and that's why 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.060
 than this video - so I hope that you 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.100
 I liked it 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.810
 live favorites had enough to 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.100
 make videos also because there is not the 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.040
 no truth up new campaigns 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.970
 there is not and I like to read your comment 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.070
 quite inclusive 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.220
 here I ask myself in the previous video if 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.530
 kojima if I apologize if this guide 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.030
 belonged to kojima and konami and the 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.550
 Answer is for feared that wants 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.310
 answer and the answer to the next 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.990
 konami owns the metal gear series 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.080
 that hideo kojima is the person who 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.660
 directed design produced all the roll 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.669
 but he does not own the metal series 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.950
 gear he helps in a lot let's say in 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:46.070
 80% but the brand the series is from your mom 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.570
 I'm saying goodbye to him, so I say goodbye 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.490
 people end ducsa I hope you have them 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.500

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.090
 about bungee want to see good me 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.000
 they gave in the expansion of house the 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.410
 world I did not remember long ago 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.580
 If you want me to show it, comment it there 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:03.410

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.409
 until next time and the question and 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.479
 Answer you play destiny 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:12.129
 and also responds that what you expect from 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.830

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:17.409
