00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.210
 and overload 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.059
 and the excessive speed in a curve 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.039
 were the main causes of 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.320
 accident registered at kilometer 18 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.260
 and half of the road to the port 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.800
 of freedom whose driver was alive 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.800
 of miracle 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.029
 the worst of this case is that in all the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.039
 section was spilled a chemical called 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.900
 strina or the one that makes the detergent 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.410
 that caused the road to be 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.870
 Slippery is a totally material 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.519
 totally sliding which then in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.620
 any time can cause another 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.900
 accident send the drivers that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
 the fact that it is a road, 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.059
 means what will they come from to excessive 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 speed is observed that the excess 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.629
 speed the load the inexperience and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.730
 many factors because this one started 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.440
 to what was the action the traffic in the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.440
 zone was paralyzed by lapses 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.689
 while two cranes towed the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.689
 truck 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.910
 For its part, the traffic police made 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.950
 a call to charge drivers 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.740
 heavy to respect the speed limit 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.730
 this road there are stretches where it is 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.890
 restricted the speed this I think that 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.400
 in this section it is 60 kilometers away 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.490
 time a heavy vehicle at speed 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.920
 maximum of 60 kilometers per hour but in 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.380
 open road always to have the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.630
 due precautions of the different 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.410
 roads respect the limits of the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.410
 of speed and so that your vehicle is 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.180
 in good condition always the police of 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.850
 continuous traffic regulating traffic 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.040
 vehicular here at kilometer 18 and a half 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.900
 while fire departments removed the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.610
 slippery material in order to 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.830
 avoid more accidents on the road
