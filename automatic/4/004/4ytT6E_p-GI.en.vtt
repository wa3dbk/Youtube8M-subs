00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.650 

the<00:00:13.650> other<00:00:13.799> prism<00:00:14.160> very<00:00:14.370> good<00:00:14.670> again<00:00:15.420> what's

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
the other prism very good again what's

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.230 
the other prism very good again what's
unique<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.410> triangular<00:00:17.039> prism<00:00:19.160> is

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
unique about this triangular prism is

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.429 
unique about this triangular prism is
that<00:00:21.240> unique<00:00:21.420> because<00:00:21.630> they've<00:00:22.170> done<00:00:22.350> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
that unique because they've done it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.359 
that unique because they've done it
twice<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:24.140> they<00:00:25.140> give<00:00:25.350> us<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.650> area<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.250> we

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
twice now they give us the area so we

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.730 
twice now they give us the area so we
don't<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.849> use<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.930> area<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> triangle

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
don't have to use the area of a triangle

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.170 
don't have to use the area of a triangle
will<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.429> later<00:00:30.109> number<00:00:31.109> two<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:32.340> V

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
will use that later number two we have V

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.959 
will use that later number two we have V
equals<00:00:33.750> again<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.320> our<00:00:34.350> formula<00:00:34.980> V<00:00:35.190> equals<00:00:35.610> big

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
equals again on our formula V equals big

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:45.950 
equals again on our formula V equals big
V<00:00:36.440> times<00:00:37.440> H<00:00:37.890> big<00:00:38.280> V<00:00:38.489> stands<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:44.570> area<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
V times H big V stands for area of a is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.090 
V times H big V stands for area of a is
not<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> base<00:00:46.770> ok<00:00:47.280> oh<00:00:48.079> well<00:00:49.079> there's<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
not just the base ok oh well there's the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.939 
not just the base ok oh well there's the
area<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.059> base<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.590> H<00:00:52.590> stands<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:54.949> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
area of the base and H stands for the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.590 
area of the base and H stands for the
height<00:00:57.949> because<00:00:58.949> Big<00:00:59.309> D<00:00:59.579> stands<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.239> area

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
height because Big D stands for the area

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.150 
height because Big D stands for the area
the<00:01:00.719> base<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.140> already<00:01:01.379> give<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> us<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the base they already give it to us so

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.080 
the base they already give it to us so
we<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.430> fill<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.940> our<00:01:03.030> formula<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.719> B<00:01:06.860> equals

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
we can fill in our formula as B equals

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.340 
we can fill in our formula as B equals
open<00:01:09.090> parenthesis<00:01:09.860> 20<00:01:10.860> close<00:01:11.549> parentheses<00:01:12.350> x

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
open parenthesis 20 close parentheses x

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:22.070 
open parenthesis 20 close parentheses x
the<00:01:14.189> height<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:15.030> 4<00:01:20.509> again<00:01:21.509> here's<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the height of 4 again here's one of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.320 
the height of 4 again here's one of
those<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.700> are<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.060> M<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.210> in

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
those we are you on our M so we do in

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.399 
those we are you on our M so we do in
our<00:01:27.479> head<00:01:28.070> sometimes<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.810> porous<00:01:30.810> defense

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
our head sometimes for is porous defense

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.670 
our head sometimes for is porous defense
or<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:34.159> attaches<00:01:35.159> 0<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:36.320> cable<00:01:37.320> she

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
or is and attaches 0 we have cable she

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.730 
or is and attaches 0 we have cable she
hit<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.860> right<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:38.310> ok<00:01:38.759> that's<00:01:39.600> right<00:01:39.840> way<00:01:40.049> so

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
hit the right way ok that's right way so

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.080 
hit the right way ok that's right way so
V<00:01:41.040> equals<00:01:42.049> 80<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.159> unit<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.579> measure<00:01:44.850> they

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
V equals 80 and the unit of measure they

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.850 
V equals 80 and the unit of measure they
use<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:46.820> unit<00:01:47.820> Logan<00:01:48.619> centimeters<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
use this one unit Logan centimeters and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.630 
use this one unit Logan centimeters and
since<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.049> length<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.799> width<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
since we have a length and a width and a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:09.730 
since we have a length and a width and a
height<00:01:53.780> please<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.020> beat

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740
