00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone aldo of italease on the run 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.879
 how to get a letter written by 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.230
 references to use to apply for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.650
 I work abroad 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.929
 reference letters do not always come 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.080
 asked however it is often useful 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.189
 have one or more from the employers of 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 previous work but just how to do 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.230
 to write it have another one written 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.529
 important thing was how it was 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 said that not always employers 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.450
 in Italy, however, also elsewhere they have the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.520
 time the urge to write letters of 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.500
 references because basically one 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.600
 annoyance then you what you can do 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.379
 take the initiative 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 you write it and then you do sign 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.559
 so do you the trouble of writing 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.270
 something nice about you and then the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.020
 doctor of work that one thing must 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.399
 do and sign it ok maybe then find the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.890
 employer who creates anyway 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.859
 problems you don't want to sign but try it 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.140
 at least the main thing to do about it 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.570
 will write the most if possible 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 possible in the language of the nation of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.610
 destination that interests you least 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.010
 million English me though if you are in fact 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 pointing towards other actions in that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.150
 language there if you are not able to 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.549
 write to your employer is not in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.400
 unable to write work is not in 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.960
 able to write Italian writing 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.630
 but it helps so much because 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.670
 probably the person abroad 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.150
 grader selector does not speak 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.360
 Italian 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.850
 you just can't make it then you do 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.430
 to translate from someone who knows 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.770
 write well in the language you are in 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.500
 they care that it is so that is a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.439
 other solution however when then 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.590
 basically write you must say 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.570
 some basic things first of all enjoy 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.200
 in form it must contain information on 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.930
 who wrote the link of who 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.100
 he wrote it to the person subject of the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.220
 letter and then why the person comes 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.750
 registered mail 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.110
 for that particular because eligible for 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.220
 do the job you are looking for and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.380
 then specific skills related to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.140
 job precisely that for which you are 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.230
 then applying all these things 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.930
 must be inserted in a letter 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.120
 short not more than one page if it is 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:34.500
 possible to say about mister smith 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.540
 rather than a mistake nor with the more 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.360
 specific and if you use words from the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.940
 recipient the name of the tar is very 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.550
 better, however, if you don't have it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.260
 a havel and michael on the first paragraph 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.830
 of the difference between it must include 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.080
 practically present who is 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.150
 writing and how you are like the giver of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.510
 work is therefore connected perhaps to the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.790
 your may and will say something like mario 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.100
 worked for me for five years like 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.950
 directly dependent a little more than the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.840
 kind then you have to explain you have to do 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.890
 explain your characteristics well 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.980
 personal and basically give 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.130
 specific information on what 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.900
 the worker you offer and why the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.180
 employer is pleased to write one 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.310
 letters of reference from someone 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.780
 puts his name and surname signatures says that 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.510
 maybe he's good 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.310
 in short, he puts his face in a 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.280
 sense the own pilot 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.190
 reputation saying that you just like 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.709
 workers you are good authors and then in 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.470
 one last one last one last 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.880
 absolutely 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.650
 the specific skills that you 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.750
 link to the job posting so 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.690
 to make it very clear that 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.720
 actually you have what you offer 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.930
 the new potential is now work 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.310
 looking very important and then finally 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.260
 finally the signer should say if 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.380
 you need to contact me 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.690
 here is my email address here 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.380
 the phone number I am delighted with 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.690
 being able to talk in person to confirm 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.680
 what I wrote about Mario 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:31.270
 so I do not always repeat the letter 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 request difference though if you are 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.950
 better to have it already prepared rather 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.630
 that he had to find in a day or 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.300
 in less than a week then already have 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.500
 all right then start already 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.600
 from now on to build all the letters 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.590
 of possible references you can have 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.590
 from previous employers also 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.510
 don't forget nowadays 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.400
 especially the linked in search profile 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.590
 to have her recommendations 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.770
 recommendations also there for each 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.520
 past job position the most 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.180
 possible a colleague in this case or the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:17.169
 your boss who says good things to 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.570
 your regard on the stroke so that you 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.280
 you are 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.490
 your profile is much more 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.160
 palatable to those who maybe all these 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.720
 references not able to offer them in 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.350
 Good luck see you soon on 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.350
 escape talents
