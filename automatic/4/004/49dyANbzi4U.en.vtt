00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.560 
this because like I said he was bugged
and<00:04:42.979> we<00:04:43.979> were<00:04:44.100> all<00:04:44.250> there<00:04:44.639> was<00:04:44.790> like<00:04:44.970> 30<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.540> his

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
and we were all there was like 30 of his

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.420 
and we were all there was like 30 of his
invent<00:04:45.960> or<00:04:46.169> working<00:04:46.530> on<00:04:46.620> this<00:04:46.770> as<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:46.979> guild<00:04:47.250> and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
invent or working on this as a guild and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.230 
invent or working on this as a guild and
it<00:04:48.180> was<00:04:48.800> chaotic<00:04:49.800> disabling<00:04:50.580> naturally<00:04:51.120> all

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
it was chaotic disabling naturally all

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.610 
it was chaotic disabling naturally all
of<00:04:51.419> us<00:04:51.540> trying<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.870> work<00:04:51.960> out<00:04:52.110> different<00:04:52.440> bits

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
of us trying to work out different bits

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.550 
of us trying to work out different bits
at<00:04:52.770> different<00:04:53.010> times<00:04:54.110> we'll<00:04:55.110> figure<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.410> out

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
at different times we'll figure it out

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.620 
at different times we'll figure it out
we<00:04:55.740> got<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:55.950> done<00:04:56.400> as<00:04:56.639> much<00:04:56.700> as<00:04:56.970> we<00:04:57.120> could<00:04:57.330> but

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
we got it done as much as we could but

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.690 
we got it done as much as we could but
with<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.710> bugs<00:04:58.950> and<00:04:59.160> everything<00:04:59.220> it's<00:04:59.610> just

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
with the bugs and everything it's just

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.330 
with the bugs and everything it's just
not<00:05:00.090> really<00:05:00.840> viable<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.560> footage<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.250> I

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
not really viable and the footage that I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.330 
not really viable and the footage that I
have<00:05:02.430> is<00:05:02.580> in<00:05:02.700> such<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.180> huge<00:05:03.750> mess<00:05:04.100> that<00:05:05.100> as<00:05:05.190> much

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
have is in such a huge mess that as much

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.490 
have is in such a huge mess that as much
as<00:05:05.460> I'd<00:05:05.580> like<00:05:05.910> to<00:05:06.210> show<00:05:06.389> off<00:05:06.419> and<00:05:06.840> guide<00:05:07.350> you

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
as I'd like to show off and guide you

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.430 
as I'd like to show off and guide you
through<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.860> steps<00:05:08.300> it's<00:05:09.300> it's<00:05:09.780> just<00:05:10.260> not

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
through the steps it's it's just not

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.850 
through the steps it's it's just not
worth<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:11.310> just<00:05:11.760> isn't<00:05:12.289> such<00:05:13.289> a<00:05:13.320> mess<00:05:13.680> of

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
worth it it just isn't such a mess of

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.430 
worth it it just isn't such a mess of
footage<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:15.120> so<00:05:15.660> far<00:05:15.900> it's<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.200> pretty

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
footage but so far it's a pretty

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.040 
footage but so far it's a pretty
explosive<00:05:16.800> start<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.090> lost<00:05:18.570> shores<00:05:18.750> event

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
explosive start to the lost shores event

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.170 
explosive start to the lost shores event
I've<00:05:19.830> been<00:05:20.010> able<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.280> go<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.850> lost<00:05:20.970> shores

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
I've been able to go to the lost shores

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.090 
I've been able to go to the lost shores
yet<00:05:21.479> but<00:05:21.690> hopefully<00:05:22.370> tomorrow<00:05:23.370> today<00:05:23.910> day<00:05:24.690> 2

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
yet but hopefully tomorrow today day 2

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.700 
yet but hopefully tomorrow today day 2
i'll<00:05:26.100> say<00:05:26.430> we<00:05:27.090> should<00:05:27.390> be<00:05:27.600> able<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.960> get<00:05:28.260> going

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
i'll say we should be able to get going

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.040 
i'll say we should be able to get going
in<00:05:28.890> there<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.580> fight<00:05:30.000> some<00:05:30.180> cargo<00:05:30.419> properly

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
in there and fight some cargo properly

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.110 
in there and fight some cargo properly
that<00:05:31.919> should<00:05:32.100> be<00:05:32.190> very<00:05:32.430> very<00:05:32.550> good<00:05:32.669> and

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
that should be very very good and

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.200 
that should be very very good and

interesting also did a whole bunch of

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.200 
interesting also did a whole bunch of
the<00:05:36.330> fractals<00:05:37.490> we<00:05:38.490> tried<00:05:38.700> that<00:05:38.820> out<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:39.090> new

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
the fractals we tried that out the new

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.730 
the fractals we tried that out the new
dungeon<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:41.150> they're<00:05:42.150> awesome<00:05:42.360> they<00:05:42.870> are<00:05:43.200> we

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
just playing it with the vent country

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.409 
just playing it with the vent country
which<00:05:55.979> isn't<00:05:56.700> really<00:05:56.760> going<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.090> teach<00:05:57.270> you

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
which isn't really going to teach you

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.629 
which isn't really going to teach you
anything<00:05:57.630> but<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.680> might<00:05:58.919> be<00:05:59.039> interesting<00:05:59.520> to

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
anything but it might be interesting to

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.920 
anything but it might be interesting to
see<00:05:59.789> us<00:05:59.970> play<00:06:00.180> through<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:00.570> and<00:06:00.660> try<00:06:00.870> and

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
see us play through it and try and

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.590 
see us play through it and try and
figure<00:06:01.110> stuff<00:06:01.289> out<00:06:01.590> as<00:06:01.770> we<00:06:02.100> go<00:06:02.300> so<00:06:03.300> that'll<00:06:03.539> be

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
figure stuff out as we go so that'll be

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.450 
figure stuff out as we go so that'll be
going<00:06:03.840> up<00:06:03.990> over<00:06:04.139> time<00:06:04.590> depending<00:06:04.830> on<00:06:05.160> how<00:06:05.430> I

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
going up over time depending on how I

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.620 
going up over time depending on how I
can<00:06:05.729> split<00:06:06.450> those<00:06:06.630> up<00:06:06.660> and<00:06:08.270> yeah<00:06:09.270> I<00:06:09.300> hope<00:06:09.510> you

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
can split those up and yeah I hope you

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.779 
can split those up and yeah I hope you
enjoy<00:06:09.870> stuff<00:06:10.169> i've<00:06:10.530> i've<00:06:11.100> enjoyed<00:06:11.400> day<00:06:11.580> one
