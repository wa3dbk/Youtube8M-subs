00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
other thing that the Moto 9 does

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.870 
other thing that the Moto 9 does
extremely<00:01:31.780> well<00:01:32.079> as<00:01:32.350> ventilation<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:33.729> have

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
extremely well as ventilation they have

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.669 
extremely well as ventilation they have
what<00:01:34.060> they<00:01:34.090> call<00:01:34.179> their<00:01:34.539> velocity<00:01:35.439> flow

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
what they call their velocity flow

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.709 
what they call their velocity flow
ventilation<00:01:36.340> system<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:37.329> can<00:01:37.450> see<00:01:37.630> it

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
ventilation system and you can see it

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.899 
ventilation system and you can see it
works<00:01:37.960> in<00:01:38.170> conjunction<00:01:38.350> with<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.979> visor<00:01:39.219> peak

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
works in conjunction with the visor peak

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.300 
works in conjunction with the visor peak
here<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.390> you've<00:01:40.539> got<00:01:40.570> air<00:01:41.289> harvesting<00:01:42.039> that's

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
here so you've got air harvesting that's

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.219 
here so you've got air harvesting that's
going<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.520> occur<00:01:42.609> as<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.539> ride<00:01:43.749> it's<00:01:43.960> going<00:01:44.140> to

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
going to occur as you ride it's going to

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.410 
going to occur as you ride it's going to
basically<00:01:44.320> push<00:01:44.829> air<00:01:45.249> up<00:01:45.640> underneath<00:01:46.090> here

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
basically push air up underneath here

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.999 
basically push air up underneath here
which<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.689> going<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.899> direct<00:01:47.079> air<00:01:47.469> right<00:01:47.710> into

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
which is going to direct air right into

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.410 
which is going to direct air right into
these<00:01:48.100> vents<00:01:48.399> here<00:01:48.789> at<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.030> front<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.299> the

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
these vents here at the front of the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.200 
these vents here at the front of the
helmet<00:01:49.600> there<00:01:50.439> are<00:01:50.590> also<00:01:50.799> intake<00:01:51.429> vents<00:01:51.789> at

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
helmet there are also intake vents at

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.910 
helmet there are also intake vents at
the<00:01:52.270> sides<00:01:52.689> here<00:01:52.960> on<00:01:53.170> either<00:01:53.530> side<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.799> your

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
the sides here on either side of your

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.109 
the sides here on either side of your
goggles<00:01:54.280> you're<00:01:54.369> going<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.579> have<00:01:54.670> plenty<00:01:55.030> of

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
goggles you're going to have plenty of

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.760 
goggles you're going to have plenty of
airflow<00:01:55.479> coming<00:01:55.719> into<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.109> helmet<00:01:56.289> there<00:01:56.560> and

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
airflow coming into the helmet there and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.169 
airflow coming into the helmet there and
then<00:01:57.159> if<00:01:57.249> you<00:01:57.340> look<00:01:57.429> at<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.579> chin<00:01:57.880> bar<00:01:58.030> you

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
then if you look at the chin bar you

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.230 
then if you look at the chin bar you
have<00:01:58.329> a<00:01:58.359> very<00:01:58.719> aggressive<00:01:59.170> large<00:02:00.159> intake<00:02:00.969> vent

hose that runs down to the base of the

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.230 
hose that runs down to the base of the
helmet<00:05:05.710> here<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.460> way<00:05:06.580> that<00:05:06.760> works<00:05:07.000> is

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
helmet here and the way that works is

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.690 
helmet here and the way that works is
the<00:05:07.930> emergency<00:05:08.440> personnel<00:05:08.860> can<00:05:09.070> inflate<00:05:09.460> that

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
the emergency personnel can inflate that

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.370 
the emergency personnel can inflate that
air<00:05:09.910> bag<00:05:10.120> if<00:05:10.360> you've<00:05:10.720> gone<00:05:10.870> down<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:11.320> they

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
air bag if you've gone down and they

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.140 
air bag if you've gone down and they
suspect<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:11.860> have<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:12.010> neck<00:05:12.340> injury<00:05:12.370> so

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
suspect you have a neck injury so

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.550 
suspect you have a neck injury so
instead<00:05:13.419> of<00:05:13.479> pulling<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.139> helmet<00:05:14.470> off

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
instead of pulling the helmet off

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.779 
instead of pulling the helmet off
they're<00:05:15.039> actually<00:05:15.400> going<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.639> use<00:05:15.669> that

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
they're actually going to use that

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.850 
they're actually going to use that
airbag<00:05:16.270> they'll<00:05:16.510> inflate<00:05:16.930> it<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.169> the<00:05:17.560> helmet

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
airbag they'll inflate it and the helmet

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.350 
airbag they'll inflate it and the helmet
will<00:05:17.950> actually<00:05:18.220> get<00:05:18.310> pushed<00:05:18.760> off<00:05:18.940> of<00:05:19.210> your

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
will actually get pushed off of your

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.840 
will actually get pushed off of your
head<00:05:19.539> so<00:05:20.020> again<00:05:20.350> just<00:05:20.380> minimizing<00:05:21.160> any<00:05:21.520> risk

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
head so again just minimizing any risk

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.390 
head so again just minimizing any risk
of<00:05:22.060> adding<00:05:22.660> injury<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:23.650> your<00:05:23.800> neck<00:05:24.010> if<00:05:24.220> you've

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
of adding injury to your neck if you've

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.830 
of adding injury to your neck if you've
gone<00:05:24.580> down<00:05:24.789> hard<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:25.270> hit<00:05:25.389> your<00:05:25.479> head<00:05:25.660> and

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
gone down hard and hit your head and

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.810 
gone down hard and hit your head and

potentially have any kind of net

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.510 
potentially have any kind of net
injuries<00:05:28.240> so<00:05:28.479> again<00:05:29.169> just<00:05:29.200> another<00:05:29.950> step<00:05:30.340> up

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
injuries so again just another step up

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.100 
injuries so again just another step up
in<00:05:30.669> technology<00:05:31.270> that's<00:05:31.450> going<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:31.660> help<00:05:31.780> keep

remove the chin strap covers that's

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.000 
remove the chin strap covers that's
another<00:05:37.810> area<00:05:38.050> that<00:05:38.229> a<00:05:38.530> lot<00:05:38.740> of<00:05:38.770> less

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
another area that a lot of less

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.950 
another area that a lot of less
expensive<00:05:39.550> helmets<00:05:39.880> you<00:05:40.450> can't<00:05:40.720> actually

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
expensive helmets you can't actually

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.629 
expensive helmets you can't actually
remove<00:05:41.380> these<00:05:41.560> but<00:05:41.800> there's<00:05:41.950> just<00:05:42.010> snap<00:05:42.490> you

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
remove these but there's just snap you

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.190 
remove these but there's just snap you
can<00:05:42.760> slide<00:05:43.000> these<00:05:43.150> off<00:05:43.330> these<00:05:43.810> can<00:05:43.990> obviously

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
can slide these off these can obviously

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.810 
can slide these off these can obviously
get<00:05:44.410> pretty<00:05:44.650> grimy<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.099> grungy<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:45.669> can

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
get pretty grimy and grungy so you can

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.029 
get pretty grimy and grungy so you can
watch<00:05:45.970> those<00:05:46.330> as<00:05:46.630> well<00:05:46.870> keep<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.620> helmet<00:05:47.919> nice

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
watch those as well keep the helmet nice

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.219 
watch those as well keep the helmet nice
and<00:05:48.220> fresh<00:05:48.430> as<00:05:48.669> you<00:05:49.000> can<00:05:49.120> imagine<00:05:49.240> this<00:05:49.960> helmet

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
and fresh as you can imagine this helmet

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.620 
and fresh as you can imagine this helmet
isn't<00:05:50.560> cheap<00:05:50.800> so<00:05:51.099> you<00:05:51.880> want<00:05:52.120> to<00:05:52.240> have<00:05:52.360> a<00:05:52.389> helmet

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
isn't cheap so you want to have a helmet

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.570 
isn't cheap so you want to have a helmet
that's<00:05:52.840> going<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.289> be<00:05:53.919> able<00:05:53.979> to<00:05:54.099> stay<00:05:54.250> fresh

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
that's going to be able to stay fresh

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.659 
that's going to be able to stay fresh
and<00:05:54.849> have<00:05:55.780> you<00:05:56.530> know<00:05:56.620> quite<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:57.010> bit<00:05:57.099> of<00:05:57.280> use<00:05:57.460> out

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
and have you know quite a bit of use out

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.520 
and have you know quite a bit of use out
of<00:05:57.729> it<00:05:57.880> while<00:05:58.599> we're<00:05:58.750> in<00:05:58.900> here<00:05:59.020> looking<00:05:59.349> at<00:05:59.440> the

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
of it while we're in here looking at the

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.400 
of it while we're in here looking at the
inside<00:05:59.860> you<00:06:00.099> can<00:06:00.250> see<00:06:00.460> how<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:01.510> ventilation

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
inside you can see how the ventilation

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.140 
inside you can see how the ventilation
is<00:06:02.650> channeled<00:06:03.190> throughout<00:06:03.550> the<00:06:03.700> helmets<00:06:04.030> so

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
is channeled throughout the helmets so

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.909 
is channeled throughout the helmets so
you<00:06:04.210> have<00:06:04.389> really<00:06:04.960> aggressive<00:06:05.349> intake<00:06:05.650> vents

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
you have really aggressive intake vents

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.890 
you have really aggressive intake vents
at<00:06:06.099> the<00:06:06.130> front<00:06:06.400> of<00:06:06.460> this<00:06:06.550> helmet<00:06:06.910> and<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.630> side

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
at the front of this helmet and the side

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.120 
at the front of this helmet and the side
intake<00:06:08.260> vents<00:06:08.560> that<00:06:08.680> I<00:06:08.710> showed<00:06:08.950> you<00:06:08.979> earlier

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
intake vents that I showed you earlier

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.089 
intake vents that I showed you earlier
are<00:06:09.580> going<00:06:09.789> to<00:06:10.000> basically<00:06:10.630> push<00:06:11.020> air<00:06:11.289> in<00:06:11.500> right

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
are going to basically push air in right

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.980 
are going to basically push air in right
at<00:06:12.220> your<00:06:12.310> temples<00:06:12.729> you<00:06:13.240> have<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.479> temporal

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
at your temples you have the temporal

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.659 
at your temples you have the temporal
artery<00:06:14.320> which<00:06:14.530> runs<00:06:14.860> right<00:06:15.160> along<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.490> side

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
artery which runs right along the side

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.610 
artery which runs right along the side
of<00:06:15.700> your<00:06:15.910> head<00:06:16.090> there<00:06:16.360> a<00:06:16.539> lot<00:06:16.930> of<00:06:17.080> blood<00:06:17.320> flows

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
of your head there a lot of blood flows

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.080 
of your head there a lot of blood flows
through<00:06:17.650> that<00:06:18.070> so<00:06:18.280> if<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:18.490> can<00:06:18.639> cool<00:06:18.880> that

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
through that so if you can cool that

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.940 
through that so if you can cool that
area<00:06:19.419> it's<00:06:19.870> just<00:06:20.139> really<00:06:20.380> going<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.680> help<00:06:20.830> keep

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
area it's just really going to help keep

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.740 
area it's just really going to help keep
you<00:06:21.250> cool<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:21.520> comfortable<00:06:21.910> and<00:06:22.270> then

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
you cool and comfortable and then

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.450 
you cool and comfortable and then
there's<00:06:22.930> air<00:06:23.110> channels<00:06:23.500> where<00:06:23.919> all<00:06:24.099> that<00:06:24.280> air

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
there's air channels where all that air

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.520 
there's air channels where all that air
can<00:06:24.639> flow<00:06:24.700> out<00:06:25.330> and<00:06:25.599> you<00:06:25.900> can<00:06:26.020> even<00:06:26.139> see<00:06:26.410> it

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
can flow out and you can even see it

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.080 
can flow out and you can even see it
flows<00:06:26.800> all<00:06:27.010> the<00:06:27.039> way<00:06:27.160> down<00:06:27.430> out<00:06:27.729> these<00:06:27.940> little

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
flows all the way down out these little

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.940 
flows all the way down out these little
venture<00:06:28.360> events<00:06:28.930> at<00:06:29.110> the<00:06:29.229> base<00:06:29.410> of<00:06:29.620> the<00:06:29.710> helmet

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
venture events at the base of the helmet

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.210 
venture events at the base of the helmet
at<00:06:30.099> the

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
at the

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.260 
at the
very<00:06:30.370> back<00:06:30.610> so<00:06:30.910> full<00:06:31.660> ventilation<00:06:32.470> on<00:06:32.830> this

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
very back so full ventilation on this
