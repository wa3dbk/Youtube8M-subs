00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
you see are the high pressure sodium

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.909 
you see are the high pressure sodium
lamps<00:00:17.930> for<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:18.980> plants<00:00:19.670> not<00:00:20.660> for<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.289> black

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
lamps for the plants not for the black

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.599 
lamps for the plants not for the black
soldier<00:00:22.429> fly<00:00:23.470> you<00:00:24.470> can<00:00:24.619> see<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.400> light

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
soldier fly you can see the the light

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.890 
soldier fly you can see the the light
the<00:00:26.599> lamp<00:00:26.810> emits<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.470> orange<00:00:27.859> light<00:00:28.599> it<00:00:29.599> does

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
the lamp emits the orange light it does

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.440 
the lamp emits the orange light it does
contains<00:00:30.589> the<00:00:31.009> blue<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:32.260> green<00:00:33.260> light<00:00:33.560> but<00:00:34.550> it

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
contains the blue and green light but it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.440 
contains the blue and green light but it
doesn't<00:00:35.810> highlight<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.120> it<00:00:38.120> doesn't

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
doesn't highlight it so it doesn't

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.530 
doesn't highlight it so it doesn't
trigger<00:00:39.320> you<00:00:40.040> can<00:00:40.220> see<00:00:40.430> today<00:00:40.940> we<00:00:41.330> have<00:00:41.510> a

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
trigger you can see today we have a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.130 
trigger you can see today we have a
cloudy<00:00:42.940> snowing<00:00:43.940> day<00:00:44.120> outside<00:00:44.810> the

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
cloudy snowing day outside the

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.480 
cloudy snowing day outside the
greenhouse<00:00:45.650> so<00:00:46.520> no<00:00:47.270> making<00:00:47.540> activities

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
greenhouse so no making activities

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:57.010 
greenhouse so no making activities
observed<00:00:51.640> yeah<00:00:54.130> so<00:00:55.130> the<00:00:55.340> why<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.330> keep<00:00:56.840> the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
observed yeah so the why I keep the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.700 
observed yeah so the why I keep the
lamps<00:00:57.380> on<00:00:57.560> it's<00:00:58.370> because<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:58.970> want<00:00:59.270> some<00:00:59.710> extra

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
lamps on it's because I want some extra

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.170 
lamps on it's because I want some extra
light<00:01:01.250> for<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.700> plants<00:01:02.470> here<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:03.680> also<00:01:04.670> some

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
light for the plants here and also some

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.480 
light for the plants here and also some
folks<00:01:05.540> doing<00:01:05.930> other<00:01:06.170> research<00:01:06.770> in<00:01:07.310> the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
folks doing other research in the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.580 
folks doing other research in the
greenhouses<00:01:08.679> also<00:01:09.679> needs<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.130> light<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:14.590> what

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
greenhouses also needs the light so what

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.039 
greenhouses also needs the light so what
kind<00:01:15.859> of<00:01:16.009> light<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:16.729> can<00:01:16.939> use<00:01:17.299> for<00:01:17.600> flexible

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
kind of light you can use for flexible

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.130 
kind of light you can use for flexible

I<00:01:45.560> notice<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:47.030> was<00:01:47.479> feeding<00:01:48.139> the<00:01:48.409> black<00:01:48.709> sugar

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
I notice I was feeding the black sugar

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:54.219 
I notice I was feeding the black sugar
fly<00:01:49.249> adults<00:01:50.179> to<00:01:50.329> my<00:01:50.479> BD<00:01:50.719> jeggings<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.759> I<00:01:53.229> used

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
fly adults to my BD jeggings and I used

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:02.139 
fly adults to my BD jeggings and I used
UV<00:01:55.189> light<00:01:55.939> pole<00:01:56.259> for<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:58.009> UV<00:01:58.399> source<00:02:00.579> that<00:02:01.579> my

UV light pole for the UV source that my
BD<00:02:02.420> Jagan's<00:02:02.869> needs<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:03.979> observe<00:02:04.279> a<00:02:04.909> couple

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
BD Jagan's needs and I observe a couple

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.889 
BD Jagan's needs and I observe a couple
mating<00:02:05.869> pairs<00:02:06.200> in<00:02:06.619> my<00:02:07.069> enclosures<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:08.030> my

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
mating pairs in my enclosures of my

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.160 
mating pairs in my enclosures of my
beauty<00:02:09.229> jeggings<00:02:09.649> because<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.510> UV<00:02:11.900> light

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
beauty jeggings because the the UV light

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.979 
beauty jeggings because the the UV light
ball<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:13.189> between<00:02:13.549> something<00:02:13.879> they<00:02:14.720> need

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
ball is in between something they need

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.290 
ball is in between something they need
to<00:02:15.019> trigger<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.310> mating

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
to trigger the mating

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.240 
to trigger the mating
and<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:21.070> I'm<00:02:22.070> thinking<00:02:22.130> looking<00:02:23.090> for<00:02:23.570> some

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
and so I I'm thinking looking for some

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.420 
and so I I'm thinking looking for some
some<00:02:25.450> high<00:02:26.450> voltage<00:02:29.320> I'm<00:02:30.320> looking<00:02:31.070> for<00:02:31.250> some

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
some high voltage I'm looking for some

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.800 
some high voltage I'm looking for some
high<00:02:31.670> voltage<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.710> also<00:02:33.710> cost-effective<00:02:34.810> UV

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
high voltage and also cost-effective UV

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.700 
high voltage and also cost-effective UV
lipos<00:02:36.880> for<00:02:38.350> supplement<00:02:39.350> light<00:02:39.560> sources<00:02:40.600> but

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
lipos for supplement light sources but

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.600 
lipos for supplement light sources but
so<00:02:42.710> far<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.010> haven't<00:02:43.160> found<00:02:43.700> anything<00:02:45.610> in

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
so far I haven't found anything in

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.910 
so far I haven't found anything in
fiction<00:02:47.030> yet<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> will<00:02:48.140> keep<00:02:48.290> your<00:02:48.500> update

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
fiction yet so I will keep your update

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.640 
fiction yet so I will keep your update
because<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:50.150> some<00:02:50.480> folks<00:02:50.750> ask<00:02:50.990> for<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.380> lamp

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
because just some folks ask for the lamp

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.740 
because just some folks ask for the lamp
and<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:52.760> don't<00:02:52.970> have<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.390> answer<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:53.990> thank<00:02:54.590> you
