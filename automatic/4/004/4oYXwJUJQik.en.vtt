00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:21.050 
the other one is going to play a loud
note<00:01:18.979> just<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.189> sort<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> fat<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> stuff

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
note just really sort of fat and stuff

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.600 
note just really sort of fat and stuff
up<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> help<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> accent<00:01:22.610> different

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
up and help to accent different

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570 
up and help to accent different
different<00:01:24.299> patterns<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:26.159> probably

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
different patterns so I think probably

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
different patterns so I think probably
one<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> most<00:01:27.150> effective<00:01:27.570> ways<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.960> using

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
one of the most effective ways of using

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
one of the most effective ways of using
if<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> lamb<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.799> putting<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> two<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
if the lamb is putting on just a two and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.370 
if the lamb is putting on just a two and
two<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.840> four

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
two and four

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.760 
two and four
sort<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.300 

is<00:01:38.770> adding<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.640> little<00:01:40.030> extra<00:01:40.799> accent<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:42.130> that

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
is adding a little extra accent to that

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.830 
is adding a little extra accent to that
really<00:01:43.270> standard<00:01:43.600> B<00:01:44.970> yeah<00:01:45.970> so<00:01:46.210> that's<00:01:46.750> a

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
really standard B yeah so that's a

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.190 
really standard B yeah so that's a
really<00:01:47.020> good<00:01:47.799> way<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.009> use<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.310> simply<00:01:49.200> I'll

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
really good way to use it simply I'll

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.320 
really good way to use it simply I'll
