00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello to all and all these galaxies 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 198 to do a little tutorial on sy 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.780
 so s king to their emails so for 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.020
 start you will have to go so on 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.109
 so if any point google.com site easy 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.240
 take so you type on google is 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.960
 located you will have it you download the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.220
 little installed riquet from here so in fact 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 who for an installer love you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.489
 do you download this folder so 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.280
 so this folder so it'll have to 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.550
 extract it to a specific place and so 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.300
 so what is the time to computer your 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.010
 disk at the local so it's riot games and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.050
 so be careful about spelling well 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.450
 capitalize capitalization of the match 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 him minsk by so the inverted uppercase 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.890
 muscles but a tiny so you 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.890
 put it all here 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.300
 so you have to run normally so you 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.120
 launch so you have not what 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.540
 I did so you have this here 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.550
 you have the name of the skin the author so 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.190
 that's when you download the 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.750
 skins they will show up here it will take 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.120
 just add them to the database so 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.070
 it's a little long 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.870
 so here we can see that I installed 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.550
 so that's all that is in yellow this 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.280
 that I installed I installed a map 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.140
 5.5 here I find your beautiful 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.860
 by the way if you want to see 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 called ring and so I also 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.410
 so install a leblanc skin so 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.010
 so I downloaded these skins on this 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.230
 site 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.740
 yorick sea works so you can see 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.230
 spelling here is simpler 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.290
 so there are all the novelties so 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.440
 especially the skins of the site we can see 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.140
 here the skins t3 different three maps 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.260
 different so there is not yet for the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.910
 crystal bim it's a bit of a pity 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.440
 so we have the skins of the minions the skins 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.150
 structures also so for example 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.869
 the turrets the inhibitors and the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.090
 nexus skin 2 millions that's marant he 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.010
 there are for example of Christmas are 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.340
 rather funny have for example chosen 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.470
 a map that this one rather not bad 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.540
 we can see that there are different 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.730
 categories so the day the night between 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.090
 the two I do not know how they say 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.680
 in French so here we have everything for the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.120
 high quality medium low quality 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.239
 quality 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.430
 we can see here so when it's here 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.799
 what do they download them during the day? 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.049
 sunset oms is available only for that 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.780
 so average quality and low quality 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.970
 see all that is coloring here 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.440
 so it's available in you 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.790
 download when you are when you 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.459
 download you go in your files 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.810
 source of sy had so that is to say so 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.959
 riot games and if you have a little tutorial 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.000
 sisskin where to install it here so there is 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.859
 so those ci what I like so 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.599
 with this site is that it harasses 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.410
 automatically all the skins you 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.780
 so download it's a lot more 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:17.959
 practice than what another site where 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:20.840
 I had a lot of files lit up so 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.310
 so you have your different ones 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.079
 install here so unless they 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.090
 were giving up on this site expert stadium 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.220
 automatically so as you said 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.500
 you protrude appears here that you 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.510
 have put here it will just have to do to 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.370
 any database and you will have it installed 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.859
 it will take it will just take them in 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.079
 the more the install it on your game by 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.599
 example this map 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.310
 here I have not installed yet so 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.069
 but it's another 5 5th time maps that 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.419
 that is, it will be above them 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.709
 I do not know how it works but suddenly 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.870
 will be both at the same time I am 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.010
 not what it's going to do 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.410
 disaster and it is better to have room 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.510
 could install this one if you have 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.910
 also dare more at 5.5 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.699
 so here it is really super nice 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.489
 takes very little time so go 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.900
 I hope that this tutorial will have pleased you if 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.480
