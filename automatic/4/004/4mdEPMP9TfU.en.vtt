00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.910
 Guess if something else happens 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.209

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.099

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.019
 Hashtag's group is there in moments 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.000
 whom you wish you never showed 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.170
 in or never in the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.120
 to have entered the public 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.739
 yes so moments there are actually 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.840
 it also happened from time to time 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.129
 People have been standing by my door and 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.840
 we waited for them to come out and 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.459
 Saxony also packed dog meadow 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.720
 with their longboards and iced tea and 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.950
 chips and then have up for hours 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.989
 I waited until I came out 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.400
 stood there only at the top of the window here 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.319
 Unfortunately, I did not do that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400
 seen 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.630
 But what do but there are also 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.200
 people the one in his privacy 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.150
 then mostly bother but with it 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.609
 You have to live as a person 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.079
 public life hahaha to the next 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.989
 ask at minister hope to 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.370
 they asked me hashtag's headgear like 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.370
 Do you love your ukulele? 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:25.000
 Oh yeah 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:27.790
 there is this wonderful colleague of 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.130
 world next ask sarah helmet and you 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.480
 asks hashtag's group already has 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.680
 a fan is trying to kiss you 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.390
 once it may even before but he has 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.750
 I do not try directly I say that 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.769
 already the one who has tried that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.239
 I asked myself if she would like me on the 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.980
 I can kiss cheek and then I have 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.860
 Experienced in the video I think so 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.650
 but then I said no that is allowed 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.080
 Neither of you are there, so we are 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.790
 already on the last question 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.700
 namely of et china underscored nemec 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:04.480
 2000 hashtags crowe mushroom why are you 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:06.250
 no longer in active snapshot 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.330
 This is not a beautiful snap made 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.160
 I think that's how beautiful I would be 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.209
 say that was for today I am 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.890
 especially many will ask nine 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.260
 ask but if you liked 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.910
 answer all this questions 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.070
 then we just leave one 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.450
 positive evaluation there and write me down 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.500
 every case in the comments on one 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.550
 Some may ask questions in the next 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.220
 video should have a few again 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.850
 have suggestions or ideas or 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.870
 maybe in what ideas maybe 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.400
 I take that simply block a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.270
 other location on because it is yes 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.010
 relatively flexible 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.380
 then I will do that too and I will 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.340
 would say that's it for today, it 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.919
 next time i want to get over 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.160
 a positive evaluation before high and we 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.160
 see us
