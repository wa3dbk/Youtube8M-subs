00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.450
 hello everyone welcome to another video 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.029
 commented with new photos of gta 5 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.040
 good game informer has released 12 new 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.840
 Photographs in your new June magazine 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.130
 I think it's good how the game was 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.599
 informer and they asked us to 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.279
 make videos with these photos, 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.960
 I did not do it but suddenly while I'm 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.520
 sleeping 5 hours ago exactly 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.380
 about 5 o'clock in the morning in Spain has 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.850
 said people in comments that have already 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.560
 come out on the rockstar games page and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.360
 I can already make video then I'm 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.579
 making the video and there were already and in the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.040
 first picture we see franklin and michael 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.989
 pointing with two weapons michael has the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.150
 light winning mother that with a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.940
 peephole welcomes one of these knitted 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.330
 that does a little zoom and franklin as 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.560
 we see has an m 416 or an x so for the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.890
 style that I corrected several 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.400
 people who are not m 4 is a m 416 oh 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.530
 416 or something weird was 416 and then a 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.299
 letter ahead as we see they followed 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.619
 having their masks a few days ago 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.850
 in the other photos 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.590
 well then we went to the second photo and 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.840
 more of the same the three characters another 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.610
 once with his three masks and we see the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.979
 truck that leaves in the trailer of michael 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.899
 hitting the van of former groups 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.420
 this is planning the mission about to 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.189
 make the robbery 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.409
 In the next photo we see Trevor in 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.909
 an sÃ¡nchez fleeing from the police the 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.040
 car on the left is a classic that 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.020
 I do not know if it looks a lot like peyote 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.540
 I think that maybe it's not a new car 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.729
 in the next image comes franklin with 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.649
 a motorcycle helmet that does not have glass 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.750
 because I do not see any reflection is 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.190
 directly without visor or maybe yes 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.110
 that has a visor and I 'm not seeing it 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.369
 too good because the photos that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 I'm looking right now they're pretty 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.799
 in small and not with very good resolution 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.450
 and well, as we can see, it has a 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.490
 skull painted over franklin him 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.020
 they like skulls very much the mask 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.909
 what I had before was skull 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.159
 motorcycle helmet too and well then the 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.929
 new motorbike is no other motorcycle 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.929
 no gta has a similar design 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.580
 so surely it's a new one and as 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.560
 we see this has the front made of 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.090
 carbon fiber that maybe is 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.890
 tuned to this bike and can also be 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.170
 take bikes in gta 5 that's what 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.840
 we will see in the following image we see a 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.940
 These sports car of luxury 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.769
 that we already saw some time ago in some 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.600
 photographs only that it was red 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.670
 before we do not know the name yet of 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.470
 this car I do not know which one is based on 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.570
 based on a car of these brand a 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.380
 little funny in mike he is the one who is 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.630
 driving and 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.040
 is here on a desert road in 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.360
 the next photo is in which more things 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.340
 found because we see here the kuban 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.290
 800 but if we look down to the right 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.750
 there's a police chase there 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.670
 four police cars because there is a 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.530
 and tucked to the right in the middle of the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.050
 land but good are chasing 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.250
 a red car and this I think is a 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.660
 mission because there is also a 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.280
 helicopter chasing the red car 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.690
 that we see it there on the right this 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.730
 it could be a mission in which trevor 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.710
 is piloting the plane and the car 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.720
 it can be like maikel or franklin and they're 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.520
 arriving for example to an escape route 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.620
 so that Trevor picks them all up in the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.230
 plane and fly fast to leave 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.210
 the policemen back we see beach it 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.920
 confirms again that this infinite water 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.600
 on all sides of the map because this 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.790
 it's a different zone to where the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.500
 saints and if for this side I'm going finite 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.510
 and it looks like the front will see 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.800
 Water will also infinite that the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.870
 other side must also have 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.030
 surely and good then we continue with 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.620
 another photo where we see franklin 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.320
 looking through binoculars these 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.600
 new in elgeta 5 in elgeta 4 also 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.980
 there were binoculars I think or you looked for a 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.290
 camera or something I do not remember exactly 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.120
 but good in the network dead redemption if 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.830
 fits binoculars but in elgeta 4 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.070
 binoculars bride 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.510
 these from tourist sites to look 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.460
 for example the statue of happiness 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.560
 but there were no binoculars of these from 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.270
 take directly into the inventory the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.190
 next picture we see a character not 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.780
 got to see which ones we throw in a car 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.820
 red which is the one based on the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.380
 lotus elise or he demands that I do not know 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.910
 a lot of good cars are you 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.350
 chasing a helicopter as we see 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.330
 we also see the zeppelin up there at 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.770
 the right and this area reminds me a lot 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.480
 Highway that was above 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.280
 alternate and in gta 4 there were sites 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.230
 in which you could throw with the car 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.420
 and this has reminded me of precisely 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.280
 that area and well then let's go ahead and 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.960
 we see trevor in first person that in 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.810
 front page just in front of diving 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.030
 behind it looks like it's michael and in the background 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.459
 I see as if there was a sunken ship or 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.980
 something big I do not know exactly what it is 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.019
 but that I do not use the sea floor 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.810
 metallic things maybe it's a 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.150
 submarine or the area below a boat 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.340
 or directly something out there 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.080
 down sunk well we're staying 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.850
 already without images in this we see a 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.290
 person shooting himself by parachute 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.170
 same area that they already taught us 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.820
 I've been watching for a while 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.740
 This area of vegetation and I have not 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.880
 found by now no animal I 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.130
 like in some photo 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.450
 you will find something to see since it is 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.880
 because they have told us that there will be 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.680
 coyotes for example or deer or cougars e 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.540
 has even seen a person says in a 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.580
 of the demos that taught them also 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.350
 wild rabbits and good but I 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.790
 I want to see it to see how they are made 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.050
 I say that they will be very similar to 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.330
 of the redemption network but I would like 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.640
 see them not just take their word 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.050
 as true good the penultimate photo 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.700
 we see a person that surely is 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.250
 from the wall street 'families shooting 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.020
 with a uci or I do not know exactly what weapon 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.280
 that through the window of your car and how 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.990
 we see is shooting people 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.910
 dressed in purple that are bullets 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.650
 and well, from here, I can see little more 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.780
 that has caught the center two 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.160
 civilians running the gray jacket 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.320
 and the one with the red shirt that are 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.180
 fleeing by legs as they can and good 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.160
 Well, finally going to the last 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.450
 photo they have shown is about the channel 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.220
 what is here in the saints 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.630
 this scene I think is the same as 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.340
 has seen in the franklin trailer in the 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.750
 that a pursuit on motorcycles and the 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.040
 they are chasing police cars me 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.990
 I think it's the same because in addition 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.400
 it was also this time that made the most 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.170
 or less and the time of day seems like 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.420
 same and good well here they are finished 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.140
 the photos I hope you liked it and 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.140
 until next time
