00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
we struggled with and honestly when this

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.760 
we struggled with and honestly when this
happen<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.630> xbox<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.290> weren't<00:02:04.649> even

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
happen and on xbox we weren't even

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.859 
happen and on xbox we weren't even
trying<00:02:05.310> for<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.060> happened<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.840> were

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
trying for it just happened and we were

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.600 
trying for it just happened and we were
all<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.409> shocked<00:02:07.829> when<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.099> actually<00:02:08.429> showed

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
all just shocked when it actually showed

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
all just shocked when it actually showed
up<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.819> our<00:02:08.879> screen<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.140> controlling

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
up on our screen but it's controlling

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.559 
up on our screen but it's controlling
all<00:02:10.979> three<00:02:11.250> objectives<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.910> triple<00:02:12.270> capping

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
all three objectives so triple capping

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.710 
all three objectives so triple capping
the<00:02:12.629> other<00:02:12.750> team

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
the other team

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.410 
the other team
so<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.380> have<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.560> B<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:14.950> C<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.370> holding<00:02:16.240> those

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
so you have a B and C and holding those

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.420 
so you have a B and C and holding those
three<00:02:16.780> objectives<00:02:17.050> for<00:02:17.770> three<00:02:18.010> full<00:02:18.220> minutes

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
three objectives for three full minutes

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.410 
three objectives for three full minutes
without<00:02:18.850> them<00:02:19.060> getting<00:02:19.480> any<00:02:19.840> caps<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:22.180> it's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
without them getting any caps so it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.090 
without them getting any caps so it's
it's<00:02:23.200> definitely<00:02:23.680> difficult<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.820> do<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:26.100> on

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
it's definitely difficult to do so on

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.120 
it's definitely difficult to do so on
Xbox<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.150> said<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.620> weren't<00:02:29.950> really

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
running hard and we just split up and we

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.760 
running hard and we just split up and we
just<00:02:37.300> covered<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:38.050> know<00:02:38.110> all<00:02:38.290> three<00:02:38.500> corners

just covered you know all three corners
of<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.040> map<00:02:39.190> really<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:40.860> ended<00:02:41.860> up<00:02:41.950> getting

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
of the map really and ended up getting

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.540 
of the map really and ended up getting
the<00:02:42.280> unlock<00:02:42.610> on<00:02:43.030> my<00:02:43.300> ps3<00:02:43.930> account<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:45.130> was<00:02:45.310> more

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
of a almost like a game glitch and by

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.720 
of a almost like a game glitch and by
the<00:02:49.990> team<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.410> was<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.770> was<00:02:51.160> just<00:02:51.190> raping

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
that we needed so that one was almost

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.640 
that we needed so that one was almost
like<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.570> game<00:03:16.780> glitch<00:03:17.050> that<00:03:17.290> we<00:03:17.380> were<00:03:17.440> able<00:03:17.620> to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
like a game glitch that we were able to

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.800 
like a game glitch that we were able to
get<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.040> I've<00:03:18.130> got<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.600> it's<00:03:19.600> like<00:03:19.750> you

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
yeah as you see right here we are this

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.240 
yeah as you see right here we are this
little<00:03:31.170> cell<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.230> host<00:03:32.380> migration<00:03:32.920> we<00:03:33.100> see

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
little cell the host migration we see

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.979 
little cell the host migration we see
enough<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.459> those<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.640> black<00:03:33.910> gaps<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:37.630> yeah

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
enough of those and black gaps but yeah

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.110 
enough of those and black gaps but yeah
so<00:03:38.140> except<00:03:39.040> it's<00:03:39.610> pretty<00:03:39.880> straightforward

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
so except it's pretty straightforward

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.760 
so except it's pretty straightforward

you'll get most of the unlocks in time

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.300 
you'll get most of the unlocks in time
but<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> most<00:03:50.200> difficult<00:03:50.800> one<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.160> we

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
but the most difficult one that we

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.210 
but the most difficult one that we
really<00:03:51.550> struggled<00:03:52.060> with<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.920> shock<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.070> link

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
really struggled with and shock the link

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.759 
really struggled with and shock the link
out<00:03:54.310> in<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:54.550> gameplay<00:03:54.760> was<00:03:55.720> holding<00:03:56.530> all

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
out in this gameplay was holding all

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.759 
out in this gameplay was holding all
three<00:03:56.920> flags<00:03:57.250> for<00:03:57.459> three<00:03:57.670> minutes<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:58.750> think<00:03:59.680> it

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
three flags for three minutes I think it

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.440 
three flags for three minutes I think it
helps<00:03:59.950> too<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.670> even<00:04:00.700> though<00:04:01.090> you're

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
helps too that even though you're

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.610 
helps too that even though you're
watching<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.780> video<00:04:01.959> right<00:04:02.019> now<00:04:02.260> even<00:04:02.470> though

watching the video right now even though

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.250
