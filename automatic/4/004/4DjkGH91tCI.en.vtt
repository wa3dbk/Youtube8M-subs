00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.569
 and how about greetings frost for fire with 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.810
 a new video about the build the runes 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.940
 and masters of echo in the jungle like 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.160
 promised is debt today we are going to analyze 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.289
 what item only better for this champion 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.570
 in the jungle since the items that 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.150
 we'll see here they differ a bit from 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.220
 the sun online we are also going to talk about 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.560
 the runes and masters that are most going to us 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.690
 serve in this jungle error since 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.390
 these differ a bit from those of 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.489
 just lane either in mid or top I do not know if 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.859
 you see a lot of echo in the jungle but 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.809
 for me it has great potential and in my 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:39.909
 personal opinion is where I think it has 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.100
 more future and it's where I've been most 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.109
 playing lately 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.600
 I believe that their guns are very effective 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.879
 since if we put our w in a place 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.159
 precise and thanks to our jump and 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.309
 our slowdown we can study to 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.780
 the enemies for 2.5 I think that 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.019
 we could take the kill very 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.999
 easily and also eco is a champion 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.619
 that you can give is very easy and 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.960
 that if a champion is under 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.090
 life under tower we could enter with the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.640
 which is to throw it with killing 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.100
 easily and return unharmed to our 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.229
 position of before with our bulk and 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.810
 then the runes that we will use to 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.210
 the jungle would be of two types one is a 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.920
 little offensive what would consist of three 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.020
 quintessence of skill power 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.049
 nine attack speed brands 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.569
 nine armor seals and nine glyphs 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.549
 of magic resistance by level 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.649
 the other style of runes only 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.509
 we would change the speed marks to 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.060
 that for some penetration marks 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.099
 hybrid the runes with a bit of 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.170
 attack speed at the beginning we 

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:43.119
 will give a very good early as we can 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.909
 easily clean the jungle and make 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.679
 very effective chants the runes of 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.539
 free penetration are based on whether 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.549
 we want to get more kill during the game 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.890
 and be able to load it since with that 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.899
 penetration of armor and magic we can 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.110
 do more harm to our 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.210
 enemy 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 the following would be the masters 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.770
 we would have these that are a little more 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.810
 Offensive with four points in reduction 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.240
 of cooling to be able to clean more 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.610
 fast the jungle the following would be 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.190
 more defensive with points on scars 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.990
 veteran and demolitionist unstoppable for 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.330
 have more life at the beginning and be able 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.160
 endure more in battles the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.260
 spells add the lawn that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.170
 we will use with echo in the jungle they will be 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.940
 the classics the flash and the smile since 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.250
 the flash is super important in echo 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.220
 to ensure a kill or be saved from 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.710
 some ambush that they make us 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.720
 and finally the will that we will use with 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.030
 echo in the jungle we will start it from the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.040
 next way with the classic machete 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.050
 of the hunter two life positions and 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.290
 our free war that after 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.300
 we will record the revealing entity when 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.430
 let's go back to base for the first time 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.440
 we can ensure our avoid the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.680
 jungle either by the ranger 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.660
 to clean the jungle faster or by 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.180
 the grill that I think is the best 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.660
 to be able to more easily hit the w 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.730
 thanks to its slowdown or also already 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.130
 be for the skirmish that this is going 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.640
 to allow making a universe is one more 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.620
 easily and finally our item of 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.350
 We will thank the jungle for the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.810
 magician after what we are going to buy 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.880
 are the sorcerer's boots and the third 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.830
 item will depend a lot on how we 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.410
 is going in the game we could 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.570
 buy the nasser tooth that is elite 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.120
 in which I would recommend since you would give us 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.220
 the 40 percent of sdr we need 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.740
 more the speed to that if not the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.390
 we have of the runes or we could also 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.680
 buy the echo of ludden that is 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.230
 indispensable in the build eco 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.810
 be it the curse of milk that also 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.000
 would give us a very important bours and if 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.950
 the enemy team has a lot of damage from 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.189
 defensive items we could buy 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.349
 the abyssal scepter the rod of the ages or 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.870
 they are jazz and this will depend if the 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.689
 enemy team has more ap or mass of 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.719
 then we would buy the rabon for 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.819
 have too much pe and finally in the 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.010
 Lay could sell our item of 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.920
 jungle and buy the staff of the 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.049
 empty and that would be the final wii and the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.840
 items would depend on how the game will be 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.970
 and how are you doing last I leave you 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.579
 the echo controls on the thousand line 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.259
 they would be leblanc and diana since with everything 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.870
 your wars could end with echoes 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.330
 too fast in the jungle does not have 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.400
 a great control and echo is too much 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.380
 strong against renga whether you 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.410
 find yourself in the top or in the jungle 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.140
 and this is all about the masters runes 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.670
 and wild echo in the jungle you know 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.730
 that if you liked the video you can give 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.560
 Like or share if you have any questions or 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.670
 suggestion can put down here in 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.350
 the comments 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.720
 tell me what do you think of this champion in 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.790
 jungle you think it has potential in the 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.100
 jungle or that can only be played in 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.260
 You can put it to me here 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.440
 down in the comments so I would 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.440
 dismissal of you see us on the line 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.749
 with the positions and with the same board
