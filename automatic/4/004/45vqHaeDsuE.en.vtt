00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.340
 Um ... let's see what I have today ... Water. 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.260
 Sugars: glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, starch, E460 fiber. 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.060
 Amino acids: glutamic acid, aspartic acid, histidine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.919
 arginine, valine, alanine, serine, glycine [A] ... Fatty acids: palmitic acid, 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:31.509
 linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid ... 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.990
 Yeah. 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.510
 Today we are going to talk about "eating real food". 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.359
 It is an idea, a mental shortcut that seems simple to understand but that generates some doubts 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.999
 at the time of putting into practice. 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.320
 Let's do a basic clarification. 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.589
 Everything around us is chemical. 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.320
 Everything is made of atoms, which form molecules, which are chemical. 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.019
 When some people say to eat real food, they might want to tell 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.110
 to avoid consuming products containing many chemical additives, ie products synthesized by 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.150
 man in industrial process. 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.970
 But here comes the moment that the rule of "eating real food" ends up confusing a lot 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.970
 people. 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.500
 Is milk real food? 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.270
 What about yogurt? 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.981
 But what if the yogurt packaging has written that contains several preservatives and other 

00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:28.500
 chemical additives? 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.090
 Still being real food? 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940
 And the potato? 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.460
 Is not it real food? 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.380
 And if it's fries taste BBQ? 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 And the grains? 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.810
 Why are people wanting to lose weight that decreases their consumption? 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.250
 And the tapioca, is it real food? 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.260
 Raw carrot is real food. 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.320
 But what if it's a carrot puree? 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.070
 And wheat, can you? 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.080
 And wheat flour bread? 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.869
 What if the bread is whole? 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.290
 What if it's cheese bread? 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.811
 See so much doubt without even looking at the area of ​​transgenics, like soy or 

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:08.811
 the corn. 

00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:12.270
 They do not say that it is transgenic and therefore it is a product invented by the human being 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.270
 which had so much modification? 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.330
 But let's remember that when you eat this banana, it is also different from the version 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.330
 wild. 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.630
 The banana used to be full of seeds, smaller. 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.410
 And it was selected over time. 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.003
 Same thing for almost everything that is real food, in some cases the changes are 

00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:33.780
 through artificial selection and in other cases are transgenic products. 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.320
 See then that there are some limits to this "eat real food" tip. 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.440
 It seems simple to understand, but it raises many doubts. 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.250
 That's why I recommend you deepen your knowledge, because that's the only way you can 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.721
 to promote conscious food re-education and to be more confident about the 

00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:53.721
 food choices. 

00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:57.120
 I invite you to visit natugood.com and create an account 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.080
 Want to see another trick that the staff usually uses but also has some limits? 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.200
 It is the rule of not consuming products that contain unpronounceable ingredients or that 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.440
 We do not know what it's about. 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:18.920
 Well, here we come to make-up with complicated names of banana components. 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.410
 And if you talk to a nutrition professional, he or she can talk about the level of 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.670
 of each component that is used in the industry. 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.840
 Sometimes a harmless flavoring or coloring can have a very weird and scary name. 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.250
 The irrational fear of the lay public would be activated not because of the real health risk, but 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.130
 Yes, out of fear of the unknown. 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.270
 The opposite happens in front of an ingredient with a more familiar name, such as "vegetal fat 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.870
 hydrogenated, "which in excess poses a much greater health risk. 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.300
 Note therefore that only the sonority of the name, the oddity in the nomenclature or lack 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.490
 familiarity with the name of an ingredient does not help us much for well-informed choices. 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.810
 Another example: you go to a nature store and buy a very expensive bottle of 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.810
 linseed oil. 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.080
 As everyone says that flaxseed does well, then you resolve to fry an egg using 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.400
 this oil of linseed, which has all the appearance of something natural and good for health. 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:38.310
 The detail is that nobody warned that this linseed oil degrades, oxidizes at high temperature. 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.520
 Not for cooking, sautéing or frying. 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:51.430
 In an attempt to be healthy, the person unfortunately spent much more money on a product that 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.110
 was misused for lack of knowledge. 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.039
 In addition to a qualitative selection, it is necessary to have quantitative criteria. 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.479
 Some ingredients considered hazardous may be harmless if they are low in 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.639
 concentration. 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.530
 And some "good" ingredients can be poisonous in a high dose. 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.360
 Even drinking too much water can kill, it's what's called water intoxication 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.280
 or hyponatremia. 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.069
 In the United States unfortunately there are several reports of abusive 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:32.669
 children are told to drink three or four liters of water at a time and 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.810
 killing the child. 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:45.860
 All this because of the wrong belief that the water would be harmless. 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.229
 Many people, for example, buy organic products with the false belief that they do not have pesticides 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:59.129
 or fungicide: it has yes, only that it is of natural origin and not synthetic. 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:07.879
 In other words, the mental shortcuts, the tricks do not stimulate me to think or learn. 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:13.669
 These are rules to be memorized without question. 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.819
 Does saying "eat real food" have advantages? 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.169
 Of course you do! 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.080
 When I remember eating real food, I know it's not a good idea to stay there. 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.319
 shelves of snacks and colorful candies that come in those packages and whose date of 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.980
 valid for more than two years. 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.220
 Michael Pollan has a well-known phrase that is "Eat food. 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.240
 Not in excess. 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.410
 Mostly vegetables. " 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.759
 Very practical for us to remember. 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.120
 Does saying "eat real food" have disadvantages? 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.430
 Of course you do! 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.689
 This mallet can stimulate a magical thought, an irrational fear, a fear of the unknown. 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:55.680
 We came back to the dark ages, as if the food labels were 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.770
 alchemists that we must fear and play at the stake. 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.669
 Instead of embracing knowledge, we flee from it. 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:10.849
 I believe that we will only be able to make conscious decisions from the moment we look 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:12.199
 to study. 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:14.689
 Only knowledge frees. 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:23.479
 I'm not talking about eating everything that comes in the package, far from it. 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:28.849
 In fact I really like the intention behind preferring real food that is the idea 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:35.199
 to prioritize fresh food, cultivated sustainably by local producers, 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.599
 buying at the fair. 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:42.569
 What we want to say is that we can go a step further and seek even more education 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:44.720
 to base our choices. 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.370
 Incidentally, one of the practical tips that we give in the course Natugood is really 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.629
 prefer real food and avoid industrialized ones.
