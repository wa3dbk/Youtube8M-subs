then<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.030> very<00:02:43.120> easy<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.810> guys<00:02:44.140> could<00:02:44.380> use<00:02:44.620> a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
then it's very easy to guys could use a

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.170 
then it's very easy to guys could use a
food<00:02:45.190> processor<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:46.360> you'd<00:02:46.660> like<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:48.180> not

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
food processor if you'd like I just not

00:02:49.180 --> 00:03:01.100 
food processor if you'd like I just not
very<00:02:49.330> much<00:02:49.570> just<00:02:51.510> into<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> pretty<00:02:52.870> fine<00:02:53.110> chop<00:02:59.310> I

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
very much just into a pretty fine chop I

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.090 
very much just into a pretty fine chop I
usually<00:03:02.110> use<00:03:02.500> about<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.950> quarter<00:03:04.769> well<00:03:05.769> when

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
usually use about a quarter well when

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.759 
usually use about a quarter well when
filling<00:03:06.430> an<00:03:06.519> onion<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:06.970> cut<00:03:07.959> bolt<00:03:08.170> right<00:03:08.380> up<00:03:08.530> and

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
filling an onion I cut bolt right up and

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.259 
filling an onion I cut bolt right up and
cut<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.010> in<00:03:09.130> half<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.610> then<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:09.850> very<00:03:10.090> easy

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
cut it in half and then it's very easy

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.240 
cut it in half and then it's very easy
to<00:03:10.420> grab<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.900> peel<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.640> pull<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:12.790> right<00:03:13.030> off

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
