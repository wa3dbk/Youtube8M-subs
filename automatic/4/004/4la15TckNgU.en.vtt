00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.179 

just<00:00:28.260> looks<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:30.199> black<00:00:31.199> should<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.650> quite

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
just looks like black should be quite

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:46.510 
just looks like black should be quite
fine<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:34.460> with<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> center

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.049 

then<00:00:47.520> point<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:48.960> mean<00:00:49.230> no<00:00:49.559> before<00:00:49.860> ok<00:00:53.059> so

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
then point do you mean no before ok so

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.110 
then point do you mean no before ok so
the<00:00:54.480> idea<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.520> weaken<00:00:56.520> everything

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120

every square every porn that you have
right<00:00:59.960> like<00:01:00.960> c2<00:01:01.500> c4<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.100> that's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
right like c2 c4 and and so on that's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.760 
right like c2 c4 and and so on that's
the<00:01:05.970> point<00:01:06.210> ok<00:01:08.630> let's<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> exploit

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the point ok let's see how to exploit

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.630 
the point ok let's see how to exploit
that<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.490> might<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.760> before<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> long

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that you might have before and the long

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.780 
that you might have before and the long
diagonal<00:01:14.900> hmm<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.619> might<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:23.430> he<00:01:23.549> gets

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
diagonal hmm you for might be if he gets

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
diagonal hmm you for might be if he gets
that<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.509> would<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.049> helping

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that and it would be would be helping

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.260 
that and it would be would be helping
him<00:01:25.710> quite<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:31.250> John<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.610> should<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
him quite a bit John I should get the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
him quite a bit John I should get the
Queen<00:01:33.659> somewhere<00:01:35.750> somewhere<00:01:36.750> our<00:01:36.960> town<00:01:37.320> hmm<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
Queen somewhere somewhere our town hmm I

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.880 
Queen somewhere somewhere our town hmm I
wonder<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.500> he<00:01:40.740> fires<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.549> let's<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> five

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
wonder if he fires and let's do a five

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.450 
wonder if he fires and let's do a five
and<00:01:43.890> force<00:01:44.610> him<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:46.220> 1975<00:01:47.220> would

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and force him to do that in 1975 would

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.569

that I played it played it badly this is

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.550 
that I played it played it badly this is
this<00:04:43.770> is<00:04:43.919> maybe<00:04:44.220> not<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:45.660> best<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:46.229> should<00:04:46.380> go

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
this is maybe not the best I should go

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.130 
this is maybe not the best I should go
here<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:47.040> have<00:04:47.370> 95<00:04:48.000> quickly<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.900> that's

gets very difficult I don't see how he
gets<00:05:57.030> rid<00:05:57.270> of<00:05:57.330> its<00:05:57.600> LightSquared<00:05:58.200> weaknesses

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
gets rid of its LightSquared weaknesses

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.159 
gets rid of its LightSquared weaknesses
or<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.070> weaknesses<00:06:00.030> on<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.389> C<00:06:00.600> file<00:06:00.840> it's

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
or the weaknesses on the C file it's

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.290 
or the weaknesses on the C file it's
probably<00:06:01.410> i<00:06:01.770> don't<00:06:02.220> i<00:06:02.700> don't<00:06:02.730> think<00:06:03.060> you<00:06:03.180> can

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
probably i don't i don't think you can

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.030 
probably i don't i don't think you can
save<00:06:03.570> this<00:06:03.780> position<00:06:04.260> against<00:06:04.560> could<00:06:04.830> play
