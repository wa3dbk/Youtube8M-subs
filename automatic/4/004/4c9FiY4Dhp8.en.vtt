00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
okay guys so a little bit of a rundown

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.090 
okay guys so a little bit of a rundown
on<00:00:07.759> the<00:00:08.000> clickers<00:00:08.360> on<00:00:08.510> the<00:00:08.600> front<00:00:08.809> clutch<00:00:09.100> you

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
on the clickers on the front clutch you

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.490 
on the clickers on the front clutch you
have<00:00:10.129> one<00:00:10.490> two<00:00:10.700> six<00:00:11.000> that<00:00:11.930> each<00:00:12.170> increment

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
have one two six that each increment

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.859 
have one two six that each increment
allows<00:00:12.920> you<00:00:13.100> to<00:00:13.219> fine<00:00:13.490> tune<00:00:13.520> it<00:00:13.940> between<00:00:14.600> one

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869 
allows you to fine tune it between one

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.920 
allows you to fine tune it between one
to<00:00:15.080> two<00:00:15.110> -<00:00:15.469> three<00:00:15.650> -<00:00:15.949> four<00:00:16.190> -<00:00:16.430> five<00:00:16.760> -<00:00:16.820> six<00:00:17.029> you

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
to two - three - four - five - six you

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.540 
to two - three - four - five - six you
have<00:00:17.960> three<00:00:18.320> of<00:00:18.440> them<00:00:18.529> all<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.100> way<00:00:19.190> along<00:00:19.400> the

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
have three of them all the way along the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.669 
have three of them all the way along the
clutch<00:00:20.439> and<00:00:21.439> you<00:00:22.009> adjust<00:00:22.099> all<00:00:22.460> three<00:00:22.669> the<00:00:22.820> same

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
clutch and you adjust all three the same

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.460 
clutch and you adjust all three the same
clicker<00:00:24.679> one<00:00:24.949> would<00:00:25.160> be<00:00:25.279> your<00:00:25.429> lowest<00:00:25.820> rpm<00:00:26.470> so

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
clicker one would be your lowest rpm so

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.759 
clicker one would be your lowest rpm so
if<00:00:28.009> you're<00:00:28.249> running<00:00:28.369> lower<00:00:28.730> or<00:00:29.150> or<00:00:29.960> you<00:00:30.650> have

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
if you're running lower or or you have

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.910 
if you're running lower or or you have
some<00:00:31.039> extra<00:00:31.310> power<00:00:31.490> you're<00:00:31.699> on<00:00:31.849> a<00:00:31.880> road

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
some extra power you're on a road

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.810 
some extra power you're on a road
something<00:00:33.920> where<00:00:34.070> it's<00:00:34.250> going<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.400> hold<00:00:34.610> its

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
something where it's going to hold its

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.200 
something where it's going to hold its
peak<00:00:35.150> at<00:00:35.420> 78<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.470> 79<00:00:36.500> hundred<00:00:37.430> rpm<00:00:37.820> is<00:00:38.030> where

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
peak at 78 to 79 hundred rpm is where

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.170 
peak at 78 to 79 hundred rpm is where
the<00:00:38.330> e-tec<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.810> non<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.050> wants<00:00:39.290> to<00:00:39.380> be<00:00:40.180> home

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
the e-tec a non it wants to be home

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.020 
the e-tec a non it wants to be home
you're<00:00:41.930> gonna<00:00:42.050> run<00:00:42.410> as<00:00:42.800> low<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.490> clicker<00:00:43.760> as<00:00:43.910> you

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
you're gonna run as low a clicker as you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.870 
you're gonna run as low a clicker as you
can<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.450> still<00:00:44.750> pull<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.110> 79<00:00:45.770> if<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:46.670> read<00:00:46.850> a

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
can and still pull that 79 if you read a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.730 
can and still pull that 79 if you read a
deep<00:00:47.150> day<00:00:47.390> like<00:00:47.660> we<00:00:47.840> are<00:00:47.960> today<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:48.410> when<00:00:48.560> we

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
deep day like we are today and when we

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.340 
deep day like we are today and when we
get<00:00:48.890> into<00:00:49.070> pretty<00:00:49.400> hard<00:00:49.610> pulls<00:00:50.000> I<00:00:50.330> find<00:00:51.080> I<00:00:51.230> was

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
get into pretty hard pulls I find I was

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.890 
get into pretty hard pulls I find I was
on<00:00:51.500> clicker<00:00:51.770> five<00:00:52.220> today<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:53.030> lot<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.780> guys

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
on clicker five today a lot of guys

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.960 
on clicker five today a lot of guys
think<00:00:54.350> that<00:00:54.500> they<00:00:55.220> don't<00:00:55.310> want<00:00:55.520> to<00:00:55.580> go<00:00:55.640> over

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
think that they don't want to go over

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.970 
think that they don't want to go over
three<00:00:56.270> because<00:00:56.720> you<00:00:57.440> know<00:00:57.530> they<00:00:57.680> don't<00:00:57.830> want

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
three because you know they don't want

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.970 
three because you know they don't want
the<00:00:58.040> machine<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.430> be<00:00:58.910> holding<00:00:59.210> back<00:00:59.240> shifting

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
the machine to be holding back shifting

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.170 
the machine to be holding back shifting
shifting<00:01:00.980> up<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:01.520> it'll<00:01:01.700> hold<00:01:01.760> your<00:01:01.940> track

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
shifting up so it'll hold your track

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.929 
shifting up so it'll hold your track
speed<00:01:02.420> up<00:01:02.660> this<00:01:03.140> is<00:01:03.350> true<00:01:03.590> but<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:04.489> also<00:01:04.670> need

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
speed up this is true but you also need

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.700 
speed up this is true but you also need
to<00:01:04.970> stay<00:01:05.239> in<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.479> power<00:01:05.689> of<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.200> Machine<00:01:06.530> you

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
to stay in the power of the Machine you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.899 
to stay in the power of the Machine you
have<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.130> keep<00:01:07.400> it<00:01:07.579> in<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.729> 78<00:01:08.329> 79<00:01:09.219> even<00:01:10.219> 8000

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
have to keep it in that 78 79 even 8000

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.260 
have to keep it in that 78 79 even 8000
rpm<00:01:11.359> at<00:01:11.960> max<00:01:12.460> because<00:01:13.460> that's<00:01:13.670> where<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:13.999> wants

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
rpm at max because that's where it wants

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.249 
rpm at max because that's where it wants
to<00:01:14.329> be<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.689> that's<00:01:14.780> where<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.079> going<00:01:15.170> to

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
to be and that's where it's going to

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.080 
to be and that's where it's going to
make<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.530> most<00:01:15.710> power<00:01:15.979> if<00:01:16.520> you're<00:01:16.729> leaving<00:01:16.909> it

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
make the most power if you're leaving it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.639 
make the most power if you're leaving it
on<00:01:17.179> clicker<00:01:17.479> three<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.079> you're<00:01:18.170> only<00:01:18.289> revving

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
on clicker three and you're only revving

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.200 
on clicker three and you're only revving
75<00:01:19.189> 70<00:01:19.700> 400<00:01:20.179> rpm<00:01:20.890> on<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.950> real<00:01:22.340> deep<00:01:22.549> hard<00:01:22.939> pull

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
75 70 400 rpm on a real deep hard pull

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.469 
75 70 400 rpm on a real deep hard pull
then<00:01:23.840> then<00:01:24.530> you're<00:01:24.710> losing<00:01:24.859> out<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.479> your

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
then then you're losing out and your

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.120 
then then you're losing out and your
machine's<00:01:26.840> not<00:01:27.020> pulling<00:01:27.439> as<00:01:27.560> good<00:01:27.710> as<00:01:27.829> it<00:01:27.950> can

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
machine's not pulling as good as it can

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.669 
machine's not pulling as good as it can
be<00:01:28.189> not<00:01:28.880> gonna<00:01:29.030> hurt<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.390> but<00:01:29.899> definitely<00:01:30.590> not

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
be not gonna hurt it but definitely not

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:31.899 
be not gonna hurt it but definitely not
gonna<00:01:30.799> make<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.130> high<00:01:31.249> mark<00:01:31.490> on<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.759> hill

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
gonna make the high mark on the hill

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.929 
gonna make the high mark on the hill
that<00:01:32.060> day<00:01:32.319> so<00:01:33.319> let<00:01:33.740> me<00:01:33.829> show<00:01:34.009> you<00:01:34.039> I'm<00:01:34.549> gonna<00:01:34.700> do

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
increments of two I'm going to start on

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.349 
increments of two I'm going to start on
actually<00:01:37.310> I'm<00:01:37.369> gonna<00:01:37.460> start<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:37.759> five<00:01:38.090> and

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
actually I'm gonna start on five and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.230 
actually I'm gonna start on five and
finish<00:01:38.689> up<00:01:38.840> on<00:01:39.049> one<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.280> I'll<00:01:40.399> go<00:01:40.549> to<00:01:40.700> five<00:01:40.939> I'll

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
finish up on one so I'll go to five I'll

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.149 
finish up on one so I'll go to five I'll
go<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:41.389> three<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:41.869> I'll<00:01:41.990> go<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.139> one<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.799> I'll

go to three and I'll go to one and I'll
show<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.579> tacks<00:01:43.819> you<00:01:44.119> can<00:01:44.270> see<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
show you the tacks you can see the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.330 
show you the tacks you can see the
difference<00:01:44.960> in<00:01:45.139> the<00:01:45.229> RPM<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.859> it<00:01:45.950> makes<00:01:46.130> and
