00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.330
 I now know the needs that we 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.860
 has in the design of an influx etc 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.300
 know you know one thing that the facts 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.770
 today by acquiring 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.559
 new from a very large lot on board 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.689
 river where the other are present 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.150
 and on this land there is a small pond 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.369
 and I set up a lookout 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.949
 photographic where I get from elsewhere 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:31.580
 photographers and naturalist for 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:32.840
 watching league 1 is time 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.460
 for that to happen we must bring him 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.769
 weight are so that's what I do 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.199
 regularly and somewhere for the 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.870
 lute ben it's a spot symbol it's a 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.550
 good place calviÃ© quiet lck 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.370
 liters we will eat and we can 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.469
 watch evolve naturally past the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.600
 observations very rich in behavior 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.219
 we do not see anywhere else that we can not 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.559
 not know by studying an animal in 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.609
 a zoo and that's it for me 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.870
 it's important because it makes me 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.139
 progress in the knowledge of 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.139
 species 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.920
 the interest is also from this plan 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.290
 of water compared to the photos I make 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.700
 sometimes on the river the river 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.650
 always looks dark because she 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.420
 stir and it is the water body apart 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.220
 when trout move and do some 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.510
 madeleines that are sometimes felt 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.850
 moreover in the photos we can see 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.320
 some light strokes 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.720
 it's not very very violent 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.330
 so this very calm body of water in our 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.670
 source that is more crystalline gives 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.800
 an impression of a mirror effect then 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.870
 that's nice because it makes you 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.180
 gain a little light but 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.620
 also we can get scenes if 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.750
 we had the reflex of properly framing 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.400
 scenes with reflections by the photo or 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.660
 return it in every way I do not 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.640
 did not know what is the reflection she 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.000
 is and that's really very very nice 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.890
 so the night photo can appreciate to 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.460
 the limit by many photographers little 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.420
 in this context come pretty nice 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.440
 because we can really put in 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.369
 value of the colors of the reflections and the 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.369
 context if cash 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.989
 it's smart and it gives me a little 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.349
 as an observational laboratory in 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.349
 natural environment
