00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello my name is savine I am 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.910
 culinary blogger and I 'll go 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.460
 explain today how to put a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.519
 roast beef baked the most important 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.949
 got your meat out at least one 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.000
 half an hour an hour from the fridge before 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.859
 any preparation 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.529
 do not forget to light your oven before 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.750
 to start preparing the roast 240 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.080
 degrees it's important 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.080
 you need some shallots 6 to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.360
 8 shallots and a piece of butter 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 will start by putting small 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.469
 pieces of butter on top of roast 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.000
 I think I prepared a little 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.739
 little too much maybe not put everything 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 here are three pieces in my opinion it's okay 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.149
 then fill in the shallots 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.500
 I propose to cut them in three 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.910
 or four pieces depending on the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.960
 size of shallots 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.960
 we install them all around the roast 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.440
 and for decoration 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.369
 we can always crumble a little bit 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.510
 on the top and then I like 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.350
 small flowers of small leaves 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.229
 of thyme on top of the road and for 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.979
 finish think to add a quarter of a small 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.810
 Verdot around the roast and for the time 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.229
 it's easy to cook 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.530
 15 minutes for the first 500 grams 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.520
 and 10 additional minutes per 500 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.500
 grams 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 so for a roast of 800 grams but I 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.210
 put it in the oven 20 minutes a good 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.820
 advice to win hear your place 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 your roast in front of the oven still hot 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.460
 you place an aluminum foil on 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.009
 the top like that all the blood is going to get 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.220
 spread within the meat and you 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.350
 will have an excellent roast your roast and at 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.070
 oven you will now know how to cook it 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.070
