00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.250 
actually got this on Amazon for $15
which<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.210> probably<00:00:48.450> much<00:00:48.660> less<00:00:48.870> advanced

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
which is probably much less advanced

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
which is probably much less advanced
it's<00:00:49.440> gonna<00:00:50.039> sell<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.510> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it's gonna sell it for as you can see it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's gonna sell it for as you can see it
has<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.199> good<00:00:52.440> fit<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.039> might

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
has a really good fit I think it might

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
has a really good fit I think it might
be<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.699> better<00:00:53.850> than<00:00:54.000> last<00:00:54.180> one

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
be a little bit better than last one

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.779 
be a little bit better than last one
although<00:00:54.780> these<00:00:54.989> silicone<00:00:55.829> cases<00:00:56.039> tend<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
although these silicone cases tend to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.090 
although these silicone cases tend to
stretch<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> bottom<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
stretch out so you can see the bottom is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
stretch out so you can see the bottom is
differently<00:00:59.520> shaped<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.270> there's<00:01:00.480> just

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
differently shaped this one there's just

differently shaped this one there's just
a<00:01:00.719> wide<00:01:00.930> oval<00:01:01.469> opposed<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> shape<00:01:02.550> there

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
a wide oval opposed to the shape there

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
a wide oval opposed to the shape there
to<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.329> fit<00:01:03.480> around<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> speakers<00:01:04.170> cuz<00:01:04.439> need

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
to just fit around the speakers cuz need
