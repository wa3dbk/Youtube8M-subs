00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.519
 hi to all guys and welcome back 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 written on the server with access games 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 the only phone book that in addition to make you come 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.020
 seasickness recommends some 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.390
 very nice and useful games ton e 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 the middle one the middle one no not 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.609
 crowd and probably today we talk about 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.710
 ball king a lot to play 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.480
 simple with which you can use 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.280
 a finger to do everything and nothing 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.280
 too complicated you will be a boy 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.530
 girl or whatever because 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.559
 then they can be unlocked or purchased 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.940
 other characters and you will have to shoot 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.340
 nothing simpler basket in t in 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.129
 effects just calculate the parabola of the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.199
 shot to then hit the basket a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.899
 perfect throw of from most points ie 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.539
 when you do not touch the edges of the basket 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.940
 otherwise and take fewer points but do 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.299
 canestre also lose more time because 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.060
 there is also the challenge in time a challenge 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.150
 very nice starting with 60 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.010
 seconds and that adds you time 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.979
 in case you make a shot 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.040
 perfect the concept of is interesting 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.619
 play because because in addition to having to do 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.840
 basket every shot that nets the net on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.450
 basket will move and move from 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.820
 one side to the other of the screen then 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.520
 it will be really difficult to center the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.070
 basket once you have taken the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.159
 aim with the first position then the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.790
 game itself is very much fun 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.130
 and we recommend it is free on android 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.350
 on ios 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.360
 given yet to know it at least now that 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.430
 we were shooting the video maybe in some not 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.430
 no problem where everyone is unloaded 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.530
 how many you can change 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.289
 balls instead of using the ball from 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.240
 right side of baseball facecash basketball 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.710
 that there is also a baseball is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.140
 can also use a nice steak 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.110
 I imagine it a day not in 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.120
 heaven and you take your pc 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.480
 take your gaming platform 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.150
 favorite that steam and what you find 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.670
 find only beautiful triple titles no 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.470
 like the beautiful united this day is 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.180
 very far obviously it is a 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.019
 people of futuristic and all times 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.330
 that we're going to peek in the store of 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.459
 android games and we realize that 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.700
 a good 80 percent of these titles 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.430
 it's nothing but shit and obviously today 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.650
 we talk about aids, you hear this 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.250
 title quantum is lapidary and monolithic 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.040
 which then does not imagine a game where it is 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.560
 beat of high street fighter 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.750
 therefore two characters that lead and 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.450
 but no, there's this guy who 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.430
 you can call it dude is kind of 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.760
 knight there is a peach one 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.769
 sword and must run I wake you up in the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.660
 savannah and you know you have to run with one 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.300
 sword in hand around us 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.180
 the nothing tire my 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.370
 we are in a giant clearing than in a 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.740
 certain point ends no at some point 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.820
 you will find columns of arches 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:24.570
 wrapped beautiful but scattered on this 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.000
 extreme plain and without a logical sense 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.490
 that is, you find a bow here in a column 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.320
 a couple of construction boxes just right for 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.180
 fill in the scenario that already in itself 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.520
 He sucked with these things made 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.590
 fuck is even worse but what we have to do 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.920
 do in this game besides gazing 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.480
 this gigantic plain all the same e 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.750
 boring as a queue at the post office we must 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.740
 beat the bad guys that are all 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.960
 around there are orc wizards 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.820
 of humanoid figures everyone 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.620
 together as if it were a party of 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.140
 carnival imagine in lucca comics 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.240
 cosplayer section ok there are several 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.460
 creatures around you all you need 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.470
 you know why you don't know who you are 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.750
 no one knows why in this game 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.550
 are only two new commands 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.560
 forward back right left is 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.400
 framing obviously remains that 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.820
 it is not that rotate is not an exaggeration there is a game 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.859
 how fight lights that you image is and 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.530
 then he moves because with the other key 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.260
 home and how many types of attacks there were 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.440
 one that is actually in the many 2 do 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.150
 tap tap tap as well should be done so much 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.070
 so much attention because on 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.680
 screen the keys do not appear you are the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.930
 nice thing is that even bagato ie if 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.960
 they could have something wrong 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.510
 did the whole game wrong 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.810
 including the inclusion of bugs on one 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.690
 platform because that is mobile is 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.770
 a completely flat platform 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.510
 flat land 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.810
 it is not that one can make much mistakes 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.630
 There are no bugs at times dips sometimes 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.419
 takes away the soil texture a lot 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.160
 very beautiful now it will seem strange but 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.260
 we didn't collect who knows 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.880
 how many hours of play on this file for 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.350
 the simple fact that it is a 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.630
 fucking nature that you don't 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.240
 imagine we know perfectly well that 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.420
 you will go to download it because the 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.500
 brook jockey are the ones you download 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.390
 mostly because we know why 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.200
 let's check these games then 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.150
 what happens to them 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.220
 and all the time they end up hitched 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.860
 we are doing a lot of years ago 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.270
 left-handed then with sorrentino now also 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.470
 with shitty games for you 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.120
 however this time you can 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.490
 safely avoid it really 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.080
 It's not worth it 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.940
 well now let's see another nice one 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.250
 play and when I say nice play 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.840
 means a really nice game 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.760
 we are talking about a game where you are 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.660
 use as often happens in this one 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.400
 rub one finger stick around what it is 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.950
 the concept of the game is very much 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.690
 simple we are a little black man who must 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.220
 move from a black platform to 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.310
 another platform 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.590
 black how we should do this thing 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.390
 erecting gods poles I don't know is 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.770
 all two-dimensional could be 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.630
 not even of the wooden boards 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.120
 however we know we must create them from 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.100
 ground up to a total height 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.070
 we must be very careful however to 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.670
 make passages that are of the 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.340
 right size because in case 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.050
 exceed in size the trafficking that 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.180
 we must travel will make us fall 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.130
 in addition to the platform we need 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.320
 reach I know is a little twisted but 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.600
 looking at the gameplay images vi 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.110
 it will be very easy to understand what I am 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.750
 obviously speaking besides the command that 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.270
 allows us to raise these 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.710
 share we have a new command that is 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.650
 what allows us to pass by 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.080
 above and below we should often do 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.300
 this switch because we have to grab 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.480
 of objects that are often below 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.830
 us and not above us is very dangerous 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.450
 but because if we don't do it with the 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.540
 right timing we go to smash 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.060
 very much on the wall in front of us 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.790
 funny even I think it's one 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.830
 of those headlines ski drugs really that 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.930
 they attack you for hours especially if not 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.070
 you have a fucking better thing to do but 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.210
 this is a game that should be used 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.250
 just when not 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.800
 and a fucking better thing to do then it goes 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.860
 very nice the graphic in his 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.500
 total simplicity pleasing the sounds on 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.319
 sound sector but it matters little that counts 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.400
 is a title that can entertain 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:25.259
 we guys thank you for 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.550
 attention and see you next 

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:28.550
 access games
