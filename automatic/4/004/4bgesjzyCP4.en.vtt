but<00:02:24.879> next<00:02:25.090> time<00:02:25.359> you<00:02:25.750> won't<00:02:25.870> be<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.079> lucky<00:02:26.409> so<00:02:26.739> I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
but next time you won't be so lucky so I

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.559 
but next time you won't be so lucky so I
think<00:02:27.159> as<00:02:27.640> far<00:02:27.670> as<00:02:27.879> getting<00:02:28.180> through<00:02:28.329> a<00:02:28.359> base

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
think as far as getting through a base

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.809 
think as far as getting through a base
really<00:02:28.870> quickly<00:02:29.260> air<00:02:29.829> troops<00:02:30.159> might<00:02:30.519> be<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
really quickly air troops might be the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.780 
really quickly air troops might be the
key<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.599> whole<00:02:31.780> setup<00:02:32.200> thing<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.680> know<00:02:32.799> I<00:02:32.829> had

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
key the whole setup thing you know I had

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.780 
key the whole setup thing you know I had
a<00:02:33.819> bad<00:02:34.120> setup<00:02:34.540> today<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:36.129> wall<00:02:36.340> breakers<00:02:36.670> I

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
a bad setup today the wall breakers I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.190 
a bad setup today the wall breakers I
wasn't<00:02:37.060> paying<00:02:37.180> attention<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.840> didn't<00:02:38.049> get

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
wasn't paying attention and I didn't get

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.800 
wasn't paying attention and I didn't get
in<00:02:38.290> as<00:02:38.439> fast<00:02:38.590> as<00:02:38.829> I<00:02:38.920> should<00:02:39.189> have<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.599> think

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
in as fast as I should have but I think

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.890 
in as fast as I should have but I think
with<00:02:40.959> an<00:02:41.079> air<00:02:41.319> army<00:02:41.769> say<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:43.299> know<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.750> you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
with an air army say you know if you

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.899 
with an air army say you know if you
could<00:02:44.049> use<00:02:44.109> an<00:02:44.379> air<00:02:44.530> army<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.129> sort<00:02:45.609> of<00:02:45.700> just

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
could use an air army and sort of just

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.339 
could use an air army and sort of just
kill<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.269> archer<00:02:46.389> Queen<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.930> then<00:02:47.049> ignore

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
kill the archer Queen and then ignore

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.170 
kill the archer Queen and then ignore
everything<00:02:47.680> else<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.370> could<00:02:48.549> probably<00:02:48.879> get

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
everything else you could probably get

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.640 
everything else you could probably get
through<00:02:49.329> a<00:02:49.420> base<00:02:49.569> like<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:50.109> well<00:02:50.620> under

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
through a base like this in well under

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.580 
through a base like this in well under
60<00:02:51.430> seconds<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:52.180> looked<00:02:52.419> like<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.689> took<00:02:52.930> us<00:02:53.109> 1

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
60 seconds it looked like it took us 1

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.449 
60 seconds it looked like it took us 1
minute<00:02:54.189> and<00:02:55.349> 45<00:02:56.349> seconds<00:02:56.980> something<00:02:57.340> like

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
minute and 45 seconds something like

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.190

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
that a minute and a half minute 40

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.319 
that a minute and a half minute 40
seconds<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.829> not<00:03:00.400> bad<00:03:00.730> at<00:03:00.970> all

more<00:03:37.720> entertaining<00:03:38.229> than<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.560> hogs<00:03:38.769> we're

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
more entertaining than the hogs we're

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.129 
more entertaining than the hogs we're
really<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.519> think<00:03:39.790> if<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.150> had<00:03:40.299> dropped<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.840> hogs

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
really I think if I had dropped the hogs

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.780 
really I think if I had dropped the hogs
within<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.620> first<00:03:41.799> ten<00:03:42.040> seconds<00:03:42.400> yeah<00:03:42.579> maybe

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
within the first ten seconds yeah maybe

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.969 
within the first ten seconds yeah maybe
I<00:03:42.909> could<00:03:43.060> have<00:03:43.180> done<00:03:43.299> it<00:03:43.359> but<00:03:43.930> that's<00:03:44.260> tough

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
I could have done it but that's tough

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.649 
I could have done it but that's tough
because<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.459> can't<00:03:45.699> ignore<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.209> clan<00:03:46.449> castle

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
because you can't ignore the clan castle

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.199 
because you can't ignore the clan castle

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.719 
I like I said I think air is the way to
go<00:04:23.020> if<00:04:23.320> you<00:04:23.380> guys<00:04:23.560> want<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.919> get<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.219> 60<00:04:24.490> second

three<00:04:24.909> sir<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.389> I<00:04:25.570> think

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
three sir and I think

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.670 
three sir and I think
it's<00:04:25.970> probably<00:04:26.660> not<00:04:26.780> possible<00:04:27.320> against

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
it's probably not possible against

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.130 
it's probably not possible against
larger<00:04:28.280> bases<00:04:28.640> probably<00:04:29.240> not<00:04:29.390> on<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.630> decent

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
larger bases probably not on a decent

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.350 
larger bases probably not on a decent
town<00:04:30.260> online<00:04:30.620> but<00:04:30.800> on<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:31.010> townhall<00:04:31.550> 8<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:32.120> can

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
town online but on a townhall 8 you can

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.880 
town online but on a townhall 8 you can
definitely<00:04:32.750> cruise<00:04:33.260> through<00:04:33.440> these<00:04:33.560> bases

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
definitely cruise through these bases

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.680
