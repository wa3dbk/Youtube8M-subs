00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
copied Messiah due to the fact that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.719

made them all by themselves including
the<00:02:02.159> generation<00:02:02.790> Knicks<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.869> um<00:02:04.939> maybe<00:02:05.939> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the generation Knicks so um maybe it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.609 
the generation Knicks so um maybe it
could<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.540> by<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.899> bought<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.170> geotech

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.120 
unfortunately it wasn't like that it's
the<00:04:08.220> fact<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.940> art<00:04:09.269> IR

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
the fact that that is the art IR

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.350 
the fact that that is the art IR
sequence<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.549> know<00:04:11.670> it's<00:04:11.820> probably<00:04:12.060> more

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
sequence and you know it's probably more

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.729 
sequence and you know it's probably more
nearer<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.840> PlayStation<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.530> just

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
nearer to the PlayStation and you just

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.860 
nearer to the PlayStation and you just
um<00:04:14.120> point<00:04:15.120> hear<00:04:15.269> that

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
um point hear that

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.430 
um point hear that
which<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.820> me<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.329> mean<00:04:18.690> not<00:04:18.870> not<00:04:19.169> really<00:04:19.290> that

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
which to me I mean not not really that

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.259 
which to me I mean not not really that
much<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.799> problem<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.760> problem<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
much of a problem the problem is the

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.029 
much of a problem the problem is the
home<00:04:21.390> button<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.870> know<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.500> want<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.770> turn

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
home button you know you want to turn

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.130 
home button you know you want to turn
you<00:04:23.940> want<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.180> know<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.510> just<00:04:24.690> want<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.930> turn

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
you want you know you just want to turn

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.330 
you want you know you just want to turn
off<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.289> PlayStation<00:04:25.860> talked<00:04:26.010> about<00:04:26.190> home

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
off the PlayStation talked about home

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.150 
off the PlayStation talked about home
with<00:04:26.490> that

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
with that

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.480 
with that
so<00:04:27.400> that's<00:04:28.270> unfortunate<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.490> guess

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
so that's unfortunate I guess

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.340 
so that's unfortunate I guess
unfortunately<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.990> had<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.990> thing<00:04:35.170> is

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
right here

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.070
