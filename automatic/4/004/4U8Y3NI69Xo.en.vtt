00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.470
 I 'm not going to comment a little bit 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.390
 quickly in a couple of minutes all the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.650
 corresponding information that 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.239
 We will leave all our opinions of 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.950
 the comments to go sharing the 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.480
 with the rest of users we start with 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.980
 the design in this first part we 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.020
 We find two heavily laden with 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.430
 galaxies and six the screen totally 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.620
 flat the top part and the part 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.920
 back with curved sides or it's like 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.480
 if it were a gallant 76 it 's the other way 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.860
 with a front screen of 5 17 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.960

 Menu button with the back buttons and 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.260
 in a task and the fingerprint scanner 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.060
 the device size increased 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.230
 reducing the side edges is something 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.090
 Thank you, it's pretty good 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.980
 increases the size at the edges continue 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.660
 before network or situation in the part 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.280
 top has the card slot 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.560

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.659
 the connection for the headphones the 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.820
 usb port a speaker and in traditional 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.470
 this this stylus in the system 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.090
 automatic discussion just push 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.850
 inwards so that the smartphone 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.770
 It expels out like any other 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.990
 the screen as for the screen the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.409

 let's remember all the colors very 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.119
 alive with is very nice that we like 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.060

 to the software of the 535 point 5.1 of the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.080

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.509

 Shortcuts in terms of battery 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.700

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.209
 Welsh 14 I had 3300 something else with 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.009
 very well this samsung reduced it and brings 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.390
 three milliamps to expect 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.799
 samsung has done a good job of 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.450
 optimization regarding the 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.120
 technical specifications of that failure 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.129
 we find ourselves with a size of 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.530
 153.2 high by 76 as one of 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.739
 width and 76 millimeters thick and a 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.299
 weight of 131 grams batteries and amps 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.019

 net android version 5.1.1 of 'hip-hop' 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.530
 touchwiz user interface very 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.720
 recognized here in murer we keep a 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.109
 very interesting increase 4 gigs of ram 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.269
 internal memory of 32 and 64 gb memory 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.430
 removable not available either 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:02.810
 we have micro is the chipset 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.640
 samsung exynos 74 20 an opd according to a 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.280
 maximum speed of 2 as one has 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.470
 exerted its connectivity hcp to the east in 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.690
 that on youtube and so on so 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.159
 we find before a great bug a great 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.470
 terminal in terms of availability 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.450
 here we have the biggest problem 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.519
 would have a special theme since the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.260
 it seems you will not be able to in Europe so 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.270
 only in North America and Asia so the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.550
 external moment 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.930
 in the USA the presale go out on 20 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.550
 August and we assume that early 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.290
 September will be all 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.170
 distributors in the 5 that you will arrive 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.140
 now the USA has a weight of 800 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.460
 99 dollars for the 32 gig version and 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.850
 to 164 999 thousand dollars for a terminal 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.440
 there seemed to be very exaggerated to the 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.180
 final we will arrive with mobiles in the 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.520
 year that comes from before now 200 years 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.950
 that dancing milk mickey headlines with 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.930
 which is a totally erased for 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.580
 let them tell us if they can see their 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.890
 comments that we have commented a bit 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.540
 All the information on this phone 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.000
