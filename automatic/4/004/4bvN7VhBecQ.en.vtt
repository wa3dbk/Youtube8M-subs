00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
all right so today we're going to be

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.079 
all right so today we're going to be
harvesting<00:00:03.240> some<00:00:03.750> Tomatoes<00:00:04.670> we<00:00:05.670> didn't<00:00:05.879> plant

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
harvesting some Tomatoes we didn't plant

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.270 
harvesting some Tomatoes we didn't plant
many<00:00:06.330> Tomatoes<00:00:06.690> we<00:00:06.810> got<00:00:06.960> six<00:00:07.560> tomato<00:00:07.859> plants

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
many Tomatoes we got six tomato plants

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.299 
many Tomatoes we got six tomato plants
actually<00:00:08.460> all<00:00:09.090> Roma<00:00:09.900> tomatoes<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:11.010> really

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
actually all Roma tomatoes we really

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.490 
actually all Roma tomatoes we really
only<00:00:11.460> use<00:00:11.580> tomatoes<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.630> tomato<00:00:12.960> sauce<00:00:13.200> so

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
only use tomatoes and tomato sauce so

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.330 
only use tomatoes and tomato sauce so
that's<00:00:14.340> why<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.700> plant<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.179> Roma's<00:00:16.279> okay<00:00:17.279> so

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
that's why we plant in Roma's okay so

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.189 
that's why we plant in Roma's okay so
obviously<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.000> best<00:00:18.029> time<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.660> pick<00:00:19.020> tomatoes

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
obviously the best time to pick tomatoes

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.010 
obviously the best time to pick tomatoes
are<00:00:19.890> when<00:00:20.100> they<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.310> fully<00:00:20.850> ripe<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.779> our

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
are when they are fully ripe and our

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.220 
are when they are fully ripe and our
have<00:00:22.560> turned<00:00:22.830> completely<00:00:23.010> red<00:00:23.930> but<00:00:24.930> believe

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
have turned completely red but believe

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.980 
have turned completely red but believe
it<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.830> actually<00:00:25.980> pick<00:00:26.580> tomatoes

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
it or not you can actually pick tomatoes

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
it or not you can actually pick tomatoes
when<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.170> are<00:00:28.380> kind<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.460> color

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
when they are kind of like this color

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.100 
when they are kind of like this color
here<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.179> little<00:00:30.330> bit<00:00:30.480> orange<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.800> lot<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.610> our

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
here a little bit orange a lot of our

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.330 
here a little bit orange a lot of our
Tomatoes<00:00:34.110> will<00:00:34.260> end<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> ground<00:00:34.980> for

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
Tomatoes will end up on the ground for

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220 
Tomatoes will end up on the ground for
whatever<00:00:35.489> reason<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.690> they're<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:36.960> color

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
whatever reason when they're this color

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.100 
whatever reason when they're this color
so<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.190> take<00:00:38.309> them<00:00:38.460> inside<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:40.050> know

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so we just take them inside and you know

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.930 
so we just take them inside and you know
kind<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> put<00:00:40.530> them<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> sunlight<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.399> in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
kind of put them in the sunlight and in

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.779 
kind of put them in the sunlight and in
a<00:00:42.030> few<00:00:42.210> days<00:00:42.360> they'll<00:00:42.570> turn<00:00:42.750> all<00:00:43.110> red<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.160> it's

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
a few days they'll turn all red so it's

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.869 
a few days they'll turn all red so it's
fine<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> pick<00:00:45.300> them<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:45.930> ideally

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
fine to pick them like this but ideally

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.160 
fine to pick them like this but ideally
you<00:00:47.879> obviously<00:00:48.210> want<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.390> pick<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.660> more

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
you obviously want to pick them more

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.550 
you obviously want to pick them more
when<00:00:49.289> they're<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.710> color

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.170 

we'll<00:00:59.130> leave<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.790> little<00:00:59.970> bit

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
we'll leave this one on a little bit

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.250 
we'll leave this one on a little bit
looks<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.630> could<00:01:00.750> get<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.900> little<00:01:01.140> more

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
looks like it could get a little more

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.180 
looks like it could get a little more
red<00:01:06.229> well<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.410> can<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
red well if you can see this but it

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.950 
red well if you can see this but it
seems<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.610> no<00:01:08.910> matter<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.660> in<00:01:09.780> terms

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
seems like no matter what we do in terms

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
seems like no matter what we do in terms
of<00:01:10.170> tomato<00:01:10.979> cages<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.700> always<00:01:12.000> seem<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.270> fall

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of tomato cages they always seem to fall

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.830 
of tomato cages they always seem to fall
over<00:01:13.020> once<00:01:13.410> they<00:01:13.940> once<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.150> fruit<00:01:15.360> begins<00:01:15.510> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
over once they once the fruit begins to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.130 
over once they once the fruit begins to
ripen<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.380> get<00:01:16.530> large<00:01:17.300> we<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.600> buy<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
ripen and get large we and we buy you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.660 
ripen and get large we and we buy you
know<00:01:19.229> each<00:01:19.680> year<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.040> seem<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.280> buy<00:01:20.369> bigger

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
know each year we seem to buy bigger

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.330 
know each year we seem to buy bigger
cages<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> same<00:01:21.930> thing<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.340> I'm

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
cages and they do the same thing so I'm

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 
cages and they do the same thing so I'm
not<00:01:23.550> really<00:01:23.670> sure<00:01:23.880> how<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.030> prevent<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
not really sure how to prevent this so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
not really sure how to prevent this so
if<00:01:25.110> anyone<00:01:25.350> has<00:01:25.380> any<00:01:25.470> ideas<00:01:26.250> please<00:01:26.490> share

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
if anyone has any ideas please share

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.980 
if anyone has any ideas please share
them<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.000> me

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
them with me

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.810 
them with me
but<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.710> other<00:01:28.890> day<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.190> still<00:01:29.640> doesn't

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
but the other day it still doesn't

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.670 
but the other day it still doesn't
affect<00:01:30.150> them<00:01:30.270> too<00:01:30.420> much<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.810> still<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> ton

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
affect them too much we still get a ton

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.820 
affect them too much we still get a ton
of<00:01:31.710> tomatoes<00:01:32.160> more<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:33.300> than<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.540> really

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
of tomatoes more more than we really

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.880 
of tomatoes more more than we really
need<00:01:34.830> so<00:01:35.190> it's<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.149> huge<00:01:36.690> problem<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.170> us

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.440 

all<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.340> finished<00:01:41.490> harvesting<00:01:42.149> all

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
all right so we finished harvesting all

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.350 
all right so we finished harvesting all
the<00:01:42.720> tomatoes<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.170> were<00:01:43.410> ripe<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:45.090> probably

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the tomatoes that were ripe we probably

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.960 
the tomatoes that were ripe we probably
have<00:01:45.720> two<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:46.860> bowls<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.490> inside

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
have two more bowls like this inside

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.389 
have two more bowls like this inside
that<00:01:48.600> were<00:01:48.750> picked<00:01:49.289> over<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.770> past<00:01:49.979> week<00:01:50.220> or

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that were picked over the past week or

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
that were picked over the past week or
two<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.690> have<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> lot<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.050> sauce<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.229> make

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
two so we have a lot of sauce to make

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.920 
two so we have a lot of sauce to make
tonight<00:01:52.970> these<00:01:53.970> Tomatoes<00:01:54.390> over<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:54.780> we're

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
tonight these Tomatoes over here we're

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.080 
tonight these Tomatoes over here we're
actually<00:01:55.050> all<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> ground<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.280> these<00:01:56.970> are

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
actually all on the ground so these are

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.490 
actually all on the ground so these are
ones<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.479> fallin<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.930> their<00:01:58.110> own<00:01:58.259> for

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
ones that just fallin on their own for

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.040 
ones that just fallin on their own for
whatever<00:01:58.680> reason<00:01:59.330> and<00:02:00.330> they're<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:00.750> quite

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.320 
whatever reason and they're not quite
ripe<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:01.950> gonna<00:02:02.039> let<00:02:02.160> them<00:02:02.310> ripen<00:02:02.850> indoors

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
ripe so I'm gonna let them ripen indoors

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.350 
ripe so I'm gonna let them ripen indoors
and<00:02:03.720> in<00:02:03.810> two<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:03.960> three<00:02:04.170> days<00:02:04.939> as<00:02:05.939> long<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.299> they

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
and in two or three days as long as they

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.000 
and in two or three days as long as they
have<00:02:06.510> some<00:02:06.750> light<00:02:06.930> they'll<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.350> look

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
have some light they'll actually look

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.570
