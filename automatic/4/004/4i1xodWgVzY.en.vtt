00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.250

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.920
 next to me is an elji vacuum for dry 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.110
 cleaning from a series of classic compressor 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.119
 model with telescopic aluminum 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.970
 pipes here on the handle control 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.759
 power included 4 slit nozzles 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.410
 for floors and carpets two in one for dust and 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.789
 upholstered furniture and turbo brush for 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.519
 intensive cleaning 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.009
 thanks to the mount between the tube and 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.810
 control on the handle brush two in one 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.460
 always on hand now about everything 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.520
 turbo cyclone filtration system 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.350
 works without loss of suction power 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.050
 incoming air is filtered at the inlet 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.360
 you immediately sent to container a 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.020
 air passing additional filters 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.310
 log out clean by the way 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.540
 hepa 13 output filter delayed 99 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.990
 whole and 95 hundredths of a percent of dust particles and 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.780
 It provides a clean air outlet and 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.170
 here is the most interesting vacuum cleaner not 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.630
 requires bags to collect dust in 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.350
 the container it is pressed into tight 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.600
 briquettes with the help of this blade 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.300
 allows not only to collect three times 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 more dust but also do the cleaning and 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.450
 cleaning the vacuum cleaner is more hygienic and without 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.960
 clouds of dust let's see how 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.960
 a vacuum cleaner 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.310
 copes with its tasks 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.190
 it's going to be very simple literally 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.900
 a pair of motions and you're done Well 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.930
 let's get down to business 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.570
 First, let's check the main brush for 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.650
 floor and carpet cleaning 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.290
 maximum suction power here 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.400
 400 20 watts see if this will be 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.370
 enough and now let's complicate the task 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.250
 see if the turbo brush handles 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.500
 pet hair 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.540
 children do not always clean neatly 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.280
 the sofa from the little cookies will help clearly 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 two in one for dust and upholstered furniture 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.869
 cleaning the vacuum cleaner itself is very easy 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.819
 throw dust briquette and all 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.819
 she won't scatter 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.810
 reducing cleaning such an option 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.970
 fundamentally for people prone to 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.099
 allergies and by the way manufacturer 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.879
 provides a 10 year warranty 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.099
 mechanism of pressing with vacuum elji 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.690
 easy to find a common language he is not only 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.129
 adequately copes with its tasks 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.080
 but also extremely easy to use 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.769
 this I say goodbye to you and with m 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.000
 video wish you a pleasant shopping video
