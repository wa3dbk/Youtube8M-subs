00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:35.380
 Hello and welcome again 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:39.370
 we are tasting today with cola cola 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:43.860
 hole donated by the fan bruno has long 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.450
 that was probably not one of the top 4 and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.180
 at the top4 and most of it is exactly like that 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.150
 how to be bruno or how he is here 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.040
 I do not know what you mean , too 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.850
 the top 8 you shit that can do that 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.610
 may be 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 it's been too long for me but me 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.930
 it does not matter 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.320
 a drink with away from collette pokÃ©mon 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:15.880
 exactly number one Czechoslovak 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.210
 love cola light cola yes with kremer janne 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.460
 chandler 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.889
 what I really cool here is that the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.079
 just rolled look that she as 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:25.929
 first is that the old design of cola 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.249
 but we have a lot like that 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.950
 let's do it, for example 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.689
 rusk makes or is called the band 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.060
 rickety and so on or passive and 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.670
 so on and I look into the kitchen 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.729
 It's fire that they do that though 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.219
 use old logo and so on that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.039
 but then still hot off the press 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.170
 they are mostly still editions 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.240
 anyway and so on and see here 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.459
 through this used look so really 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.079
 from as if the thing was even 50 years 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.299
 old stood for years 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.840
 I think that's cool is the interest by 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:02.229
 as I said , an aging old just like that 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.539
 in the Czech Republic there are as far as I know 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:09.340
 quite a few so the manufacturer 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.400
 I believe it's three or four 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.490
 big companies that make everything so 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.069
 the licensed products is taxi 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.090
 very big with it and so on and so on 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.819
 coca cola and so far and the places 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.400
 almost everything here and so together so 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.819
 they have 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.280
 Pretty quite a broker 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.870
 there is almost nothing there is much 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.420
 payroll tax what it gives it tastes 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.519
 all the same products but that's yes 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.579
 everything just off the big yes that 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.980
 time to sell cheaper and that is 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.470
 really one of the independents i say 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.720
 Of course, clearly, there is somewhere 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.239
 also something big with but that is 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.730
 yes something something again next to pepsi 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.650
 and so on, that still exists 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.319
 micro drops in these two it 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.590
 are you watching those orange signs? 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.019
 chemistry lessons around this 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.019
 hazard symbols and hate them 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:27.609
 polluting cola not because it applies 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.760
 even for the neutral has maybe 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:35.389
 us that in the title yes it is that also has 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.120
 I find a light resta roma and 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:41.359
 a bit let even a little bit 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:47.019
 I do not think of lemon in front of lemon 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.019
 but not the astaro 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:05.100
 but it is easily very easy 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.100
 already is mild to moderate and 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.670
 aesthetics is still there it is cola whole 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.300
 short as kroner very short cola then is 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.590
 it certainly is one too 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:22.020
 so tart lemon level does not like 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.020
 spread but really something sour 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.420
 and then it's back in the back 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.970
 this sinful cardona moderate and then 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.720
 yes, and then comes the Sun is why and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.430
 thanks to order 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.010
 There is no coffee taste there 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:41.460
 comes roasted aromas without coffee 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.130
 interesting it is nothing now 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.840
 Extraordinary is in front of gingerbread place 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.580
 yes yes there is the food cola is with 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.500
 spices jaja alcon and although the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.460
 I do not usually have this life 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.450
 so it has nothing 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.040
 extraordinary what do I mean now 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.510
 not that is not unique that is 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.340
 In any case , it is nothing now 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.620
 what makes me so stupid from the stool 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.620
 but interesting it is interesting 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.780
 classic supermarket does not ask that 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.620
 do not see and hear a hollow standing 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.420
 I get has 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.800
 next to it are or are the co 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.510
 always next to it is just like the fans 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.250
 the company is also is exactly 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.080
 as always because he is yes we are in 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.150
 to come to our imaginary where it all 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.150
 there and what is 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.740
 and if you're still at home somehow 13 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.200
 years old cans there are full 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.740
 I bought those off no matter what 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.980
 Cost is empty on that too 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:45.790
 that was such a horny shit or 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:47.590
 sinking georgia yes interesting but it 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.000
 is still his cool 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.530
 according to many other things 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.560
 have cola no cola honest but me 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.900
 then find it good that they are 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.340
 then demarcate correctly 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.840
 but I would 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.669
 Pretty or call her name 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.050
 not actually taken the corolla 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.680
 is according to Kohler 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.160
 yes but I think it would be first 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.669
 later so someday if I have it 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.380
 It's usually like that in Cuba 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.970
 and so on in other countries where it is 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.020
 coca cola did not exist at first 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.410
 By now there are probably 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.210
 but in these countries cola has to 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.870
 did not exist or was banned or why 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.120
 always there was such a cola replacement 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.820
 drinks that tastes like cola 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.220
 but people have yes we say 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.960
 times so synonymous no comparative and 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.680
 This inca kola is a classic one 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.740
 classic example just what 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.680
 therefore chewing gum tastes good 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.610
 I think that will be here in fashion 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.750
 it already has to be 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.020
 So I definitely say 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.580
 at least it could be tried 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.590
 At some point you will find exactly 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.250
 partly near the Czech 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.350
 border 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.740
 otherwise online click us relatively 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.030
 easy then rather in the 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.289
 plastic bottle in the glass bottle 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.919
 and you get to nichtsdestrotz 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:11.940
 taste already pure 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.940
 give it a try in this sense 

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:37.400
 Hello and welcome again 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:41.350

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.350
