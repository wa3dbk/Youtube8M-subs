00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.130
 the plasma kings we have this album 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.560
 Dedicated to the spin 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.420
 brandy and dallas two of the 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.020
 main test brokers artists of all 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.030
 times 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.650
 they have the beginning of the twentieth 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.320
 knit in New York in the 20th and 20th centuries 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.140
 actually all subsequent kessler 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.710
 clarinetists pretty much shaped us 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.710
 one need 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.830
 when to announce that he 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.540
 pretty much had fear that competition 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.880
 everybody knew that another one was smaller 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.860
 He tip for their seat at the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.660
 difficult places with the back to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.770
 audience turned that just his 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.770
 finger forces do not write off 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.630
 the special thing about the new album is 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.740
 that this time we purely on the trio 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.360
 have concentrated 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.789
 So there are no other instruments 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.740
 at the same time and also differs 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.740
 the new cd from the old all by it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.810
 that we do not have any original compositions on it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.909
 but have only repertoire 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.470
 by dave davis and nature of the brandy 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.720
 from the 19 20s 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.000
 but we did not try this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.590
 to reproduce this old style 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.560
 but we tried that in 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.760
 to record our sound that the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760
 transports music to the present day
