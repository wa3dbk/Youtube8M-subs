00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.180
 We continue with our previous one of the 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.430
 World Cup of Brazil-2014 and now you 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 it's time for the national team of Mexico 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.310
 Sirs 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.740
 unfortunately the ghost of the 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.059
 injuries continues to seize the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.010
 teams preparing for the cup 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.140
 World Cup in Brazil-2014 and has also 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.880
 touched mexico juan carlos medina was 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.130
 the first low of the final list of 23 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.740
 of miguel the louse herrera but the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.410
 last was that of louis el chapo mounts and 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.660
 perhaps the most painful for that horror and 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.460
 physical injury suffered in the match of 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.470
 friendly that disputed before ecuador yes 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.690
 well it is true a goal was sent the one of 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.420
 opening for the 3 to 1 win over 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.370
 equator but that fracture of tibia and 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.870
 Fibula - is he left us all with his mouth 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.090
 open adjustment was present in that 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.710
 so a funeral is like that 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.719
 I meet both in the press room 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.340
 like in the stands and also after 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.020
 of the party at the press conference 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.460
 of miguel herrera also of reign 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.110
 wheel and of course in the mixed zone 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.059
 where we talked with all the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.489
 players a player that the key miguel 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.039
 Herrera said this mountain is the capito 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.809
 He was already part of the starting eleven that was going 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.729
 to have to debut against Cameroon and 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.100
 unfortunately in a very 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.960
 rugged is out of the world 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.670
 of the list that is a sensitive low 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.890
 because midfield is something that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.409
 Herrera is still working hard and still 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.270
 he does not have the four that he will carry 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.130
 to the front defined leaving the subject of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.530
 the side injuries and getting into the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.080
 flat football clearly one of the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.909
 positions that continues to fight is the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.100
 of the bow who will be the goalkeeper 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.380
 The owner of mexico talks about memo ochoa 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.299
 it talks about jesús crown you that thinks 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.619
 diego unfortunately also plays 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.840
 talk about the injuries here but the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.940
 jesus crown who is apparently being 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.979
 recovering from that cervical injury that 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.479
 suffers in the party between Israel achieves 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.310
 be hundred percent for me is the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.869
 titular archer is the one who wants the most 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.159
 Herrera risk but eye because memo 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.140
 ochoa has done well so far 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.490
 in preparation matches and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.590
 be back in that selection 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.750
 surely wants to be finally like 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.310
 holder in the world cup when talking about 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.340
 the mexico selection of the herrera louse 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.810
 there is talk of a generational change with 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.030
 some players of the past 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.209
 I say several processes because there were some 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.830
 before the louse herrera in this team 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.230
 diego but when you have to point to 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.060
 a figure of this is from this selection 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.490
 that really startles here in tó 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.990
 He founded probably not this man 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.750
 is here in the picture because here 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.600
 should be oribe the ugly peralta well 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.150
 besides putting on the shirt feeling it 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.740
 he really sweats her and not only scores 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.930
 goals with the Mexican team but that 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.640
 also drag the defenses what is 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.320
 locate a bit and it also returns a 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.240
 little to be able to create options so that 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.530
 other classmates and come no longer you core 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.000
 in the selection for me no place to 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.920
 doubts oribe the new player of america 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.090
 you have to be the mexico figure that 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 I think we totally agree 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.600
 with that situation when we see the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.640
 reality of the Mexican national team in the 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.100
 present and are in group a with the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.960
 host brazil candidate too 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.850
 favorite to win this world cup or 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.280
 together with cameroon and croatia, what are the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.190
 real possibilities that has the tri of 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.960
 move on to where they are not 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.910
 looking for the fifth game a long time ago 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.800
 time I really do not think they reach the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.270
 fifth game but they have possibilities 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.100
 of the place to hesitate to classify so 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.750
 less to the last 16 will have to 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.160
 dispute it without a doubt with 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.320
 croatia and with cameroon because brazil 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.410
 practically already stays with that 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.300
 first position of the group to but what 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.030
 Mexico can do before Cameroon in his 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.280
 World Cup debut is the key to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.380
 then they can move forward from the group maybe 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.510
 tear victory to Cameron and for 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.730
 there a tie against Croatia can 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.600
 place them as seconds of the group 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.569
 remember that the selection of mexico 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.940
 debuts at the 2014 world cup in Brazil 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.550
 before Cameroon on June 13 in Natal 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.560
 gentlemen and what do you think Mexico will be able to 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.510
 order to find that fifth match that 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.730
 they are both looking to be a oribe peralta 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.250
 the figure that will be thrown on the shoulders 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.989
 to tri in this world leave us your 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.670
 comments and of course follow all 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.650
 the previous ones that we are doing here in 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.190
 football mlb.com of the World Cup 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.190
 Brazil-2014
