 you really slow down 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.969
 mouse sensitivity but it's not scary 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:00.539
 so go ahead control panel 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.650

 RC user settings and set 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.620
 performance push 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.480
 performance from on according to 3d 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.340
 the application click this and apply

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.450
 performance 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:13.319
