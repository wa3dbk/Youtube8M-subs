00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I can't figure that I gotta go dig up

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.970 
I can't figure that I gotta go dig up

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.150 
the music for Myron
anyway<00:00:08.059> and<00:00:09.059> if<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.870> if<00:00:10.469> you're<00:00:10.679> interested

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160

anyway and if you if you're interested
in<00:00:11.190> learning<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.519> riff<00:00:12.620> this<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.860> what<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.130> is

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
in learning the riff this is what it is

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.790 
in learning the riff this is what it is
first<00:00:15.000> off<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.109> whole<00:00:16.320> beginning

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
first off this is the whole beginning

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.160 
first off this is the whole beginning
intro<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.430> just<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.789> G<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> G<00:00:18.449> C<00:00:18.510> F<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.960> if<00:00:19.080> you

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
intro is just a G and a G C F so if you

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:30.960 
intro is just a G and a G C F so if you
play<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> bar<00:00:19.710> G<00:00:20.300> it's<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:23.090> then

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.600 

so<00:00:31.810> what<00:00:32.110> you're<00:00:32.260> doing<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.800> you're<00:00:33.130> you're

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
so what you're doing is you're you're

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.990 
so what you're doing is you're you're
really<00:00:33.790> just<00:00:34.300> actually<00:00:34.660> playing<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.670> string

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
really just actually playing this string

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:48.869 
really just actually playing this string
in<00:00:37.120> this<00:00:37.240> one

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.599 

so<00:00:49.690> I<00:00:49.899> normally<00:00:50.530> play<00:00:50.680> it<00:00:50.859> this<00:00:51.010> way<00:00:51.070> but

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
so I normally play it this way but

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:58.560 
so I normally play it this way but
that's<00:00:51.940> really<00:00:52.210> what<00:00:52.449> you're<00:00:52.539> doing<00:00:57.570> easier

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
that's really what you're doing easier

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:08.310 
that's really what you're doing easier
this<00:00:58.750> way<00:00:58.930> play<00:00:59.409> these<00:00:59.559> two<00:00:59.769> strings

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.090 

and<00:01:09.320> then<00:01:09.670> you're<00:01:10.670> doing<00:01:10.789> these<00:01:11.000> two

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.690 

there

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.969 

I<00:01:24.990> can't<00:01:25.990> tell<00:01:26.110> if<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.439> see<00:01:26.590> what<00:01:26.710> this<00:01:26.829> is

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
I can't tell if you can see what this is

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.469 
I can't tell if you can see what this is
on<00:01:27.159> this<00:01:27.280> little<00:01:27.520> screen<00:01:27.729> or<00:01:27.880> not<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:29.229> um

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
on this little screen or not but um

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.200 
on this little screen or not but um
hopefully<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.659> works<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.820> if<00:01:33.939> you<00:01:34.030> were<00:01:34.119> to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
hopefully that works but if you were to

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.330 
hopefully that works but if you were to
do<00:01:34.329> a<00:01:34.360> chord<00:01:34.990> wise<00:01:35.229> just<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.740> see<00:01:35.950> what's<00:01:36.159> going

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
do a chord wise just to see what's going

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.179 
do a chord wise just to see what's going
on<00:01:36.520> again<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:38.049> just<00:01:38.200> where<00:01:38.469> this<00:01:38.560> pinkie<00:01:38.979> is

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
on again it's just where this pinkie is

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.870 
on again it's just where this pinkie is
and<00:01:39.899> then<00:01:40.899> this<00:01:41.049> finger<00:01:41.470> these<00:01:42.460> others<00:01:42.759> are

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
and then this finger these others are

00:01:42.880 --> 00:02:00.060 
and then this finger these others are
not<00:01:43.060> being<00:01:43.240> used<00:01:43.539> but<00:01:43.929> for<00:01:44.380> positioning

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.410 

now<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.490> need<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.820> listen<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.300> recording

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
now you need to listen to the recording

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.090 
now you need to listen to the recording
to<00:02:01.840> find<00:02:02.080> out<00:02:02.200> when<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.380> chord<00:02:02.590> changes<00:02:02.770> are

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
to find out when the chord changes are

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:28.530 
to find out when the chord changes are
so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.690 

anyway<00:02:29.680> hopefully<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:30.860> useful<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.580> it

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
anyway hopefully that's useful and it

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.560 
anyway hopefully that's useful and it
wasn't<00:02:32.440> too<00:02:33.440> obnoxious
