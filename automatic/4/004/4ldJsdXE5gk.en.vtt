I<00:01:56.560> know<00:01:57.220> we've<00:01:57.430> had<00:01:57.460> valve<00:01:57.970> guide<00:01:58.240> issues<00:01:58.630> on

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
I know we've had valve guide issues on

I know we've had valve guide issues on
these<00:01:59.080> too<00:01:59.380> so<00:01:59.970> we've<00:02:00.970> had<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.270> replace

these too so we've had to replace

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.770 
these too so we've had to replace
cylinder<00:02:01.990> heads
