if I metal appreciatively the current
length<00:01:47.080> ways<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:48.010> should<00:01:48.610> go<00:01:48.880> through<00:01:49.240> nice

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
length ways it should go through nice

messing<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:51.070> I'm<00:01:51.100> gonna<00:01:51.580> finish<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.180> wrong

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
messing and I'm gonna finish it wrong

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.670 
messing and I'm gonna finish it wrong
for<00:01:53.140> thin<00:01:53.920> end<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.750> means<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.229> would<00:01:56.560> be

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
for thin end that means it would be

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.070 
for thin end that means it would be
easier<00:01:57.100> but<00:01:57.400> you're<00:01:57.760> wet<00:01:58.120> through<00:02:01.080> sometimes

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
easier but you're wet through sometimes

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.840 
easier but you're wet through sometimes
this<00:02:02.290> can<00:02:02.500> take<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.740> couple<00:02:03.040> days<00:02:03.220> in<00:02:03.700> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
this can take a couple days in the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.960 
this can take a couple days in the
warnings<00:02:04.270> again

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
warnings again

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.890 
warnings again
then<00:02:07.480> you<00:02:07.780> trick<00:02:08.080> your<00:02:12.720> straight<00:02:13.720> as<00:02:13.750> possible

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
then you trick your straight as possible

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.290 
then you trick your straight as possible
factory<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.460> see<00:02:15.700> actually<00:02:15.910> goes<00:02:16.270> through
