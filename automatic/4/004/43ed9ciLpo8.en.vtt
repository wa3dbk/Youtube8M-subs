00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.559
 today we have two sets in comparison and today I have me 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.499
 I've already thought about putting reinforcements on the boat that's why I'm not 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.070
 Caller circle kfz-mechatroniker 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.949
 big Jutta Verna said local but you have for Keiko Bleicher for you 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.550
 prepare one 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.850
 Toyota Avensis Combi and a Volvo v70 station wagon and I would try today 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.650
 I really have one 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.810
 through and through from its brand toyota driver might have convinced 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.260
 from something else can convince what my boys do not believe them 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.740
 latter Fürth of Bern 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.729
 and we'll try it out with which one you want to start 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.549
 Of course Osman is under pressure early then the key here is a lot of fun 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.549
 we'll be back right away mka 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.540
 our Toyota Avensis is the strongest for this model 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.730
 available diesel engine equipped 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.660
 with its 177 hp and its 400-minute torque that means 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.660
 Pure driving pleasure 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.970
 The six-speed manual gearbox allows for crisp gear changes and also that 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.930
 Suspension is designed sporty enough to market even tight corners 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.720
 faster the direct steering does the rest it conveys 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720
 always good contact with the street 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.679
 where is he? 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.900
 where is he? 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.610
 It's been quite a while now. "Becks" stays away 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.220
 i hope he will not come back to you and environment just when she is 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.830
 in the time where he is on the road we now have enough opportunity us 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.830
 take a closer look at the Volvo v70 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.640
 Clean lines characterize the picture of the biggest damage coming 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.300
 typical Volvo the broad shoulder and pulled up to the roof edge 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300
 tail lights 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.379
 the trunk of our test »would be exposed that is even the 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.800
 last is and if the flap then up once 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.700
 we have here 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.519
 1600 liters of space 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.480
 for luggage with folded 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
 rear seats 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.379
 do you work the seats Euro 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.099
 I'll do that here, here's that 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.980
 actually even in the three-piece this can suppress 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.569
 and then we have the front 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 a comfortable back seat 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.059
 Great at Volvo always the built-in child seats in two 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.400
 Stages depending on the size of my child 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.759
 can take off 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.759
 always further forward 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:57.619
 then we also find some very simple and elegant interior design 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:58.440
 in front 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.020
 i have more comfortable front seats i have more many thats a system with 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.070
 hurts is that the navigation system because here with these scarce use 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.910
 may not be completely intuitive to use it would be nice if i just nice 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.910
 could press on it 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.019
 Suckale 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.889
 and a first impression 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.559
 optimal requirement 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.809
 Airplanes around everything optimally well 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:27.929
 are you still driving? 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:30.129
 a round with the euro 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.819
 Marc o'polo compensate Munich and Bamberg the same way 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.819
 fun 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:43.269
 Like Volvo has 175hp on the various for the same performance 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.599
 like the commuter 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.549
 Torque of Zuger has me 420 Newton meters the automatic transmission and 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.929
 the possibilities for activity for gentle gliding is suitable 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:57.949
 however, the driving behavior is not as precise as that of the car 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.949
 Karwendels especially at Massa 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.220
 the district now with the Volvo inferior 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.050
 can we 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.050
 Take a close look at the Toyota Avensis Combi 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:32.800
 the third generation of the Avensis has been around since 2009 and is very similar to 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.279
 in the US offered Corolla and should help the new brand design also in 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.990
 Enforce Europe 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.540
 what you might associate with Toyota Design from earlier is not 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.539
 much more left 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.550
 it is remarkable that the appeal wants 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.100
 although he's from the year 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.260
 a flattened re-line still has nine liters more space for luggage 1000 609 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.669
 Feet deep so go in this state here 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.659
 in the trunk 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.059
 Toyota Avensis Combi 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.370
 but you rarely need so much space 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.800
 because most of the time we are sitting in an upright position this year 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.490
 to be nice at the back 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.159
 can sit down comfortably 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.159
 and still has 543 meters of luggage space 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.330
 The interior is solid but not very innovative, true to the motto 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.980
 from 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.610
 those of us researchers 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.610
 The instrument cluster is easy to read a switching point display series 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.169
 Kaya worry 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.339
 Professor drove with the Volvo and how load 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.870
 but not more storage space 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.560
 we have to and want to 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.919
 Rome pretty weird on the road 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.900
 and at pretty cheerful 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.129
 the mill controls 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.629
 Although school reports would be Polo Tang 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.159
 Bolt you can not do anything 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.689
 sometimes it is not only important how a car drives but never 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.239
 maintenance-friendly a car is let's take a look under the hood 

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:15.239
 of course works 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.339
 so Bavaria's media also Volvo engine 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.929
 what he's up to as a car mechatronic yes and that's pretty much on offer 

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:26.710
 one should only come - total 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.249
 m for the little motto of our must all clear 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.960
 um + amazed oil March was dying 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.110
 I do not see Eschborn Stone's mode 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.319
 completely looking for already 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.389
 but thanks works 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.500
 electrically with this author Paulo for middle class of it 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.330
 and of course they come up with something great 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.469
 They take you to their roots 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:50.520
 Pietsch 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.930
 even before it was taken 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.790
 This is of course handy because you are just beautiful here 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.460
 the ordinary citizen uses exactly 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.430
 so revealed 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.430
 says earlier 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.799
 optimally that is practically yes and now the Toyota 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.119
 I do not see much plastic covers or statements 

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:17.580
 who knowingly or seems to both hotspur switch several citizens 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.020
 This complicated already one dares then nothing at all because 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.990
 Everywhere such plastic cover you have the otto-normal consumer 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.880
 has no idea because I can break something because you can with you 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.610
 Sophie Koch always Eichmann's ANSYS problem may be the tips or 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.330
 what else 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.599
 That means you could be here 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:39.789
 with a little manual skill also help yourself what, of course 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:44.409
 to try a lot so what do you think is better of the maintenance 

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:48.619
 If both of them are for my nerves both have such new logo 

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:50.169
 one used 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.870
 Euro with endemic Dortmund on the job site was with the headlights 

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:55.970
 Yeah good 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.940
 So it remains with your favorites the solo part 5 Manteuffel
