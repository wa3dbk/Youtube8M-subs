video<00:00:12.990> we're<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.500> begin<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.889> actual

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
video we're going to begin the actual

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.070 
video we're going to begin the actual
modeling<00:00:14.880> process<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> robot<00:00:15.929> itself

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
modeling process of the robot itself

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.380 
modeling process of the robot itself
alright<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.640> start<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.210> we're

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
alright so to start with here we're

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.300 
alright so to start with here we're
gonna<00:00:18.510> start<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:19.050> some<00:00:19.470> pretty<00:00:20.070> basic

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
gonna start with some pretty basic

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.370 
gonna start with some pretty basic
primitives<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.119> order<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.390> build<00:00:21.510> things<00:00:21.779> so

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
primitives in order to build things so

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
primitives in order to build things so
let's<00:00:22.529> go<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.769> our<00:00:23.189> extended<00:00:23.850> primitives<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
let's go to our extended primitives and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849 
let's go to our extended primitives and
we're<00:00:24.480> gonna<00:00:24.570> use<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> chamfer<00:00:25.080> box<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.650> build

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
we're gonna use a chamfer box to build

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.890 
we're gonna use a chamfer box to build
his<00:00:26.490> body<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.510> as<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.750> drag<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:28.410> chamfer<00:00:29.099> box

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
his body so as I drag in my chamfer box

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.240 
his body so as I drag in my chamfer box
dragging<00:00:30.900> our<00:00:31.019> height<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> side<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.070> then

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
dragging our height on the side and then

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.000 
dragging our height on the side and then
as<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:33.149> drag<00:00:33.540> here<00:00:33.840> we're<00:00:34.020> gonna<00:00:34.110> run<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.739> off

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
as I drag here we're gonna run that off

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.220 
as I drag here we're gonna run that off
so<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.760> should<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.480> pretty<00:00:36.690> good<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.989> start

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
so that should be pretty good to start

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.350 
so that should be pretty good to start
with<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.670> able<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.090> in

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
with now I do want to be able to see in

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.729 
with now I do want to be able to see in
my<00:00:39.510> side<00:00:39.780> view<00:00:39.809> here<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.170> we're<00:00:40.379> gonna<00:00:40.469> change

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
my side view here so we're gonna change

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.440 
my side view here so we're gonna change
this<00:00:41.010> from<00:00:41.160> wireframe<00:00:41.700> let's<00:00:42.270> go<00:00:42.390> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
this from wireframe let's go to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.430 
this from wireframe let's go to
realistic<00:00:43.309> alright<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.120> look<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.050> here

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
realistic alright so as we look in here

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.650 
realistic alright so as we look in here
we<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.480> adjust<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:50.250> robot<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.300> fit

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
we can see as we adjust the robot to fit

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.770 
we can see as we adjust the robot to fit
our<00:00:52.140> modeling<00:00:52.949> planes<00:00:53.250> what's<00:00:54.210> gonna<00:00:54.360> happen

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
our modeling planes what's gonna happen

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
our modeling planes what's gonna happen
is<00:00:55.020> we're<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.590> continually<00:00:56.399> grab<00:00:56.760> those

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
is we're gonna continually grab those

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
is we're gonna continually grab those
modeling<00:00:57.600> planes<00:00:57.809> themselves<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.190> gonna

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
modeling planes themselves so I'm gonna

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
modeling planes themselves so I'm gonna
grab<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.789> three<00:01:00.000> planes<00:01:00.329> I'm<00:01:00.809> gonna

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
grab all three planes I'm gonna

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.270 
grab all three planes I'm gonna
right-click<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> object

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
right-click and I'm gonna go to object

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.030 
right-click and I'm gonna go to object
properties<00:01:03.000> those<00:01:03.930> objects<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:04.830> make

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
properties those objects I'm gonna make

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
properties those objects I'm gonna make
them<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:06.150> face<00:01:06.390> call<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.049> sure

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
them back face call I want to make sure

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.469 
them back face call I want to make sure
back<00:01:07.380> face<00:01:07.590> calls<00:01:07.830> turned<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
back face calls turned on and I want to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.020 
back face calls turned on and I want to
uncheck<00:01:09.869> show<00:01:10.680> frozen<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.549> gray<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.729> then

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
uncheck show frozen and gray so then

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.940 
uncheck show frozen and gray so then
when<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> freeze<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.780> I'll<00:01:13.290> still<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> able<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
when I freeze them I'll still be able to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.039 
when I freeze them I'll still be able to
see<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> image<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.150> leave<00:01:15.330> show<00:01:15.570> frozen<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
see the image if I leave show frozen and

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
see the image if I leave show frozen and
gray<00:01:16.200> checked<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.770> soon<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.340> freeze<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
gray checked as soon as I freeze the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
gray checked as soon as I freeze the
objects<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.659> image<00:01:19.140> will<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:19.409> away<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
objects the image will go away and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.380 
objects the image will go away and
they'll<00:01:19.770> turn<00:01:19.950> solid<00:01:20.159> gray<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.210> won't

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
they'll turn solid gray so that won't

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.300 
they'll turn solid gray so that won't
help<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.659> whole<00:01:21.840> lot<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:22.979> they're

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
help this whole lot so now that they're

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.870 
help this whole lot so now that they're
frozen

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
frozen

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.749 
frozen
we<00:01:24.180> can't<00:01:24.450> accidentally<00:01:25.080> pick<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.340> now

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
we can't accidentally pick them so now

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.179 
we can't accidentally pick them so now
again<00:01:26.970> we'll<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.330> back<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> our<00:01:27.689> modify<00:01:27.990> panel

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
again we'll go back to our modify panel

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.920 
again we'll go back to our modify panel
well<00:01:29.189> turn<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.640> edged<00:01:29.970> faces<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.810> these

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
well turn out on edged faces for these

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.050 
well turn out on edged faces for these
views<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.439> what's<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
views so we can see what's going on and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.670 
views so we can see what's going on and
then<00:01:36.240> we're<00:01:36.360> gonna<00:01:36.450> add<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:36.659> segments<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.650> be

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
then we're gonna add some segments to be

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
then we're gonna add some segments to be
able<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.280> refine<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:40.310> adjust<00:01:41.659> alright<00:01:42.659> so

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
able to refine and adjust alright so

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
able to refine and adjust alright so
that<00:01:43.020> looks<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.590> will<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.890> plenty<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that looks like that will be plenty of

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
that looks like that will be plenty of
geometry<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.280> adjust<00:01:47.399> his<00:01:48.000> size<00:01:48.390> here

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
geometry so as we adjust his size here

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.890 
geometry so as we adjust his size here
and<00:01:51.140> then<00:01:51.290> adjust<00:01:51.650> position<00:01:52.330> our<00:01:53.330> overall

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
and then adjust position our overall

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.500 
and then adjust position our overall
shape<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.650> pretty<00:01:55.400> close<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.820> what<00:01:56.180> we<00:01:56.330> want

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
shape is pretty close to what we want

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.660 
shape is pretty close to what we want
but<00:01:56.690> definitely<00:01:57.080> not<00:01:57.170> exactly<00:01:57.890> where<00:01:58.310> we<00:01:58.460> want

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
but definitely not exactly where we want

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.399 
but definitely not exactly where we want
it<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:58.880> be<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.360> if<00:01:59.540> we<00:01:59.690> look<00:01:59.869> around<00:02:00.020> at<00:02:00.290> our

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
it to be so if we look around at our

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.040 
it to be so if we look around at our
fill<00:02:00.619> it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
fill it

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.630 
fill it
just<00:02:02.920> move<00:02:03.430> mop<00:02:04.710> that's<00:02:05.710> not<00:02:05.920> too<00:02:06.160> bad

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
just move mop that's not too bad

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.570 
just move mop that's not too bad
I<00:02:06.960> had<00:02:07.960> another<00:02:08.170> Philips<00:02:08.590> segment<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.190> that's

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
I had another Philips segment and that's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.880 
I had another Philips segment and that's
even<00:02:09.880> better<00:02:10.030> all<00:02:10.510> right<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:11.020> from<00:02:11.440> there

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
even better all right so from there

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.100 
even better all right so from there
since<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.910> enough<00:02:13.180> geometry<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.840> round

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
since I have enough geometry to round

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.500 
since I have enough geometry to round
out<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> body<00:02:14.710> but<00:02:15.670> I'm<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.850> little<00:02:16.180> flat<00:02:16.480> on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
out the body but I'm a little flat on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.750 
out the body but I'm a little flat on
the<00:02:16.810> sides<00:02:16.960> here<00:02:17.410> we're<00:02:18.220> gonna<00:02:18.370> right-click

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
the sides here we're gonna right-click

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.380 
the sides here we're gonna right-click
and<00:02:19.240> convert<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.500> an<00:02:20.620> editable<00:02:20.770> poly

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
and convert this to an editable poly

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.970 
and convert this to an editable poly
that<00:02:22.390> will<00:02:22.570> allow<00:02:22.900> me<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.170> be<00:02:23.770> able<00:02:23.830> to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
that will allow me to be able to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.660 
that will allow me to be able to
interact<00:02:24.460> directly<00:02:24.700> with<00:02:25.920> every<00:02:26.920> vertex<00:02:27.430> edge

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
interact directly with every vertex edge

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.000 
interact directly with every vertex edge
polygon<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:29.020> here<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.230> have<00:02:29.320> vertex<00:02:29.710> edge

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
polygon so here you have vertex edge

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.970 
polygon so here you have vertex edge
border<00:02:30.850> which<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.180> an<00:02:31.270> opening<00:02:31.780> around<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.800> set

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
border which is an opening around a set

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.400 
border which is an opening around a set
of<00:02:33.010> edges<00:02:33.160> around<00:02:33.430> an<00:02:33.640> open<00:02:33.760> polygon<00:02:34.410> polygon

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
of edges around an open polygon polygon

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.890 
of edges around an open polygon polygon
and<00:02:35.620> element<00:02:35.970> elements<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.180> an<00:02:37.390> entire<00:02:37.660> object

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
and element elements is an entire object

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.010 
and element elements is an entire object
or<00:02:38.380> chunk<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.250> mesh<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.390> part<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.810> sub

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.500 
or chunk of mesh that is part of the sub
object<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.520> again<00:02:42.760> we'll<00:02:42.940> select<00:02:43.270> those

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
object so again we'll select those

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.850 
object so again we'll select those
vertices<00:02:43.960> I'm<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.470> go<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.590> soft

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
vertices I'm going to go to soft

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.650 
vertices I'm going to go to soft
selection<00:02:45.370> because<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.820> want<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.000> expand<00:02:46.510> these

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
selection because I want to expand these

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.690 
selection because I want to expand these
and<00:02:47.020> make<00:02:47.140> him<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.590> little<00:02:48.040> bit<00:02:48.280> rounder

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and make him a little bit rounder

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.130 
and make him a little bit rounder
through<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.000> midsection<00:02:49.330> there<00:02:49.630> but<00:02:50.050> in

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
through the midsection there but in

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.050 
through the midsection there but in
order<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.380> do<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:51.130> don't<00:02:51.340> want<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.640> have<00:02:51.850> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
order to do that I don't want to have to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.170 
order to do that I don't want to have to
grab<00:02:52.360> every<00:02:53.080> set<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:53.770> vertices<00:02:54.100> here<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.730> would

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
grab every set of vertices here I would

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.450 
grab every set of vertices here I would
rather<00:02:55.330> be<00:02:55.450> able<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.720> grab<00:02:55.960> a<00:02:56.170> region<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:56.920> then

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
rather be able to grab a region and then

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.180 
rather be able to grab a region and then
as<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.880> scale<00:02:59.010> I'll<00:03:00.010> scale<00:03:00.990> with<00:03:01.990> a<00:03:02.260> decreasing

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
as I scale I'll scale with a decreasing

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.460 
as I scale I'll scale with a decreasing
kind<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.270> ability<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.190> control<00:03:06.190> those<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:07.470> that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
kind of ability to control those so that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.810 
kind of ability to control those so that
looks<00:03:08.650> pretty<00:03:08.800> good<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.250> lot<00:03:09.400> more<00:03:09.580> like

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
looks pretty good it's a lot more like

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.330 
looks pretty good it's a lot more like
that<00:03:09.850> actual<00:03:10.480> shape<00:03:10.720> now<00:03:11.650> as<00:03:11.800> we<00:03:11.920> look<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.160> here

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
that actual shape now as we look in here

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.610 
that actual shape now as we look in here
we<00:03:12.370> see<00:03:12.700> we've<00:03:12.970> got<00:03:13.150> some<00:03:13.510> extra<00:03:14.170> edges<00:03:14.500> in

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
we see we've got some extra edges in

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.590 
we see we've got some extra edges in
spots<00:03:14.860> where<00:03:15.100> we<00:03:15.190> don't<00:03:15.400> really<00:03:15.760> need<00:03:16.150> all<00:03:16.540> of

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
spots where we don't really need all of

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.490 
spots where we don't really need all of
those<00:03:17.350> edges<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:18.970> nice<00:03:19.150> thing<00:03:19.180> in<00:03:19.570> 2012<00:03:20.260> is

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
those edges so one nice thing in 2012 is

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.830 
those edges so one nice thing in 2012 is
within<00:03:21.280> our<00:03:21.459> graphite<00:03:21.880> modeling<00:03:22.239> tools<00:03:22.480> we

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
within our graphite modeling tools we

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.290 
within our graphite modeling tools we
have<00:03:23.020> geometry<00:03:23.560> all<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.610> ability<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.090> hit

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
have geometry all and the ability to hit

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.449 
have geometry all and the ability to hit
quad<00:03:25.600> Rifai<00:03:25.959> all<00:03:26.200> what<00:03:26.860> that's<00:03:27.040> gonna<00:03:27.160> do<00:03:27.430> is

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
quad Rifai all what that's gonna do is

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.460 
quad Rifai all what that's gonna do is
it's<00:03:27.670> gonna<00:03:27.880> look<00:03:28.180> through<00:03:28.360> my<00:03:28.570> mesh<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.050> find

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
it's gonna look through my mesh and find

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.890 
it's gonna look through my mesh and find
any<00:03:29.709> edges<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.400> can<00:03:30.550> delete<00:03:30.910> in<00:03:31.600> order<00:03:31.810> to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
any edges that it can delete in order to

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.960 
any edges that it can delete in order to
make<00:03:32.050> all<00:03:32.230> quads<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.430> can<00:03:33.550> see<00:03:33.730> when<00:03:33.850> it

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
make all quads so you can see when it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.520 
make all quads so you can see when it
deleted<00:03:34.209> those<00:03:34.390> edges<00:03:34.780> there<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.170> now<00:03:35.290> have<00:03:35.500> a

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
deleted those edges there I now have a

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.550 
deleted those edges there I now have a
four-sided<00:03:36.130> polygon<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.630> that's<00:03:37.810> not<00:03:38.020> truly

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
four-sided polygon so that's not truly

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.699 
four-sided polygon so that's not truly
vital<00:03:39.190> in<00:03:39.550> most<00:03:39.880> situations<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.470> nice

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
vital in most situations but it is nice

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.420 
vital in most situations but it is nice
to<00:03:41.739> have<00:03:42.040> all<00:03:42.280> quads<00:03:42.690> all<00:03:43.690> right<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.320> know<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
to have all quads all right so know the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.729 
to have all quads all right so know the
body<00:03:45.700> in<00:03:46.390> my<00:03:46.630> opinion<00:03:46.989> at<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:47.290> point<00:03:47.530> is

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
body in my opinion at this point is

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.949 
body in my opinion at this point is
pretty<00:03:48.430> much<00:03:48.580> done<00:03:48.910> we'll<00:03:49.570> be<00:03:49.600> able<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.840> move

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
pretty much done we'll be able to move

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.990 
pretty much done we'll be able to move
on<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.260> some<00:03:50.380> other<00:03:50.440> objects<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.610> what<00:03:51.760> we<00:03:51.850> can

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
on to some other objects so what we can

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.790 
on to some other objects so what we can
do<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.420> we<00:03:52.570> can<00:03:52.690> start<00:03:52.930> thinking<00:03:53.350> about<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
do is we can start thinking about the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.710 
do is we can start thinking about the
appropriate<00:03:54.580> primitives<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.239> we<00:03:55.360> can<00:03:55.570> use

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
appropriate primitives that we can use

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.050 
appropriate primitives that we can use
for<00:03:55.959> certain<00:03:56.200> parts<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.620> body<00:03:56.739> now<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.700> can

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
for certain parts of the body now I can

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.430 
for certain parts of the body now I can
tell<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.480> elbows<00:03:58.780> here<00:03:59.019> we<00:03:59.170> pretty<00:03:59.350> much

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
tell in the elbows here we pretty much

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.440 
tell in the elbows here we pretty much
have<00:03:59.709> spheres<00:04:00.190> but<00:04:00.730> for<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.940> lot<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.239> things

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
have spheres but for a lot of things

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.630 
have spheres but for a lot of things
with<00:04:01.720> modeling<00:04:02.350> spheres<00:04:02.950> aren't<00:04:03.220> really<00:04:03.459> very

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
with modeling spheres aren't really very

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.120 
with modeling spheres aren't really very
good<00:04:03.910> objects<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.630> I'll<00:04:05.260> show<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.560> why<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.070> if

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
good objects and I'll show you why so if

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.920 
good objects and I'll show you why so if
I<00:04:06.190> go<00:04:06.340> back<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:06.519> my<00:04:06.700> standard<00:04:07.269> primitives<00:04:07.780> and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
I go back to my standard primitives and

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.080 
I go back to my standard primitives and
we<00:04:08.019> just<00:04:08.200> make<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.410> sphere<00:04:08.730> we'll<00:04:09.730> make<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:09.910> in

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
we just make a sphere we'll make it in

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.340 
we just make a sphere we'll make it in
our<00:04:10.180> front<00:04:10.420> viewport<00:04:10.660> we're<00:04:10.990> not<00:04:11.110> gonna<00:04:11.230> end

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
our front viewport we're not gonna end

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.540 
our front viewport we're not gonna end
up<00:04:11.470> keeping<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.860> anyway<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.520> doesn't

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
up keeping it anyway so it doesn't

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.060 
up keeping it anyway so it doesn't
really<00:04:12.790> matter<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.270> its<00:04:13.420> orientation<00:04:14.020> if<00:04:14.950> I

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
really matter of its orientation if I

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.949 
really matter of its orientation if I
look<00:04:15.310> at<00:04:15.430> this

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
look at this

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.170 
look at this
see<00:04:16.410> all<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.680> these<00:04:17.340> edges<00:04:17.579> come<00:04:17.940> into<00:04:18.150> a

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
see all of these edges come into a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.319 
see all of these edges come into a
single<00:04:18.570> vertex<00:04:19.340> generally<00:04:20.340> speaking<00:04:20.639> if<00:04:21.060> I'm

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
single vertex generally speaking if I'm

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.610 
single vertex generally speaking if I'm
never<00:04:21.539> going<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.720> do<00:04:21.870> anything<00:04:21.900> other<00:04:22.440> than

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
never going to do anything other than

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.800 
never going to do anything other than
have<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:23.220> sphere<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.970> really<00:04:24.419> doesn't<00:04:24.720> matter

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
have a sphere it really doesn't matter

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.510 
have a sphere it really doesn't matter
if<00:04:25.350> I'm<00:04:25.530> ever<00:04:25.710> gonna<00:04:25.860> actually<00:04:26.100> want<00:04:26.370> to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
if I'm ever gonna actually want to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.909 
if I'm ever gonna actually want to
interact<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:27.419> modify<00:04:28.020> this<00:04:28.080> object<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.800> any

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
interact and modify this object in any

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.920 
interact and modify this object in any
way<00:04:29.130> having<00:04:29.729> all<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.060> these<00:04:30.180> edges<00:04:30.389> coming<00:04:30.780> to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
way having all of these edges coming to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.950 
way having all of these edges coming to
a<00:04:30.990> single<00:04:31.289> vertex<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:32.210> generally<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> bad<00:04:33.600> kind

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
a single vertex is generally a bad kind

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.110 
a single vertex is generally a bad kind
of<00:04:34.110> modeling<00:04:34.650> method<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.639> we're<00:04:35.820> gonna<00:04:35.910> throw

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
of modeling method so we're gonna throw

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.600 
of modeling method so we're gonna throw
that<00:04:36.210> away<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.600> we're<00:04:36.720> gonna<00:04:36.840> make<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.050> box

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
that away and we're gonna make a box

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.689 
that away and we're gonna make a box
so<00:04:38.610> I'm<00:04:38.669> gonna<00:04:38.789> make<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:38.940> box<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:40.050> fits<00:04:40.699> pretty

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
so I'm gonna make a box that fits pretty

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.020 
so I'm gonna make a box that fits pretty
closely<00:04:42.330> with<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.990> sphere<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:44.669> we're<00:04:44.940> gonna

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
closely with that sphere so we're gonna

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.219 
closely with that sphere so we're gonna
go<00:04:45.210> back<00:04:45.389> here<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:45.720> we're<00:04:45.810> gonna<00:04:45.870> make<00:04:46.080> it

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
go back here and we're gonna make it

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.140 
go back here and we're gonna make it
eight<00:04:46.440> inches<00:04:47.330> by<00:04:48.330> eight<00:04:48.630> by<00:04:49.080> eight<00:04:50.000> all<00:04:51.000> right

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
eight inches by eight by eight all right

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.909 
eight inches by eight by eight all right
so<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.330> have<00:04:51.389> a<00:04:51.479> nice<00:04:51.599> perfect<00:04:51.960> cube<00:04:52.139> we're

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
so I have a nice perfect cube we're

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.129 
so I have a nice perfect cube we're
gonna<00:04:53.039> add<00:04:53.250> let's<00:04:54.180> make<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.360> four<00:04:54.720> around<00:04:54.900> each

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
gonna add let's make it four around each

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:55.550 
gonna add let's make it four around each
side

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
side

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.710 
side
all<00:04:55.740> right<00:04:55.919> so<00:04:56.130> four<00:04:56.610> by<00:04:56.759> four<00:04:57.000> by<00:04:57.030> four<00:04:57.479> box

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
all right so four by four by four box

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.629 
all right so four by four by four box
that<00:04:58.380> is<00:04:58.530> eight<00:04:58.740> inches<00:04:58.949> by<00:04:59.039> 10<00:04:59.250> inches<00:04:59.310> by

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
that is eight inches by 10 inches by

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.230 
that is eight inches by 10 inches by
eight<00:04:59.729> inches

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
eight inches

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.810 
eight inches
now<00:05:00.930> I'm<00:05:01.320> gonna<00:05:01.470> add<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.650> modifier<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.400> this<00:05:02.520> box

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
now I'm gonna add a modifier to this box

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.010 
now I'm gonna add a modifier to this box
called<00:05:03.389> you<00:05:04.349> guessed<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.889> Spira<00:05:05.520> Phi<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.900> I'm

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
called you guessed it Spira Phi so I'm

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.600 
called you guessed it Spira Phi so I'm
the<00:05:07.199> sphere<00:05:07.470> if<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.620> modifier<00:05:08.130> is<00:05:08.280> gonna<00:05:08.430> make

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
the sphere if I modifier is gonna make

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.570 
the sphere if I modifier is gonna make
that<00:05:08.789> box<00:05:09.090> into<00:05:09.599> a<00:05:09.630> perfect<00:05:10.110> sphere<00:05:10.380> right<00:05:11.340> now

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
that box into a perfect sphere right now

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.520 
that box into a perfect sphere right now
if<00:05:12.120> we<00:05:12.389> look<00:05:12.570> at<00:05:12.720> that<00:05:12.930> compared<00:05:13.349> to<00:05:13.380> that

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
if we look at that compared to that

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.900 
if we look at that compared to that
original<00:05:13.740> sphere<00:05:14.160> there<00:05:14.669> are<00:05:14.849> no<00:05:15.590> crazy

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
original sphere there are no crazy

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.640 
original sphere there are no crazy
triangulated<00:05:17.910> faces<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:18.840> we<00:05:18.900> get<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.110> real<00:05:19.380> nice

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
triangulated faces so we get a real nice

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.870 
triangulated faces so we get a real nice
simple<00:05:20.099> object<00:05:20.520> here

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
simple object here

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.820 
simple object here
now<00:05:21.419> if<00:05:21.539> I<00:05:21.599> go<00:05:21.690> back<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.870> box<00:05:22.139> we<00:05:22.380> can<00:05:22.500> up<00:05:22.650> those

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
now if I go back to box we can up those

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.820 
now if I go back to box we can up those
segments<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.280> little<00:05:23.490> bit<00:05:23.610> more<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:25.470> get<00:05:25.590> an

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
segments a little bit more to get an

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.159 
segments a little bit more to get an
even<00:05:26.250> smoother<00:05:26.729> sphere<00:05:27.000> all<00:05:27.780> right<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:28.020> that

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
even smoother sphere all right so that

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.899 
even smoother sphere all right so that
ought<00:05:28.289> to<00:05:28.320> work<00:05:28.409> pretty<00:05:28.740> well<00:05:28.830> now<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.370> can<00:05:29.699> see

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
ought to work pretty well now I can see

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.790 
ought to work pretty well now I can see
though<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.360> it<00:05:30.599> can<00:05:30.780> be<00:05:30.990> a<00:05:31.199> little<00:05:31.500> bit

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
though that it can be a little bit

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.610 
though that it can be a little bit
bigger<00:05:32.099> so<00:05:32.430> we'll<00:05:33.210> make<00:05:33.389> it<00:05:33.419> ten<00:05:34.550> by<00:05:35.550> ten<00:05:36.620> by

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
bigger so we'll make it ten by ten by

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.340 
bigger so we'll make it ten by ten by
ten

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
ten

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.200 
ten
and<00:05:39.500> that's<00:05:39.920> pretty<00:05:40.160> good<00:05:40.430> it<00:05:40.700> encompasses

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
and that's pretty good it encompasses

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.450 
and that's pretty good it encompasses
that<00:05:41.720> geometry<00:05:42.290> that's<00:05:42.890> a<00:05:42.980> little<00:05:43.190> too<00:05:43.280> big

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
that geometry that's a little too big

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.080 
that geometry that's a little too big
actually<00:05:43.700> so<00:05:44.060> let's<00:05:44.240> go<00:05:44.360> nine<00:05:44.600> by<00:05:44.780> nine

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.659 

so<00:05:47.750> in<00:05:48.080> this<00:05:48.350> phase<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.800> modeling<00:05:49.220> all<00:05:49.430> we're

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
so in this phase of modeling all we're

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.390 
so in this phase of modeling all we're
really<00:05:49.700> trying<00:05:50.300> to<00:05:50.360> do<00:05:50.510> is<00:05:50.750> just<00:05:51.100> start<00:05:52.100> with

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
really trying to do is just start with

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.879 
really trying to do is just start with
some<00:05:52.610> pretty<00:05:52.880> basic<00:05:53.180> primitives<00:05:53.900> and<00:05:54.110> figure

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
some pretty basic primitives and figure

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.070 
some pretty basic primitives and figure
out<00:05:55.040> exactly<00:05:55.190> which<00:05:56.180> primitives<00:05:56.690> we<00:05:56.810> want<00:05:56.990> to

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
out exactly which primitives we want to

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.409 
out exactly which primitives we want to
use<00:05:57.200> in<00:05:57.410> which<00:05:57.620> areas<00:05:58.160> of<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.400> mesh<00:05:58.610> so<00:05:59.330> I'll

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
use in which areas of the mesh so I'll

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.350 
use in which areas of the mesh so I'll
start<00:05:59.690> here<00:05:59.840> with<00:05:59.990> some<00:06:00.139> cylinders<00:06:00.650> and<00:06:01.360> again

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
start here with some cylinders and again

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.420 
start here with some cylinders and again
cylinders<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:03.020> spheres<00:06:03.080> so<00:06:04.070> we'll<00:06:04.310> be<00:06:04.400> able

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
cylinders and spheres so we'll be able

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.190 
cylinders and spheres so we'll be able
to<00:06:04.610> get<00:06:04.730> some<00:06:05.000> basic<00:06:05.240> modeling<00:06:05.780> done<00:06:05.960> with

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
to get some basic modeling done with

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.240 
to get some basic modeling done with
just<00:06:06.530> some<00:06:06.710> really<00:06:07.010> pretty<00:06:07.340> simple<00:06:07.639> objects
