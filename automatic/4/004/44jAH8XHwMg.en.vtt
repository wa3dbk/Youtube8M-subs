 historical paintings of the scene of this kind 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.420
 belonged to the lowest Dutch category 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.659
 genre painting 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.369

 becoming more strict public 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:14.230
 morality caused chewing compensate 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.420
 repressed notions and desires this 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.700
 the plot essentially refers to 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.610
 the wild life of the prodigal son from the parable 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.459

 paintings that were not only 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.650
 reality replay is always 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.170
 revealed to us sense contained appeals for 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.110
 moral standards and value 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.660
 Vermeer talked about the problem of control 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.030
 over sensuality alcoholic motive 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.000
 intoxication more precisely enjoying wine 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.580
 is central to the composition on 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.610
 carpeted table located 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.069
 parallel to the plane of the picture and similarly 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.329
 barrier separating the viewer from 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.599
 actors 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.940
 worth a jug of wine a young woman in

 another glass of dark bourbon 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.000
 huller's clothes with a lute are considered 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.970
 that under the guise of the prodigal son Vermeer 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.760
 portrayed herself a girl cheek who 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.209
 flushed with drunk wine 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.000
 stretch a hand 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.310

 but the scene is not in a brothel on this 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.030
 indicate bobbins abandoned on the carpet 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.100
 on the left, this detail allows us to conclude 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.530
 that the action takes place in the usual 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.470
 house in this case we are talking about 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.859
 Adultera which contribute to wearing 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.319
 black old woman today is considered to be 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.410
 writing this picture influenced the canvas 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.690
 Today Dirk van Buren who was in 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.500
 collections maria teenz and in the picture 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.930
 vermeer 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.620
 four figures are shown vertical

 Baburin at 3 in the horizontal format 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.440
 almost exactly and imitation barbionov 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.859
 gesture to which the soldier transmits girls 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.859
 a coin 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.160
 unlike many other works 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.940
 for example, canvases 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.920
 soldiers courtesan France you peace with a 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.440
 get new colorful details and 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.380
 characteristic hints 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.140
 for example copulating dogs picture 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.600
 Vermeer representing the scene with close 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.980
 the point of view conceived ladies more restrained 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.440
 and semantically more openly priestess 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.710
 Vermeer is dominated by two bright color 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.500
 spots red camisole soldiers and yellow 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.710
 blouse girls they are clearly distinguishable in 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.350
 candlelight like lighting is no longer 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.910
 repeat in his paintings 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.730
 the artist has not yet reached mastery 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.250
 composition break up into pieces figure 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.560
 left seems isolated lighting 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.870
 uneven table on which stands a jug 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.290
 strangely goes into balustrade on 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.270
 which threw a 24-year-old carpet 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.790
 the artist began to experiment with 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.110
 new direction in which he still 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.110
 to be improved
