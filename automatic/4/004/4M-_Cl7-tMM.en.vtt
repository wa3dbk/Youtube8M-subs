 discussed a possible ceasefire agreement between 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.260
 Chelsea and harder if a limited stay that solves those thoughts were 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.789
 but quickly disassembled 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.789
 the chance to be in the half minute 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.070
 Lahr BZ 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.829

 around 70 cents European Cup game 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.909
 otherwise more likely to destroy who cyclists conquerors in the defensive midfield 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.109
 flew in front of the runway on Tor Ianu 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 then there you go 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.410
 Chelsea made the promises words or played 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.570
 on 70 points 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.860

 one of three world champions owned by Chelsea Mitsubishi Opel 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.990
 played 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.990
 here, however, only the last half hour 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.410
 the Berlin with the first attempts 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.360
 I hold 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.360
 then the team forward again Gianluca Rocchi 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.440

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.440

 Peter Cissek minute second goal for Chelsea 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.310
 Coronation 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.830
 Wallace it would be 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.250
 and the Brocks 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.030
 too, but he does not seem to protect Quota's working poor frequently 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 from the scoreboard 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.170
 the Spaniard wants to shell with 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.590
 is enough for joy 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.899
 Artwork veiled 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.879
 two days without Ohnemus 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.879
 Germany's Guttenberg wanted to force the turnaround 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.729
 Sebastian Geisler 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.509
 what's missing are the famous centimeters 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.179
 the Berlin gradually better into play 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:31.779
 Combinations gears 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.979
 Ali Daei 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.979
 the shows but stable than 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.729
 By the way, it should not be that and it says that 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.559
 moreover, the second yellow card is said for 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.129
 as a solution closer 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.129
 but that did not hurt Chelsea any more 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.639
 also the citizens of Berlin could cope with the situation but are still further than 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.359
 second behind the Londoners 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.499
 who wants to profit as the second force behind United 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:06.139
 Be July 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.629
 we want to show how good we really are I think the fact that we are in 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.769
 are the second round and Arsenal London does not speak for itself Â» 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.769
 Duck family it is a sign of our progress 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.809
 the chance picture approx 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.469
 a Frenchman and a Spaniard are guessing this time 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.009
 Jonas Hiller and Abba 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.449
 and since praise I received this perfect pass from Dennis, we know that 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.749
 not only wonderful control of the ball and have made him 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:33.089
 it was not the easiest goal of my career but his players kicked 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.819
 that was already very nice for me no means goods are waiting for you 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.799

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.929
 Months will be more expensive at 5 8 percent

 Hirvonen 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.859
 Girls are a great evening for me but also for the players 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.489
 and that leaves the club altogether we are through with and we are 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.729
 first group 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.259
 the first participation Champions League is that not so bad connect 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.389
 in Pentonville turning in Winnenden 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.819
 because at the same time Galatasaray Ralf Kunze be satisfied on the policy 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.569
 who it is in his confession to finally get on with this is 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:20.200
 class 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.599
