00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hello my name is Mary Miller from math

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.289 
hello my name is Mary Miller from math
math<00:00:03.929> calm<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.400> video<00:00:05.730> we'll<00:00:05.940> talk<00:00:06.240> about

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
math calm in this video we'll talk about

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.100 
math calm in this video we'll talk about
comparing<00:00:07.170> decimals<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.809> I<00:00:09.809> wrote<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
comparing decimals and I wrote a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.740 
comparing decimals and I wrote a
question<00:00:10.590> which<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.980> more<00:00:11.420> these<00:00:12.420> are

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
question which is more these are

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.169 
question which is more these are
accessible<00:00:13.410> if<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.610> many<00:00:14.849> people

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
accessible if we really like many people

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.019 
accessible if we really like many people
written<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.599> would<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:16.369> 0.04<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:18.500> 0.0<00:00:19.500> 16<00:00:20.189> which

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
written it would be 0.04 or 0.0 16 which

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.179 
written it would be 0.04 or 0.0 16 which
is<00:00:21.180> more<00:00:22.070> 0.27<00:00:23.070> or<00:00:23.689> 0.3<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.990> chose<00:00:25.920> these

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
is more 0.27 or 0.3 I chose these

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.580 
is more 0.27 or 0.3 I chose these
because<00:00:26.250> many<00:00:27.180> children<00:00:27.449> if<00:00:28.199> they<00:00:28.410> have

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
because many children if they have

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.710 
because many children if they have
misconception<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.460> decimals<00:00:29.970> they<00:00:30.539> might

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
misconception of decimals they might

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.130 
misconception of decimals they might
look<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.260> 10<00:00:32.390> digits<00:00:33.390> after<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.840> point

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
look at this 10 digits after the point

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.920 
look at this 10 digits after the point
and<00:00:34.530> really<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.250> okay<00:00:35.460> 27<00:00:36.300> something<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and really that's okay 27 something and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.319 
and really that's okay 27 something and
3<00:00:37.500> something<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.610> might<00:00:38.730> think<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.300> as

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
3 something they might think of these as

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
3 something they might think of these as
numbers<00:00:39.960> stood<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> other<00:00:40.980> side<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
numbers stood on the other side of the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.060 
numbers stood on the other side of the
decimal<00:00:41.850> point<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.570> said<00:00:42.780> okay<00:00:43.079> 27<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.829> more

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
decimal point and said okay 27 is more

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.430 
decimal point and said okay 27 is more
than<00:00:44.190> 3<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:45.090> must<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> them

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
than 3 so this must be one of them

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.639 
than 3 so this must be one of them
oh<00:00:46.489> yeah<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.660> 16<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> 16

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
oh yeah I think what was for 16 and 16

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.650 
oh yeah I think what was for 16 and 16
is<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.390> cost

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
is more so that's what is cost

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.950 
is more so that's what is cost
conception<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.770> teachers<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
conception that we teachers have to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.529 
conception that we teachers have to
baffle<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.309> explain<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.940> some<00:00:57.510> way

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
baffle and explain to them in some way

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.160 
baffle and explain to them in some way
so<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:58.050> don't<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.699> misconception<00:00:59.699> I

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
so they don't get it misconception I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.729 
so they don't get it misconception I
want<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> use<00:01:01.440> place<00:01:01.920> value<00:01:02.399> chart<00:01:03.110> here<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
want to use place value chart here is a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.700 
want to use place value chart here is a
place<00:01:05.100> value<00:01:05.430> chart<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.360> hundreds<00:01:07.320> place

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
place value chart this is hundreds place

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.820 
place value chart this is hundreds place
change<00:01:08.280> place<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:09.060> split<00:01:09.470> tenths<00:01:10.470> place

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
change place one split tenths place

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.880 
change place one split tenths place
hundreds<00:01:11.820> place<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.720> thousands<00:01:13.350> place

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
hundreds place and then thousands place

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940 
hundreds place and then thousands place
I<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> number<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:15.930> these<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.740> whole

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
I go to number it here these are whole

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.910 
I go to number it here these are whole
numbers<00:01:17.930> 462<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.670> 468<00:01:21.049> now<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> compare<00:01:22.650> them

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
numbers 462 and 468 now to compare them

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.060 
numbers 462 and 468 now to compare them
we<00:01:23.759> look<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> biggest<00:01:25.110> place<00:01:25.409> value<00:01:25.830> in

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
we look at the biggest place value in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
we look at the biggest place value in
here<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> hundreds<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.750> they

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
here we will go to hundreds and they

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.370 
here we will go to hundreds and they
both<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.670> 400<00:01:29.670> these<00:01:30.570> men<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:30.990> both<00:01:31.200> have

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
both have 400 these men will both have

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.060 
both have 400 these men will both have
six<00:01:31.710> tens<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:34.200> come<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> ones

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
six tens and then we come to the ones

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.670 
six tens and then we come to the ones
this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.229> therefore<00:01:37.439> this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
this is to this is it so therefore this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.770 
this is to this is it so therefore this
is<00:01:37.740> smaller<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.490> eight<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.450> more

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
is smaller because eight one is more

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.149 
is smaller because eight one is more
than<00:01:39.869> two<00:01:40.619> one

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
than two one

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.550 
than two one
the<00:01:41.640> same<00:01:41.880> principle<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.570> used<00:01:42.869> when

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the same principle is used when

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
the same principle is used when
comparing<00:01:43.979> decimals<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.990> gonna<00:01:46.229> write

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
comparing decimals and I'm gonna write

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.990 
comparing decimals and I'm gonna write
these<00:01:46.560> two<00:01:46.740> decimals<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.700> place

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
these two decimals here in this place

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.569 
these two decimals here in this place
value<00:01:48.390> chart<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.990> mind<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.979> small<00:01:50.040> point<00:01:50.399> reading

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
value chart I mind a small point reading

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.660 
value chart I mind a small point reading
here<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.149> after<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.600> ones<00:01:51.960> place<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.710> zero

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
here right after the ones place so zero

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
here right after the ones place so zero
one<00:01:53.700> zero<00:01:53.939> four<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:56.390> 0.04<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.200> four

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
one zero four is 0.04 it is four

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.929 
one zero four is 0.04 it is four
hundredths

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
hundredths

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.780 
hundredths
but<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> other<00:02:00.750> number<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:02.840> like<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.110> now

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
but the other number is like this now

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.350 
but the other number is like this now
when<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.939> compare<00:02:06.500> starting<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.680> isn't

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
when we compare starting with isn't

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.720 
when we compare starting with isn't
going<00:02:09.360> over<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> right<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:11.250> see<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.550> they

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
going over to the right we see that they

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.640 
going over to the right we see that they
have<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> same<00:02:12.150> amount

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
have the same amount

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.789 
have the same amount
hundreds<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.310> another<00:02:13.730> things<00:02:14.030> none<00:02:14.480> same<00:02:15.230> 101

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
hundreds in another things none same 101

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.360

that is each part here each interval
here<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.139> 100<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:11.180> therefore<00:03:11.599> this<00:03:11.750> year<00:03:12.970> to

here is 100 so therefore this year to
tenancies<00:03:15.109> also<00:03:16.120> 20<00:03:17.120> hundreds<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.049> then<00:03:18.410> this

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
tenancies also 20 hundreds and then this

tenancies also 20 hundreds and then this
next<00:03:18.919> one<00:03:19.099> is<00:03:19.129> one<00:03:19.280> hundred<00:03:19.879> more<00:03:20.120> or<00:03:21.220> 0.21

next one is one hundred more or 0.21
2100<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.709> here's<00:03:25.239> 22<00:03:26.239> hundreds<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.079> then

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
2100 and here's 22 hundreds and then

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.539 
2100 and here's 22 hundreds and then

here at 6 tenths and 600 0.6 goes like
this<00:04:00.799> on<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.639> top<00:04:01.879> and<00:04:02.150> then<00:04:02.379> 0.06<00:04:03.379> goes<00:04:03.709> like

this on the top and then 0.06 goes like

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
this to the top now you're the ones they

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.759 
this to the top now you're the ones they
have<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.489> say<00:04:07.669> my<00:04:07.849> mother<00:04:08.000> once<00:04:08.419> say<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.530> they

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
have to say my mother once say and they

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.439 
have to say my mother once say and they

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
don't know the same amount of tens this

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.930 
don't know the same amount of tens this
one<00:04:11.629> has<00:04:11.780> six<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.799> one<00:04:12.949> is<00:04:13.099> none<00:04:13.310> so

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
one has six this one is none so

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.159 
one has six this one is none so
therefore<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:14.329> is<00:04:14.389> bigger

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.360

amount<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.639> thousands<00:04:47.120> they<00:04:47.719> are<00:04:47.780> non<00:04:48.530> zero

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
amount of thousands they are non zero

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.070 
amount of thousands they are non zero
zero<00:04:49.340> when<00:04:50.180> it's<00:04:50.300> empty<00:04:50.569> it's<00:04:50.840> not<00:04:51.110> oh<00:04:51.439> they're

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
zero when it's empty it's not oh they're

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.270 
zero when it's empty it's not oh they're
here<00:04:54.080> all<00:04:54.409> right

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
here all right

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.899 
here all right
five<00:04:55.490> point<00:04:56.090> zero<00:04:56.210> zero<00:04:56.750> one<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.500> five<00:04:57.909> point

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
five point zero zero one and five point

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.409 
five point zero zero one and five point
zero<00:04:59.120> one<00:04:59.719> a<00:05:00.580> child<00:05:01.580> with<00:05:01.789> a<00:05:01.819> misconception

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
zero one a child with a misconception

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.629 
zero one a child with a misconception
again<00:05:02.840> I<00:05:03.020> think<00:05:03.080> these<00:05:03.379> are<00:05:03.530> equal<00:05:03.919> because<00:05:04.370> it

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
again I think these are equal because it

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.899 
again I think these are equal because it
looks<00:05:04.759> like<00:05:04.940> one<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.449> one<00:05:06.340> but<00:05:07.340> using<00:05:07.819> the

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
looks like one and one but using the

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.959 
looks like one and one but using the
place<00:05:08.120> value<00:05:08.389> chart<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.719> clearly<00:05:08.990> see<00:05:09.319> that

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
place value chart to clearly see that

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.240 
place value chart to clearly see that
here<00:05:10.969> this<00:05:11.900> number<00:05:12.110> is<00:05:12.379> bigger<00:05:12.650> because<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.129> is

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
here this number is bigger because it is

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.300 
here this number is bigger because it is
100<00:05:14.000> less<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.509> one<00:05:14.719> is<00:05:14.930> now<00:05:17.050> lastly<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.379> had

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
100 less this one is now lastly I had

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.559 
100 less this one is now lastly I had
six<00:05:19.729> point<00:05:20.270> sixty<00:05:21.080> five<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:22.129> then<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.330> other

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
six point sixty five and then this other

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.610 
six point sixty five and then this other
one<00:05:23.689> six<00:05:24.139> point<00:05:24.560> six<00:05:25.069> zero<00:05:25.870> five<00:05:26.870> which<00:05:27.289> one<00:05:27.500> is

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
one six point six zero five which one is

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.159 
one six point six zero five which one is
more<00:05:27.889> than<00:05:28.729> 700<00:05:29.569> ones

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
more than 700 ones

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.580 
more than 700 ones
seven<00:05:30.949> out<00:05:31.099> of<00:05:31.129> ten<00:05:31.930> but<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.229> one<00:05:33.409> has

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
seven out of ten but this one has

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.330 
seven out of ten but this one has
hundreds<00:05:34.250> sometimes<00:05:34.789> not<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:36.650> six<00:05:37.129> point
