00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
more dramatic when you think about what

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.679

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
a heart attack is which is actually lack

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
a heart attack is which is actually lack
of<00:01:30.990> oxygen<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.829> heart<00:01:31.950> muscle<00:01:32.270> that's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
of oxygen to the heart muscle that's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
of oxygen to the heart muscle that's
when<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> get<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.869> symptoms<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.860> it's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
when you get the symptoms so it's

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.789 
when you get the symptoms so it's
happening<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.700> exertion<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:37.380> really

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
happening with exertion or with really

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.890 
happening with exertion or with really
exercising<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.479> relieved

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
exercising and then if it's relieved

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.920 
exercising and then if it's relieved
with<00:01:40.170> rest<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:41.220> about<00:01:41.460> your<00:01:41.610> heart<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:42.150> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
with rest think about your heart if you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660 
with rest think about your heart if you
have<00:01:43.110> indigestion<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.130> take<00:01:44.399> something

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
have indigestion and you take something

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
have indigestion and you take something
for<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.030> stomach<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.600> goes<00:01:45.750> away<00:01:46.049> it's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
for your stomach and it goes away it's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
for your stomach and it goes away it's
probably<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.399> heart<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.420> pain

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
probably not your heart if you have pain

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.350 
probably not your heart if you have pain
and<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:49.610> anti-inflammatory<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.240> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and you take an anti-inflammatory and it

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
and you take an anti-inflammatory and it
goes<00:01:51.540> away<00:01:51.720> again<00:01:52.110> probably<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.130> heart

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
goes away again probably not your heart

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.660 
goes away again probably not your heart
but<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> symptoms<00:01:54.600> come<00:01:54.990> back<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:56.130> really

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
but if the symptoms come back you really

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
but if the symptoms come back you really
should<00:01:56.880> not<00:01:57.030> dismiss<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.899> think<00:01:58.229> hard

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
should not dismiss it and think hard

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.819 
should not dismiss it and think hard
first<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.280> better<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.240> wrong<00:02:00.649> than<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
first it is better to be wrong than to

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.190 
first it is better to be wrong than to
be<00:02:01.950> sorry<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.049> there's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
be sorry so I know that there's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.719 
be sorry so I know that there's
sometimes<00:02:04.560> confusion<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.369> difference

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
sometimes confusion the difference

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.800 
sometimes confusion the difference
between<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> heart<00:02:06.509> attack

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
between a heart attack

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.109 
between a heart attack
and<00:02:07.049> cardiac<00:02:07.590> arrest<00:02:07.920> could<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.670> explain<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
and cardiac arrest could you explain the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.140 
and cardiac arrest could you explain the
difference<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.660> us<00:02:09.750> cardiac<00:02:10.709> arrest<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.430> truly

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
difference to us cardiac arrest is truly

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.190 
difference to us cardiac arrest is truly
sudden<00:02:12.599> death

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
sudden death

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.170 
sudden death
and<00:02:13.290> there's<00:02:13.800> nothing<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:14.849> about<00:02:14.970> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
and there's nothing we can do about it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.509 
and there's nothing we can do about it
when<00:02:16.020> someone<00:02:16.410> has<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> heart<00:02:16.920> attack<00:02:17.099> it's

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
when someone has a heart attack it's

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.729 
when someone has a heart attack it's
damage<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> heart<00:02:18.780> muscle<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:19.709> can

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
damage to the heart muscle we can

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.699 
damage to the heart muscle we can
intervene<00:02:20.489> we<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.970> open<00:02:21.420> blood<00:02:21.870> flow<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.530> that

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
intervene we can open blood flow of that

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.890 
intervene we can open blood flow of that
artery<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> muscle<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.660> actually

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
artery to the muscle and we can actually

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.589 
artery to the muscle and we can actually
prevent<00:02:25.590> people<00:02:25.980> from<00:02:26.370> having<00:02:26.730> heart<00:02:27.300> damage

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
prevent people from having heart damage

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.650 
prevent people from having heart damage
so<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.800> very<00:02:29.220> important<00:02:29.760> distinction<00:02:30.120> one

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
so it's a very important distinction one

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.259 
so it's a very important distinction one
there<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.050> nothing<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.160> about<00:02:32.310> unless

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
there is nothing we can do about unless

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.570 
there is nothing we can do about unless
maybe<00:02:33.569> if<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.900> witnessed<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.709> we<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.459> do

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
maybe if it's witnessed and we can do

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.000 
maybe if it's witnessed and we can do
CPR<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:36.959> people<00:02:37.140> having<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.709> heart<00:02:37.920> attack

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
CPR but for people having a heart attack

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.309 
CPR but for people having a heart attack
it's<00:02:38.550> about<00:02:38.790> intervention<00:02:39.239> getting<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
it's about intervention getting to the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.350 
it's about intervention getting to the
doctor<00:02:40.530> getting<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> hospital<00:02:41.880> as<00:02:42.299> soon

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
doctor getting to the hospital as soon

doctor getting to the hospital as soon
as<00:02:42.959> possible<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.239> bottom<00:02:51.599> line<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.780> heart

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
as possible so the bottom line on heart

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.080 
as possible so the bottom line on heart
attack<00:02:52.349> symptoms<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.610> they<00:02:53.760> often

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
attack symptoms is that they often

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.850 
attack symptoms is that they often
disguise<00:02:54.420> themselves<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:55.079> other<00:02:55.290> ailments
