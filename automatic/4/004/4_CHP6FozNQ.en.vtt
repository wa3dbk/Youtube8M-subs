00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
do is just hold it upside down like this

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.569 
do is just hold it upside down like this
and<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:55.259> put<00:01:55.470> my<00:01:55.560> hair<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.920> between<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.399> two

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and then put my hair in between the two

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.270 
and then put my hair in between the two
and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.719> I'm<00:01:57.869> gonna<00:01:58.049> first<00:01:58.380> go<00:01:58.619> back<00:01:58.829> with<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and then I'm gonna first go back with it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.170 
and then I'm gonna first go back with it
and<00:01:59.960> then<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:00.990> front<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> front

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and then go front or to the front

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.740 
and then go front or to the front
whatever<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:05.030> I'm<00:02:06.030> gonna<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> little

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
whatever and I'm gonna go a little

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.210 
whatever and I'm gonna go a little
slower<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.439> piece<00:02:07.649> even<00:02:07.920> though<00:02:08.099> you

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
slower on this piece even though you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.190 
slower on this piece even though you
really<00:02:08.250> don't<00:02:08.610> want<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.940> go<00:02:09.149> slow<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.509> want<00:02:09.899> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
really don't want to go slow you want to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.670 
really don't want to go slow you want to
fast<00:02:10.700> because<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:12.120> thing<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.629> hotter<00:02:13.530> than

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
fast because this thing is hotter than

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.500 
fast because this thing is hotter than
any<00:02:14.129> curling<00:02:14.580> iron<00:02:14.730> or<00:02:14.849> any<00:02:15.060> straightener

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
any curling iron or any straightener

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.550 
any curling iron or any straightener
that<00:02:15.690> I've<00:02:15.780> ever<00:02:15.930> used<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
that I've ever used so and this is a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.610 
that I've ever used so and this is a
little<00:02:19.920> come<00:02:20.040> out<00:02:20.160> light<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:21.750> similar<00:02:22.140> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
little come out light it's similar to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.040 
little come out light it's similar to
like<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> mixture<00:02:24.060> between<00:02:24.269> a<00:02:24.510> curling<00:02:24.900> iron

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
like a mixture between a curling iron

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.770 
like a mixture between a curling iron
and<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.410> three<00:02:25.620> barrel<00:02:25.860> curling<00:02:26.069> air<00:02:26.540> I'll<00:02:27.540> take

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and a three barrel curling air I'll take

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.930 
and a three barrel curling air I'll take
this<00:02:28.050> piece<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.880> show<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.940> guys<00:02:30.180> again<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:34.940> put

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
this piece and show you guys again I put

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.530 
this piece and show you guys again I put
it<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.180> between<00:02:37.220> back<00:02:38.220> put<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.299> between

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it in between back put it in between

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.000 
it in between back put it in between
again<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.250> front<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:43.019> just<00:02:43.080> continue

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
again to the front and just continue

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.500 
again to the front and just continue
that<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.430> figure<00:02:44.760> 8<00:02:44.910> motion<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:50.360> then<00:02:51.360> I'll

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
that in a figure 8 motion and then I'll

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.250 
that in a figure 8 motion and then I'll
just<00:02:51.660> pull<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.989> out<00:02:52.110> like<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:54.360> there<00:02:55.230> you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
just pull it out like that and there you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.550 
just pull it out like that and there you
have<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.680> curl<00:02:56.420> or<00:02:57.420> wave<00:02:57.480> whatever<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.410> want

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
have the curl or wave whatever you want

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.740 
have the curl or wave whatever you want
to<00:02:58.620> call<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.970> want<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.299> use<00:03:00.329> small

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
to call it you want to use small

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.210 
to call it you want to use small
sections<00:03:01.230> because<00:03:01.500> when<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.799> use<00:03:02.010> big

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
sections because when you use big

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.640 
sections because when you use big
sections<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:03.510> doesn't<00:03:04.079> come<00:03:04.200> out<00:03:04.349> looking

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
sections it doesn't come out looking

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.199 
sections it doesn't come out looking
right<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:05.040> looks<00:03:05.220> kind<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:07.370> sloppy<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.970> don't

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
right it looks kind of sloppy I don't

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.550 
right it looks kind of sloppy I don't
know<00:03:09.299> how<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.510> really<00:03:09.780> describe<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:15.560> again

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
know how to really describe it so again

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:26.130 
know how to really describe it so again
I'll<00:03:16.889> just<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.459> figure<00:03:17.819> 8

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.730 

and<00:03:26.800> pull<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.280> out<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:29.260> like<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.410> perfect

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
and pull it out it's like a perfect

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.460 
and pull it out it's like a perfect
zigzag<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:31.980> when<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.070> comes<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.580> bangs<00:03:33.820> I

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
zigzag and when it comes to the bangs I

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.140 
zigzag and when it comes to the bangs I
don't<00:03:35.470> want<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.710> do<00:03:35.830> them<00:03:35.980> in<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.130> same<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.820> I'm

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
don't want to do them in the same so I'm

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.970 
don't want to do them in the same so I'm
gonna<00:03:37.420> kind<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.810> wrap<00:03:38.020> it<00:03:38.050> around<00:03:38.410> like<00:03:38.920> that

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
gonna kind of wrap it around like that

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.570 
gonna kind of wrap it around like that
so<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.850> goes<00:03:39.940> under<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.440> then<00:03:42.370> I'm<00:03:42.490> gonna

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
so that it goes under and then I'm gonna

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.290 
so that it goes under and then I'm gonna
take<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.880> bigger<00:03:43.240> iron<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.910> I'm<00:03:45.910> just<00:03:46.120> kind

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
take the bigger iron and I'm just kind

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.640 
take the bigger iron and I'm just kind
of<00:03:46.330> gonna<00:03:46.510> wrap<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.960> around<00:03:47.190> backwards<00:03:52.650> so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
of gonna wrap it around backwards so

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.710 
of gonna wrap it around backwards so
then<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.010> bangs<00:03:54.220> point<00:03:54.970> away<00:03:55.209> from<00:03:55.450> my<00:03:55.570> face

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
then the bangs point away from my face

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.870 
then the bangs point away from my face
so<00:03:56.140> for<00:03:56.530> every<00:03:56.740> person<00:03:57.100> there's<00:03:57.310> gonna<00:03:57.490> be<00:03:57.700> one

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
so for every person there's gonna be one

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.480 
so for every person there's gonna be one
side<00:03:58.180> that's<00:03:58.480> like<00:03:58.630> harder<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.770> style<00:04:00.130> than

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
side that's like harder to style than

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.090 
side that's like harder to style than
another<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:02.290> is<00:04:02.530> my<00:04:02.770> harder<00:04:03.310> side<00:04:03.610> I

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
another and this is my harder side I

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.960 
another and this is my harder side I
think<00:04:06.100> it's<00:04:06.220> just<00:04:06.310> because<00:04:06.489> I'm<00:04:06.700> right-handed

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
think it's just because I'm right-handed

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.420 
think it's just because I'm right-handed
so<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.780> probably<00:04:08.260> like<00:04:08.380> reach<00:04:08.650> over<00:04:08.980> here<00:04:09.010> I

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
so I probably like reach over here I

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.740 
so I probably like reach over here I
don't<00:04:10.060> know<00:04:11.340> it's<00:04:12.340> it's<00:04:13.239> like<00:04:13.420> just<00:04:13.630> an

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
don't know it's it's like just an

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.289 
don't know it's it's like just an
awkward<00:04:13.930> angle<00:04:14.560> from<00:04:14.680> my<00:04:14.860> hand<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:18.090> I'll<00:04:19.090> do

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
awkward angle from my hand so I'll do

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:33.020 
awkward angle from my hand so I'll do
the<00:04:19.480> same<00:04:19.510> thing

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.290 

and<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.390> want<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.660> be<00:04:34.780> really<00:04:35.080> quick

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
and you want to be really quick

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.450 
and you want to be really quick
because<00:04:37.300> it's<00:04:38.050> really<00:04:38.440> hot<00:04:38.770> so<00:04:39.130> if<00:04:39.190> you<00:04:39.310> leave

piece of hair that there are two ways to

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.769 
piece of hair that there are two ways to
do<00:05:38.969> this<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.539> I've<00:05:40.529> been<00:05:40.740> doing<00:05:40.889> it<00:05:41.159> the

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:41.779 
do this and I've been doing it the

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.909 
do this and I've been doing it the
downward<00:05:42.779> way<00:05:42.990> that<00:05:43.199> you<00:05:43.289> can<00:05:43.439> also<00:05:43.560> do<00:05:43.800> it

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
downward way that you can also do it

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.640 
downward way that you can also do it
upward<00:05:44.330> so<00:05:45.330> let<00:05:45.840> me<00:05:45.930> show<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.139> this

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
upward so let me show you this

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.679 
upward so let me show you this
so<00:05:47.219> rather<00:05:47.430> than<00:05:47.580> moving<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.090> this<00:05:48.210> way<00:05:48.389> like<00:05:48.599> I

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:48.689 
so rather than moving it this way like I

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:50.330 
so rather than moving it this way like I
have<00:05:48.870> been<00:05:49.020> I<00:05:49.259> just<00:05:49.349> like<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.860> way<00:05:49.949> better<00:05:50.129> on

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
have been I just like that way better on

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.939 
have been I just like that way better on
the<00:05:50.520> way<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:51.750> can<00:05:51.900> do<00:05:51.990> it<00:05:52.110> this<00:05:52.229> way<00:05:52.289> I<00:05:52.680> think

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
the way you can do it this way I think

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.679 
the way you can do it this way I think
this<00:05:53.310> is<00:05:53.490> kind<00:05:53.699> of<00:05:53.759> gonna<00:05:54.000> explain<00:05:54.300> to<00:05:54.479> you<00:05:54.569> why

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
this is kind of gonna explain to you why

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.439 
this is kind of gonna explain to you why
I<00:05:54.719> like<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.110> other<00:05:55.259> way<00:05:55.379> better<00:05:55.669> so<00:05:56.669> this<00:05:57.210> way

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
I like the other way better so this way

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.369 
I like the other way better so this way
you<00:05:58.520> do<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.669> same<00:05:59.879> thing<00:06:00.180> but<00:06:00.870> then<00:06:01.050> you<00:06:01.169> wrap

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
you do the same thing but then you wrap

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:08.209 
you do the same thing but then you wrap
your<00:06:01.560> hair<00:06:01.770> upward<00:06:02.279> on<00:06:02.490> it<00:06:02.839> so<00:06:06.529> like<00:06:07.529> this<00:06:07.770> and

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
your hair upward on it so like this and

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.600 
your hair upward on it so like this and
then<00:06:09.089> you<00:06:09.210> go<00:06:09.710> upwards<00:06:10.710> so<00:06:11.009> through<00:06:11.430> the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
then you go upwards so through the

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.129 
then you go upwards so through the
middle<00:06:11.909> on<00:06:12.029> around<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.539> other<00:06:13.310> um<00:06:14.930> and<00:06:15.930> the

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
middle on around the other um and the

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:17.899 
middle on around the other um and the
reason<00:06:16.500> why<00:06:16.620> I<00:06:16.650> don't<00:06:16.949> really<00:06:17.129> like<00:06:17.430> this<00:06:17.699> one

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
reason why I don't really like this one

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:23.300 
reason why I don't really like this one
is<00:06:18.150> because<00:06:18.389> it's<00:06:18.690> harder<00:06:20.240> in<00:06:21.379> my<00:06:22.379> opinion<00:06:22.860> and

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
is because it's harder in my opinion and

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.820 
is because it's harder in my opinion and
rather<00:06:24.089> than<00:06:24.389> wrapping<00:06:24.690> your<00:06:25.020> hair<00:06:25.319> down<00:06:25.770> like

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
rather than wrapping your hair down like

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.519 
rather than wrapping your hair down like
in<00:06:26.460> direction<00:06:27.150> that<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.360> grows<00:06:27.599> you're

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529 
in direction that it grows you're

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.579 
in direction that it grows you're
wrapping<00:06:28.949> it<00:06:29.069> upward<00:06:29.460> so<00:06:30.000> it's<00:06:30.150> like<00:06:30.300> I<00:06:30.589> don't

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:31.589 
wrapping it upward so it's like I don't

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.059 
wrapping it upward so it's like I don't
know<00:06:31.770> I<00:06:31.889> just<00:06:32.189> find<00:06:32.370> that<00:06:32.460> a<00:06:32.550> little<00:06:32.939> weird<00:06:34.069> so

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
know I just find that a little weird so

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.670 
know I just find that a little weird so
that's<00:06:35.310> why<00:06:35.520> I<00:06:35.550> do<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:36.000> the<00:06:36.120> way<00:06:36.210> that<00:06:36.419> I<00:06:36.479> do<00:06:36.719> but

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
that's why I do it the way that I do but

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.350 
that's why I do it the way that I do but
it's<00:06:38.550> your<00:06:38.729> preference

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360
