Nokia n9 makes us sad not because it
isn't<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.519> good<00:00:14.639> handset<00:00:15.059> because<00:00:15.389> everything

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
isn't a good handset because everything

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.570 
isn't a good handset because everything
that<00:00:16.110> we've<00:00:16.259> seen<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.950> indicates<00:00:17.460> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
that we've seen about it indicates that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.450 
that we've seen about it indicates that
the<00:00:17.939> n9<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.570> very<00:00:18.840> good<00:00:19.110> indeed<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.130> because

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the n9 is very good indeed but because

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.609 
the n9 is very good indeed but because
the<00:00:20.609> n9<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.300> essentially<00:00:22.020> doomed<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:25.439> main

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the n9 is essentially doomed the main

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.120 
the n9 is essentially doomed the main
problem<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.520> n9<00:00:27.090> runs<00:00:27.449> me<00:00:27.720> go<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
problem is that the n9 runs me go a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.529 
problem is that the n9 runs me go a
comparatively<00:00:29.130> new<00:00:29.460> operating<00:00:29.910> system<00:00:30.029> that

comparatively new operating system that

future me go handsets and that means
that<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> n9<00:00:45.450> could<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.930> both<00:00:46.110> Nokia's<00:00:46.649> first

nearly two years for nokia to come up

nearly two years for nokia to come up
with<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.780> n900<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.799> launched<00:01:11.159> at<00:01:11.280> the

with it the n900 was launched at the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
with it the n900 was launched at the
point<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:12.030> before<00:01:12.270> android<00:01:13.020> devices

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
started to take off in a really big way

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.719 
started to take off in a really big way
but<00:01:16.020> Nokia<00:01:16.470> made<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> mistake<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> hinting

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but Nokia made the mistake of hinting

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.280 
but Nokia made the mistake of hinting
that<00:01:17.760> there<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> better<00:01:18.540> device<00:01:18.960> around

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the corner there wasn't but some

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
the corner there wasn't but some
