since<00:00:47.550> our<00:00:47.730> last<00:00:47.910> update<00:00:48.270> they've<00:00:48.809> poured

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
since our last update they've poured

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.220 
since our last update they've poured
more<00:00:49.559> concrete<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.480> presumably<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
more concrete for presumably the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.400 
more concrete for presumably the
perimeter<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.280> building<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.170> my

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
perimeter of the building but it is my

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.500 
perimeter of the building but it is my
understanding<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.579> building<00:00:57.030> isn't

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
understanding that the building isn't

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
understanding that the building isn't
going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.649> normal<00:00:58.920> rectangular

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850

it's<00:01:00.989> from<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.710> understanding<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> have

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
it's from my understanding going to have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.509 
it's from my understanding going to have
some<00:01:03.809> pretty<00:01:04.110> unique<00:01:04.350> properties<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.369> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
some pretty unique properties to it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.050 
some pretty unique properties to it
including<00:01:05.780> some<00:01:06.780> type<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.380> staggered<00:01:08.310> look<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
including some type of staggered look to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.179 
including some type of staggered look to
it<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:10.290> sure<00:01:10.500> there'll<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.979> great

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it and I'm sure there'll be some great

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.850 
it and I'm sure there'll be some great
facades<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:12.119> well<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> general

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
facades as well but just the general

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
shape of the building as I understand

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:24.200 
shape of the building as I understand
it's<00:01:16.049> gonna<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.470> unique

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840 

and<00:01:25.210> here<00:01:26.170> we<00:01:26.260> are<00:01:26.290> now<00:01:26.620> we're<00:01:26.920> actually<00:01:27.070> going

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
up we're ascending right now to a height

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.690 
up we're ascending right now to a height
of<00:01:31.720> 200<00:01:32.350> feet<00:01:33.220> in<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.580> air<00:01:35.310> well<00:01:36.310> above<00:01:36.550> the
