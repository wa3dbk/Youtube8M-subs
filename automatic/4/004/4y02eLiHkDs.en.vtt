00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 to 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.880
 the production of trout egg 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.609
 rainbow outside season under a 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.160
 sustainable scheme today is a reality 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.439
 in Mexico after several years of 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.750
 research the national institute of 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.059
 fishing has managed to guarantee 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.920
 availability of egg of the species a 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.920
 through the technique photoperiod 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.640
 strategic management in other countries and 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.800
 applied today in mexico allows to manipulate 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.900
 the maturation of males and females to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.020
 by increasing or decreasing 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.300
 hours of daylight and thus advance or 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.660
 delay the spawning periods of the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.660
 trout 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.550
 if this project originated responding 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.970
 a sector demand that they required 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.130
 they continuity in the web supply the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.330
 the kutxa naturally that's what 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.230
 only one period of the pnc that is 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.020
 Autumn Winter 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.210
 but the product to complete its cycle 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.110
 of production requires a supply 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.350
 continuous before that need was proposed 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.930
 egg production out of season 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.930
 which is through the photoperiod 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.690
 the validation of the technique for 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.090
 egg production made by 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.520
 fresh life researchers guarantee 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.160
 to aquaculturists the availability of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.290
 product throughout the year generating 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.290
 also direct and indirect jobs 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.070
 in its experimental stage the technique of 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.500
 Photoperiod was successfully applied in the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.320
 aquaculture center el zarco located in the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.540
 state of mexico where one was installed 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.759
 photo room period for the control of 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.110
 reproductive maturation through 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.110
 artificial light application 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.640
 To date, more than one 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.650
 million eggs and hatchlings for its 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.690
 subsequent marketing what 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.450
 makes the puddle the center 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.880
 aquaculture pioneer of this project whose 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.070
 development will generate trout production 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.160
 rainbow during all the months of the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.160
 year 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.630
 every animal has a chip that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.260
 provides its genealogy and its history 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.390
 of light to be able to predict a result 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.850
 There is a file in this way 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.710
 animal that offers information about the 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.810
 number and quality of eggs produced 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.990
 of rainbow trout and behavior 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.920
 of the males 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.350
 as a result of the effects 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.840
 positive of the research the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.730
 technology methods and applied processes 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.010
 they were transferred to other farms 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.320
 aquaculture as the production unit 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.020
 cani data in the municipality of jilotzingo 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.870
 State of Mexico and the aquaculture center 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.570
 guachochi in chihuahua encouraging that 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.520
 truficultores of other entities 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.560
 request advice from inapesca for 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.560
 adopt the technique of reproduction 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.989
 good is a better producer than before 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.870
 this technique has better opportunities 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.719
 of marketing is diversifying 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.670
 to the point that we expect him to 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.670
 could only be dedicated to 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.319
 reproduction 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.319
 for the profitability of the month 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.450
 in this way it is corroborated that the 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.700
 photoperiod technology applied in 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.880
 mexico by Mexican researchers is 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.709
 successful and represents an alternative 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.050
 to stimulate the development of 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.600
 aquaculture satisfying the demand of 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.480
 market and impacting positively 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 and sustainable activity on farms 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.600
 aquaculture
