00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
Skinner radio would you believe and it's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.010 
Skinner radio would you believe and it's
an<00:00:58.680> analog<00:00:59.280> Skinner<00:00:59.789> radio<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.629> four

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
channels and what you do is you open

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.770 
channels and what you do is you open
this<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.479> cub<00:01:06.840> part<00:01:07.260> mount<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:08.070> here

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
this little cub part mount right here

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.800 
this little cub part mount right here
and<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.470> gives<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> access<00:01:11.119> to<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.360> four

and it gives you access to these four

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.359 
and it gives you access to these four
tuning<00:01:13.439> knobs<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> manually<00:01:15.560> tune<00:01:16.560> each

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
tuning knobs and you manually tune each

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.330 
tuning knobs and you manually tune each
channel<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.710> once<00:01:19.950> you've<00:01:20.100> done<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
channel and then once you've done that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.630 
channel and then once you've done that
then<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.180> could<00:01:21.780> cover<00:01:22.200> back<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.460> you're

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
then you could cover back on and you're

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
then you could cover back on and you're
ready<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> skate<00:01:24.320> hit<00:01:25.320> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
ready to skate hit it

tunes from 150 megahertz to 174 miles
actually<00:01:32.490> under<00:01:32.820> sitting<00:01:33.060> five<00:01:33.240> meters<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
actually under sitting five meters and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.270 
actually under sitting five meters and
the<00:01:35.520> reason<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.630> using<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.290> uses<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> band

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the reason it is using it uses that band

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.330 
the reason it is using it uses that band
because<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.659> time<00:01:39.930> frame<00:01:40.320> when<00:01:40.890> this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
because in the time frame when this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.310 
because in the time frame when this
radio<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.540> released

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
radio was released

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
radio was released
most<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> activity<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.090> Skinner's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
most of the activity that Skinner's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.080 
most of the activity that Skinner's
wanted<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> listen<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.890> was<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.850> band

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
wanted to listen to was in that band

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.260 
wanted to listen to was in that band
that<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> business<00:01:49.500> band<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.939> where

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
that was the business band that's where

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
that was the business band that's where
your<00:01:51.450> fire<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> policemen<00:01:52.649> were<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.070> was

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
your fire and policemen were so that was

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.639 
your fire and policemen were so that was
that<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> most<00:01:57.060> active<00:01:57.329> band<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.530> say

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that was the most active band I can say

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.440 
that was the most active band I can say
I<00:01:58.680> gave<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.040> four<00:01:59.340> channels<00:01:59.820> at<00:02:00.030> once<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I gave you four channels at once you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 
I gave you four channels at once you
manually<00:02:00.810> tune<00:02:01.110> these<00:02:01.290> things<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.310> scan

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
manually tune these things it would scan

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.010 
manually tune these things it would scan
those<00:02:02.939> four<00:02:03.270> channels<00:02:04.280> was<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.490> too<00:02:06.420> accurate

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
those four channels was it too accurate

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.490 
those four channels was it too accurate
because<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.829> analog<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.479> back<00:02:09.720> then<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
because it is analog but back then the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.520 
because it is analog but back then the
signals<00:02:10.920> were<00:02:11.069> very

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
signals were very

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.910 
signals were very
strong<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.410> didn't<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.770> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
strong and they you didn't have to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.280 
strong and they you didn't have to
precisely<00:02:15.400> tune<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.330> frequency<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.140> do

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
precisely tune the frequency like you do

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.680 
precisely tune the frequency like you do
nowadays<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.160> lot<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.540> utilities<00:02:19.540> and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
nowadays for a lot of utilities and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.550 
nowadays for a lot of utilities and
stuff<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:21.069> he<00:02:22.060> had<00:02:22.270> seen<00:02:22.569> my<00:02:22.780> video<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.350> this

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
stuff so he had seen my video of this

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.400 
stuff so he had seen my video of this
guy<00:02:23.970> which<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.270> just<00:02:25.990> keep<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.350> around<00:02:26.620> for

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
guy which I just keep it around for

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.530 
guy which I just keep it around for
nostalgia<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.790> he<00:02:31.180> had<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:33.010> cousin<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:34.360> that

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
nostalgia so he had the cousin to that

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.840 
nostalgia so he had the cousin to that
radio<00:02:34.870> setup<00:02:35.860> very<00:02:36.160> summery

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850

few<00:03:07.239> small<00:03:07.690> problems<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.410> probably<00:03:08.890> are<00:03:09.069> due

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
few small problems that probably are due

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.150 
few small problems that probably are due
to<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> fact<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.930> lot<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.620> switches

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
to the fact that a lot of the switches

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.610 
to the fact that a lot of the switches
and<00:03:12.310> contacts<00:03:12.819> need<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.690> be<00:03:13.840> clean<00:03:14.170> which<00:03:14.500> I

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
and contacts need to be clean which I

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.949 
and contacts need to be clean which I
haven't<00:03:14.769> done<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.280> just<00:03:15.670> wiped<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.360> off<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.900> I

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
haven't done I just wiped it off and I

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.930 
haven't done I just wiped it off and I
put<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.230> on<00:03:17.320> my<00:03:17.440> table<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.829> here<00:03:18.040> we<00:03:18.100> go<00:03:18.310> but<00:03:18.820> it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
put it on my table and here we go but it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.259 
put it on my table and here we go but it
kind<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.239> works<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:21.280> program<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:22.030> one

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
kind of works and you program this one

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.509 
kind of works and you program this one
similar<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.959> how<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.290> program<00:03:23.650> my<00:03:24.100> other<00:03:24.310> one

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
similar to how you program my other one

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.780 
similar to how you program my other one
in<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.420> bottom<00:03:26.110> where<00:03:26.470> he's<00:03:26.799> kind<00:03:27.640> of

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
are the for tuning knobs for the four

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.680 
are the for tuning knobs for the four
channels<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:35.620> what<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.100> do<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.420> put<00:03:37.630> it

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
channels and what you do is you put it

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.630 
channels and what you do is you put it
in<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.840> manual<00:03:38.350> mode<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.890> then<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.100> select<00:03:39.370> a

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
in a manual mode and then you select a

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.300 
in a manual mode and then you select a
channel<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.380> then<00:03:41.380> let<00:03:41.590> me<00:03:41.680> zoom<00:03:41.890> in<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.130> little

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
channel and then let me zoom in a little

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.490 
channel and then let me zoom in a little
bit<00:03:42.430> here<00:03:43.079> two<00:03:44.079> moons<00:03:45.209> over<00:03:47.370> here<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:50.200> see

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
bit here two moons over here you see

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.470 
bit here two moons over here you see
this<00:03:50.680> dial<00:03:51.100> which<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.880> thought<00:03:52.120> was<00:03:52.299> an

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
this dial which I thought was an

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.740 
this dial which I thought was an
estimator<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.170> it's<00:03:53.290> not<00:03:53.500> it's<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:55.390> dial

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
estimator but it's not it's the dial

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.020 
estimator but it's not it's the dial
showing<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.769> frequency<00:03:57.070> that<00:03:57.730> you've

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
showing you the frequency that you've

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.860 
showing you the frequency that you've
tuned<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.799> you<00:04:00.489> reach<00:04:00.730> down<00:04:01.030> here<00:04:01.570> and<00:04:01.780> I'm

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
tuned to so you reach down here and I'm

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.140 
tuned to so you reach down here and I'm
going<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.230> channel<00:04:02.410> one<00:04:02.709> right<00:04:02.950> now<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.940> you

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
going to channel one right now and you

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.050 
going to channel one right now and you
tune<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:07.450> can<00:04:07.630> see<00:04:08.519> that<00:04:09.519> dial

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
tune it in and you can see that dial

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.319 
tune it in and you can see that dial
move<00:04:10.590> indicating<00:04:11.590> what<00:04:12.310> frequency<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.150> that

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
move indicating what frequency you that

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.469 
move indicating what frequency you that
channels<00:04:13.780> on<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:15.280> if<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.640> turn<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:16.030> volume<00:04:16.209> up

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
channels on and if I turn the volume up

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.509 
channels on and if I turn the volume up
a<00:04:16.630> little<00:04:16.810> bit<00:04:18.750> think<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.900> can<00:04:20.109> pick<00:04:20.320> up<00:04:20.560> Italy

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
a little bit think I can pick up Italy

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.260 
a little bit think I can pick up Italy
now<00:04:21.970> this<00:04:22.120> as<00:04:22.659> I<00:04:22.870> said<00:04:22.930> this

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
now this as I said this

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.210 
now this as I said this
Bayon<00:04:24.630> one<00:04:25.319> hundred<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.650> fifty<00:04:25.949> megahertz

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
Bayon one hundred and fifty megahertz

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.279 
Bayon one hundred and fifty megahertz
two<00:04:26.550> hundred<00:04:26.759> so<00:04:26.880> if<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.120> like<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.419> it's<00:04:27.870> not<00:04:28.139> as

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
two hundred so if I like it it's not as

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.790 
two hundred so if I like it it's not as
active<00:04:29.449> for<00:04:30.449> utilities<00:04:31.139> such<00:04:31.319> as<00:04:31.500> fire<00:04:31.770> and

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
active for utilities such as fire and

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.610 
active for utilities such as fire and
emergency<00:04:32.099> they've<00:04:32.610> all<00:04:32.819> moved<00:04:33.229> up<00:04:34.229> to

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
emergency they've all moved up to

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.930 
emergency they've all moved up to
probably<00:04:35.009> 800<00:04:35.430> megahertz<00:04:36.650> but<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.729> is

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
probably 800 megahertz but the this is

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.110 
probably 800 megahertz but the this is
still<00:04:39.210> an<00:04:39.509> active<00:04:39.720> businessman<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:41.120> getting

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
still an active businessman and getting

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.809 
still an active businessman and getting
the<00:04:43.080> NOAA<00:04:43.590> Weather<00:04:43.949> Channel<00:04:44.370> is<00:04:44.490> still<00:04:44.699> in

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
the NOAA Weather Channel is still in

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.520 
the NOAA Weather Channel is still in
this<00:04:44.940> being<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.389> let's<00:04:45.569> see<00:04:45.690> if<00:04:45.780> we<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:46.020> pick

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
this being so let's see if we can pick

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.050 
this being so let's see if we can pick
up<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.800> NOAA<00:04:47.009> Weather<00:04:47.039> Channel<00:04:49.729> should<00:04:50.729> be<00:04:50.880> down

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
up a NOAA Weather Channel should be down

00:04:51.060 --> 00:05:11.440 
up a NOAA Weather Channel should be down
around<00:04:51.210> 160<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:54.440> get<00:04:55.440> everyone

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.720 

okay<00:05:12.170> there<00:05:12.410> it's<00:05:12.530> picking<00:05:12.830> up<00:05:12.980> no<00:05:13.580> other

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
okay there it's picking up no other

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.630 
okay there it's picking up no other
channel<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.300> actually<00:05:14.480> can<00:05:14.780> pick<00:05:14.960> up<00:05:15.110> two

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
channel I actually can pick up two

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.910 
channel I actually can pick up two
channels<00:05:16.640> in<00:05:16.730> my<00:05:16.910> area<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.510> so<00:05:18.350> now<00:05:18.860> that

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
channels in my area and so now that

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.350 
channels in my area and so now that
particular<00:05:20.290> channel<00:05:21.290> of<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.740> four<00:05:22.010> is<00:05:22.400> tuned

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
particular channel of the four is tuned

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.530 
particular channel of the four is tuned
to<00:05:23.810> receive<00:05:24.590> no<00:05:24.830> weather<00:05:25.130> so<00:05:26.120> then<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:26.420> would

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
to receive no weather so then you would

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.720 
to receive no weather so then you would
go<00:05:26.720> to<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:26.990> next<00:05:27.260> one<00:05:27.500> you<00:05:27.740> use<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.280> next<00:05:28.490> knob

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
go to the next one you use the next knob

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.180 
go to the next one you use the next knob
so<00:05:29.330> on<00:05:29.510> down<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.750> line<00:05:30.050> -<00:05:30.320> you've<00:05:30.590> tuned<00:05:30.920> in

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
so on down the line - you've tuned in

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.570 
so on down the line - you've tuned in
four<00:05:32.060> channels<00:05:32.600> that<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:32.930> want<00:05:33.140> to<00:05:33.230> scan<00:05:33.580> now

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
four channels that you want to scan now

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.060 
four channels that you want to scan now
of<00:05:34.730> course<00:05:34.910> NOAA<00:05:35.690> Weather<00:05:36.020> Channel<00:05:36.560> is<00:05:36.740> not

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
of course NOAA Weather Channel is not

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.010 
of course NOAA Weather Channel is not
typically<00:05:37.760> a<00:05:37.790> channel<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.330> want<00:05:38.600> to<00:05:38.690> scan

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
typically a channel you want to scan

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.720 
typically a channel you want to scan
because<00:05:39.320> it's<00:05:39.590> always<00:05:39.770> on<00:05:40.070> so<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.490> radio

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
because it's always on so the radio

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.940 
because it's always on so the radio
would<00:05:40.910> always<00:05:41.060> stop<00:05:41.450> there<00:05:41.780> so<00:05:42.440> what<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.770> can

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
would always stop there so what you can

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.870 
would always stop there so what you can
do<00:05:43.160> is<00:05:43.900> use<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.170> switch<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.770> disable<00:05:46.310> that

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
do is use this switch to disable that

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.020 
do is use this switch to disable that
channel<00:05:47.390> and<00:05:47.860> then<00:05:48.860> enable<00:05:49.670> your<00:05:49.850> other

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
channel and then enable your other

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.620 
channel and then enable your other
channels<00:05:50.990> that<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.290> want<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.680> listen<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:52.190> and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
channels that you want to listen to and

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.600 
channels that you want to listen to and
put<00:05:53.630> it<00:05:53.720> in<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.170> got<00:05:54.680> in<00:05:54.860> manual<00:05:55.250> mode<00:05:55.310> right

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
put it in I got in manual mode right

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.680 
put it in I got in manual mode right
here<00:05:55.670> it<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.000> program<00:05:56.390> it

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
here it to program it

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.650 
here it to program it
but<00:05:57.290> then<00:05:57.500> scan<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:58.160> it<00:05:58.280> will<00:05:58.430> scan<00:05:58.730> whatever

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
but then scan and it will scan whatever

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.420 
but then scan and it will scan whatever
channels<00:06:00.170> you<00:06:00.350> have<00:06:00.380> selected<00:06:01.070> for<00:06:01.250> it<00:06:01.340> to

scan now if you want to listen to the

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.270 
scan now if you want to listen to the
NOAA<00:06:05.720> weather<00:06:06.020> because<00:06:06.560> conditions<00:06:07.100> are

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
it back in kajori tune see that's how

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.210 
it back in kajori tune see that's how
that<00:06:21.650> work<00:06:21.980> it<00:06:22.670> also<00:06:22.850> has<00:06:23.420> an<00:06:23.630> AM<00:06:23.960> and<00:06:24.140> FM<00:06:24.220> tuner

that work it also has an AM and FM tuner

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
that work it also has an AM and FM tuner
but<00:06:25.910> you<00:06:26.060> select<00:06:26.480> by<00:06:27.110> the<00:06:27.170> selector<00:06:27.800> here<00:06:28.310> and

but you select by the selector here and

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.060 
but you select by the selector here and
it<00:06:29.390> has<00:06:29.540> a<00:06:29.570> squelch<00:06:30.050> control<00:06:30.500> what<00:06:30.680> you<00:06:30.800> use

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
it has a squelch control what you use

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.150 
it has a squelch control what you use
when<00:06:31.310> you're<00:06:31.430> doing<00:06:32.300> scanning<00:06:32.720> so<00:06:33.560> that<00:06:33.830> it

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
when you're doing scanning so that it

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.820 
when you're doing scanning so that it
won't<00:06:34.400> stop<00:06:34.730> on<00:06:35.000> our<00:06:35.120> frequency<00:06:35.450> our<00:06:35.960> channel

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
won't stop on our frequency our channel

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.180 
won't stop on our frequency our channel
does<00:06:37.310> not<00:06:37.900> doesn't<00:06:38.900> have<00:06:38.930> any<00:06:39.170> activity<00:06:39.710> now

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
does not doesn't have any activity now

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.460 
does not doesn't have any activity now
that's<00:06:40.370> one<00:06:40.550> thing<00:06:40.730> I've<00:06:40.880> noticed<00:06:41.120> is<00:06:41.570> the

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
that's one thing I've noticed is the

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.870 
that's one thing I've noticed is the
scrub<00:06:42.980> control<00:06:43.490> needs<00:06:44.000> to<00:06:44.240> be<00:06:44.360> cleaned

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
scrub control needs to be cleaned

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.400 
scrub control needs to be cleaned
it's<00:06:46.880> very<00:06:47.150> scratchy<00:06:47.540> and<00:06:47.930> it's<00:06:48.050> in<00:06:48.170> and<00:06:48.320> out

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
it's very scratchy and it's in and out

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.160 
it's very scratchy and it's in and out
so<00:06:48.650> it<00:06:48.770> definitely<00:06:48.980> needs<00:06:49.340> to<00:06:49.400> be<00:06:49.490> cleaned<00:06:50.170> so

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
so it definitely needs to be cleaned so

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.020 
so it definitely needs to be cleaned so
that's<00:06:51.410> basically<00:06:51.770> it<00:06:51.950> already<00:06:52.040> only<00:06:52.340> it's

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
that's basically it already only it's

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.560 
that's basically it already only it's
got<00:06:53.180> a<00:06:53.210> built-in<00:06:53.920> antenna<00:06:55.150> I'll<00:06:56.150> show<00:06:56.390> you<00:06:56.450> in

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
got a built-in antenna I'll show you in

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.690 
got a built-in antenna I'll show you in
a<00:06:56.630> second<00:06:56.990> it<00:06:57.110> does<00:06:57.470> not<00:06:57.650> have<00:06:57.860> any<00:06:58.160> external

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
a second it does not have any external

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.950 
a second it does not have any external
antenna<00:06:59.300> connections<00:06:59.950> so<00:07:00.950> here's<00:07:01.220> the

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
antenna connections so here's the

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.730 
antenna connections so here's the
telescopic<00:07:02.960> antenna<00:07:03.940> and<00:07:04.940> in<00:07:05.180> the<00:07:05.710> return<00:07:06.710> of

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
telescopic antenna and in the return of

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.010 
telescopic antenna and in the return of
volume<00:07:07.220> down<00:07:07.400> close<00:07:07.640> can<00:07:07.820> be<00:07:07.940> pretty<00:07:08.180> loud<00:07:08.390> if

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
volume down close can be pretty loud if

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.850 
volume down close can be pretty loud if
