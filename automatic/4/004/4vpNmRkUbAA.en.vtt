instrumental<00:02:31.830> serious<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.640> kind<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.910> morphs

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
instrumental serious that kind of morphs

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.620 
instrumental serious that kind of morphs
into<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.840> eventually<00:02:33.960> serious<00:02:34.740> gets<00:02:35.630> reduced

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
into it eventually serious gets reduced

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.490 
into it eventually serious gets reduced
to<00:02:37.020> just<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.710> bass<00:02:37.920> part<00:02:38.690> implying<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.290> B

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
to just the bass part implying the B

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.740 
to just the bass part implying the B
minor<00:02:40.740> chord<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.730> G<00:02:41.910> chord<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.630> that's

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
minor chord and a G chord so that's

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.000 
minor chord and a G chord so that's
where<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.930> started<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.500> really<00:02:43.740> just<00:02:43.860> with

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
where I started was really just with

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.910 
where I started was really just with
that<00:02:44.040> first<00:02:44.430> little<00:02:44.730> thing<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.170> then<00:02:46.650> brought

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
that first little thing and then brought

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.650 
that first little thing and then brought
in<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.370> keyboard<00:02:47.730> parts<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.450> was<00:02:48.570> listening

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
in the keyboard parts as I was listening

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.640 
in the keyboard parts as I was listening
to<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.140> thought<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.410> know<00:02:49.530> those

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
to this I thought you know those

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.410 
to this I thought you know those
keyboard<00:02:50.040> parts<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.490> be<00:02:50.520> done<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.970> keep<00:02:51.210> we

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
keyboard parts can be done and keep we

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.730 
keyboard parts can be done and keep we
can<00:02:51.540> keep<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.840> bass<00:02:52.020> going<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:52.530> that's

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
can keep the bass going because that's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.020 
can keep the bass going because that's
what<00:02:52.920> we're<00:02:53.040> going<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.190> hear<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.580> song<00:02:53.790> is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
what we're going to hear in this song is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.140 
what we're going to hear in this song is
the<00:02:54.720> thumping<00:02:55.200> bass<00:02:55.610> constant<00:02:56.610> flow<00:02:56.880> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
the thumping bass constant flow of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.140 
the thumping bass constant flow of
eighth<00:02:57.600> notes<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.340> then<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.520> not<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.910> hard

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
eighth notes and then it's not that hard

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.260 
eighth notes and then it's not that hard
to<00:03:00.300> work<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:02.100> keyboard<00:03:02.490> chords<00:03:02.880> and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
to work in the the keyboard chords and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.650 
to work in the the keyboard chords and
so<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.690> tried<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.050> make<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.620> arrangement<00:03:05.660> more

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
so I tried to make this arrangement more

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.790 
so I tried to make this arrangement more
like<00:03:06.840> what<00:03:07.020> you'd<00:03:07.170> hear<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
like what you'd hear with just the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.280 
like what you'd hear with just the
keyboard<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.730> bass<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.840> really<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.200> much

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
keyboard and the bass not really so much

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.070 
keyboard and the bass not really so much
about<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.650> guitar<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.690> would<00:03:12.810> be<00:03:12.900> what

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
about the guitar and it would be what

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.960 
about the guitar and it would be what
you<00:03:13.200> could<00:03:13.320> play<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:14.040> accompany<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.640> sing

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you could play to accompany it and sing

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.170 
you could play to accompany it and sing
it<00:03:15.590> especially<00:03:16.590> if<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.830> have<00:03:17.010> Eric<00:03:17.790> Wolfson's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
it especially if you have Eric Wolfson's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.930 
it especially if you have Eric Wolfson's
voice<00:03:19.040> now<00:03:20.040> Eric<00:03:20.310> passed<00:03:20.489> away<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.730> few<00:03:20.790> years

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
voice now Eric passed away a few years

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.420

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
necessary

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.560 
necessary
to<00:03:47.130> get<00:03:47.340> all<00:03:47.520> of<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.150> happen<00:03:48.450> together

thumb just pounding away through the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.050 
thumb just pounding away through the
chords<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.220> all<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.640> we're<00:03:53.790> not<00:03:53.880> going<00:03:54.000> to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
chords so all I have we're not going to

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.370 
chords so all I have we're not going to

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
ok never I gotta save that for a

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.540 
ok never I gotta save that for a
different<00:04:14.100> different<00:04:14.390> story<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:15.950> ok<00:04:16.950> coming

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
different different story so ok coming

different different story so ok coming
up<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.120> little<00:04:18.800> dissection<00:04:19.800> of<00:04:20.630> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
up in a little dissection of the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.159 
up in a little dissection of the
assemblage<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.790> eye<00:04:23.790> on<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:23.970> sky

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.110 

the<00:04:29.039> right<00:04:29.189> hand<00:04:29.400> technique<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.909> pretty

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
the right hand technique is pretty

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.760 
the right hand technique is pretty
interesting<00:04:30.330> because<00:04:30.539> usually<00:04:31.259> your<00:04:31.560> three

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
interesting because usually your three

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.080 
interesting because usually your three
fingers<00:04:31.979> are<00:04:32.340> going<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.520> be<00:04:32.610> working<00:04:32.939> as<00:04:33.060> a

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
fingers are going to be working as a

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.839 
fingers are going to be working as a
group<00:04:33.330> just<00:04:33.569> plucking<00:04:33.870> chords<00:04:34.610> just<00:04:35.610> play<00:04:35.729> the

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
group just plucking chords just play the

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.670 
group just plucking chords just play the
open<00:04:36.090> strings<00:04:36.389> just<00:04:37.050> hit<00:04:37.199> them<00:04:37.319> like<00:04:37.379> that

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
open strings just hit them like that

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.499 
open strings just hit them like that
sometimes<00:04:38.129> they'll<00:04:38.249> be<00:04:38.279> playing<00:04:38.610> on<00:04:38.789> the

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
sometimes they'll be playing on the

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.689 
sometimes they'll be playing on the
first<00:04:40.199> ant<00:04:40.560> first<00:04:40.919> beat<00:04:41.069> of<00:04:41.189> the<00:04:41.249> measure<00:04:41.340> and

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
first ant first beat of the measure and

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.689 
first ant first beat of the measure and
left<00:04:41.909> and<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.479> beat<00:04:42.689> two<00:04:42.930> one<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:43.979> two<00:04:44.400> and

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
left and of beat two one and two and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
and for and along with that though we've

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.810 
and for and along with that though we've
got<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.770> steady<00:04:52.160> diet<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.360> eighth<00:04:53.540> notes<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:55.760> I'm

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
got a steady diet of eighth notes so I'm

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.010 
got a steady diet of eighth notes so I'm
just<00:04:55.940> playing<00:04:56.120> open<00:04:56.389> strings<00:04:56.630> right<00:04:56.780> now<00:04:56.900> so

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
just playing open strings right now so

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.110 
just playing open strings right now so
you<00:04:57.080> can<00:04:57.169> get<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.380> feel<00:04:57.620> for<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.040> and<00:04:58.340> want<00:04:58.970> the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
you can get the feel for it and want the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.520 
you can get the feel for it and want the
so<00:04:59.360> we<00:04:59.570> need<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.750> be<00:04:59.840> able<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.020> keep<00:05:00.139> your<00:05:00.290> thumb

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
so we need to be able to keep your thumb

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.440 
so we need to be able to keep your thumb
going<00:05:00.800> keeping<00:05:01.610> beat<00:05:01.790> for<00:05:02.060> us<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.300> we'd<00:05:02.419> be

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
going keeping beat for us and we'd be

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.409 
going keeping beat for us and we'd be
counting<00:05:02.930> this<00:05:03.110> one<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:04.160> two<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.910> three<00:05:04.940> and

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
counting this one and two and three and

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.060 
counting this one and two and three and
four<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:06.410> one<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.860> two<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.790> three<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.300> four

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
four and one and two and three and four

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.460 
four and one and two and three and four
so<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.160> first<00:05:10.340> thing<00:05:10.490> I<00:05:10.580> would<00:05:10.639> practice<00:05:11.180> is

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
so the first thing I would practice is

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.110 
so the first thing I would practice is
particularly<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.650> rhythm<00:05:12.919> of<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.400> dotted

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
particularly the rhythm of a dotted

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.060 
particularly the rhythm of a dotted
quarter<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.660> another<00:05:15.500> note<00:05:15.650> coming<00:05:15.919> on<00:05:16.010> the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
quarter and another note coming on the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.560 
quarter and another note coming on the
end<00:05:16.220> of<00:05:16.400> two<00:05:16.550> along<00:05:16.880> with<00:05:17.030> those<00:05:17.120> eighth<00:05:17.300> notes

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
end of two along with those eighth notes

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.900 
end of two along with those eighth notes
so<00:05:18.139> that's<00:05:18.320> second<00:05:18.710> we<00:05:19.070> would<00:05:19.190> pinch<00:05:19.490> on<00:05:19.700> beat

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
so that's second we would pinch on beat

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.350 
so that's second we would pinch on beat
one<00:05:20.090> a<00:05:20.530> bass<00:05:21.530> note<00:05:21.770> on<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.340> bass<00:05:23.060> note<00:05:23.270> on

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
one a bass note on the and bass note on

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.100 
one a bass note on the and bass note on
two<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:24.110> another<00:05:24.800> pinch<00:05:25.190> on<00:05:25.669> the<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.360> of<00:05:26.660> two

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
two and another pinch on the and of two

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.990 
two and another pinch on the and of two
and<00:05:27.380> then<00:05:27.889> three<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.810> four<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.220> so<00:05:31.220> right

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
and then three and four and so right

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.170 
and then three and four and so right
hand<00:05:32.180> exercise<00:05:32.660> for<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:32.930> song<00:05:33.139> one<00:05:33.950> and<00:05:34.310> two

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
hand exercise for the song one and two

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.490 
hand exercise for the song one and two
and<00:05:35.690> three<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.860> four<00:05:37.550> and

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.120 

you

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.510 

the<00:05:46.910> chords<00:05:47.240> in<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.420> song<00:05:47.450> are<00:05:48.010> fairly<00:05:49.010> normal

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
the chords in the song are fairly normal

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.620 
the chords in the song are fairly normal
we<00:05:49.610> could<00:05:49.730> play<00:05:49.880> through<00:05:50.090> a<00:05:50.120> very<00:05:50.330> simple

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
we could play through a very simple

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.330 
we could play through a very simple
version<00:05:51.080> of<00:05:51.140> the<00:05:51.200> song<00:05:51.440> if<00:05:51.740> I<00:05:51.860> just<00:05:52.190> the

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
version of the song if I just the

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.880 
version of the song if I just the
general<00:05:52.610> chord<00:05:52.910> progression<00:05:53.300> would<00:05:53.360> be<00:05:53.510> d

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.680 

to<00:05:57.890> be<00:05:58.070> minor

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:11.160 

come<00:06:02.900> again

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.390 

let's<00:06:11.620> see<00:06:11.710> what<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:11.920> bars<00:06:12.070> permit<00:06:12.520> go<00:06:12.700> to<00:06:12.760> G<00:06:14.400> G

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
let's see what the bars permit go to G G

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.120 
let's see what the bars permit go to G G
minor<00:06:16.050> have<00:06:17.050> much<00:06:17.230> easier<00:06:17.530> ways<00:06:17.680> to<00:06:17.710> play<00:06:17.920> both

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
minor have much easier ways to play both

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.810 
minor have much easier ways to play both
of<00:06:18.310> those<00:06:18.460> an<00:06:18.760> e7<00:06:19.690> sus4<00:06:19.990> with<00:06:20.410> me<00:06:20.560> in<00:06:20.680> the<00:06:20.770> base

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.570 

so<00:06:24.820> the<00:06:24.940> verse<00:06:25.120> starts<00:06:25.510> off<00:06:25.810> with<00:06:26.740> RA<00:06:27.040> with<00:06:27.430> D

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
so the verse starts off with RA with D

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.800 
so the verse starts off with RA with D
in<00:06:27.700> the<00:06:27.790> base<00:06:27.940> I<00:06:28.120> would<00:06:28.240> usually<00:06:28.360> play<00:06:28.660> that

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
in the base I would usually play that

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.150 
in the base I would usually play that
with<00:06:28.900> my<00:06:28.990> first<00:06:29.170> and<00:06:29.380> second<00:06:29.650> fingers<00:06:29.920> as<00:06:30.040> I've

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
with my first and second fingers as I've

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.150 
with my first and second fingers as I've
talked<00:06:30.340> about<00:06:30.430> in<00:06:30.580> an<00:06:30.640> earlier<00:06:30.730> section<00:06:32.160> and

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
talked about in an earlier section and

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.430 
talked about in an earlier section and
just<00:06:33.300> move<00:06:34.300> it<00:06:34.420> and<00:06:34.690> move<00:06:34.900> these<00:06:35.110> two<00:06:35.260> fingers

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
just move it and move these two fingers

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.430 
just move it and move these two fingers
to<00:06:35.680> our<00:06:35.770> standard<00:06:36.130> date<00:06:36.310> one<00:06:36.970> and<00:06:37.330> two<00:06:37.990> and

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
to our standard date one and two and

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.040 
to our standard date one and two and
three<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:39.490> four<00:06:40.210> and<00:06:40.510> I<00:06:40.690> you<00:06:40.750> could<00:06:40.870> do<00:06:40.960> the

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
three and four and I you could do the

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.540 
three and four and I you could do the
exact<00:06:41.320> same<00:06:41.350> thing<00:06:41.860> in<00:06:41.980> the<00:06:42.040> second<00:06:42.400> measure

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
exact same thing in the second measure

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.520 
exact same thing in the second measure
but<00:06:43.480> I<00:06:43.510> liked<00:06:43.780> you<00:06:43.870> for<00:06:44.050> just<00:06:44.260> a<00:06:44.350> little

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
but I liked you for just a little

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.620 
but I liked you for just a little
variety<00:06:44.680> come<00:06:45.640> to<00:06:45.790> a<00:06:45.820> different<00:06:46.090> voicing

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
variety come to a different voicing

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.540 
variety come to a different voicing
coming<00:06:46.870> up<00:06:46.960> to<00:06:47.050> the<00:06:47.140> fifth<00:06:47.380> fret<00:06:47.560> leaving<00:06:48.490> the

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
coming up to the fifth fret leaving the

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.390 
coming up to the fifth fret leaving the
first<00:06:48.790> string<00:06:49.030> open<00:06:49.360> and<00:06:49.860> playing<00:06:50.860> these<00:06:51.190> two

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
first string open and playing these two

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.130 
first string open and playing these two
notes<00:06:51.580> out<00:06:51.760> of<00:06:51.850> the<00:06:51.910> a<00:06:51.940> chord<00:06:52.330> that<00:06:52.390> the<00:06:52.810> e<00:06:52.840> and

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
notes out of the a chord that the e and

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.880 
notes out of the a chord that the e and
the<00:06:53.230> C<00:06:53.410> sharp<00:06:53.650> and<00:06:53.950> going<00:06:54.880> to<00:06:55.030> the<00:06:55.210> higher<00:06:55.450> D<00:06:55.890> so

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
the C sharp and going to the higher D so

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.890 
the C sharp and going to the higher D so
that<00:06:56.920> we<00:06:57.100> hear<00:06:57.460> just<00:06:57.760> a<00:06:57.940> little<00:06:58.180> different<00:06:58.510> a

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
that we hear just a little different a

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.810 
that we hear just a little different a
little<00:06:59.620> variety<00:06:59.740> here<00:07:00.190> instead<00:07:00.460> hearing<00:07:00.730> the

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820 
little variety here instead hearing the

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.220 
little variety here instead hearing the
f-sharp<00:07:00.940> on<00:07:01.390> the<00:07:01.480> top<00:07:03.600> we<00:07:04.600> hear<00:07:04.780> it<00:07:04.870> hear<00:07:05.050> an<00:07:05.140> A

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
f-sharp on the top we hear it hear an A

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.530 
f-sharp on the top we hear it hear an A
in<00:07:05.350> there
