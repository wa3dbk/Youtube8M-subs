registrar there and and then going into
theatre<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.280> guess<00:00:14.580> which<00:00:14.940> was<00:00:15.210> very<00:00:15.630> daunting

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
theatre I guess which was very daunting

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.279 
theatre I guess which was very daunting
I<00:00:17.240> before<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.390> I've<00:00:18.480> had<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> MRIs<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
I before that I've had all the MRIs and

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.359 
I before that I've had all the MRIs and
things<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:21.260> yes<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.560> very<00:00:22.800> nervous<00:00:23.010> I

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
things but yes I was very nervous I

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.070 
things but yes I was very nervous I
didn't<00:00:23.640> know<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.970> brain<00:00:24.210> surgery<00:00:24.449> always<00:00:24.900> has

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
didn't know in brain surgery always has

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.960 
didn't know in brain surgery always has
these<00:00:25.199> big<00:00:25.380> connotations<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:28.609> going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.820> see

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
these big connotations and going to see

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
these big connotations and going to see
it<00:00:30.090> her<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> being<00:00:31.080> awake<00:00:31.439> through<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.980> whole

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it her and being awake through the whole

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.290 
it her and being awake through the whole
thing<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.579> actually<00:00:32.910> good<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.270> way

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
thing I think is actually good in a way

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.760 
thing I think is actually good in a way
because<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.930> least<00:00:34.020> they<00:00:34.410> can't<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.739> anything

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
because at least they can't do anything

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.090 
because at least they can't do anything
if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.399> know<00:00:35.579> about<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.840> also

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.740 

he's<00:00:41.100> still<00:00:41.280> awake<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.420> went<00:00:42.600> on

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
he's still awake and because it went on

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.100 
he's still awake and because it went on
quite<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.379> long<00:00:43.590> time<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.309> yes<00:00:45.000> died<00:00:45.899> you

scary because you can hear them drilling

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.349 
scary because you can hear them drilling
into<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:57.510> skull<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.559> oh<00:00:59.359> it

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

into your skull and you think oh it
doesn't<00:01:00.570> hurt<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.620> could<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.899> but

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
doesn't hurt but you know could and but

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.950 
doesn't hurt but you know could and but

right<00:01:07.200> through<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:09.470> yes<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.010> was<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
right through it and yes so that was the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.609 
right through it and yes so that was the
next<00:01:11.460> part<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> journey<00:01:12.049> then<00:01:13.049> we're<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
next part of the journey then we're at a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
next part of the journey then we're at a
week<00:01:13.740> later<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.100> had<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.689> stimulator

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
week later I had the stimulator

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.490 
week later I had the stimulator
implanted<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.299> which<00:01:18.810> was<00:01:18.990> pretty<00:01:19.200> much

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
implanted and then which was pretty much

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
implanted and then which was pretty much
a<00:01:19.560> non-event<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.250> wasn't<00:01:20.580> paying<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.030> law<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
a non-event it wasn't paying for law and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.810 
a non-event it wasn't paying for law and
then<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.200> went<00:01:22.380> home<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.860> six<00:01:23.009> weeks<00:01:25.820> until

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
then I went home for six weeks until

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.050 
then I went home for six weeks until
they<00:01:27.240> turned<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.490> they're<00:01:29.490> turning<00:01:29.909> on

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
they turned it on and they're turning on

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.160 
they turned it on and they're turning on
was<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:31.220> pretty<00:01:32.220> mean<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.759> stay<00:01:32.970> much<00:01:33.299> more

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
was a pretty mean to stay much more

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.590 
was a pretty mean to stay much more
momentous<00:01:34.590> than<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.829> expected<00:01:35.479> because<00:01:36.479> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
momentous than I expected because I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.380 
momentous than I expected because I
really<00:01:36.900> felt<00:01:37.170> I've<00:01:38.159> given<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:38.850> last<00:01:39.030> job

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
really felt I've given this my last job

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
really felt I've given this my last job
that<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.869> last<00:01:40.079> big<00:01:40.350> shot<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.950> DBS

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that was my last big shot to have DBS

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.539 
that was my last big shot to have DBS
and<00:01:41.840> okay<00:01:42.840> I've<00:01:43.020> done<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.710> didn't<00:01:44.369> really

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
and okay I've done that I didn't really

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.130 
and okay I've done that I didn't really
think<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.060> work<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.750> worth<00:01:45.930> giving

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
think it would work I was worth giving

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
think it would work I was worth giving
it<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:47.100> didn't<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> lot

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it a go but I really didn't have a lot

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.120 
it a go but I really didn't have a lot
of<00:01:47.759> faith<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.649> remember<00:01:50.100> being

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
of faith in it and I just remember being

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.789 
of faith in it and I just remember being
there<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:53.869> I'm<00:01:54.869> turning<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.560> my
