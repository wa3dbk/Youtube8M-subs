00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.700 
that could even do top 5 stunts as one
of<00:01:30.210> them<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> come<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> new

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
of them so I come up with like a new

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
of them so I come up with like a new
theme<00:01:32.040> every<00:01:32.250> single<00:01:32.729> week<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.180> haven't

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
theme every single week I haven't

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.510 
theme every single week I haven't
actually<00:01:33.869> thought<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> themes<00:01:35.280> yet

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
actually thought of all the themes yet

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.710 
actually thought of all the themes yet
but<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:35.790> sure<00:01:35.820> could<00:01:36.180> come<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.540> some

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
but I'm sure could come up with some

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.840 
but I'm sure could come up with some
really<00:01:36.900> unique<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.920> creative<00:01:38.189> ideas<00:01:38.820> and
