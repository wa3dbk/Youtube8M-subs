Flynn<00:01:32.960> Rider

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.440 

I'd<00:01:36.500> seen<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.890> few<00:01:37.220> episodes<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.790> his<00:01:37.970> show<00:01:38.240> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
I'd seen a few episodes of his show and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.660 
I'd seen a few episodes of his show and
I<00:01:38.480> thought<00:01:38.660> he's<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.170> funny<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:39.920> clever<00:01:40.370> and

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
I thought he's so funny and clever and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.340 
I thought he's so funny and clever and
um<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.760> saw<00:01:43.970> I<00:01:44.150> heard<00:01:44.720> him<00:01:44.870> sing<00:01:45.140> and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
um and then I saw I heard him sing and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.600 
um and then I saw I heard him sing and
he<00:01:45.410> was<00:01:45.560> terrific

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
he was terrific

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.400 
he was terrific
so<00:01:47.120> when<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.270> heard<00:01:47.450> he<00:01:47.630> was<00:01:47.660> cast<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.230> thought

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
so when I heard he was cast I thought

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.020 
so when I heard he was cast I thought
that<00:01:48.530> was<00:01:48.650> really<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.610> know<00:01:49.640> smart<00:01:50.200> casting

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
that was really you know smart casting

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.600 
that was really you know smart casting
because<00:01:53.030> he's<00:01:53.450> dashing<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:54.530> he's<00:01:55.040> also<00:01:55.250> he

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
because he's dashing but he's also he

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.090 
because he's dashing but he's also he
can<00:01:55.820> be<00:01:55.970> kind<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.390> goofy<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:59.290> he's<00:02:00.290> very<00:02:00.620> smart

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
can be kind of goofy and he's very smart

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.770 
can be kind of goofy and he's very smart
and<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:03.700> those<00:02:04.700> smarts<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.360> that

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
and that that those smarts that that

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.720 
and that that those smarts that that
cleverness<00:02:06.260> is<00:02:06.590> there<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.250> choices<00:02:07.700> that

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
cleverness is there in the choices that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.710 
cleverness is there in the choices that
he<00:02:07.940> makes<00:02:08.119> as<00:02:08.330> an<00:02:08.450> actor<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:10.130> he<00:02:11.000> has<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.210> great

necessarily asking the same things of me
and<00:02:47.620> sometimes<00:02:48.010> they'll<00:02:48.280> they<00:02:48.609> will<00:02:48.790> say

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
and sometimes they'll they will say

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.750 
and sometimes they'll they will say
things<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:50.019> seem<00:02:50.260> contradictory<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:51.639> in

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
things that seem contradictory but in

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.179 
things that seem contradictory but in
fact<00:02:52.000> what<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.599> does<00:02:52.840> is<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.469> provokes<00:02:53.950> a

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
fact what it does is it provokes a

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.970 
fact what it does is it provokes a
dialogue<00:02:54.639> and<00:02:55.139> what<00:02:56.139> we<00:02:56.349> end<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.769> with<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
dialogue and what we end up with a

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.110 
dialogue and what we end up with a
result<00:02:57.189> that's<00:02:57.730> not<00:02:58.599> what<00:02:58.959> any<00:02:59.200> one<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.650> us

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
result that's not what any one of us

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.610 
result that's not what any one of us
individually<00:03:01.120> would<00:03:01.299> have<00:03:01.420> come<00:03:01.629> up<00:03:01.659> with<00:03:01.959> but

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
individually would have come up with but

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.289 
individually would have come up with but
something<00:03:03.040> completely<00:03:03.790> different<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
something completely different and

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.339 
something completely different and
hopefully<00:03:04.419> even<00:03:05.109> better<00:03:06.540> they<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.840> given<00:03:08.079> me

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
hopefully even better they have given me

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.879 
hopefully even better they have given me
so<00:03:08.709> much<00:03:08.889> freedom<00:03:09.189> and<00:03:09.639> so<00:03:09.849> much<00:03:10.060> support<00:03:10.889> and

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
so much freedom and so much support and

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.500 
so much freedom and so much support and
they're<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.790> enthusiastic<00:03:13.799> about<00:03:15.329> what<00:03:16.329> we're

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
they're so enthusiastic about what we're

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.440 
they're so enthusiastic about what we're
doing<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:18.519> energy<00:03:18.969> seems<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:20.590> have<00:03:21.090> well<00:03:22.090> it's

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
doing the energy seems to have well it's

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.860 
doing the energy seems to have well it's
it's<00:03:22.689> just<00:03:22.780> endless<00:03:23.169> their<00:03:23.859> energy

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.979 

I<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:29.180> we've<00:03:29.330> taken<00:03:29.569> something

that's that's classic and beautiful and

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.420 
that's that's classic and beautiful and
that<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.010> themes<00:03:34.370> are<00:03:35.440> important<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.959> that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
that the themes are important but that

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.539 
that the themes are important but that
