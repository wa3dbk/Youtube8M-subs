when I put this on my phone so if you're

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.170 
when I put this on my phone so if you're
someone<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.069> lives<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.579> an<00:03:09.670> area<00:03:09.819> where

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
someone that lives in an area where

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.640 
someone that lives in an area where
reception<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.810> really<00:03:10.840> good<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.560> you're

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
reception is really good so you're

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.680 
reception is really good so you're
getting<00:03:11.950> four<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.640> five<00:03:12.790> bars<00:03:13.060> all<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.480> time

getting four and five bars all the time

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.449 
getting four and five bars all the time
this<00:03:13.930> probably<00:03:14.470> will<00:03:14.620> not<00:03:14.829> be<00:03:15.040> an<00:03:15.130> issue<00:03:15.280> for

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
this probably will not be an issue for

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.699 
this probably will not be an issue for
you<00:03:15.940> however<00:03:16.720> if<00:03:16.959> you're<00:03:17.109> someone<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.440> lives
