 collective can also be surveyed 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:06.399
 interviewed to treat France plays since 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.710
 long of I do not know what and and of 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:14.710
 almost nothing but for some time 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:18.720
 nothing is okay it's paralysis 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 everything is there as we say 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.759
 need a good cure of 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.640
 detoxification of an analysis in 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.700
 depth of reasons for his dismay 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.880
 so that his decline is not 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.890
 confirmed by triple went to 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.890
 chaotic weapons 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.610
 France I beg you to sit on 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.120
 this divine let's say rather than you 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.979
 kneel yes I know I know that 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.380
 you did not stand anymore but that's 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.140
 not a reason to tell me that you 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.420
 are not lower than land 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.440
 the bitterness does not justify the inked sees 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.940
 France 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.100
 I listen to you I hear your sufferings 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.770
 I understand your grievances but in 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.090
 psychology we can not attribute the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.910
 fault with no luck 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.580
 we can not get rid of his 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.190
 responsibilities by invoking the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.980
 conjuncture or the relationship of forces 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.890
 we are always there for something 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.989
 just by referring to it in France 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.430
 france france do not tell me especially 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.860
 that these are your last two lovers who 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.440
 have put you in this state I do not you 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.080
 will not follow either on this slope that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.810
 all all the bad fair wears 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.470
 and then your lovers have chosen you 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.700
 you elected them you carried them 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.250
 to the naked 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.350
 so you can take it but 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.709
 than you, but what is heartbreaking 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.810
 and neurotic at the same time it's not 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.010
 so much to get bled white in a 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.320
 time but to be it all the time and 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.380
 by the same languages 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:14.660
 it's a self mutilation cash rehearsal 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:20.329
 that you an unbalanced I would even say 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:24.290
 at a strange France regulations you 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.370
 are sick and your illness is 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.030
 paradoxically 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.600
 where every well-born soul who has never

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:42.769
