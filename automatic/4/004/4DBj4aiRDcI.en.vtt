 That's why we have such a special one 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.350
 sound that is rebuilt around the camp and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.200
 if someone comes up against it then it will shut 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.790
 an alarm shot fired today but 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.860
 Tomorrow we got up in the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.750
 length after on the floor of the shoot 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.520
 not be triggered tonight yet 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.920
 take a closer look to be sure 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.820
 that we are not uninvited at night 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.820
 get visitors 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.780
 polarregion has me from childhood on 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.880
 fascinate four read as 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.070
 teenager have the books over 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.900
 Amundsen Scott as they all said 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.330
 devoured 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.430
 and I have been in the early years 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.950
 actually determined my life 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.990
 to be true that I yes in 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.990
 This million is also on the way 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.980
 one notices which force with more vehemence 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.720
 as such a storm can continue to set up 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.540
 also with a sailing ship 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.360
 to be an ocean where you suddenly day 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.640
 long knows the heaviest storm the way 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.640
 must be to assert itself 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.850
 if you are frozen with a ship 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.370
 is somewhere in Greenland ice in 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.680
 the northwest passage or in siberia 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.660
 You just have to be patient 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.430
 wait until the ice is perfect or 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.430
 that the weather will be different 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.340
 my critical temperatures are up 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.980
 have yourself experienced go down to 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.780
 at minus 60 degrees in siberia 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.060
 but also during the printing of 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.190
 expedition we have temperatures of 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.400
 up to minus 56 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.620
 But then there was that just got to be 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.760
 where I can not escape 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.760
 and also does not want to escape 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.380

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.960
 one in germany where i live and 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.200
 governing in the wild 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.300

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.600
