grip<00:00:44.270> now<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> center<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> cutout

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
grip now in the center we have a cutout

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.490 
grip now in the center we have a cutout
for<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> apple<00:00:47.730> 30-pin<00:00:47.940> connector<00:00:48.469> however<00:00:49.469> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
for the apple 30-pin connector however I

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
for the apple 30-pin connector however I
also<00:00:49.649> found<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.399> other<00:00:50.670> connector<00:00:51.329> types

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
also found that other connector types

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840 
also found that other connector types
fit<00:00:52.410> through<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.890> without<00:00:53.280> too<00:00:53.640> much

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
fit through here without too much

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.500 
fit through here without too much
difficulty<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.640> an<00:00:57.000> ipod<00:00:57.300> touch

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
difficulty so here I have an ipod touch

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.569 
difficulty so here I have an ipod touch
and<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.320> wanted<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> put<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> spider

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and if I wanted to put it on the spider

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
and if I wanted to put it on the spider
podium<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> place<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.620> in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
podium all I have to do is place it in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
podium all I have to do is place it in
the<00:01:01.739> center<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:03.210> these<00:01:03.480> legs<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.989> so

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the center and because these legs are so

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560 
the center and because these legs are so
flexible<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> need<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.180> simply

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
flexible all I need to do is simply

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.390 
flexible all I need to do is simply
place<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.920> legs<00:01:08.100> around<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.700> device<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
place the legs around the device and

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
place the legs around the device and
wrap<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.610> around

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
wrap it around

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.960 
wrap it around
like<00:01:14.470> so<00:01:16.380> also<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.620> extra<00:01:17.950> grip<00:01:18.190> provided<00:01:18.790> by

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
like so also the extra grip provided by

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.240 
like so also the extra grip provided by
the<00:01:19.030> legs<00:01:19.330> means<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.260> spider<00:01:20.590> podium<00:01:21.070> is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
the legs means that the spider podium is

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.330 
the legs means that the spider podium is
ideal<00:01:21.790> for<00:01:22.450> unstable<00:01:22.900> environments<00:01:23.680> such<00:01:24.280> as

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
ideal for unstable environments such as

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.570 
ideal for unstable environments such as
on<00:01:24.730> a<00:01:24.760> plane<00:01:25.120> or<00:01:25.450> in<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.780> car<00:01:26.050> however<00:01:27.010> I<00:01:27.280> myself

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
on a plane or in a car however I myself

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.390 
on a plane or in a car however I myself
like<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.120> have<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.690> product<00:01:29.080> set<00:01:29.470> up<00:01:29.620> in<00:01:29.800> this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
like to have the product set up in this

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.430 
like to have the product set up in this
desktop<00:01:30.910> format<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:31.660> that<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.870> can<00:01:31.930> browse<00:01:32.260> the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
desktop format so that I can browse the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.130 
desktop format so that I can browse the
web<00:01:32.619> but<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.430> could<00:01:33.760> even<00:01:33.880> rotate<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.020> device

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
web but I could even rotate the device

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.280 
web but I could even rotate the device
into<00:01:35.740> landscape<00:01:36.610> orientation<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.900> viewing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
into landscape orientation for viewing

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.000 
into landscape orientation for viewing
videos<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.369> playing<00:01:40.119> games<00:01:40.770> another<00:01:41.770> cool

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
videos and playing games another cool

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.160 
videos and playing games another cool
feature<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:42.970> can<00:01:43.090> even<00:01:43.510> attach<00:01:43.960> the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
feature is that you can even attach the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.859 
feature is that you can even attach the
product<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> bike<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.850> obviously<00:01:46.570> this

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
product to a bike and obviously this

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.930 
product to a bike and obviously this
would<00:01:47.050> make<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.440> ideal<00:01:47.619> for<00:01:47.940> navigation

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
would make it ideal for navigation

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.469 
would make it ideal for navigation
applications<00:01:49.800> in<00:01:50.800> terms<00:01:51.160> of<00:01:51.310> disadvantages<00:01:52.240> I

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
applications in terms of disadvantages I

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.020 
applications in terms of disadvantages I
did<00:01:53.200> find<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.560> placing<00:01:54.070> devices<00:01:54.490> onto<00:01:54.759> the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
did find that placing devices onto the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.330 
did find that placing devices onto the
spike<00:01:55.270> bodiam<00:01:55.750> can<00:01:56.170> be<00:01:56.290> very<00:01:56.530> tedious<00:01:56.830> because

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
spike bodiam can be very tedious because

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.820 
spike bodiam can be very tedious because
it<00:01:57.670> does<00:01:57.850> take<00:01:58.119> one<00:01:58.360> time<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:59.530> ensure<00:01:59.680> that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
it does take one time to ensure that

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.940 
it does take one time to ensure that
your<00:02:00.160> device<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.460> safely<00:02:01.030> held<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.500> future

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
your device is safely held in the future

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.950 
your device is safely held in the future
I<00:02:03.100> would<00:02:03.190> like<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.610> see<00:02:03.790> Bravo<00:02:04.240> improving<00:02:04.869> the

product so that's securing our device to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.830 
product so that's securing our device to
the<00:02:07.090> podium<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.290> much<00:02:08.649> quicker<00:02:08.920> process<00:02:09.220> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the podium is a much quicker process I
