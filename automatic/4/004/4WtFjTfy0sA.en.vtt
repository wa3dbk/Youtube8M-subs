00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.710
 Your day 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.159
 on his frank day in his private vehicle 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.990

 a baby a trade in the area 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.539
 d so that when leaving it he realized full prey persecution and 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.239
 this was sacrificial I do not say 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.390
 sd but today with mentioning it and from 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 important to mention that he sacrificed his vehicle including his integrity 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.260
 the physics of this one somehow quarter the level 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 circulation to the vehicle 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 is on television colt or coke percent subjects 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.960
 by the way to impact parity control and impact two others 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.680
 vehicles that were in another trade in front 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.860
 and enter at that moment for the intervention first the police 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.950
 the state ministerial 7 the encore 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.610
 nation with this corporation 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.610
 because there we achieved the assurance of the three subjects 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.950
 not fortunately fortunately, it did not happen of him scare and little of this one 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.760
 elections that do not put in well 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.420
 in danger nor his 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.450
 You saw 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.580
 it feels good physically because it is really can it was 6 percent 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.820
 quite unfortunately, by the way, he is in condition 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.820
 stable 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.789
 well, somehow 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.189
 We do not have anything concrete, this is working hours and we have 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.100
 well in the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890
 the dfb 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.040
 the intention to search in some way in what way you could 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.110
 support 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.320
 in that sense we believe then what 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.660
 that an act of sacrifice that nature then ere 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.260
 it is important it is important your letters look for the way to support it and 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.470
 do with that file on the part of the institution institution bread will look for pri 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.729
 I'm sure there's going to be some route 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.929
 of success in that sense
