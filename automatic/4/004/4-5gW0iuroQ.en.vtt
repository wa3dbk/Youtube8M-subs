00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 tame the dragon 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.780
 today we have a toy again like graphite 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.059
 dragon 2 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.840
 Yesterday afternoon I managed to get here 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.260
 This is a miracle, this is our toothless too 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.760
 how my big only he is completely different 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 much less besides the expression 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:36.810
 his faces are different than mine 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:40.430
 big see this here and also he 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.890
 there is a special racing coloring like 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:49.350
 You are here on the paws on the head on the wings 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.670
 here and also the second half is painted over 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.140
 tail he can so here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.140
 turn head 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:08.010
 also his paws don't move him 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:13.050
 there are such translucent wings also 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:19.520
 can fold like this and we them 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:24.450
 can we get you back here and when he 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.370
 but with folded wings he gets up 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.650
 hind legs as all this 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:33.330
 outweighs 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:37.350
 This is our toothless with a barrel function and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.049
 so he started making a barrel we just but 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.690
 for so you can say we twist it 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.690
 tail like this 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:58.500
 and then we push him over here 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.270
 such a button disguised as a spike and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.430
 he starts making his barrel 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.390
 this is very cool realistic 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.440
 looks the same in the saddle toothless y 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.580
 we can land and king 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.100
 Now we have a king without teeth 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.150
 notice what's on my big toothless and 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.670
 he sits better than on this all the more 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:35.620
 that he can not stand a barrel 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:43.870
 Look here for the first time 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:46.360

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.610

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.970
