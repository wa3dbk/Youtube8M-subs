there<00:00:05.640> are<00:00:05.730> actually<00:00:06.060> two<00:00:06.240> options<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.810> place

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
there are actually two options in place

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.840 
there are actually two options in place
in<00:00:07.380> the<00:00:07.500> hair<00:00:07.650> follicles<00:00:08.190> with<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.760> every

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
in the hair follicles with the every

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.129 
in the hair follicles with the every
technique<00:00:09.360> one<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.010> common<00:00:11.550> way<00:00:11.900> used<00:00:12.900> in

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
technique one is the common way used in

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.600 
technique one is the common way used in
the<00:00:13.230> older<00:00:13.500> techniques<00:00:13.860> as<00:00:13.980> well<00:00:14.160> which

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
the older techniques as well which

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.170 
the older techniques as well which
requires<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.660> opening<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.320> small<00:00:16.650> holes<00:00:17.340> in

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
requires the opening of small holes in

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.960 
requires the opening of small holes in
our<00:00:18.630> recipient<00:00:19.410> area<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
our recipient area and then the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.030 
our recipient area and then the
placement<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.540> the<00:00:21.660> hair<00:00:21.840> follicles<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
placement of the hair follicles with the

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
placement of the hair follicles with the
specific<00:00:23.660> forceps<00:00:25.340> however<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.850> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
specific forceps however there is a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.460 
specific forceps however there is a
newer<00:00:27.510> technique<00:00:29.150> involving<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.450> use<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
newer technique involving the use of a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.799 
newer technique involving the use of a
special<00:00:31.590> device<00:00:32.040> called<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.790> implant<00:00:33.270> which

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
special device called the implant which

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.680 
special device called the implant which
allow<00:00:34.110> us<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:35.039> place<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> hair<00:00:35.910> follicle<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.510> a
