all<00:00:07.190> right<00:00:07.400> double<00:00:07.790> stops<00:00:08.060> example<00:00:08.660> number

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
all right double stops example number

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.250 
all right double stops example number
one<00:00:09.550> so<00:00:10.550> what<00:00:10.700> I'm<00:00:10.790> doing<00:00:10.820> here<00:00:11.059> is<00:00:11.480> I'm

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
one so what I'm doing here is I'm

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.740 
one so what I'm doing here is I'm
playing<00:00:12.469> double<00:00:12.950> stops<00:00:13.160> out<00:00:13.460> of<00:00:13.670> common<00:00:14.300> chord

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
playing double stops out of common chord

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.580 
playing double stops out of common chord
shapes<00:00:15.490> so<00:00:16.490> this<00:00:16.939> tune<00:00:17.210> starts<00:00:18.020> in<00:00:18.140> G<00:00:18.320> so<00:00:18.529> I'm

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
shapes so this tune starts in G so I'm

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.170 
shapes so this tune starts in G so I'm
visualizing<00:00:19.099> that<00:00:19.460> G<00:00:19.640> here<00:00:19.880> in<00:00:20.000> third

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
visualizing that G here in third

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.230 
visualizing that G here in third
position<00:00:20.689> we<00:00:21.160> also<00:00:22.160> have<00:00:22.369> B<00:00:22.579> flats<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:23.150> this

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
position we also have B flats in this

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.679 
position we also have B flats in this
tune

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
tune

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.950 
tune
so<00:00:23.869> I'm<00:00:23.960> visualizing<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.890> b-flat<00:00:25.779> that<00:00:26.779> might

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
so I'm visualizing a b-flat that might

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.929 
so I'm visualizing a b-flat that might
look<00:00:27.110> like<00:00:27.169> a<00:00:27.320> strange<00:00:27.710> b-flat<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:28.400> you<00:00:28.489> but<00:00:28.730> if

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
look like a strange b-flat to you but if

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.920 
look like a strange b-flat to you but if
you<00:00:29.540> visualize<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:30.230> open<00:00:31.009> G<00:00:31.220> chord<00:00:31.250> and<00:00:31.930> then

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
you visualize the open G chord and then

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.500 
you visualize the open G chord and then
move<00:00:33.200> it<00:00:33.350> up<00:00:33.500> to<00:00:33.530> b-flat<00:00:34.090> pulling<00:00:35.090> those<00:00:35.180> open

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
move it up to b-flat pulling those open

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.630 
move it up to b-flat pulling those open
strings<00:00:35.780> along<00:00:35.899> with<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:37.180> not<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:38.390> weird<00:00:39.640> next

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
strings along with it not so weird next

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.020 
strings along with it not so weird next
chord<00:00:40.850> is<00:00:40.940> C<00:00:40.969> going<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:42.410> my<00:00:42.500> closest<00:00:42.920> C<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.699> the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
chord is C going to my closest C and the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.729 
chord is C going to my closest C and the
last<00:00:44.269> chord<00:00:44.510> we're<00:00:44.629> going<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:44.780> need<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.140> D<00:00:45.440> and

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
last chord we're going to need is D and

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.419 
last chord we're going to need is D and
I'm<00:00:45.980> going<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:46.250> my<00:00:46.809> closest<00:00:47.809> D<00:00:48.050> that's<00:00:48.710> a<00:00:49.070> C

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
I'm going to my closest D that's a C

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.479 
I'm going to my closest D that's a C
chord<00:00:49.699> that<00:00:50.449> I've<00:00:50.600> moved<00:00:50.870> up<00:00:51.079> and<00:00:51.489> barred

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
chord that I've moved up and barred

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.419 
chord that I've moved up and barred
across<00:00:52.789> for<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.059> open<00:00:53.359> strings<00:00:53.980> so<00:00:54.980> all<00:00:55.190> of<00:00:55.339> my

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
across for the open strings so all of my

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:56.650 
across for the open strings so all of my
double<00:00:55.730> stops<00:00:55.910> are<00:00:56.120> coming<00:00:56.390> out<00:00:56.510> of

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
double stops are coming out of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.599 
double stops are coming out of
visualizing<00:00:57.079> these<00:00:57.379> shapes<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:58.129> I<00:00:58.339> try<00:00:58.550> to

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
visualizing these shapes and I try to

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.729 
visualizing these shapes and I try to
keep<00:00:58.789> all<00:00:58.999> these<00:00:59.149> shapes<00:00:59.410> you<00:01:00.410> know<00:01:00.499> around

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
keep all these shapes you know around

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.169 
keep all these shapes you know around
the<00:01:00.920> same<00:01:01.129> position<00:01:01.550> or<00:01:01.640> close<00:01:01.850> I'm<00:01:02.030> not

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
the same position or close I'm not

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.590 
the same position or close I'm not
jumping<00:01:02.600> around<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.929> neck<00:01:04.180> as<00:01:05.180> far<00:01:05.360> as<00:01:05.449> the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
jumping around the neck as far as the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.680 
jumping around the neck as far as the
right<00:01:05.870> hand<00:01:06.230> goes<00:01:06.970> with<00:01:07.970> these<00:01:08.180> double<00:01:08.480> stops

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
right hand goes with these double stops

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.290 
right hand goes with these double stops
as<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.470> general<00:01:10.010> rule<00:01:10.190> if<00:01:10.640> there's<00:01:10.910> two<00:01:11.120> notes

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
as a general rule if there's two notes

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.960 
as a general rule if there's two notes
being<00:01:11.510> played<00:01:11.630> I'm<00:01:12.200> doing<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.100> with<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.460> ring

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
being played I'm doing it with the ring

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.070 
being played I'm doing it with the ring
and<00:01:14.270> middle<00:01:14.570> finger<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:16.900> popping<00:01:17.900> those

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
and middle finger and popping those

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.950 
and middle finger and popping those
strings<00:01:19.120> if<00:01:20.120> they're<00:01:20.300> single<00:01:20.630> notes<00:01:20.810> being

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
strings if they're single notes being

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.570 
strings if they're single notes being
played<00:01:21.050> I'm<00:01:21.620> probably<00:01:21.950> doing<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.370> with<00:01:22.460> the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
played I'm probably doing it with the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:31.750 
played I'm probably doing it with the
pick<00:01:29.260> so<00:01:30.260> there<00:01:30.590> are<00:01:30.710> times<00:01:31.070> when<00:01:31.400> I'm<00:01:31.490> playing

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
pick so there are times when I'm playing

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.180 
pick so there are times when I'm playing
pick<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.900> middle<00:01:33.410> finger<00:01:33.680> together<00:01:39.070> okay<00:01:40.070> and

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
pick and middle finger together okay and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.530 
pick and middle finger together okay and
sometimes<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.580> break<00:01:40.760> these<00:01:40.910> rules<00:01:41.000> but<00:01:41.510> for

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
sometimes I break these rules but for

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.720 
sometimes I break these rules but for
the<00:01:41.810> most<00:01:41.960> part<00:01:42.250> 90%<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.370> time<00:01:43.520> that's

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
the most part 90% of the time that's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.410 
the most part 90% of the time that's
what<00:01:43.910> I'm<00:01:44.030> doing<00:01:44.300> down<00:01:44.450> here<00:01:46.060> as<00:01:47.060> far<00:01:47.270> as<00:01:47.330> the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
what I'm doing down here as far as the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.390 
what I'm doing down here as far as the
embellishment<00:01:48.020> goes<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.290> these<00:01:48.410> chords<00:01:49.100> I'm

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
embellishment goes to these chords I'm

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.330 
embellishment goes to these chords I'm
using<00:01:49.910> some<00:01:50.360> half-step<00:01:50.780> approaches<00:01:51.380> to

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
using some half-step approaches to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.000 
using some half-step approaches to
different<00:01:52.460> pieces<00:01:52.760> of<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.120> chord<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.010> for

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
different pieces of the chord so for

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.010 
different pieces of the chord so for
instance<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:56.030> G<00:01:56.210> chord<00:01:56.510> if<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:56.690> take<00:01:56.900> these

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
instance in this G chord if I take these

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.650 
instance in this G chord if I take these
two<00:01:57.260> notes<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.800> could<00:01:58.220> approach<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.120> bottom<00:01:59.510> or

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
two notes I could approach the bottom or

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.880 
two notes I could approach the bottom or
the<00:01:59.690> highest<00:02:00.050> one<00:02:00.380> from<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.590> half-step

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
the highest one from a half-step

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.000 
the highest one from a half-step
underneath<00:02:02.110> or<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.170> can<00:02:03.320> approach<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.740> bottom

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
underneath or I can approach the bottom

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.300 
underneath or I can approach the bottom
one<00:02:04.130> from<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.400> half-step<00:02:04.700> underneath<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
one from a half-step underneath the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.339 
one from a half-step underneath the
other<00:02:07.460> approaches<00:02:07.940> I'm<00:02:08.090> using<00:02:08.300> our<00:02:08.720> pedal

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
other approaches I'm using our pedal

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.839 
other approaches I'm using our pedal
tone<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.769> I'm<00:02:09.830> keeping<00:02:10.039> one<00:02:10.429> note<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.670> the

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
tone so I'm keeping one note of the

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.720 
tone so I'm keeping one note of the
double<00:02:11.120> stop<00:02:11.300> stationary<00:02:12.460> while<00:02:13.460> I<00:02:13.490> move

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
double stop stationary while I move

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.840 
double stop stationary while I move
another<00:02:14.030> note<00:02:14.240> around

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.650 

okay<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:19.910> let's<00:02:20.150> take<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.330> look<00:02:20.480> at<00:02:20.600> this

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
okay so let's take a look at this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.090 
okay so let's take a look at this
example<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.260> see<00:02:21.320> how<00:02:21.410> all<00:02:21.620> these<00:02:21.740> things<00:02:21.800> are

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
example and see how all these things are

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.900 
example and see how all these things are
kind<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.310> fitting<00:02:22.580> together<00:02:23.170> over<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.290> G

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
kind of fitting together over the G

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.600 
kind of fitting together over the G
herring<00:02:25.910> onto<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.270> seven<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.340> there's<00:02:31.520> an

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
herring onto the seven so there's an

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.170 
herring onto the seven so there's an
example<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.120> petal<00:02:32.600> tone<00:02:32.780> being<00:02:33.020> use

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
example of that petal tone being use

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.460 
example of that petal tone being use
give<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.390> high<00:02:35.600> G<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:35.960> top<00:02:36.230> that's

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
give this high G on top that's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:45.490 
give this high G on top that's
sustaining<00:02:43.660> here's<00:02:44.660> another<00:02:44.930> pedal<00:02:45.350> tone

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
sustaining here's another pedal tone

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.930 
sustaining here's another pedal tone
basically<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.100> same<00:02:46.280> lick<00:02:46.490> but<00:02:46.640> an<00:02:46.760> octave

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
basically the same lick but an octave

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.300 
basically the same lick but an octave
lower<00:02:52.240> okay<00:02:53.240> now<00:02:53.570> I'm<00:02:53.690> going<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.900> be

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
lower okay now I'm going to be

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.440 
lower okay now I'm going to be
approaching<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.580> double<00:02:55.910> stop<00:02:56.060> from<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.300> half

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
approaching this double stop from a half

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.010 
approaching this double stop from a half
step<00:02:56.660> underneath<00:02:58.510> doing<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.600> same<00:02:59.780> with<00:02:59.900> the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
step underneath doing the same with the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.160 
step underneath doing the same with the
next<00:03:00.140> double<00:03:00.500> stop<00:03:01.990> next<00:03:02.990> one

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.229 

and<00:03:07.170> then<00:03:07.560> I'm<00:03:07.680> anticipating<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.640> B<00:03:08.879> flat

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
and then I'm anticipating this B flat

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.330 
and then I'm anticipating this B flat
chord<00:03:12.230> okay<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.470> for<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.739> those<00:03:14.010> tops<00:03:14.220> you

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
chord okay and for that those tops you

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220 
chord okay and for that those tops you
know<00:03:14.459> it's<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.730> imagining<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.720> G<00:03:15.870> chord<00:03:15.900> like

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
know it's on imagining a G chord like

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.140 
know it's on imagining a G chord like
this

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
this

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.570 
this
just<00:03:18.150> moved<00:03:18.450> up<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.840> b-flat<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:20.430> where

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
just moved up to b-flat so that's where

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.369 
just moved up to b-flat so that's where
these<00:03:20.670> come<00:03:20.730> from<00:03:26.569> now<00:03:27.569> I'm<00:03:27.750> out<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.930> our<00:03:28.140> C

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
these come from now I'm out of our C

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.800 
these come from now I'm out of our C
chord<00:03:28.590> shape<00:03:32.060> there's<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.150> pedal<00:03:33.330> tune<00:03:33.569> on<00:03:33.720> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
chord shape there's a pedal tune on the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.870 
chord shape there's a pedal tune on the
bottom<00:03:34.110> for<00:03:34.290> you

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.680 

back<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.660> G<00:03:42.970> they're<00:03:43.970> gonna<00:03:44.060> do<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.240> little<00:03:44.390> Bend

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
back to G they're gonna do a little Bend

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.750 
back to G they're gonna do a little Bend
release<00:03:44.990> on<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.680> double<00:03:46.010> stop

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.490 

over<00:03:53.659> to<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.870> b-flat<00:03:58.989> that<00:03:59.989> little<00:04:00.260> pattern

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
over to the b-flat that little pattern

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.009 
over to the b-flat that little pattern
has<00:04:01.190> come<00:04:01.430> up<00:04:01.580> before<00:04:01.849> in<00:04:02.330> this<00:04:02.480> whole<00:04:02.629> chorus

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
has come up before in this whole chorus

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.149 
has come up before in this whole chorus
so<00:04:03.140> it's<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.349> great<00:04:03.620> pattern<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:05.420> I'm

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
so it's a great pattern and I'm

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.080 
so it's a great pattern and I'm
approaching<00:04:07.159> the<00:04:07.250> spot<00:04:07.549> that's<00:04:07.760> bottom

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
approaching the spot that's bottom

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.449 
approaching the spot that's bottom
another<00:04:08.239> double<00:04:08.629> shot<00:04:08.780> from<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:09.310> whole<00:04:10.310> step

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
another double shot from a whole step

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.949 
another double shot from a whole step
attorneys<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.090> walking<00:04:11.690> into<00:04:11.840> a

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
low note of the double stop and going

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.310 
low note of the double stop and going
back<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.239> forth<00:04:20.449> in<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.780> out<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.049> chord

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
back and forth in and out of the chord

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:37.230 
back and forth in and out of the chord
tone<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:35.090> that's<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.300> interval<00:04:35.630> of<00:04:35.690> a<00:04:35.810> six

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
tone so that's the interval of a six

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.400

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
familiar c7 shape pretty close to this

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.719 
familiar c7 shape pretty close to this
one<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.900> kind<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:48.289> jumped<00:04:48.680> shapes<00:04:48.919> on<00:04:49.130> him<00:04:51.729> into

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
one I kind of jumped shapes on him into

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:01.060 
one I kind of jumped shapes on him into
our<00:04:52.880> D

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.820 

this<00:05:02.060> is<00:05:02.180> a<00:05:02.270> bottom<00:05:03.050> voicing<00:05:03.500> here<00:05:03.680> you've

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
this is a bottom voicing here you've

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.080 
this is a bottom voicing here you've
probably<00:05:03.950> done<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.280> million<00:05:04.580> times<00:05:04.700> when

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
probably done a million times when

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.760 
probably done a million times when
you've<00:05:05.210> played<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.420> C<00:05:05.720> chord<00:05:06.020> with<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.440> fifth

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
you've played a C chord with the fifth

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.850 
you've played a C chord with the fifth
on<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:06.950> bottom<00:05:08.410> that's<00:05:09.410> where<00:05:09.530> I'm<00:05:09.710> getting

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
on the bottom that's where I'm getting

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.910 
on the bottom that's where I'm getting
that<00:05:10.130> from<00:05:13.930> then<00:05:14.930> I'm<00:05:15.020> gonna<00:05:15.110> rake<00:05:15.440> into<00:05:15.800> my

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
that from then I'm gonna rake into my

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.240 
that from then I'm gonna rake into my
flat<00:05:16.250> third<00:05:16.670> of<00:05:17.030> G<00:05:20.230> landing<00:05:21.230> on<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.440> root<00:05:21.620> okay

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
flat third of G landing on the root okay

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.320 
flat third of G landing on the root okay
so<00:05:22.310> let's<00:05:22.550> start<00:05:22.790> this<00:05:23.000> from<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.270> beginning

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
so let's start this from the beginning

00:05:23.330 --> 00:06:23.790 
so let's start this from the beginning
I'll<00:05:23.810> do<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.170> in<00:05:24.260> time<00:05:24.500> really<00:05:25.280> slowly

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.860 

you
