out to figure out how to make them and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.230 
out to figure out how to make them and
now<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.950> bunch<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.490> these<00:00:20.640> fun<00:00:20.910> stars

okay so the first thing I did is I took
my<00:00:23.940> paper<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:25.350> folded<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.860> in<00:00:26.010> half<00:00:26.039> and

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
my paper and I folded it in half and

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.779 
my paper and I folded it in half and
increase<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.810> full<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:29.310> let's<00:00:29.550> fold

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
increase that full and then let's fold

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.450 
increase that full and then let's fold
it<00:00:29.970> lightly<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.720> half<00:00:31.020> just<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.010> get<00:00:32.189> my

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
halfway mark now I'm going to take my

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.080 
halfway mark now I'm going to take my
paper<00:00:35.910> meet<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.140> little<00:00:37.500> fold<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.579> right

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
paper meet that little fold here right

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
paper meet that little fold here right
there's<00:00:39.390> where<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.870> fold<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.010> let's<00:00:41.250> meet

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
there's where that fold is so let's meet

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.580 
there's where that fold is so let's meet
that<00:00:41.700> point<00:00:42.920> grease<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:45.290> then<00:00:46.290> let's

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that point grease that and then let's

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.049 
that point grease that and then let's
fold<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.160> over<00:00:48.770> there<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
fold that over there we go and then I

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.709 
fold that over there we go and then I
flip<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.660> fold<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> back<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.739> itself<00:00:53.719> just

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
flip it and fold it back on itself just

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.910 
flip it and fold it back on itself just
like<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:56.629> okay<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.200> now<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.469> have

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920

like that okay and then now you have
kind<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> a<00:01:00.200> swirl<00:01:01.200> tight<00:01:01.590> side<00:01:01.950> here<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.579> just

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
kind of a swirl tight side here I'm just

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
kind of a swirl tight side here I'm just
gonna<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.809> thick<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.440> so<00:01:04.649> I'm<00:01:04.739> ready

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
gonna a little thick there so I'm ready

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.249 
gonna a little thick there so I'm ready
adjusting<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.610> bold<00:01:05.880> okay<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
adjusting that bold okay and then the

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.820 
adjusting that bold okay and then the
angle<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.890> cut<00:01:08.310> your<00:01:08.970> full<00:01:09.690> your<00:01:10.050> one

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
angle that you cut your full your one

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.499 
angle that you cut your full your one
cut<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.429> determines<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.509> angle<00:01:12.899> of<00:01:13.020> your

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
cut here determines the angle of your

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.710 
cut here determines the angle of your
points<00:01:15.509> cut<00:01:16.319> that<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:17.270> then<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> unfold

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
points cut that off then when you unfold

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
points cut that off then when you unfold
it<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:21.929> star<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:23.039> need<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> take

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it you have your star you need to take

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.469 
it you have your star you need to take
the<00:01:23.880> long<00:01:25.280> points<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.429> make<00:01:26.940> sure<00:01:27.149> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the long points and make sure that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.080 
the long points and make sure that
they're<00:01:27.810> up<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.770> shorter<00:01:29.310> lines<00:01:29.580> need<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
they're up and the shorter lines need to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.270 
they're up and the shorter lines need to
be<00:01:30.270> down<00:01:30.539> so<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.899> might<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.289> press<00:01:32.039> some

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
be down so you might have to press some

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.029 
be down so you might have to press some
of<00:01:32.399> those<00:01:32.490> folds<00:01:33.030> back<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.899> opposite<00:01:34.289> way<00:01:34.470> ok

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
of those folds back the opposite way ok

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.100 
of those folds back the opposite way ok
there's<00:01:35.399> my<00:01:35.459> star<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.179> then<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.780> next<00:01:36.929> thing

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
there's my star and then the next thing

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.100

I did there we got justing that bold is
I<00:01:40.830> took<00:01:42.860> my<00:01:44.209> star<00:01:45.209> and<00:01:45.660> then<00:01:45.929> I<00:01:46.110> took<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.860> multi

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
I took my star and then I took the multi

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.190 
I took my star and then I took the multi
tambo<00:01:47.880> multi<00:01:48.209> decent<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.660> put<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.840> line

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
tambo multi decent and I just put a line

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.109 
tambo multi decent and I just put a line
of<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:53.840> line<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.110> glue<00:01:55.410> around<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.630> each<00:01:58.489> of<00:01:59.489> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
of a line of glue around the each of the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
of a line of glue around the each of the
points<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:00.989> I<00:02:01.050> did<00:02:01.229> about<00:02:01.349> half<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.039> star

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
points and I did about half of the star

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.400 
points and I did about half of the star
then<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.119> went<00:02:03.239> back<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.479> did<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.959> rest<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.130 
then I went back and did the rest and
then<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> opened<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:05.009> my<00:02:05.220> glass<00:02:05.429> glitter<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
then I opened up my glass glitter and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.699 
then I opened up my glass glitter and
just<00:02:08.390> poured<00:02:09.390> that

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
just poured that

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.350 
just poured that
over<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.860> top<00:02:12.099> like<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.819> then

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
over the top like that and then

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.050 
over the top like that and then
continued<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.080> around<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.190> rest<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.760> star

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
continued on around the rest of the star

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.210 
continued on around the rest of the star
just<00:02:16.750> like<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.050> did<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.260> those<00:02:17.410> first<00:02:17.680> ones<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
just like I did on those first ones and
