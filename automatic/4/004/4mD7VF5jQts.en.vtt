bolted from that room or had a panic
attack<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.950> passed<00:03:20.640> out<00:03:20.970> or<00:03:21.239> spewed<00:03:21.720> all<00:03:21.930> over

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
attack and passed out or spewed all over

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.259 
attack and passed out or spewed all over
the<00:03:22.260> floor<00:03:22.410> okay<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.100> would<00:03:23.580> not<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.820> making<00:03:23.970> out

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
the floor okay I would not be making out

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.729 
the floor okay I would not be making out
with<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.540> guy<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.260> just<00:03:25.470> doesn't<00:03:25.680> make

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
with the guy and it just doesn't make

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.500 
with the guy and it just doesn't make
any<00:03:25.800> sense<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.400> me<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.820> not<00:03:26.940> how<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.150> works

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
any sense to me that is not how it works

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.490 
any sense to me that is not how it works
and<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.220> wasn't<00:03:29.370> realistic<00:03:29.790> at<00:03:30.570> all<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
and it just wasn't realistic at all the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.290 
and it just wasn't realistic at all the
next<00:03:31.860> thing<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.130> was<00:03:32.250> really<00:03:32.580> disappointed<00:03:32.790> in

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
next thing I was really disappointed in

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.490 
next thing I was really disappointed in
was<00:03:34.019> how<00:03:35.090> stereotyped<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.630> characters

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
was how stereotyped the characters

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.840 
was how stereotyped the characters
