00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
version I don't like just chain because

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170

it puts the same pattern in over and
over<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.200> anyway<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.100> chain

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
over so anyway that's my chain
