good<00:01:38.250> drop<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.490> electronics<00:01:42.119> component

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
good drop and the electronics component

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.010 
good drop and the electronics component
fell<00:01:43.799> out<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.520> thing<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.659> actual

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
fell out of the thing this is the actual

button<00:01:46.320> part<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> light<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
button part to the light but the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.760 
button part to the light but the
pressure<00:01:49.829> switch<00:01:50.159> hooks<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.590> housing<00:01:52.590> is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
pressure switch hooks to the housing is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.550 
pressure switch hooks to the housing is
cracked<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.229> I'm

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
cracked like a like I'm

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
cracked like a like I'm
actually<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> try<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.640> pry<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
actually going to try and pry it a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.770 
actually going to try and pry it a
little<00:01:57.210> bit<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.780> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
little bit but you can see that and the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.429 
little bit but you can see that and the
mountain<00:02:01.110> broke<00:02:01.320> off<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.140> those<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.380> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
mountain broke off so for those of you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.059 
mountain broke off so for those of you
who<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.680> asking<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.340> my<00:02:05.630> perception<00:02:06.630> on

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
who are asking what my perception on

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.609 
who are asking what my perception on
