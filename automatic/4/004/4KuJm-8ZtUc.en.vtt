00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:12.210
 and this other video is chapter number 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.670
 3 of our survival life here 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 in green round because back that way 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.539
 of good game clinton thank you because no 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.220
 good people this time we play in this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.019
 huge area that we are seeing here that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.120
 Well we all know that that 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.550
 we start and 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.230
 the light station good for this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 bus station I have a few 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.490
 things of which I want to say because 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.600
 It's good because it's bad and that's not how it is 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.240
 good 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.180
 the advantages kuwait is too close 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.090
 we can grab it from the beginning 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.770
 of the rounds since round 1 is a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.920
 large area so obviously we can see 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.900
 that we have all this square because 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.989
 I'm changing, I 'm part of the 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 back and if we lock ourselves we can enter 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.790
 like to the station and there make the little ball 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.040
 and go out and we have all the space of 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.080
 new the truck always goes by there or 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.210
 you can always wait for you in álava 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.800
 you put on the lava that makes the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.870
 van zombies have to go through the lava 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.830
 maybe they burn and between the truck passes 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.140
 of the chinga we all have the m-14 and the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.159
 olimpia the m-14 improved until the round 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.720
 24 is good and it cleans good well in its 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.960
 case of it is too good up to 30 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.850
 good, but obviously you'll have to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.230
 shoot the two shot perfect 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.790
 place for light machine guns 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.160
 obviously people like me am doing 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.690
 I have right now the scale and improving 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.820
 more with shit is called has a few 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.150
 very strange men now but then 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.050
 obviously it 's too easy to network 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.550
 trace here with them and with it kill 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.440
 everything suddenly improved because the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.080
 wheel 36 already normal and it's like that 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.240
 you will not kill them what I would recommend 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.640
 make the little ball in the entire Midwest 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.400
 where they see me pass by here is a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.140
 kevin zraly relax technique and I tell the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 you can do back where you want and you go 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.830
 running to the bottom and when 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.720
 you get there you start shooting like crazy 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.660
 so that you start sending them and so not 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.670
 well I have two disadvantages for the ones with 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.300
 a few windows by which 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.220
 I do not like to be here you have to spend 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.830
 for the lava to take us let's say 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.599
 they take you for the same reason you will have to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.180
 go through this road is open kill 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.819
 to the zombies and it's pretty pretty 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.530
 difficult that 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.180
 the hangers are far away we will have 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.430
 to walk the entire tunnel to get to 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.780
 the next one but it will pass to get to the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.670
 govern or respective that explained yesterday 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.799
 is where behind very easy let's say here 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.219
 where is the truck the carts these 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.790
 fucking people behind that here to pass 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:45.260
 I get very easy and I think 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.879
 that that 's all moments you admire the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.519
 strategy that I'm trying to do is 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.310
 without omitting surround them I expected it to 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.109
 come in little ball like that and so on 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.480
 truck can be annoying yes because 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.189
 when you appear stage an area of ​​a 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.510
 stadium will no longer cover the area 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.639
 outside and that's why when you hear the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.599
 beep from the truck go directly to 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.180
 another extreme 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.799
 good the other corner of the area for 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.750
 that you can start to be correct and not 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.419
 have but also because the truck 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.859
 boat is for the road and you thinking 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.569
 what was missing so that it arrives or 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.579
 even pay attention to the sound of 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.680
 truck you turn around and that truck you 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:23.959
 cap and you can not pass and the zombies ter 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.890
 bordalás and ballistic as well as for 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.340
 see 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.959
 if it's a good strategy because to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.280
 sometimes yes he comes to say it's not the same 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.280
 pepper's I recommend 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:47.050
 picco if in case you have a lack and 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.050
 you could also choose 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.920
 it's a big green actually yes because 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.959
 I keep zombies coming to cover you and 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.180
 sweet whore flame correlate if you have 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.660
 you can have me take those 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.660
 zombies 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.719
 so I like it 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:23.500
 because in the next capital tomorrow of 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:23.500
 trànsit was going to see why
