00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:03.078
 Road ~ Kelu ~ grams 

00:00:03.078 --> 00:00:06.083
 I am Liu Ding (Imitating the Star Wars Darth Vader tone, originally I am your father) 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:09.082
 Wow! It’s the Hut Jabaya! (The Alien of Star Wars) 

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:11.091
 Jia Ba... What? 

00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:13.024
 No, I think you should be... 

00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:14.058
 Wrong? (Make it wrong, mix up = mix up) 

00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:16.027
 Do not! It’s you who is being stirred, Jia Ba (mix up also has the meaning of mixing, noodles) 

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:18.083
 Oh, I have a feeling of muscle strain. 

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.036
 Oh! Hey! Dough! 

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:21.044
 What is it? 

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:24.064
 Are you agitator when you are stirring, or are you agitator? 

00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:25.084
 Can you shut up? 

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:28.075
 Um, I think I have done my best (Liu Ding has said the best I could do as the homophonic yeast, yeast is yeast, it is hard to relate to this yeast dough) 

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:31.004
 Oh! Hey! Dough! 

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.090
 Shut me up, you stupid fruit 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.093
 Hey! Dough! 

00:00:33.093 --> 00:00:34.099
 What? ! 

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:35.092
 Rolling pin 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.007
 Wow! It’s really completely flattened (flat-out wrong is a big mistake) 

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.036
 Hey, have you tried to twist and see? 

00:00:46.036 --> 00:00:48.004
 Of course there are 

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:49.057
 But it didn't work, I was stuck all over. 

00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:51.050
 Then if you apply cream to your lubrication? 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.033
 I have already been creamed. 

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:55.079
 Hey, you don't have to tell me, dude. 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.053
 Today is the worst day ever!! 

00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:01.029
 Hey, what happened there... 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.010
 What? What? 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.002
 Um... nothing. 

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.043
 It doesn't sound like nothing. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.051
 Oh, no! 

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:18.092
 It’s hot! It’s hot here! 

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:22.040
 Wow, you should go for a shower. 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.000
 You don't seem to take a shower (crusty describes the crusty or crispy food, but the proverb also refers to people who don't take a bath, pun) 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.023
 I think what you said is my golden crispy shell. 

00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:29.017
 Tell you, Liu Ding 

00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:31.057
 The oven is the best thing I have ever encountered in my life. 

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:35.013
 I am strong and strong now, there is a feeling that the world is in the palm of my hand. 

00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:36.060
 Um... I don’t know. 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.007
 I only think that you look like a loafer (loafer also has the meaning of a leisurely person) 

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:45.042
 Are you saying that I just baked hot enough? (Note: full of hot air literally translated as full of heat, but this sentence has the meaning of empty mouth, and Liu Ding said loafer idlers also coincide, pun) 

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:51.047
 knife! 

00:01:53.098 --> 00:01:55.023
 Don't worry, bread 

00:01:55.023 --> 00:01:57.065
 Your injury will be good (Liu Ding is talking about heel repairing the heel, because he uses bread as a shoe. But heel and heal homophonic) 

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:59.032
 Oh no, this is very painful. 

00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:01.018
 Ah! My face! 

00:02:02.043 --> 00:02:03.092
 my face! 

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:08.091
 Where did the stupid shoe go? 

00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:14.054
 My face... no way... move... 

00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:18.041
 Hey, man, I see you are a toast. 

00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:22.026
 Oh, this feels really bad. 

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:25.000
 Dude, you are really miserable today. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.068
 Is this place very hot now or is it only me hot? 

00:02:26.068 --> 00:02:28.018
 I don't know yeah, let's ask for a cream. 

00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:35.050
 My face! My beautiful face!! 

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.073
 Wow, this is called "wiping" black (smear campaign refers to sputum, but can be literally translated as smearing) 

00:02:39.073 --> 00:02:41.003
 To shut up! 

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.044
 I am not deliberately pleased you (butter you up=please, flattery, but butter is cream, pun) 

00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:46.044
 To shut up!!! 

00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:47.098
 Hey! Hey! Heel 

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:49.071
 What? 

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:51.019
 Still a knife! 

00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:58.007
 Hey, poor high-heeled Jabba the Loaf-Heel (Loafer Heel refers to high heels) 

00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:00.030
 I actually really like his... 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.057
 I have to send some flowers to him, but they are already here. 

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.087
嘿!嘿!Flour (flour flour and flower flower homophonic) 

00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:06.006
 Who will stop him? 

00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:12.091
 (polujony subtitle production) 

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:20.059
 So I will say 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.004
 "Only the power of flowers can stop him!!" 

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.064
 Kill me
