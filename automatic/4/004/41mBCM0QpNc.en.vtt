00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 I recently told you the war a5 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.490
 universally imagined one 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.799
 adult tower cooler in each 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.240
 regard points could however 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.040
 not everyone has the option of one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.780
 corresponding tower cooler in this 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.340
 larger format to install because of that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.740
 I want you today the smaller one 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
 brother craig a 7 imagine 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.560
 in this sense, have fun with this 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.560
 video and let's go 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.470
 so welcome to one 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.060
 another video of the cryo rica 7 comes in 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.100
 a colored and very stable cardboard 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.260
 the latter includes elementary 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.059
 Product information such as the socket 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.980
 Compatibility or the product 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.809
 Inside , the cooler can be found 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.519
 and the installation material good 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.530
 protected and stows the supplied 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.809
 Accessories are rather minimalist 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.580
 but also completely sufficient there would be 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.320
 First of all the usual paperwork 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.850
 consisting of two installation guide 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.590
 with different languages ​​and 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.390
 many small screen to 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.760
 practical accessories are among others 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.920
 the thermally conductive paste of type b 9 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.210
 a universal backplate four distance 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.280
 side and four fixing screws 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.200
 last but not least, clamp two fans 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.940
 For an optional fan fan 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.500
 relies on the well-known tau design 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.229
 measures including fan 123 x 145 x 98 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.940
 millimeters and brings close to 7 111 grams 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.890
 on the scales in contrast to the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.229
 recent universal coolers are coming here 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.030
 the q11 120 fan for use 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.009
 by the displaced design of the radiator 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.600
 are memory incompatibilities 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.670
 history the technical data of the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.220
 fans 330 to 1600 pm 83 3 cubic meters 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.690
 the hour 10 to 25 decibels and 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.789
 The fan is connected via a 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.170
 4 pin pwm connection the construction is on 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.149
 the first look typical tower cooler 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.009
 The H7 is made of a copper 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.319
 bottom plate which with three 6mm 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.940
 heatpipes is traversed this carry 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.649
 the waste heat in the 40 aluminum slats 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.270
 on the top is again 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.369
 once a hole something not for ventilation 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.810
 served but to lock the x-bow 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.340
 the right screwdriver for 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.030
 Locking the x-bow will not be here 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.039
 included 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.959
 the second look shows that war 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.220
 here on the hi-fi technology sets the 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.569
 means that one on a warm one 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.729
 design sets which turbulences 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.500
 They also help speed up the jet 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.420
 for the eccentric transport of the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.920
 warm air processing defects could 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.300
 I do not notice with my model 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 and all in all is the processing 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.720
 extremly good 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.819
 the h7 is compatible to all 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.840
 current platforms starting at 11 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:26.890
 50 over l 55 to 11 56 but also amd fm 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.170
 1 and 2 at 20 2 plus and a3 and a3 plus 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.640
 sockets are supported here intel lga 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.410
 775 13 66 and 2011 v3 will be accordingly 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.060
 not supported, but we come now 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.160
 time to test how does the h7 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.430
 The h7 was tested for all use 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.790
 an intel core i5 44 40 with 3.1 ghz 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.160
 including asus h 97 m and eight gigabytes 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.870
 About casual sports store during the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.489
 test was the ambient temperature 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.319
 to 22 degrees celsius 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.390
 here are the results in idle mode 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.010
 the core temperature is 30 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.959
 degree and thus the h7 is up 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.390
 Eye level with the appointment bike ride spirit 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.000
 120 m in the lot mode is the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.830
 maximum temperature to 55 degrees can at 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.239
 Cooling cpu is not just the temperature 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.040
 factor important but also the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.720
 volume of the fan here I can 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.340
 just my subjective assessment 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.930
 Tell me because a corresponding 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.430
 Meter is missing the fan is in 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.650
 low to medium speed range 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.420
 very quiet only at maximum 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.069
 speed he is slightly higher build 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.870
 so that the fan image is identical to 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.030
 larger h5 universal 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.190
 Overall, the h7 is a very good one 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.280
 alternative to known coolers such as 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.080
 for example the hr 02 macho or big rock 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.580
 but in addition to the low price is also 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.709
 the performance and processing quality 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.840
 very good but also the safe and 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.580
 Easy mounting system as well as the cool 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.200
 optics speak for the h 7 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.910
 Links to this cooler as well 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.109
 The other test participants are like 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.430
 usual in the infobox 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.400
 At this point, I thank you 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.540
 war for the provision of this 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.040
 review copies are more videos 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.510
 as usual now linked and then 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.609
 I thank you for your interest 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.019
 this cooler and at this video like 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.760
 I am usually looking forward to comments and 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.760
 reviews and then until recently
