there's birds everywhere but also lots
of<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:31.390> I<00:00:31.419> think<00:00:31.749> one<00:00:31.929> thing<00:00:32.140> they<00:00:32.320> do<00:00:32.380> is<00:00:32.590> more

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
of but I think one thing they do is more

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.620 
of but I think one thing they do is more

these are lilies and these are the red
orangey<00:00:52.989> sticky<00:00:53.469> pollen<00:00:53.980> of<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:54.280> lilies

which<00:00:55.449> have<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.960> be<00:00:56.079> transferred<00:00:56.649> to<00:00:57.070> the

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
which have to be transferred to the

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.030 
which have to be transferred to the
female<00:00:58.059> of<00:00:58.269> another<00:00:58.839> flower<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.589> the<00:00:59.769> lily<00:00:59.980> and

pollination<00:01:13.509> there<00:01:14.170> won't<00:01:14.350> be<00:01:14.409> any<00:01:14.829> little

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
pollination there won't be any little

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:25.649 
pollination there won't be any little
beans<00:01:15.520> whatsoever<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.520> pollination<00:01:25.180> is<00:01:25.299> very

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
beans whatsoever so pollination is very

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.389 
beans whatsoever so pollination is very
important<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.439> plants<00:01:26.829> because<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.189> gives

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
important to plants because it gives

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.730 
important to plants because it gives
them<00:01:27.520> fruits<00:01:27.939> and<00:01:28.329> seeds<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:29.079> nuts<00:01:29.320> and

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
them fruits and seeds and nuts and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.370 
them fruits and seeds and nuts and
basically<00:01:30.430> baby<00:01:30.759> plums<00:01:31.119> oh<00:01:31.479> yes<00:01:31.930> it's<00:01:32.140> all

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
basically baby plums oh yes it's all

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.010 
basically baby plums oh yes it's all
about<00:01:32.409> reproduction<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.509> have<00:01:34.719> you<00:01:34.840> ever

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
about reproduction but have you ever

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.800 
about reproduction but have you ever
wondered<00:01:35.200> what<00:01:36.130> pollen<00:01:36.670> actually<00:01:37.240> look<00:01:37.540> like

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
wondered what pollen actually look like

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.230 
wondered what pollen actually look like
when<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.170> put<00:01:38.380> them<00:01:38.500> under<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> microscope

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
when you put them under the microscope

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.959 
when you put them under the microscope
they<00:01:40.240> are<00:01:40.649> beautiful<00:01:41.649> they<00:01:41.829> are<00:01:42.040> so<00:01:42.250> pretty

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
they are beautiful they are so pretty

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.469 
they are beautiful they are so pretty
and<00:01:43.149> well<00:01:43.780> adapted<00:01:43.930> you<00:01:44.920> see<00:01:45.100> some<00:01:45.520> pollen<00:01:46.000> go

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
and well adapted you see some pollen go

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.440 
and well adapted you see some pollen go
through<00:01:46.719> the<00:01:46.869> air<00:01:47.020> they<00:01:47.259> dispersed<00:01:47.710> by<00:01:47.920> winds

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
through the air they dispersed by winds

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:59.539 
through the air they dispersed by winds
others<00:01:49.450> are<00:01:49.689> dispersed<00:01:50.079> by<00:01:50.289> birds

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.669 

they<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.270> little<00:02:00.479> barbs<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.259> let's

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
they have little barbs on them let's

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.370 
they have little barbs on them let's
stick<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> feathers<00:02:02.789> of<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> birds<00:02:03.380> some

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
stick to the feathers of the birds some

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.559 
stick to the feathers of the birds some
pollen<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.039> licked<00:02:05.609> up<00:02:05.759> by<00:02:05.969> geckos<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:09.179> it

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
pollen I licked up by geckos and it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.500 
pollen I licked up by geckos and it
takes<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.019> pond<00:02:10.259> from<00:02:10.530> flower<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.730> flower

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
takes the pond from flower to flower

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.900 
takes the pond from flower to flower
there<00:02:13.379> are<00:02:13.590> even<00:02:14.160> flowers<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.790> are

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
there are even flowers that are

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.050 
there are even flowers that are
pollinated<00:02:15.569> by<00:02:15.599> bits<00:02:16.080> now<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
pollinated by bits now get it in the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.570 
pollinated by bits now get it in the
middle<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.540> night<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.890> most<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
middle of the night but most of the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.460 
middle of the night but most of the
pollination<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.209> course<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.660> done<00:02:21.930> by

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
pollination of course it's done by

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.830 
pollination of course it's done by
insects<00:02:23.099> now<00:02:23.940> let's<00:02:24.150> take<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> look<00:02:24.540> at<00:02:24.690> what

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
insects now let's take a look at what

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:35.539 
insects now let's take a look at what
insects<00:02:25.319> there<00:02:26.250> are<00:02:26.400> oh<00:02:27.560> yes<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:35.489> course

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
insects there are oh yes of course

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.789 
insects there are oh yes of course
they're<00:02:35.970> also<00:02:36.120> native<00:02:36.720> bees<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.530> live<00:02:37.680> in

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
they're also native bees that live in

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.710 
they're also native bees that live in
holes<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.160> ground<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.549> they<00:02:39.060> pollinate

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
holes in the ground but they pollinate

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.920 
holes in the ground but they pollinate
for<00:02:40.200> instance<00:02:40.470> tea<00:02:40.890> tree<00:02:41.130> Monica<00:02:41.940> all<00:02:42.480> sort<00:02:42.810> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
for instance tea tree Monica all sort of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.180 
for instance tea tree Monica all sort of
made<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.290> glass<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.400> fantastic<00:02:45.390> job<00:02:46.190> so

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
made of glass they do a fantastic job so

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.400 
made of glass they do a fantastic job so
why<00:02:47.489> are<00:02:47.819> all<00:02:48.030> these<00:02:48.209> insects<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.170> birds

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
why are all these insects and birds

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.550 
why are all these insects and birds
geckos<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.220> bets<00:02:50.700> for<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.120> matter

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
geckos and bets for that matter

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.000 
geckos and bets for that matter
attracted<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.739> pollinate<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.670> flowers<00:02:55.010> well

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
attracted to pollinate the flowers well

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.199 
attracted to pollinate the flowers well
they<00:02:56.370> get<00:02:56.549> a<00:02:56.610> reward<00:02:57.890> nectar<00:02:58.890> that's<00:02:59.849> the

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
they get a reward nectar that's the

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.729 
they get a reward nectar that's the
reward<00:03:01.340> mmm<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.730> bet<00:03:03.510> you've<00:03:03.930> never<00:03:03.959> seen<00:03:04.380> this

before<00:03:04.799> right<00:03:05.370> here's<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.329> flex<00:03:06.660> flower<00:03:06.930> and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
before right here's a flex flower and

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.129 
before right here's a flex flower and
when<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.590> squeeze<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.220> look<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.840> see<00:03:10.019> the

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
when you squeeze it look you can see the

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.160 
when you squeeze it look you can see the
moisture<00:03:10.319> coming<00:03:10.829> out<00:03:11.040> now<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:12.660> nectar

moisture coming out now that is nectar
that's<00:03:13.769> what<00:03:14.040> all<00:03:14.280> these<00:03:14.819> pollinators<00:03:15.600> are

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
that's what all these pollinators are
