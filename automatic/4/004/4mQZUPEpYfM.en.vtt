okay<00:00:00.240> so<00:00:01.220> in<00:00:02.220> minute<00:00:02.490> there<00:00:03.360> we<00:00:03.449> are<00:00:03.510> now

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
okay so in minute there we are now

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.360 
okay so in minute there we are now
continue<00:00:04.230> with<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.470> ignition<00:00:05.190> sequence

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
continue with the ignition sequence

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.730 
continue with the ignition sequence
begins<00:00:05.879> at<00:00:06.000> minus<00:00:06.299> 25<00:00:06.569> seconds<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:07.350> said<00:00:07.560> then

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
begins at minus 25 seconds you said then

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.070 
begins at minus 25 seconds you said then
yes<00:00:08.370> minus<00:00:08.940> 20<00:00:09.240> seconds<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.690> first<00:00:09.900> stage

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
yes minus 20 seconds the first stage

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.530 
yes minus 20 seconds the first stage
engines<00:00:10.500> ignited<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:12.000> second<00:00:12.330> stage

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
engines ignited and the second stage

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.570 
engines ignited and the second stage
single<00:00:12.929> engine<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.559> lit<00:00:13.860> at<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> same<00:00:14.370> time

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
single engine is lit at the same time

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.180 
single engine is lit at the same time
now<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.289> ignition<00:00:16.289> sequence<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.920> three

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
now the ignition sequence is in three

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.970 
now the ignition sequence is in three
stages<00:00:17.490> from<00:00:17.940> minus<00:00:18.330> 17<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.050> minus<00:00:19.320> 6<00:00:19.560> seconds

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
stages from minus 17 to minus 6 seconds

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.320 
stages from minus 17 to minus 6 seconds
the<00:00:20.070> end<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.310> their<00:00:20.490> engines<00:00:21.000> are<00:00:21.119> tested

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the end of their engines are tested

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.650 
the end of their engines are tested
automatically<00:00:22.320> them<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.460> minus<00:00:23.850> 15<00:00:24.210> seconds

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
automatically them at minus 15 seconds

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.349 
automatically them at minus 15 seconds
is<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.230> component<00:00:25.550> does<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.699> at<00:00:27.180> about

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
is the first component does it at about

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.810 
is the first component does it at about
20<00:00:28.289> percent<00:00:28.740> there's<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> gantry<00:00:29.460> pulling

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
20 percent there's the gantry pulling

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
20 percent there's the gantry pulling
back<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.700> minus<00:00:33.420> 7<00:00:33.690> seconds<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.200> second

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
back and minus 7 seconds is the second

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.530 
back and minus 7 seconds is the second
intermediate<00:00:35.280> pressure<00:00:35.460> 50<00:00:35.940> percent<00:00:36.360> and

intermediate pressure 50 percent and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.720 
intermediate pressure 50 percent and
then<00:00:37.230> minus<00:00:37.559> 3<00:00:37.590> seconds<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> order<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.550> given

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
then minus 3 seconds the order is given

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.799 
then minus 3 seconds the order is given
for<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> final<00:00:39.510> phase<00:00:39.690> full<00:00:39.989> throttle<00:00:41.809> so

what went through your mind as you watch

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.160 
what went through your mind as you watch
liftoff<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.000> you've<00:01:57.150> seen<00:01:57.360> her<00:01:57.570> lift<00:01:57.930> off

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
liftoff because you've seen her lift off

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.620 
liftoff because you've seen her lift off
before<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.940> think<00:01:59.940> you're<00:02:00.120> right<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.300> saw<00:02:00.570> it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
before I think you're right I saw it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.900 
before I think you're right I saw it
already<00:02:00.870> from<00:02:01.110> Baikonur<00:02:01.650> but<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.610> time<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
already from Baikonur but this time is

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.180 
already from Baikonur but this time is
also<00:02:03.060> very<00:02:03.180> special<00:02:03.830> indifference<00:02:04.830> it's<00:02:04.980> will

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
also very special indifference it's will

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.940 
also very special indifference it's will
to<00:02:05.880> leave<00:02:06.210> daylight<00:02:06.540> because<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.560> Baikonur

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to leave daylight because in Baikonur

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.040 
to leave daylight because in Baikonur
you<00:02:08.130> start<00:02:08.369> out<00:02:08.520> during<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.850> night<00:02:09.030> aside<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you start out during the night aside and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.500 
you start out during the night aside and
in<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.410> snow<00:02:10.710> I<00:02:10.740> imagine<00:02:11.310> no<00:02:11.550> no<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.000> was<00:02:12.180> was

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
in the snow I imagine no no it was was

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.220 
in the snow I imagine no no it was was
doing<00:02:15.740> 336<00:02:16.740> tons<00:02:17.100> at<00:02:17.630> liftoff<00:02:18.630> that's<00:02:18.960> half

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
doing 336 tons at liftoff that's half

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.610 
doing 336 tons at liftoff that's half
the<00:02:19.500> mass<00:02:19.710> roughly<00:02:20.070> venerian<00:02:20.700> 5<00:02:21.440> yeah<00:02:22.440> the

second stage are burning now and you can

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.380 
second stage are burning now and you can
see<00:02:26.670> them<00:02:26.880> as<00:02:27.060> Soyuz<00:02:27.510> heads<00:02:27.930> north<00:02:28.650> up<00:02:29.640> the

there as the flame out and there's the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.060 
there as the flame out and there's the
separation<00:03:03.540> beautiful<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.620> see<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.860> four

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
separation beautiful you see the four

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.530 
separation beautiful you see the four
boosters<00:03:05.489> falling<00:03:05.910> away<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:08.459> use<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.820> burn<00:03:09.000> now

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
boosters falling away to use to burn now

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.900 
boosters falling away to use to burn now
from<00:03:09.770> 336<00:03:10.770> tons<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.220> lift<00:03:11.400> off<00:03:11.610> with<00:03:11.820> the

from 336 tons that lift off with the
boosters<00:03:12.300> gone<00:03:12.510> how<00:03:12.690> much<00:03:12.750> does<00:03:13.080> she<00:03:13.110> weigh<00:03:13.410> I

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
boosters gone how much does she weigh I

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.300 
boosters gone how much does she weigh I
think<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.670> think<00:03:14.930> 155<00:03:15.930> tons<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.770> in<00:03:16.920> less

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
think we I think 155 tons so in less

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.770 
think we I think 155 tons so in less
than<00:03:17.459> two<00:03:17.640> minutes<00:03:17.730> she<00:03:18.090> loses<00:03:18.420> more<00:03:18.720> than

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
than two minutes she loses more than

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.949 
than two minutes she loses more than

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
you can see on the left our altitude and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.470 
you can see on the left our altitude and
distance<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.190> speed<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.730> altitude<00:03:30.209> on<00:03:30.360> the

Left approaching 70 kilometers we're

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.060 
Left approaching 70 kilometers we're
gonna<00:03:33.300> separate<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.900> satellites<00:03:34.380> roughly

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
gonna separate the satellites roughly

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.259 
gonna separate the satellites roughly
around<00:03:35.660> 23,000<00:03:36.660> kilometers<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.620> be<00:03:37.800> watching

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
around 23,000 kilometers so be watching

around 23,000 kilometers so be watching
for<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.380> now<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.440> figures<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.250> altitude<00:03:41.610> and

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
for that now the figures on altitude and

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.610 
for that now the figures on altitude and

where<00:03:47.700> we<00:03:47.880> said<00:03:48.060> we're<00:03:48.209> just

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
where we said we're just

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.010 
where we said we're just
go<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.430> then<00:03:50.180> they're<00:03:50.270> confirmed<00:03:50.720> before

picked<00:04:01.280> up<00:04:01.400> by<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.940> naval<00:04:02.390> station<00:04:03.019> which<00:04:03.170> is

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
picked up by a naval station which is

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.360 
picked up by a naval station which is
actually<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.680> ship<00:04:03.950> out<00:04:04.129> in<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.280> Atlantic

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
actually a ship out in the Atlantic

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.020 
actually a ship out in the Atlantic
right<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.890> then<00:04:06.890> by<00:04:07.040> Santa<00:04:07.430> Maria<00:04:07.670> in<00:04:07.880> the

right and then by Santa Maria in the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.420 
right and then by Santa Maria in the
Azores<00:04:08.510> yeah<00:04:09.080> you're<00:04:09.260> right<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.560> tries<00:04:09.800> so

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
Azores yeah you're right it tries so

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.040 
Azores yeah you're right it tries so
useful<00:04:10.610> eyes<00:04:10.819> first<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.450> roof<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:11.840> then

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
useful eyes first to the roof and then

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.800 
useful eyes first to the roof and then
to<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.769> east<00:04:12.980> over<00:04:13.489> Europe<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.000> over<00:04:14.540> Europe

to the east over Europe and over Europe

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.390 
to the east over Europe and over Europe
she's<00:04:15.019> picked<00:04:15.319> up<00:04:15.500> in<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.799> South<00:04:16.040> by<00:04:16.340> the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
she's picked up in the South by the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.190 
she's picked up in the South by the
station<00:04:16.910> near<00:04:17.060> toulouse<00:04:17.450> which<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.930> called

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
station near toulouse which is called

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.690 
station near toulouse which is called
osaka<00:04:19.070> sands<00:04:19.850> right<00:04:21.040> then<00:04:22.040> she<00:04:22.310> continues

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
osaka sands right then she continues

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.240 
osaka sands right then she continues
east<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.270> south<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.200> finally<00:04:24.770> picked<00:04:24.979> up<00:04:25.070> by

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
east and south and finally picked up by

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.969 
east and south and finally picked up by
perth<00:04:25.660> which<00:04:26.660> will<00:04:26.900> see<00:04:27.110> separation<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.919> the

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
perth which will see separation of the

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.219 
perth which will see separation of the
two<00:04:28.130> Galileo<00:04:28.580> satellites<00:04:28.850> over<00:04:29.389> Australia

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
two Galileo satellites over Australia

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.469 
two Galileo satellites over Australia
now<00:04:30.380> Galileo<00:04:30.800> has<00:04:31.520> her<00:04:31.669> own<00:04:31.700> station<00:04:32.330> these

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
now Galileo has her own station these

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.150 
now Galileo has her own station these
are<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.720> Arian<00:04:33.020> space<00:04:33.229> exactly<00:04:33.740> this<00:04:34.010> is

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
are the Arian space exactly this is

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.710 
are the Arian space exactly this is
linked<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.639> to<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.970> launcher<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:35.600> we

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
linked to the to the launcher so we

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.750 
linked to the to the launcher so we
having<00:04:36.020> other<00:04:36.139> stations<00:04:36.650> however<00:04:37.220> for<00:04:37.669> the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
having other stations however for the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.550 
having other stations however for the
Leo<00:04:37.940> when<00:04:38.360> we<00:04:38.479> take<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.780> satellites<00:04:39.229> after

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
Leo when we take the satellites after

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.920 
Leo when we take the satellites after
separation<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.610> also<00:04:41.300> then<00:04:41.450> of<00:04:41.570> course<00:04:41.780> in

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
separation and also then of course in
