00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.290 
greatest but I think you look further
you<00:02:41.960> look<00:02:41.990> at<00:02:42.200> their<00:02:42.320> errors<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:44.000> look<00:02:44.210> at

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
you look at their errors you look at

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.250 
you look at their errors you look at
what<00:02:44.450> they<00:02:44.600> did

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
what they did

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.530 
what they did
I<00:02:45.290> think<00:02:46.220> Dennis<00:02:46.490> Rodman<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.150> greatest

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
I think Dennis Rodman is the greatest

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.560 
I think Dennis Rodman is the greatest
rebounder<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.140> all<00:02:48.290> time
