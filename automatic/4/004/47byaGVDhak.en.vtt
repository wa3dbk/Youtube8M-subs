00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
one of the things I've been to some

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.270 
one of the things I've been to some
countries<00:00:53.870> like<00:00:54.140> Tahiti<00:00:54.350> for<00:00:54.680> example<00:00:55.129> where

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
countries like Tahiti for example where

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.160

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
guess correct and it is a really unique

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.420 
guess correct and it is a really unique
experience<00:01:00.229> because<00:01:00.470> inside<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.040> room<00:01:01.190> you

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
experience because inside the room you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.130 
experience because inside the room you
can<00:01:01.610> actually<00:01:01.820> look<00:01:02.420> down<00:01:02.600> into<00:01:02.869> the<00:01:03.019> water

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
can actually look down into the water

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.930 
can actually look down into the water
