00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.510
 in principle factory of volvo trucks around 35,000 a year fall 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.700
 Tire trucks account for one third of global production 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.509
 it is therefore the largest production site of the Swedish truck builder 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.640
 nevertheless does not necessarily have the largest have the largest that is true 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
 the story is about 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.220
 volvo trucks that it is almost 15 6 lawsuit in our country heidi factory 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.010
 is capable of opening a 75 hp team but once also modernized this on one 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.470
 sustainable and tablet-friendly production process 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.410
 today I have a large install with glass surfaces and big rebounding 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.800
 Floored soccer bosses from reads the production halls that creates in Division IV 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.280
 appears to be reduced to a minimum that was for volvo trucks but nothing finds 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.030
 in 2006 volvo trucks went into the sea with electrabel that changed seats from the factory 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.989
 to make the first single 2 neutral company impression 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.970
 not caravans from a factory that at that time 14,000 tons CEO 40 years 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.549
 barely two years later, the assignment was completed 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.650
 three windmills and 4,500 square meters of solar panels provide the factory with 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.710
 renewable energy and they put together more than 50 percent of the total 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.890
 energy requirement 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.780
 in addition to the factory the old volvo trucks also a thio mazda plant and celebrates 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.140
 that it generates one of the biggest hits of renewable energy 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.070
 to make the site all the way since we are in the red headlines Volvo trucks 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.360
 together and I see your arm from a number of French hydroelectric power stations 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.650
 environmentally friendly production is of course impossible without green products 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.950
 and that has been litigated throughout 2011, it is not surprising that 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.530
 to be 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.580
 rolled in that limit already calling number of saves on the vehicle of the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.540
 band is 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 in the worst case, find that plan 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.120
 fd who offer 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.120
 and a vehicle that the polls for 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.049
 uses the low average speed but a lot rests on a by martijn 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.639
 I have entered and I am going to save the under going reuse 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.959
 we think and died in four people 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.269
 use fuel on alternatives 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.209
 this did not affect the meaning of the vehicles in which a 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.579
 part of a liter of fuel 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.949
 the replacement with with pineapple 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.999
 trust in vemw six money does not comment 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:46.469
 460 hp any later phase also includes multiple configurations of men of one

 2012 and as required in the future many viewers did manage to turn away with 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.809
 pilot project with scandinavia 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.469
 to transform a residual product from the paper industry into one

 usable fuel male dnb the tipster 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.079
 a look at the future within a few years ago 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.459
 Future music is what they demanded is 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.069
 the Swedish old have got that
