00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
don't really well in the past and I've

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.840 
don't really well in the past and I've
been<00:01:01.539> a<00:01:01.570> few<00:01:01.750> Nebraska<00:01:02.170> games<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:03.489> went<00:01:03.789> up

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
been a few Nebraska games but I went up

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.330 
been a few Nebraska games but I went up
to<00:01:03.879> Nebraska<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.839> think<00:01:05.140> their<00:01:06.009> level<00:01:06.250> of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
to Nebraska and I think their level of

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.950 
to Nebraska and I think their level of
dedication<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:07.149> their<00:01:07.390> attitude<00:01:07.750> toward

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
dedication and their attitude toward

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.430 
dedication and their attitude toward
their<00:01:08.080> team<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.850> i<00:01:09.880> was<00:01:10.149> there<00:01:10.180> is<00:01:10.600> more<00:01:11.289> than

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
their team when i was there is more than

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.370 
their team when i was there is more than
what<00:01:11.590> i<00:01:11.619> see<00:01:11.920> students<00:01:12.820> feeling<00:01:13.630> about<00:01:13.780> see<00:01:13.960> as

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
what i see students feeling about see as

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.249 
what i see students feeling about see as
far<00:01:14.530> as<00:01:14.649> this<00:01:14.770> year<00:01:15.009> at<00:01:15.789> least<00:01:16.119> this<00:01:16.360> year<00:01:16.420> now

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
far as this year at least this year now

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.429 
far as this year at least this year now
so<00:01:17.470> you're<00:01:17.979> optimistic<00:01:18.900> i'm<00:01:19.900> most<00:01:20.200> definitely

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
so you're optimistic i'm most definitely

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.840 
so you're optimistic i'm most definitely
optimistic<00:01:20.979> for<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.130> future<00:01:21.189> i<00:01:21.460> think<00:01:21.759> this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
optimistic for the future i think this

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.010 
optimistic for the future i think this
year<00:01:21.909> has<00:01:22.180> been<00:01:22.270> kind<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.509> challenging<00:01:22.900> for

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
year has been kind of challenging for

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.270 
year has been kind of challenging for
the<00:01:23.080> bus<00:01:23.229> for<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.409> new<00:01:23.530> coach<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:23.890> everything

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
the bus for the new coach and everything

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.240 
the bus for the new coach and everything
but<00:01:24.549> i<00:01:25.030> think<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:26.320> future<00:01:26.500> holds<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.860> lot<00:01:27.040> in

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
but i think the future holds a lot in

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.830 
but i think the future holds a lot in
next<00:01:27.490> season<00:01:27.790> they're<00:01:28.360> just<00:01:28.390> working<00:01:28.659> out<00:01:28.780> the

next season they're just working out the

i<00:03:50.540> don't<00:03:51.540> know<00:03:51.660> i<00:03:52.110> think<00:03:52.320> we're<00:03:52.950> probably

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
i don't know i think we're probably

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.540 
i don't know i think we're probably
gonna<00:03:53.430> lose

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.430 

70<00:04:00.550> 70<00:04:01.330> do<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.750> think<00:04:01.870> it's<00:04:01.990> gonna<00:04:02.050> be<00:04:02.230> close

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010

of<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.280> football<00:04:09.280> season<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:09.760> far<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:10.710> think

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
of the football season so far I think

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.760 
of the football season so far I think
they're<00:04:12.270> rebuilding<00:04:13.270> and<00:04:13.720> hopefully<00:04:14.620> they

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
they're rebuilding and hopefully they

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.400 
they're rebuilding and hopefully they
can<00:04:14.830> do<00:04:15.040> better<00:04:15.190> next<00:04:15.310> year<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:16.410> couldn't

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
can do better next year and couldn't

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.320 
can do better next year and couldn't
have<00:04:17.500> had<00:04:17.620> real<00:04:18.160> high<00:04:18.310> expectations<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.150> don't

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
have had real high expectations I don't

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.550 
have had real high expectations I don't
think<00:04:19.540> for<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.780> season<00:04:20.110> given<00:04:20.380> what's

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
think for the season given what's

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.730 
think for the season given what's
happened<00:04:20.860> over<00:04:20.920> the<00:04:21.100> last<00:04:21.720> decade<00:04:22.740> football
