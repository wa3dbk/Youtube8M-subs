00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.940
 The second moment which I would like 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.350
 share actually we all know 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.939
 fine but periodically we forget it 2 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.990
 call it to you 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.239
 goes down on the map we have the station 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.309
 freestyle and 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.170
 field ever moon this is now 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.230
 called balance all fan 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.829
 direction means you have all the top 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.190
 as for polling login when 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.230
 ranking then we have, respectively, 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 like them but the same should not 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.390
 forget that this is one of the main parts 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 given the culture on quality qual we can 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.840
 swing anything by trap there 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:08.340
 moreover to then the hull yes we can 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 swing if your feet here allows 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.260
 point we must not forget about him 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.140
 because so many moments when we 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.680
 make movement on straight legs and and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.520
 need to tell yourself dude . 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.830
 and when going by leader us 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.620
 respectively, picked up speed to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.560
 and we don't know what to do here and 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.020
 it turns out the fate in our movement if 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.720
 the answer i do is wide yielding even 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 I will prepare because I walked widely and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.560
 from here to do another yard on the move 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.200
 some 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.840
 and we because there even on a class still 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.490
 what are you doing in the wall we're in 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.979
 a square in a little dancing 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.320
 accordingly everything so that even if you 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.670
 do all sorts of party dansy and any such 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.180
 then you here here here around 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.110
 decide to make decisions on 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.459
 you are more difficult but it will be correct so 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:12.170
 you, respectively, I have to work there in 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:16.560
 Coupe with Maidas in general, I believe that our 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.970
 of course the Spaniards it comes from the pelvis 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.830
 file connect legs and let us take into account 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.930
 such a thing 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.720
 when I can not strain myself 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.910
 spin 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.280
 go back accordingly the stronger 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.549
 my legs up 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.900
 the wider i do mind the topic again 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:47.230
 It also becomes on it 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.680
 You can also work to collect too 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.180
 handbrake rice cable and demand overs ideal 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.709
 so called colleagues 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.080
 pass nellie every time every time 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.849
 adds his own what is now before 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.819
 me all the qualities you have here before you 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.549
 be your picture should change 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.810
 more difficult one hundred percent one hundred percent of 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.140
 important but after a while your many 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.040
 here 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.049
 will understand what work she needs and they 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.370
 will swing you match download 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.590
 and all floors and slime to god on movement 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.569
 looks like this we shouldn't 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.440
 forget accordingly and about the body 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:33.040
 here now I am doing a corpus 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.670
 can walk like introductory staying in 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.060
 the side further is the movement here through 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.480
 one so in a circle it might be 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.430
 movements in general can even charge 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.310
 so wide you are now 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:57.160
 actually it doesn't matter so go ahead 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:00.790
 our pelvis up has the ability to rotate 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:05.260
 they also need to be able to work not very 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.459
 like when dancers work seven bodies 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.220
 Yes, including will not give 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:13.690
 Often this moment disappears so here 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:18.000
 Tass very important important component 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.519
 long time ago there with this moment 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.980
 it is done a lot of sleep steps up to you 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.100
 steps and so on we need his gaze 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.030
 and how to connect it with our bounce 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.110
 accordingly, we also take a circle 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.240
 I initially just take out what you can 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:41.910
 make a circle on the basin I and connect 0 1 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:47.680
 2 3 4 yes for example on to the simplest 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:50.650
 one-two-three-four variations connected 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.160
 points more yes it works and a little bit 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.380
 Smooth to the circle was still in one 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.110
 side and always a friend because 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.930
 again the mistake of so many is not the mistake 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.880
 or rather, they work for us all that we are 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.820
 we study only a garden on a bottom which to us 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.770
 conveniently we need 2 respectively in one 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.860
 side and suddenly several times repeat 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.390
 so that your body then from here that to us 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.880
 need to do we need to change the gould 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.120
 first again the way down goes away 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.640
 up and down 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.680
 go to the view and so on and then turn on 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.170
 this music you like and try 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.390
 work with my bride rhythmically correctly 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:34.090
 first clap clap clap strong share 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.490
 again i'm strong weak strong weak 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.770
 strong words and so on then when 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.930
 your body has become accustomed to this we 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.740
 start developing more interesting then 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.040
 we can break 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.580
 precisely on musical on musical 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.830
 row 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.220
 either because he has the rapper himself 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.240
 singer 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.190
 voice so here's the same thing we can 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.080
 notice for example with somehow da 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:05.650
 la paloma not done and so on but us 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:09.370
 together with you should be constantly 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.970
 I really want you to eat 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.970
 more to 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:48.049
 we made a few movements and they 

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:54.619
 include this moment lessons 

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:57.709
 the road is what i call dance key 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:07:01.759
 by which you can dial it 

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:07.719
 another movement and improvise up 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:07.719
 imagine and put better
