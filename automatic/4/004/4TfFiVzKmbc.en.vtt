00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 job interview 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.219
 I hesitated a lot before getting dressed 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.440
 because I thought to myself if I ever 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.690
 put on a skirt know the one that says 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.830
 look at my pretty legs but if I 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.720
 mens pants that's the one who refuses 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.260
 her femininity 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.540
 so I put on a panties skirt 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.680
 I am here I take a handbag that 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.050
 fact housewife who comes 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.190
 tourist if I take a briefcase a 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.410
 does active women who does not want one 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.620
 sees that unemployment so I took a 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.640
 backpack I got if I get too much in 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.290
 acquired advance she who is very 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.070
 anxious if I arrive late it's been 7 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.540
 who does not care 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.040
 I had an appointment at noon I am 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.940

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.150

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.500

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.500
 from the frosts sit down 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.350
 no problem I smiled because at 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.370
 internship that I did at pole employment they 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.719
 said it was very important to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.320
 caring relationships and the person who 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.910
 welcome you 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.839
 because the employer often asks him 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.839
 his opinion about you 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.060
 I had brought home reading 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.520
 read here or closer but for the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.119
 interviews I bring the world 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.119
 always the same 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.610
 even more I was waiting for that I had 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.900
 the anguished who climbs is happily 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.890
 I did an internship at the employment center they 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.420
 taught us the technique of 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.550
 abdominal breathing to fight 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.530
 against stress of the interview you 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.030
 puffs of the lungs of air you passed 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.500
 in the belly and you hope 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.500
 quietly it's done 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.330
 I had my journal I was doing my 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330
 breathing 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.740
 when i hear schori at the girl 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.760
 the problem is that the more I breathed 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.600
 the more I had the anxiety that goes up is 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.700
 after a while I decided 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.140
 to completely stop breathing I'm 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.140
 am put into minimum service this just 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.479
 thankfully after one hour 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.979
 the employer arrived I got up 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.030

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.030
