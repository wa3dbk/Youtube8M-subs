00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.200
 and welcome all my solex bnf game 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.210
 find for a brand new video 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.180
 which will be an informative video for 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.160
 maybe the appearance of a dlc 5 on 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.010
 call of duty black ops 2 and who would 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.860
 surely very very much access to the level of 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.890
 zombie so very pushy for what is 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.380
 of the zombie so I will show you 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.600
 currently on screen an image that 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.200
 posted treyarch on may 6 on their page 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.059
 Facebook 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.500
 so this is an official image you 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.680
 aurelian in the description of their 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.760
 eggs 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.010
 we will say facebook article like what 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.960
 they posted this picture 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.340
 so this picture I say you see in 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.980
 below there is a little text so the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.009
 About paragraph 10 and in this day 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.530
 1961 alan shepard piloted the mission 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.850
 was 2007 became the first American 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.350
 to travel in space 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.360
 so for now we can not do anything 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.340
 pull one can rather think that it is 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.899
 simply an information and when 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.640
 we're doing well the second paragraph among 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.979
 other sheppard missions also served 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.619
 from commander to third mission 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.780
 of moon landing of America calling 14 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.940
 during which he encountered 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.470
 zombies so here already we really enter 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.560
 in the heart of treyarch 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.670
 so that is to say the zombies that is 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.040
 really a mark we will say of 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.540
 manufactures for the treyarch license when 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.710
 we are waiting for our call of duty we are expecting 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.470
 always to see zombie coming 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.180
 treyarch is there the last paragraph 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.000
 which is for me quite revealing 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.729
 on the appearance of the dlc 5 he says 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.490
 wait let's check this 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.140
 last part get ready so the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.790
 last part could surely 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.920
 mean the last part led so of 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.750
 the story of the zombie so maybe 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.240
 when 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.320
 which would make it in fact a new party 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.539
 to their hobby is the phrase is the word the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.850
 semi-final game that says hold 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.860
 ready for me it announces quite 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.930
 the appearance that confirms even you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.570
 can put on to have a fifth 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.690
 on the other hand it does not specify any 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.550
 release date for this dlc but it gives 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.120
 a lot of information talking about 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.230
 alan shepard no astronaut 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.430
 like what he will travel in space 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.230
 so that could very well be 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.239
 maybe a moon remake or even 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.730
 simply rehabilitate the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.870
 map moon on call of duty black ops 2 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.550
 so that would really be something 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.560
 huge for me it's a map that I have 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.290
 not bad after these affairs the secret on 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.209
 black ops a name so this is it 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.380
 I hope you enjoyed the video and 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.340
 you have been useful 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.170
 I intend to send a code then 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.340
 I hope they will accept is this me 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.780
 I want the next door well 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.780
 sure those over everyone
