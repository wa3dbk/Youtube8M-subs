 Hi, guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.279
 welcome to a new apps mania ya 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.500
 you know where every Monday and Wednesday 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.670
 Friday we review all the news of the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.769
 world of mobile applications good 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.929
 guys let's start with mercury web 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.090
 browser is a web browser for this is 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.100
 and for android that I love to fix 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.900
 that we are not just a web browser 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.850
 conventional but we also have 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.380
 different options to start fixing 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.960
 that we go to the adjustments we can 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.029
 go to file and access the clouds 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.769
 most popular and of course see the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.510
 files that we have downloaded 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.190
 because it incorporates a small manager 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.570
 files within this application so 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.219
 simple as we give to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.200
 download a file and carlos that we 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.180
 This menu appears and we can see that we 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.950
 we are going to give you download link and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 automatically we will be here 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.250
 downloaded file more things that we 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.930
 we found guys is that we here 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.910
 we have different options for example 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 to modify the user agent and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.079
 tell him that we are browsing from mac 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.820
 from firefox from internet explorer 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.559
 from chrome or from where you 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.480
 you want no more little things than us 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.949
 we found we have a reading list 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.989
 any page we can put it here 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.150
 to later read it as you are 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.450
 looking in a much more comfortable and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.039
 things 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.780
 I love them let's go again to the 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.789
 adjustments we give to the size of the font 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 and notice that from here we will be able to 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.280
 expand or reduce the size of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 letters of any web page guys and 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.520
 girls but if this was not 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.890
 enough besides this web browser 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.270
 as such it incorporates fixed extensions 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.369
 that here we have the whole list of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.289
 extensions with super useful things that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.810
 we can do with one of the browsers 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.929
 more useful that we are going to find in 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.509
 year is filling them we continue with jet 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.369
 arcane ball and it is a video game for it 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.799
 is and for which is the popular canon 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.560
 but from another perspective, be sure that 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.750
 we have maps that are very very different 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.099
 guys let's play a game of 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.110
 test for you to read that ais 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.849
 note that we can choose the difficulty 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.470
 let's put that normal we're not going to 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.989
 to be so masochists and good here we have it 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.520
 an untraditional arkanoid where the 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.289
 objects are moving to fix that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.759
 we touch the screen we throw the ball and 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.130
 we simply have to 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.470
 try not to let the ball escape 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.149
 touch the ground while we destroy all 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.619
 the obstacles or objects that we 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.090
 we found at the top and we're going 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.649
 taking the vitamins that are going 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.209
 help improve as you are seeing 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.900
 this way is quite complicated and 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.989
 quite 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.659
 and addictive guys and girls good guys 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.730
 we continue with wi-fi 2 is a 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.409
 new application for ios and that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.989
 keep super useful now to have 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.310
 free internet anywhere you 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.870
 I explain how the guys worked 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.060
 you in the search engine put where 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.799
 you are your city â€‹â€‹the street and such or 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.989
 well just press the and ass 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.879
 stella up on the right so that you 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.069
 is in your GPS position no 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.560
 and notice that below is going to appear 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.200
 list of all on wifi that have been 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.819
 introduced by the users I explain 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.590
 how this works is nothing to hack 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.359
 or nothing is worth you guys just you 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.579
 you give the button also put here 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.549
 the name of the router exec 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.170
 wifi put where you are the user 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.739
 the password and you can add a 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.750
 commentary 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.730
 and this is made public in such a way that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.409
 everyone will have access to these 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.439
 data imagine that you go from 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.139
 vacation and you are going to have a coffee 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.120
 today instead of asking for the password of the 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.230
 establishment to the waiter today 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.760
 quietly from here we're going to 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.430
 can not see that we 're going to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.030
 this bakery for example and tells us the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.800
 user and also tells us the contra 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.050
 which has of course introduced the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.550
 Own owners are understood because 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.550
 the roll is that all of us 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.590
 when we go and we connect to 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.180
 internet that are public in quotes 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.980
 always have a password or e that 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.840
 let's put here all the passwords and the 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.760
 user so that they are being in 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.319
 any place we can enjoy 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.390
 free internet is an application that is 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.709
 well used really can be very 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.060
 useful especially this summer guys 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.410
 I hope you liked that we 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.060
 you can apply compound I like already 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.360
 you know see you in a next video 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.360
 bye
