I'm back and he has had a bath and as
you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.270> tell<00:02:24.330> he<00:02:24.780> looks<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.200> lot<00:02:25.620> better<00:02:27.590> he's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you can tell he looks a lot better he's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.490 
you can tell he looks a lot better he's
actually<00:02:28.940> gotten<00:02:29.940> his<00:02:30.270> softness<00:02:30.870> back<00:02:31.200> but

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
actually gotten his softness back but

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.920 
actually gotten his softness back but
it's<00:02:31.680> still<00:02:31.920> not<00:02:32.100> 100%<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.450> Kiva<00:02:33.780> is
