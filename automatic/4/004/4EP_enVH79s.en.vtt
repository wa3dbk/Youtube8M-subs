00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.466
- Earlier this season,
I had the cast of "Scandal"

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.933
on the show,
and we played a game

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.133
where they had to reveal
some pretty dark secrets.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.966
The game was full
of surprises.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:12.466
and this clip has some
never ever before seen moments.

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.166
No one's seen them.
No one.

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.100
Till now.
Enjoy.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.900
Oh, a lot more energy
on this side.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.900
This is the cast of "Scandal."

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.666
- Yeah!
- You're going down!

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.300
- We're playing a game
and it's called--

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.233
it's called the
"Scandal Secret Showdown."

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:28.500
We divided the cast
into teams,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.666
the White House versus
Olivia Pope and Associates.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.833
We've asked everyone
before the show

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.700
to tell us a secret
about themselves

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.100
their castmates
would not know

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.533
'cause they know each other
so well.

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.200
One person from each team
will come up.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.233
I'll read the secret
and the first person to buzz in,

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:44.400
and guess right, and guess
who's secret it is wins.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800
If they get it wrong,
the other team can steal.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.600
We only have
nine cast members.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.166
We need one more
on this side.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.833
So where is
Carly Applegate?

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.566
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.066
You know what?
I'm a little uncomfortable,

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.700
but I'm not good
at keeping secrets,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.166
so I want to--I want to confess
my secret right away.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.300
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.566
- Take it off, take it off.
- Hang in there, folks.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.600
- Hang in there.
- It'll be all right.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.966
- Hang on.
- This is good TV.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.966
[all cheering]

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.900
- How did that happen?

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.766
Hi, baby.

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.966
How'd you do that?

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.666
Oh, my God.

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.966
- Ellen--Ellen--Ellen
always does the best job

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:35.733
of surprising everybody else,
so we wanted

00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:39.100
to offer you a surprise
with another cast member.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.300
- I was so shocked.
I was, like,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.733
why'd you stop texting me?

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.866
We had been texting all day

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:43.866
and then all of a sudden,
it stopped.

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.233
- And then it just
mysteriously stopped.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:49.733
- Portia!
- Oh, my God.

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.466
- Hey.
- All right.

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.233
That was hilarious.
So there's probably no

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.733
Carly Applegate.
That was a fake name

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.300
or something.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.700
Let's bring up
the first two players.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.933
Let's play the game.
All right.

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:02.933
- You're going down.
- All right.

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:04.433
Hands behind your backs,
please.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.800
Don't cheat.
Hands behind your bla--backs.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.500
- Behind my black?
- Hands behind your black.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.200
- That's good. I'm ready.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.466
I already have one up
on you.

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:18.300
- I'm so excited.
Portia's here.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.633
I can't talk anymore.

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:20.700
(all) Aww.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.700
- All right.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.966
I spend every day--
every single day

00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:26.433
scared that
I'm gonna be arrested.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:27.766
[buzzer buzzing]

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:30.100
- Wow.
- Who said it?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.633
- Whose secret is that?
- She doesn't even know.

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:33.766
- She doesn't know.
- Guillermo.

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:36.966
- No. You can steal.
- I think it's Guillermo.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:37.966
- I just said Guillermo.
- I just wanted to hit

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:39.400
the button.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.500
- What is going on?
- I don't think that.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.166
That was his turn.
Do not give him another chance.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.266
[all talking]

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:50.500
Don't give him another chance.
He wasn't listening.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.433
- I call it--
- This thing is important.

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:55.666
- You can play the president
brilliantly.

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:56.933
- Don't ever vote for me.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:59.233
- You don't ever listen
when you're the president.

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:01.200
- Perfect, right?
- All right, now.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.900
You want another guess?

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.800
- Scott Foley.
- Oh, no.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.066
No?
- No.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.233
- Okay.
- Who is it?

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:09.900
- Is it Guillermo?
- No.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.266
- I can't--
- Wow.

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:17.666
Wow.

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:19.766
- I love that everyone thinks
it's Guillermo.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.766
- It's Bellamy.
It's Bellamy.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.266
- No.
- I think it's Katie.

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:24.266
- Yeah.
- No.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.400
- Jeff. No.
- Nobody else is left.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.133
- Are we allowed to say--
- Katie? Darby?

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:32.566
- Yes.
- What?

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:35.733
- Arrested for what?
- Anything.

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:37.933
- I think Darby's, like,
the least likely person

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:40.300
in America to get arrested.
- I know.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.666
- But I'm not.
[laughter]

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.766
- Racial profiling
at it's best.

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:48.400
- All right.
Everybody back--

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.566
back to your posts.

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:53.500
All right.
- Oh, my God.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.666
- Remember when
Richard Dawson

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:55.666
would kiss everybody
on the lips?

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.100
- I know, he did.
- Yeah, he did.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.633
- Get it, Guillermo.
- All right.

00:03:58.633 --> 00:03:59.833
Here's the next secret.

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:03.466
When I was five years old,
I almost set my house on fire.

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:05.233
[buzzer buzzing]

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:07.366
- Josh Malina.

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:08.633
- No. You get to steal.

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:12.166
- Is it--oh, oh.
Wait, do--okay.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:13.800
Wha!
- Hit the buzzer.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.000
- Oh.
[buzzer buzzing]

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.766
That is fun.
Kerry.

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:21.400
- No.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.666
[buzzer buzzing]

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:24.700
- Yes?
- Portia.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.833
- No.
- Oh.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:30.100
[buzzer buzzing]

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.566
- Katie.

00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:33.300
- No.
- We're terrible at this.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.533
- Guillermo.
[laughter]

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:40.866
- It's Tony.
It's Tony.

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:43.433
- Wow.
- I had a misspent youth.

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:44.433
- All right.
All right.

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:48.800
- Here we go.
- We can do it.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.033
- All right.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:51.766
I learned to ride a bike
only two years ago.

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:54.900
- What?
[buzzer buzzing]

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.966
- Jeff?
- Kerry?

00:04:56.966 --> 00:04:58.166
- No.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:00.633
- You got a look
on your face.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.066
- How do you think it is,
Katie?

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:04.033
- Guillermo?
[laughter]

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:08.100
- I stole a bike two years ago.
[laughter]

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.266
- But you didn't
get arrested.

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.533
All right.
- Is it your turn or mine?

00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:14.666
- It'll be yours.
[buzzer buzzing]

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:15.966
- Bellamy?
- Yes.

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.633
[cheering]

00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:20.633
- Get it, get it, get it,
get it, get it.

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:22.566
- Come on, Josh.
Come on, Josh.

00:05:22.566 --> 00:05:25.233
This is like a grudge match.
Grudge match.

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:26.500
- Okay, this is a good one.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.333
I sleep with a stuffed animal
every night.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:32.300
- Josh Malina.
[buzzer buzzing]

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.266
- Yes, Scott.
- It's Guillermo.

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:37.500
- It is.
- It is!

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.100
- Yeah!
Yeah!

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.333
- Scottie!

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:46.633
The first correct answer.
Oh, my God.

00:05:46.633 --> 00:05:48.866
- All right.

00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:50.400
- Here's another one.
- Portia.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.400
- I was once arrested
three times in one day.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.700
[buzzer buzzing]

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.000
Yes, Darby?
- Jeff Perry.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.533
- Oh.
- Is it you?

00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:02.766
- No.
- Oh.

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:03.766
- It's okay, it's okay.

00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:08.166
- I want to say Guillermo,
but...

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.866
Josh.

00:06:09.866 --> 00:06:13.633
Yes?
- No, no.

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:14.900
Darn it.
[buzzer buzzing]

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.600
- Yes?
- Scott Foley.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.233
- Yes!

00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:20.066
[cheering]

00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:22.200
- For what?
For what?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.833
- What were you arrested--
- Did we win?

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:26.100
- What were you arrested for?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.633
- How is it you never
told us that story?

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:30.533
- It's, uh, multiple traffic
offenses that I was arrested

00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:32.366
one in one precinct.

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:34.000
They then took me
to another precinct

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.300
where they arrested me
and the third precinct

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.066
didn't want to come get me,
so that second precinct

00:06:37.066 --> 00:06:38.766
arrested me for
the third precinct.

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:40.466
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:41.933
- Look what we learned today.

00:06:41.933 --> 00:06:44.566
And that's how you play
the "Scandal Secret Showdown."

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:46.866
If there's one thing
we learned,

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.733
it's that no one trusts
Guillermo.
