00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello to all so today we get 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.610
 found for a new video and we 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.280
 is today for a magazine 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.470
 special royal extension since I had 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.420
 the pleasure of being able to test chalks 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.000
 for the hair so it's something 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 thing that we often talked about I find 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 on the Net 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 and then I think it's been a bit of a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.449
 leaves a little trend the a7 was to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.730
 colorful powers dry a little bit 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.790
 flashy this summer and I think it's great 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.610
 nice so I was lucky that relays 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.760
 the extension makes me test this little 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.680
 product there and so you see that you 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.410
 have a little all the colors at the time 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.610
 neutral colors as colors 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.500
 super funky 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.360
 so me for the colors 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.120
 neutral I propose instead three 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.500
 colors because it's really the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 colors you can wear all 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.530
 days 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.050
 so you have chalk quesnoy so if 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.809
 you want to have the same color 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.170
 hair that I use you here 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.510
 a black chalk like that you have a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.369
 brown so a bit super classic 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.560
 it's this one for me it's really 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.509
 the brown that goes everywhere 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.460
 so you can really associate with 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.740
 any hair color I find myself 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.100
 finally blond arm that wants everything 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.580
 nice and then you have a beautiful world I 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.799
 think cholet found is the one who 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.850
 would look like the humblest we will say 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.650
 natural between life but that's because 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.290
 the others his pillow a little blurry I 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.619
 so it's the one who gets 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.810
 will bring a little bobo in good and then 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.000
 the other colors are 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.310
 mainly clubs sup the super 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.530
 funky that you can use gold 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 was not at an evening of a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.220
 disguise and all that I find that 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.229
 it's really great the principle 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.820
 and then to remove these little ones created there 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.979
 and none of that makes you 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.630
 shampoo and then his share that's it 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.549
 really very simple I think it 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.750
 lasts 24 ie two days you 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.969
 will keep two days to worry 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.340
 your choice points and so that's it 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.860
 so I'll show you here next 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.270
 how to use these created there the principle 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.900
 the trick is to take a wick you 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.280
 Take mass of hair streaked you 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.959
 take a lock of hair that you 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.959
 just have you wanted 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.150
 really good your wick to take 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.860
 a brush or lycées your wick because 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.680
 that must be smoother 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.069
 in pretty nice cloud mode and then 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.750
 you take your cream you take 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.519
 your mage who is wet and then you 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.900
 make a movement up and down and 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.640
 especially no water base because 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.730
 otherwise it's ok and stuffed makes your choice 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.620
 it's going to be nice at all so really 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.209
 very simple all the way down until 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.840
 you have the color as intense as 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.780
 you want it and then once 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.920
 you have the color I advise you 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.879
 of the home does what I already 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.870
 hated crès lacquered and you go 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.310
 your hand in it's true that his 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.090
 tendency to leave really barred as 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.849
 from greece 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.280
 his samba what so you put the 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.730
 lacc and it will hold the most 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.269
 long time possible your color your 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.250
 beautiful thing so here and then suddenly 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.349
 as you read when you have 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.720
 tired of having this little wick you 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.760
 shampoo and wash 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.400
 hair as usual like that 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.420
 allows to remove the color and in addition 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.879
 of that in this kit there you have the serum 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.310
 shine so that I advise you to 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.840
 to apply it after removing it is this 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.989
 that the trend created a little has 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.060
 dried the lock of hair and suddenly 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.580
 here is a little serum a little care after 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.010
 it's rather nice and then it 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.290
 will have to have not to have this 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.519
 sensation of 2 sec actually after 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.099
 josh so here's for that so leaves this 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.470
 kit costs 24 euros 95 and you can 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.349
 find on royal extension website 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.810
 so here is a small kit super nice for 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.190
 the evenings would have created an hour 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.410
 I tried to find them I did not 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.970
 not found and without knowing that royal 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.349
 extension was doing so yes but we 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.020
 propose to test that I found that 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.569
 rather nice in any case so here 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.200
 that's it for this little magazine 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.239
 hair 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.560
 I hope you have liked me 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.880
 do both very big kisses and 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.880
