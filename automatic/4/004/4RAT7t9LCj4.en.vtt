also mind them from underneath here but

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.399 
also mind them from underneath here but
you<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.150> larger<00:01:12.540> chance<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.930> finding<00:01:13.260> them

little bit bigger biome which is you and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.690 
little bit bigger biome which is you and
then<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> fire<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.740> even<00:01:47.250> large<00:01:47.430> bone

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
then that fire is here even large bone

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
then that fire is here even large bone
and<00:01:48.060> nap<00:01:48.390> I'm<00:01:48.600> two<00:01:48.810> things<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.170> need<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> larger

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and nap I'm two things we need a larger

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.620 
and nap I'm two things we need a larger
by<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.070> again<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:51.150> basically<00:01:51.299> how<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
by them again that's basically how the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359 
by them again that's basically how the
whole<00:01:51.810> process<00:01:52.020> works<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
whole process works so this is the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.450 
whole process works so this is the
smallest<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> biomes<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:55.130> yes<00:01:56.130> apart

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
smallest of the biomes and yes apart

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.590 
smallest of the biomes and yes apart
from<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> mineral<00:01:56.880> bone<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
from the mineral bone this is the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.210 
from the mineral bone this is the
smallest<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.229> branch<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.680> bigger<00:01:58.979> one

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
smallest or branch out to bigger one

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.680 
smallest or branch out to bigger one
there's<00:01:59.549> more<00:01:59.729> branch<00:01:59.970> out<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.240> bigger<00:02:00.420> ones

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
there's more branch out the bigger ones

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.539 
there's more branch out the bigger ones
and<00:02:01.260> it's<00:02:01.409> big<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> branch<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.400> bit

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and it's big on the branch out to a bit

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.990 
and it's big on the branch out to a bit
smaller<00:02:02.820> ones<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.659> forth<00:02:03.990> oh<00:02:04.610> another<00:02:05.610> cool

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
smaller ones so forth oh another cool

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
smaller ones so forth oh another cool
fact<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.450> them<00:02:06.900> is<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.099> fall

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
fact about them is that if you fall

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.360 
fact about them is that if you fall
through<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.299> will<00:02:09.450> die<00:02:09.860> yes<00:02:10.860> you're

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
through here you will die yes you're

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.300 
through here you will die yes you're
just<00:02:11.610> yet

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
just yet

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.330 
just yet
you<00:02:12.520> just<00:02:12.670> die<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:14.080> yeah<00:02:14.440> now<00:02:14.950> that's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
you just die so yeah now that's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.979 
you just die so yeah now that's
basically<00:02:15.790> all<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.120> really<00:02:16.239> need<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.870> know

basically all you really need to know
about<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.950> bio<00:02:18.370> seemed<00:02:18.700> odd<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.220> need<00:02:21.370> any

will walk out onto the boardwalk but

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
will walk out onto the boardwalk but
don't<00:02:34.330> expect<00:02:34.480> them<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.349> walk<00:02:35.560> out<00:02:36.569> into<00:02:37.569> other
