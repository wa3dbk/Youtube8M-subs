to the bundle number if you go watch my

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.400 
to the bundle number if you go watch my
other<00:00:52.440> pc<00:00:52.920> build<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.160> my<00:00:53.250> channel<00:00:54.320> it's<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
other pc build up my channel it's a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.990 
other pc build up my channel it's a
quite<00:00:55.559> nice<00:00:55.739> Carlos<00:00:56.340> getting<00:00:56.579> black<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.879> blue

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
other side so that I can do just a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.940 
other side so that I can do just a
clinic<00:04:06.900> panel<00:04:07.140> because<00:04:07.260> episodes<00:04:07.470> actually

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
clinic panel because episodes actually

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.550

what<00:05:11.660> I'm<00:05:11.810> going<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:11.990> be<00:05:12.050> doing<00:05:12.170> is<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.680> was

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
what I'm going to be doing is I was

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.620 
what I'm going to be doing is I was
thinking<00:05:13.370> about<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.760> some<00:05:13.850> others<00:05:13.970> mish<00:05:14.300> and

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
thinking about it some others mish and

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.660 
thinking about it some others mish and
changing<00:05:15.560> myself<00:05:15.680> as<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.220> can<00:05:16.310> self<00:05:16.460> trying

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
changing myself as you can self trying

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.280 
changing myself as you can self trying
to<00:05:16.760> push<00:05:16.910> you<00:05:17.000> up<00:05:17.090> there<00:05:17.330> but<00:05:17.990> I<00:05:18.020> mean<00:05:18.200> it's

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
to push you up there but I mean it's

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.840 
to push you up there but I mean it's
pretty<00:05:18.440> rigid<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.040> feels<00:05:19.220> like<00:05:19.340> in<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> snap

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
pretty rigid and it feels like in a snap

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.580 
pretty rigid and it feels like in a snap
when<00:05:20.030> I<00:05:20.060> push<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.480> so<00:05:20.690> am<00:05:20.870> what<00:05:21.380> I'm<00:05:21.440> going<00:05:21.560> to

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
when I push it so am what I'm going to

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.140 
when I push it so am what I'm going to
do<00:05:21.680> is<00:05:21.800> hopefully<00:05:22.220> I'll<00:05:22.340> be<00:05:22.370> good<00:05:22.610> from<00:05:22.820> black

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
do is hopefully I'll be good from black

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.040 
do is hopefully I'll be good from black
tinted<00:05:23.720> or<00:05:23.900> frosted<00:05:24.380> glass<00:05:24.610> acrylic<00:05:25.610> and

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
tinted or frosted glass acrylic and

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.570 
tinted or frosted glass acrylic and
getting<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.080> heat<00:05:27.230> gun<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.500> melting<00:05:28.160> that<00:05:28.280> into

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
getting a heat gun and melting that into

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.250 
getting a heat gun and melting that into
the<00:05:28.670> shape<00:05:28.910> will<00:05:29.150> not<00:05:29.300> melt<00:05:29.450> um<00:05:29.780> heat<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:30.230> that

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
the shape will not melt um heat in that

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.440 
the shape will not melt um heat in that
and<00:05:30.530> then<00:05:30.560> bending<00:05:30.920> it<00:05:31.040> into<00:05:31.250> shape<00:05:31.490> I<00:05:31.790> sort<00:05:32.390> of

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
and then bending it into shape I sort of

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.310 
and then bending it into shape I sort of
am<00:05:33.400> just<00:05:34.400> an<00:05:34.550> elevated<00:05:35.210> level<00:05:35.420> and<00:05:35.840> then<00:05:35.960> kind

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
am just an elevated level and then kind

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.770 
am just an elevated level and then kind
somehow<00:05:36.710> on<00:05:36.980> android<00:05:37.400> fan<00:05:38.000> melts<00:05:38.270> into<00:05:38.420> it<00:05:38.600> and

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
somehow on android fan melts into it and

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.750 
somehow on android fan melts into it and
having<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.620> on<00:05:39.740> there<00:05:39.980> so<00:05:40.160> hopefully<00:05:40.340> that

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
having it on there so hopefully that

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.790 
having it on there so hopefully that
will<00:05:40.880> be<00:05:41.060> pretty<00:05:41.300> easy<00:05:41.420> to<00:05:41.810> do<00:05:41.990> that's<00:05:42.560> pretty

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
will be pretty easy to do that's pretty

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.650 
will be pretty easy to do that's pretty
right<00:05:43.550> at<00:05:43.670> the<00:05:43.730> end<00:05:43.940> I'm<00:05:44.120> gonna<00:05:44.240> be<00:05:44.330> doing<00:05:44.450> that

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
right at the end I'm gonna be doing that

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.080 
right at the end I'm gonna be doing that
because<00:05:44.840> that's<00:05:45.200> a<00:05:45.520> pretty<00:05:46.520> big<00:05:46.700> job<00:05:46.940> in

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
because that's a pretty big job in

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.400 
because that's a pretty big job in
everything<00:05:47.420> and<00:05:47.450> i'll<00:05:47.600> probably<00:05:47.750> have<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:47.960> use

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
everything and i'll probably have to use

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.260 
everything and i'll probably have to use
some<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.620> my<00:05:48.910> granddad's<00:05:49.910> tools<00:05:50.150> and

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
some of my granddad's tools and

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.600 
some of my granddad's tools and
everything<00:05:50.330> to<00:05:50.600> do<00:05:50.720> that<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.710> also<00:05:51.950> had<00:05:52.310> said

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
everything to do that and also had said

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.550 
everything to do that and also had said
about<00:05:52.640> the<00:05:53.030> psu<00:05:53.540> is<00:05:53.690> not<00:05:53.870> sleeved<00:05:54.170> to<00:05:54.380> anything

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
about the psu is not sleeved to anything

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
only something like six months warranty

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.910
