only<00:00:04.610> as<00:00:04.700> higher<00:00:04.910> two<00:00:05.240> strings<00:00:05.630> we're<00:00:05.779> going

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
only as higher two strings we're going

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.970 
only as higher two strings we're going
to<00:00:05.960> do<00:00:06.080> it<00:00:06.200> a<00:00:06.260> little<00:00:06.439> bit<00:00:06.529> different<00:00:07.130> and

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
to do it a little bit different and

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.530 
to do it a little bit different and
we're<00:00:09.980> going<00:00:10.129> to<00:00:10.190> do<00:00:10.309> it<00:00:10.430> like<00:00:10.549> this<00:00:10.820> in<00:00:11.090> order

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
we're going to do it like this in order

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.970 
we're going to do it like this in order
to<00:00:11.690> keep<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:11.929> string<00:00:12.440> because<00:00:12.679> that<00:00:12.860> the

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
to keep the string because that the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.490 
to keep the string because that the
strings<00:00:13.340> are<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.519> whole<00:00:13.700> lot<00:00:13.730> thinner<00:00:14.290> and<00:00:15.290> they

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
strings are a whole lot thinner and they

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.010 
strings are a whole lot thinner and they
do<00:00:15.559> tend<00:00:16.009> to<00:00:16.130> slip<00:00:16.400> out<00:00:16.610> what<00:00:17.450> we<00:00:17.570> want<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:17.869> do

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
do tend to slip out what we want to do

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.220 
do tend to slip out what we want to do
is<00:00:18.880> we're<00:00:19.880> going<00:00:19.970> to<00:00:20.060> have<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.600> little<00:00:20.990> bit<00:00:21.140> of

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
is we're going to have a little bit of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.410 
is we're going to have a little bit of
extra<00:00:21.529> slack<00:00:21.830> okay<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:25.660> about<00:00:26.660> an<00:00:26.810> inch<00:00:26.960> again

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
extra slack okay and about an inch again

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.740 
extra slack okay and about an inch again
we're<00:00:29.420> going<00:00:29.689> back<00:00:30.199> around<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:30.920> tuner<00:00:31.750> and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
we're going back around the tuner and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.290 
we're going back around the tuner and
we're<00:00:33.350> going<00:00:33.620> underneath<00:00:34.460> that<00:00:35.269> string<00:00:35.780> okay

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
we're going underneath that string okay

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.139 
we're going underneath that string okay
now<00:00:38.300> once<00:00:38.960> we<00:00:39.140> go<00:00:39.260> underneath<00:00:39.649> it<00:00:39.980> we're<00:00:40.820> going

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
now once we go underneath it we're going

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.270 
now once we go underneath it we're going
to<00:00:41.270> do<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:41.930> loop<00:00:42.850> up<00:00:43.870> okay<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.140> that's<00:00:45.980> where

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
to do a loop up okay and that's where

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.350 
to do a loop up okay and that's where
we're<00:00:46.489> going<00:00:46.760> to<00:00:48.100> tighten<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.280> ok<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.300> again

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
we're going to tighten it ok so again

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.139 
we're going to tighten it ok so again
stop<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.600> string<00:00:53.899> through<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.620> whole<00:00:55.149> came

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
stop the string through the whole came

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.130 
stop the string through the whole came
around<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:57.670> went<00:00:58.670> underneath<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.780> string

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
around that went underneath the string

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.570 
around that went underneath the string
and<00:01:00.640> Lulu<00:01:01.640> hooked<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:02.059> up<00:01:02.149> like<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.500> okay<00:01:03.580> and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
and Lulu hooked it up like that okay and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.830 
and Lulu hooked it up like that okay and
now<00:01:05.229> we're<00:01:06.229> going<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.710> tighten<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:09.220> okay<00:01:10.840> so

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
now we're going to tighten it okay so

now we're going to tighten it okay so
it's<00:01:12.020> actually<00:01:12.260> as<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.770> tighten<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.460> it's<00:01:13.670> going

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
it's actually as I tighten it it's going

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.550 
it's actually as I tighten it it's going
to<00:01:14.000> lock<00:01:14.799> around<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:17.600> string<00:01:17.960> that's<00:01:18.110> poking

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
to lock around this string that's poking

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.230 
to lock around this string that's poking
up<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:19.310> way<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.939> doesn't<00:01:20.619> it<00:01:21.619> can't<00:01:21.950> come<00:01:22.130> out

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
up this way it doesn't it can't come out

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:36.800 
up this way it doesn't it can't come out
