00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.330
 the coach of Real Madrid JosÃ© 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.130
 Mourinho appeared at a press conference 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.320
 after the victory of his team against 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.450
 the real society in it analyzed the 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.999
 work of Christian Ronaldo and all the 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.610
 team with young people with 10 in no 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:19.020
 Now you can play with 9 days 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.510
 they have to participate in the sessions 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.090
 defensive has the team loses being 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.340
 compact that is necessarily a little 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.620
 more emotion 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.180
 and that normally in a public when 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.890
 his team was playing with 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.010
 normally the public is easier to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.070
 put it on your side when you get in and the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.900
 people see and feel that you want to win 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.540
 same per player less and I think that the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.300
 players have managed to transmit this 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.170
 feeling to the fans and has 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.350
 got that the fans 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.170
 they were with them during the night 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.109
 working well as everyone 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.359
 it's a good match as everyone has 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.600
 deserved to win as everyone has done a 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.600
 effort 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.750
 extra like all 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.250
 and he has celebrated with his classmates and 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.730
 then he has approached the bench that 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 It is very short 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.010
 an important weapon that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.020
 that we gained immersed nothing else to begin 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.880
 the Real Madrid match stayed with 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.340
 one less for the expulsion of Antonio 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.350
 Adam the Madridista technician assesses if that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:36.159
 play and your player my feelings 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:39.310
 which must be able to 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.520
 to be able to mark but it seems to me that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.729
 we have about two players between 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.230
 delivered on the goal line 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.500
 inside the line 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.750
 and what has happened is 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.880
 this season, we are always 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.920
 finalized with decisions 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.159
 are the ones penalized with the wrong ones 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.300
 and they are more penalized with doubts is 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.409
 for me 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.860
 I can not be wrong and I want to give 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.209
 the benefit of the doubt to the referee 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.680
 I want a great time but my feeling 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.280
 is that in another field with another team 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.319
 yellow card penalty 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.910
 much has been lacking about giving 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.080
 it's not because he does not have 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.920
 16 years I left to madrid 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.920
 they have 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.710
 formaciones la madrid is madridista has 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.680
 born in madrid 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.580
 He is a son of the house and why not 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.260
 may have a right also to be a 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.710
 be happy that's why we have 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.000
 transformed an attack problem to the 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.280
 from mourinho to our area that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.130
 program in a problem of lack of 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.530
 respect for a boy who deserves 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.970
 Real Madrid and respect begin 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.650
 think about the cup game of the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.970
 Wednesday against the Celtic 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.300
 jose mourinho talked like this about this 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.480
 I am coach next meeting 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.620
 passionate and coach every game is 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.270
 it is equal the cup game nothing more 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.300
 important that starting from league by the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.550
 fact that you tell me we are very 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.700
 distant d 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.290
 first thing but jump plays the theme well 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.030
 as a team is confidently 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:31.600
 winning 2 2 1 but my experience here 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.520
 also in these two and a half years the 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.140
 people like people cup games 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.520
 they like 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.740
 the emotion of 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.620
 of winning and continuing or losing and being out 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.140
 and I have the feeling that even though 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.390
 we play already in a few days and that 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.090
 the people who have played is has a 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.660
 effort 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.629
 extra days so long my feeling is 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.840
 that the team is going to be and the session is going 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.840
 to be and here we can
