00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 and let's talk a little bit about things 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.780
 necessary basics that you may need 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.380
 to make cookies that is the main thing 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 The main thing is to have some cutters to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.770
 see you can always resort to the typical 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.750
 glass at home that we all have done 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.699
 to have some round cookies but 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.260
 if we can have some forms then 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.180
 much better there are infinite kinds of 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.429
 cutters we have for example these that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.949
 they are metal cutters are fantastic 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.140
 because the edge is very sharp and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.260
 then when we cut we should make a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 practically perfect cut of these 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.210
 we have this we have others more 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.360
 little ones of infinity of forms 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 we get these that come into play that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.480
 they come in pairs that can make figures 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 very funny in this for example that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 It has the shape of cupcakes or you can always 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.600
 make a big one with a tiny one of 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.480
 window for example we are giving 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.030
 ideas 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.980
 and another little thing that you can do with that 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.320
 same idea with making a little window 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.479
 for example, with these, there is a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.119
 game you could cut so much for this 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.530
 side that has the hondita like this 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.540
 smooth and what you want to do a little circle 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.520
 bigger then cut the little one's 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.290
 inside and when you baked it you put 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 a few crystallites good a caramel 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.530
 crushed but you put in the center the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.630
 minister- bake things that in some 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.659
 fantastic cookies with a little window 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.670
 of glass these would be plastic 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.610
 these are phenomenal because they come 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.320
 reinforced and does not deform the same 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.570
 would happen with this style that is also 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.580
 Plastic ones are the most 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.039
 indicated for children to use 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.440
 because it does not have the metallic edge 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.399
 they will have no risk a risk of 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.009
 cut other curious cutters these 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.350
 they bring you comfort grip they call it 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.440
 which is the handle to catch them are very 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.930
 comfortable and they help you very much 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.450
 of pressing and catching them properly 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.820
 and other curious cutters there are 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.280
 those that come with textures that 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.370
 would be for example this with this very 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.040
 simple because you stretch the short dough and 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.850
 then you would put the texturing that would be 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.860
 stops is placed on the dough the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.800
 roller above and stays checked 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.720
 shape and other type of cutters that you 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.930
 they do this directly and texturize 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.090
 would these be these cutters for 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.700
 use it is very simple stretch the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.860
 mass puts them short 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.360
 the first thing is to cut always move it 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.260
 a little bit so he knows well the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.620
 mass and already you press and when pressing as 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.050
 you see this part of the cutter that you 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.030
 Let's texturized is we have this 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.060
 we have another one of flowers 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.580
 there are infinite infinity of designs other 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.190
 necessary thing to prepare 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.200
 cookies as a roll serves you this 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.840
 Roller type or any roller 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.840
 wood that you have at home there is a trick 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.269
 very simple there are these tablets 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.280
 they come in pack they usually come 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.319
 single-thickness individual and have 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.940
 different thicknesses then for example 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.349
 you want to make 3 cookies 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.599
 millimeters that is this is a little bit 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.870
 fine but good is the one that caught 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.360
 you place them on the sides you place the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.430
 mass in the center and you start to pass the 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.590
 roller and when it reaches the top of the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.910
 biscuit the dough has all the same 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.580
 thickness either when they left the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.250
 bake biscuits perfect for 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.720
 the best a tray of this style that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.910
 are the special trays for 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.890
 cookies and if not then even if you have 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.200
 you in the oven to take them out 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.090
 remember you always have to leave them 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.650
 cool a little on the tray and 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.810
 then to a grid like the one we use 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.030
 to cool the cupcakes and also the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.579
 clear cakes so I do not expect anything 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.140
 with this I have clarified a 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.459
 little everything you need to 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.459
 make some great cookies
