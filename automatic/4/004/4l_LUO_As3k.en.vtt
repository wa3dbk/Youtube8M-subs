actually buy host in sm dicing however
you<00:04:55.180> do<00:04:55.390> have<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:56.169> put<00:04:56.320> down<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.590> deposit

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.830 

however<00:05:00.190> much<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.520> deposit<00:05:01.060> half<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.540> that<00:05:01.660> is

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
however much you deposit half of that is

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.409 
however much you deposit half of that is
the<00:05:01.960> maximum<00:05:02.110> bet<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.680> can<00:05:02.860> take<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.460> if<00:05:04.300> you

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
the maximum bet you can take so if you

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.570 
the maximum bet you can take so if you
deposit<00:05:04.810> 100<00:05:04.930> mil<00:05:05.410> then<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:06.190> can<00:05:06.340> take<00:05:06.520> a

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
deposit 100 mil then you can take a

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.450 
deposit 100 mil then you can take a
maximum<00:05:06.880> of<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.480> 50-ml<00:05:08.020> bet<00:05:08.280> which<00:05:09.280> would

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
maximum of a 50-ml bet which would

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.460 
maximum of a 50-ml bet which would
obviously<00:05:09.490> turn<00:05:10.120> into<00:05:10.390> a<00:05:10.450> hundred<00:05:10.840> mil<00:05:10.990> pot<00:05:13.470> so

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
obviously turn into a hundred mil pot so

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.250
