00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
about putting it on my eye or anywhere

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.570 
about putting it on my eye or anywhere
near<00:02:17.459> my<00:02:17.550> eye<00:02:17.580> because<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.300> stink<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.650> um<00:02:19.860> it

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
near my eye because the stink but um it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.860 
near my eye because the stink but um it
doesn't<00:02:20.820> really<00:02:20.910> burn<00:02:21.239> or<00:02:21.480> anything<00:02:21.720> like
