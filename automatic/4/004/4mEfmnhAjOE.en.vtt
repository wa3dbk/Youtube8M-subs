00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.730
 Oh move 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.680
 It is a single type 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:12.950
 I would like to assemble the roby again this time Roby is the lobby 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:19.039
 We will continue down the No. 26 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:25.570
 Well , first of all I think that I want to do from the life of Powers 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:29.470
 So I think that I want to introduce the parts to use in the lobby. Nos. 26 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.650
 First servo motor that is attached to the lobby No. 26 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.960
 One right ankle vertical rotation work 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:45.030
 Parts that come with this time was the servo motor one only 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.720
 And it is provided in the servo cable and or same No. 25, which was stretched a seal to use this time No. 25 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.570
 Was 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.440
 We will use the head stand assembled with one ankle tape 85 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.090
 Let's go together 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:04.790
 First of all , remove the cover of the servo motor to do a servo test . 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.790
 Since the screw is attached, I will remove the screw 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 web 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 Hmm 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.810
 Yes I feel the back cover when the screw is removed Yes 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.070
 Hmm 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.760
 Here 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.690
 And 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:32.850
 Connect the servo cable to the connector 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.510
 In the magazine, I attached the servo cable to the connector on the side of Koc, so I attached it here too 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.370
 To go 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.370
 It is usual guidance Yes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.690
 Yes installed 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 Yes i feel like this 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.359
 Once it's installed 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.359
 Pass the cable through this hole 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.110
 I will screw again 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:22.430
 In it that I was able Yes example screwing I think I want to do a test of id 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.000
 Then I would like to do servo test 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.530
 Well this time in advance this cable is 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.530
 I disconnected the servo cable Yes 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.380
 Install the servo cable to the ok connector here 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.630
 It is not 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.910
 By Sau cable has been installed Yes Turn on the power of here 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:58.630
 If yes 1 lights up this 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:01.990
 Press test set button to check if the serve works yes 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:09.930
 This is 45 degrees 40 left and right 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:09.930
 If you come back I stop waiting to rotate It is age 45 degrees to the entered works correctly 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.800
 Yes it works properly 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:24.820
 Then write the id next 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:28.690
 This id is led that I would like to do both confirmation of it only after the confirmation id 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.350
 In the condition that the light of 5 is lit 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.760
 Because this means that it writes, this up button 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.989
 Press the Up button 4 times 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.850
 Yes 1234 yes 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.440
 I applied it to number 5 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.680
 After this, hold down this test and set button while the bar lights up 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.680
 Yes 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.780
 Yes 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.780
 After flashing 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:06.770
 The fifth is 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:11.170
 It will be displayed Now turn off the power to confirm writing is finished 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.170
 Yes power is turned on again disappeared 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.769
 Yes it's the best, but pressing the test and set button again makes it over come 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.769
 to go 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:30.340
 This completes the writing of id and confirmation 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.340
 Yes Turn off the power when finished 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.740
 Serve black 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.740
 Remove it as you lift up Yes removed easily 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.700
 Be sure to attach a servo cable to this connector after using it by all means 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.900
 Because it will cause a failure 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.900
 Be sure to attach 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.900
 Then I want to go to the last step 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.700
 Last emperor put ankle tape on the servo 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.660
 is 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.660
 I think a little confusing, but this is 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:17.900
 It seems that ankle tape 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:21.979
 You know color is here is white here is of that lobby 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:28.100
 The body color is something like creamy color 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:31.169
 I think at me Yes is that here is peel off the stick this in What is that adhesive portion 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:37.190
 Well then let's get along 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:39.129
 It is the edge of this servo shaft for spring city 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.440
 From the middle of 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.190
 from here 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.190
 Soar 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.180
 It is to turn and put up to here 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:03.270
 Is to stick to the side so that it does not stick out below the back cover 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.270
 I think I want to actually do it 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:11.630
 Yes I finished sticking 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.630
 This is something like this 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.690
 It was good even from the front 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.930
 Just 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.500
 Photos around here is what 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:29.520
 It's kind of awkward but the end 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.700
 I can see it as a little motor 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:40.310
 Masu Nante it something wide 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:44.240
 I think it means that I do not know the color Yes this seal of this No. 26 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:50.199
 So the assembly work has ended or 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.199
 Please take a closer look Suggest to meet you in issue 27 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.240
 Good Iiii
