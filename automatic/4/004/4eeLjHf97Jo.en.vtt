and I think we cut that what six inches

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.880 
and I think we cut that what six inches
by<00:03:36.250> about<00:03:36.640> 14<00:03:37.209> inches<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:37.600> think<00:03:37.630> mm-hmm<00:03:38.620> and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
by about 14 inches I think mm-hmm and

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.740 
by about 14 inches I think mm-hmm and
that's<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.820> foam<00:03:39.970> board<00:03:40.150> piece<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.630> you

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
that's the foam board piece and you

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.479 
that's the foam board piece and you
