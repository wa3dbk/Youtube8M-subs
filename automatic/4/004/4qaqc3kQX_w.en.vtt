00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.630 
first if they have their balance they
can<00:01:39.170> figure<00:01:39.380> out<00:01:39.470> how<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.710> pedal<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.100> bike<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.549> a

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
can figure out how to pedal a bike in a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.609 
can figure out how to pedal a bike in a
matter<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:40.970> about<00:01:41.119> 30<00:01:41.659> seconds<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.320> 1<00:01:42.560> minute

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
matter of about 30 seconds to 1 minute

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.920 
matter of about 30 seconds to 1 minute
so<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.700> straighter<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.119> unique<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.689> that

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
so the straighter is unique and that

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.870 
so the straighter is unique and that
there<00:01:45.080> isn't<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:45.470> big<00:01:45.770> step<00:01:46.280> or<00:01:46.579> this<00:01:46.729> big

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
there isn't this big step or this big

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.120 
there isn't this big step or this big
leap<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:47.390> faith<00:01:47.630> where<00:01:47.960> they<00:01:48.140> have<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.650> all<00:01:48.950> of

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
leap of faith where they have to all of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.999 
leap of faith where they have to all of
a<00:01:49.189> sudden<00:01:49.520> be<00:01:49.610> riding<00:01:50.210> at<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.020> first<00:01:51.590> inkling

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
a sudden be riding at the first inkling

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.980 
a sudden be riding at the first inkling
of<00:01:52.250> insecurity<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.329> just<00:01:53.540> put<00:01:53.689> their<00:01:53.810> feet

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
of insecurity and just put their feet

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.080 
of insecurity and just put their feet
down<00:01:54.200> again<00:01:54.470> after<00:01:55.009> they've<00:01:55.189> figured<00:01:55.670> out<00:01:55.880> all

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
down again after they've figured out all

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.060 
down again after they've figured out all
the<00:01:56.119> balance

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
the balance

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.640 
the balance
and<00:01:57.250> steering<00:01:57.940> riding<00:01:58.450> skills<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.229> enters<00:01:59.620> a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
and steering riding skills it enters a

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.399 
and steering riding skills it enters a
new<00:01:59.950> phase<00:01:59.979> where<00:02:00.790> now<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.180> becomes<00:02:01.479> a<00:02:01.720> toy<00:02:01.960> for

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
new phase where now it becomes a toy for

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.500 
new phase where now it becomes a toy for
the<00:02:02.440> bigger<00:02:02.710> kids<00:02:03.010> and<00:02:03.490> by<00:02:03.790> bigger<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.180> mean
