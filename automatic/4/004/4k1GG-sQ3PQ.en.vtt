00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
there we go so in the end it was too

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
there we go so in the end it was too
easy<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.740> algebraic<00:02:02.729> were<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.030> pushing<00:02:03.180> way

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
easy in algebraic were just pushing way

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
easy in algebraic were just pushing way
too<00:02:03.630> many<00:02:04.020> players<00:02:04.320> forward<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.890> they<00:02:05.189> were

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
too many players forward and they were

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.859 
too many players forward and they were
just<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.549> search<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.479> crucial

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
just in search of that of that crucial

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.479 
just in search of that of that crucial
with<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.680> crucial<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.369> them

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
with it that crucial got to get them

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.830 
with it that crucial got to get them
back<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.330> wasn't<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> happen

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
back in it but it wasn't going to happen

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.050 
back in it but it wasn't going to happen
for<00:02:10.110> them<00:02:10.259> they<00:02:10.590> absolutely<00:02:10.770> needed<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.700> win<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
for them they absolutely needed a win to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
for them they absolutely needed a win to
try<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.300> get<00:02:12.540> that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
to try to keep themselves in it as you

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.880 
to try to keep themselves in it as you
can<00:02:15.270> see<00:02:15.420> Grenier<00:02:15.780> taking<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.560> freaky<00:02:16.830> at

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
can see Grenier taking the freaky at

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.590 
can see Grenier taking the freaky at
that<00:02:17.010> time<00:02:17.190> instead<00:02:17.460> of<00:02:17.520> gore<00:02:17.790> cook<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
that time instead of gore cook and the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.270 
that time instead of gore cook and the
shot<00:02:18.840> was<00:02:19.110> way<00:02:19.320> too<00:02:19.380> close<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> key<00:02:20.070> but<00:02:20.220> he

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
shot was way too close to the key but he

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.310 
shot was way too close to the key but he
just<00:02:20.460> pluck<00:02:20.790> sit<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.090> here<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.420> that's<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.020> we

just pluck sit in here and that's it we

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.870 
just pluck sit in here and that's it we
went<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> Nell<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.010> that's<00:02:23.190> fine<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.730> to

went to Nell so that's fine not to
nothing<00:02:24.690> much<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:24.990> can<00:02:25.020> complain<00:02:25.410> about<00:02:25.590> their

was<00:02:36.810> pretty<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.080> believe<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.440> was<00:02:37.620> maybe<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
was pretty I believe that was maybe the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.000 
was pretty I believe that was maybe the
fifth<00:02:38.280> game<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.770> Euroleague<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> we

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
fifth game of the Euroleague that we

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.220 
fifth game of the Euroleague that we
were<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.880> which<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.600> which<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.110> good

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
were in so which is which is a good

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.780 
were in so which is which is a good
thing<00:02:43.290> too<00:02:43.560> because<00:02:43.590> we're<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.040> nine<00:02:44.370> points

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
thing too because we're on nine points

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.270 
thing too because we're on nine points
and<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.330> team<00:02:45.540> above<00:02:45.780> us<00:02:45.930> who<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.290> think<00:02:46.560> yeah

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
and the team above us who I think yeah

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.910 
and the team above us who I think yeah
what<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.490> was<00:02:47.640> saying<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.910> team<00:02:48.060> above<00:02:48.300> us<00:02:48.450> were

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
what I was saying the team above us were

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.900 
what I was saying the team above us were
Wolfsburg<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.130> obviously<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.490> we<00:02:50.760> just

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
Wolfsburg and obviously that we just

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.940 
Wolfsburg and obviously that we just
needed<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.209> get<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> winner<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:52.320> really<00:02:52.620> need<00:02:52.740> to

on the free kick from that distance was

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.610 
on the free kick from that distance was
the<00:04:20.790> exact<00:04:21.150> amount<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.780> want<00:04:22.080> under<00:04:22.440> two

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
it can be exact and sometimes they might

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.670 
it can be exact and sometimes they might
just<00:04:35.970> see<00:04:36.419> they<00:04:36.629> might<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.080> miss<00:04:37.259> hit<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.560> it

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199

which<00:05:31.710> probably<00:05:31.949> gives<00:05:32.190> you<00:05:32.279> a<00:05:32.310> bit<00:05:32.430> of<00:05:32.460> an

which probably gives you a bit of an

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.119 
didn't even lose eventually we ended up
losing<00:06:09.029> nebula<00:06:09.330> fakir<00:06:09.750> 45<00:06:10.349> days<00:06:10.590> somehow<00:06:10.949> but

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
losing nebula fakir 45 days somehow but

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:12.980 
losing nebula fakir 45 days somehow but
either<00:06:11.219> way<00:06:11.430> that<00:06:11.940> was<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.599> was<00:06:12.659> pretty<00:06:12.750> much

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
either way that was that was pretty much

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.059 
either way that was that was pretty much
going<00:06:13.199> to<00:06:13.259> be<00:06:13.319> it<00:06:13.440> he<00:06:13.590> just<00:06:13.680> brought<00:06:13.889> your

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
going to be it he just brought your

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.260 
going to be it he just brought your
shoulder<00:06:14.340> or<00:06:14.430> whatever<00:06:14.669> that's<00:06:14.789> fine<00:06:14.909> that

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
shoulder or whatever that's fine that

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.309 
shoulder or whatever that's fine that
means<00:06:15.419> he<00:06:15.539> will<00:06:15.599> probably<00:06:15.900> miss<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.199> next

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
means he will probably miss the next

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.930 
means he will probably miss the next
game<00:06:16.590> but<00:06:16.830> then<00:06:17.340> again<00:06:17.460> he<00:06:17.699> might<00:06:17.729> actually

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
game but then again he might actually

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.459 
game but then again he might actually
miss<00:06:18.210> the<00:06:18.270> next<00:06:18.419> two<00:06:18.629> games<00:06:18.810> because<00:06:19.259> look<00:06:19.440> at

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
miss the next two games because look at

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.619 
miss the next two games because look at
this<00:06:19.620> we<00:06:19.830> advance<00:06:20.159> we've<00:06:20.699> got<00:06:20.879> a<00:06:20.909> cup<00:06:21.150> game<00:06:21.389> and

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:21.629 
this we advance we've got a cup game and

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.779 
this we advance we've got a cup game and
then<00:06:21.960> after<00:06:22.229> that<00:06:22.319> we<00:06:22.620> play<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:22.949> final<00:06:23.190> europa

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
then after that we play the final europa

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.490 
then after that we play the final europa
league<00:06:23.819> match<00:06:24.150> against<00:06:24.479> Wolfsburg<00:06:24.990> so<00:06:25.349> he

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
league match against Wolfsburg so he

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.779 
league match against Wolfsburg so he
might<00:06:25.590> actually<00:06:25.800> end<00:06:25.979> up<00:06:26.129> missing<00:06:26.340> both<00:06:26.550> games

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
might actually end up missing both games

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:27.830 
might actually end up missing both games
because<00:06:27.090> we're<00:06:27.240> playing<00:06:27.419> so<00:06:27.629> many<00:06:27.719> games

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
because we're playing so many games

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.869 
because we're playing so many games
within<00:06:28.289> each<00:06:28.469> other<00:06:28.620> but<00:06:28.770> either<00:06:29.219> way<00:06:29.460> that's

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:29.879 
within each other but either way that's

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.249 
within each other but either way that's
going<00:06:30.000> to<00:06:30.060> have<00:06:30.210> to<00:06:30.240> do<00:06:30.419> it<00:06:30.539> we<00:06:30.810> will<00:06:30.930> play<00:06:31.110> this

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
going to have to do it we will play this

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.749 
going to have to do it we will play this
cup<00:06:31.529> game<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:31.949> hopefully<00:06:32.099> progress<00:06:32.550> because

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
cup game and hopefully progress because

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.579 
cup game and hopefully progress because
we're<00:06:33.719> actually<00:06:33.840> getting<00:06:34.080> toward<00:06:34.379> the<00:06:34.409> latter

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:34.589 
we're actually getting toward the latter

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:36.139 
we're actually getting toward the latter
stages<00:06:34.860> you<00:06:35.039> can<00:06:35.159> see<00:06:35.279> there<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:35.520> round<00:06:35.699> of<00:06:35.789> 16

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:36.149 
stages you can see there the round of 16

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.029
