00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
next we come to the name of the note so

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.610 
next we come to the name of the note so
here<00:00:05.790> we<00:00:05.880> can<00:00:05.910> change<00:00:06.300> this<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.870> anything

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
here we can change this to anything

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.789 
here we can change this to anything
would<00:00:07.859> letter<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.280> we<00:00:08.370> could<00:00:08.519> say<00:00:08.670> my<00:00:09.799> coffee

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
would letter so we could say my coffee

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.980 
would letter so we could say my coffee
we<00:00:11.639> could<00:00:11.790> also<00:00:11.940> have<00:00:12.240> numbers<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:12.690> we

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
we could also have numbers but we

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
we could also have numbers but we
couldn't<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> space<00:00:13.769> huh<00:00:14.059> hitting<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
couldn't have a space huh hitting the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.400 
couldn't have a space huh hitting the
space<00:00:15.330> bar<00:00:15.360> will<00:00:15.660> actually<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.110> give<00:00:16.260> me

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
space bar will actually just give me

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.099 
space bar will actually just give me
underscores<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.820> then<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.420> put<00:00:18.599> two<00:00:18.810> there

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
underscores and then I can put two there

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.900 
underscores and then I can put two there
the<00:00:19.800> only<00:00:19.980> thing<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.550> can't<00:00:20.789> actually

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the only thing is that we can't actually

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
the only thing is that we can't actually
start<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.599> a<00:00:21.630> number<00:00:21.840> tough<00:00:22.080> i'm<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.650> i<00:00:22.800> put

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
start with a number tough i'm here i put

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.339 
start with a number tough i'm here i put
seven<00:00:24.150> or<00:00:24.240> something<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.630> won't<00:00:24.810> work<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.289> i

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
seven or something it won't work but i

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.080 
seven or something it won't work but i
could<00:00:25.529> start<00:00:25.740> with<00:00:25.830> any<00:00:26.039> letter<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.609> even<00:00:27.000> an

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
could start with any letter or even an

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.099 
could start with any letter or even an
under<00:00:27.300> school<00:00:27.570> there<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:29.539> we<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.660> see<00:00:30.869> that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
under school there and we can see that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.490 
under school there and we can see that
the<00:00:31.410> name<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.580> updated<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.900> graph<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.350> as

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the name is updated on the graph here as

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.580 
the name is updated on the graph here as
well<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.670> whatever<00:00:36.360> name<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.990> here<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
well so whatever name we have here is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.020 
well so whatever name we have here is
the<00:00:37.890> name<00:00:38.070> that's<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.520> referenced

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the name that's going to be referenced

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.390 
the name that's going to be referenced
in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> expression<00:00:39.660> okay<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.220> these

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
in the expression okay so to see these

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.980 
in the expression okay so to see these
two<00:00:41.610> let's<00:00:41.820> now<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.240> look<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:42.690> something

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
two let's now have a look at something

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.720 
two let's now have a look at something
that<00:00:43.200> has<00:00:43.380> on<00:00:43.590> screen<00:00:43.890> control<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.580> had<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that has on screen control so we had a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.300 
that has on screen control so we had a
busy<00:00:44.970> day<00:00:45.060> here<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.800> double-click<00:00:47.160> this

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
busy day here so we double-click this

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.650 
busy day here so we double-click this
video<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> first<00:00:50.310> one

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
video we can see that the first one

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.780 
video we can see that the first one
refers<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.990> tile<00:00:52.230> color<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.130> if<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.520> change

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
refers to the tile color so if we change

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.000 
refers to the tile color so if we change
that<00:00:54.060> to<00:00:54.630> something<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:55.610> blue<00:00:57.710> you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.860> see

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that to something like blue you can see

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.280 
that to something like blue you can see
now<00:00:59.220> that<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.640> tile<00:00:59.850> color<00:01:00.150> has<00:01:00.630> changed<00:01:00.660> as

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
now that the tile color has changed as

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.620 
now that the tile color has changed as
is<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> title<00:01:02.160> bar<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.150> we<00:01:03.300> double

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
is the title bar here and if we double

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.299 
is the title bar here and if we double
click<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.990> you<00:01:04.350> consider<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:04.949> that's

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
click it you consider it now that's

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.910 
click it you consider it now that's
selected<00:01:06.020> but<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.140> top<00:01:07.289> of<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.469> we<00:01:07.679> can<00:01:07.799> also

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
selected but on top of that we can also

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.740 
selected but on top of that we can also
choose<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> change<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:11.450> on-screen<00:01:12.450> controls

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
choose to change the on-screen controls

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.929 
choose to change the on-screen controls
color<00:01:13.259> so<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.039> could<00:01:14.159> change<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.700> blue

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
color so we could change that to blue

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.029 
color so we could change that to blue
but<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.469> not<00:01:16.590> quite<00:01:16.859> the

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
but you can see that's not quite the

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.980 
but you can see that's not quite the
same<00:01:17.460> blue<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:17.969> we<00:01:18.090> could<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.270> copy<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.780> over

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
same blue or we could just copy it over

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.520 
same blue or we could just copy it over
like<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.039> now<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.310> exactly<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> same

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
like that and now it's exactly the same

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.880 
like that and now it's exactly the same
next<00:01:22.530> long<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> undo<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.850> redo<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
next long we have the undo and redo and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
next long we have the undo and redo and
reset<00:01:25.890> button<00:01:26.219> as<00:01:26.899> there's<00:01:27.899> an<00:01:27.990> important

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
reset button as there's an important

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.800 
reset button as there's an important
distinction<00:01:28.770> between<00:01:29.039> this<00:01:29.670> undo<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.539> and

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
distinction between this undo here and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.800 
distinction between this undo here and
this<00:01:33.810> undo<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.819> so<00:01:35.819> the<00:01:35.999> undo<00:01:36.299> from<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> main

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
this undo here so the undo from the main

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.450 
this undo here so the undo from the main
menu<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.499> also<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.859> one<00:01:38.219> with<00:01:38.429> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
menu which is also the one with the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.230 
menu which is also the one with the
hotkeys<00:01:39.270> goes<00:01:40.170> back<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.679> linear<00:01:40.920> fashion

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
hotkeys goes back in a linear fashion

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.289 
hotkeys goes back in a linear fashion
where<00:01:42.240> these<00:01:42.899> undos<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:44.119> operate<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
where these undos here operate in a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
where these undos here operate in a
nonlinear<00:01:45.869> fashion<00:01:46.549> okay<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.609> let's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
nonlinear fashion okay so let's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.539 
nonlinear fashion okay so let's
illustrate<00:01:48.179> that<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.200> image<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.460> I'm

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
illustrate that here we go image so I'm

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.440 
illustrate that here we go image so I'm
going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> choose<00:01:50.969> color<00:01:51.840> bars<00:01:53.119> I'm<00:01:54.119> now<00:01:54.389> going

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
going to choose color bars I'm now going

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.379 
going to choose color bars I'm now going
to<00:01:54.630> choose<00:01:54.810> busy<00:01:55.109> a<00:01:55.170> witch<00:01:55.380> hotkey<00:01:55.829> p<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> I'm

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:57.389 
to choose busy a witch hotkey p so I'm

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.120 
to choose busy a witch hotkey p so I'm
also<00:01:57.539> going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> view<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.229> I'm<00:01:58.259> drawing<00:01:58.859> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
also going to view what I'm drawing so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
realized I'd lost that point so I could

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:42.490 
realized I'd lost that point so I could
step<00:02:33.090> back<00:02:33.120> here<00:02:33.660> through<00:02:34.110> undies<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:41.150> undo

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
three buttons here so this one here will

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.540 
three buttons here so this one here will
float<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.169> then<00:04:41.169> this<00:04:41.440> one<00:04:41.500> here<00:04:41.950> is<00:04:42.130> help

it<00:04:46.090> would<00:04:46.210> be<00:04:46.419> closed<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.200> this<00:04:47.620> one<00:04:47.800> if<00:04:48.190> I

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
it would be closed and this one if I

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.000 
it would be closed and this one if I
click<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.550> again<00:04:48.729> we'll<00:04:49.510> put<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:49.840> we'll<00:04:49.870> put<00:04:50.320> to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
live under this tab here node so label

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.860 
live under this tab here node so label
this<00:04:59.260> will<00:04:59.470> allow<00:04:59.680> us<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.860> a<00:05:00.070> label<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:01.690> node

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
this will allow us to a label the node

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.600 
this will allow us to a label the node
without<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.320> interfering<00:05:03.070> with<00:05:03.250> the

without it interfering with the
expression<00:05:04.510> name<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:04.990> can<00:05:05.020> call<00:05:05.289> this<00:05:05.410> rough

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
expression name so I can call this rough

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.540 
expression name so I can call this rough
and<00:05:07.540> you<00:05:07.600> can<00:05:07.720> see<00:05:07.900> now<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.320> that<00:05:09.190> appears

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
and you can see now that that appears

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.210 
and you can see now that that appears
here<00:05:09.610> though<00:05:10.390> these<00:05:10.930> controls<00:05:11.470> here<00:05:11.770> change

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
here though these controls here change

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.780 
here though these controls here change
the<00:05:12.820> font<00:05:13.600> on<00:05:14.080> this<00:05:14.380> particular<00:05:14.650> node<00:05:15.010> so<00:05:15.760> I

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
the font on this particular node so I

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.910 
the font on this particular node so I
could<00:05:16.120> go<00:05:16.480> to<00:05:16.540> this<00:05:16.720> here<00:05:17.290> change<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.830> two

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
could go to this here change it two

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.200 
could go to this here change it two
times<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.820> then<00:05:19.780> I<00:05:19.960> can<00:05:20.110> make<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:20.590> bold<00:05:21.210> italic

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
times and then I can make it bold italic

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:29.790 
times and then I can make it bold italic
change<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.260> size<00:05:24.480> change<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.630> color<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:29.320> now

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
change the size change the color and now

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.020 
change the size change the color and now
you<00:05:29.860> can<00:05:30.010> see<00:05:30.040> that<00:05:30.160> all<00:05:30.460> those<00:05:30.580> things<00:05:30.880> have

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
you can see that all those things have

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.540 
you can see that all those things have
afflicted<00:05:31.210> this<00:05:31.600> note<00:05:31.810> here<00:05:32.250> also<00:05:33.250> we<00:05:33.430> can

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
afflicted this note here also we can

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.550 
afflicted this note here also we can
help<00:05:33.850> hide<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.270> input<00:05:34.540> so<00:05:34.780> if<00:05:34.840> we<00:05:34.930> do<00:05:35.080> that<00:05:35.140> we

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
help hide the input so if we do that we

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.710 
help hide the input so if we do that we
no<00:05:35.710> longer<00:05:35.740> see<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.220> input<00:05:37.210> pipe<00:05:37.450> into<00:05:37.630> the

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
no longer see the input pipe into the

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.230 
no longer see the input pipe into the
node<00:05:38.020> if<00:05:38.410> I<00:05:38.620> click<00:05:38.830> on<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:39.250> node<00:05:39.490> though<00:05:39.730> we

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
node if I click on the node though we

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.440 
node if I click on the node though we
get<00:05:40.420> to<00:05:40.540> see<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.810> input<00:05:41.050> point<00:05:41.730> cached<00:05:42.730> so

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
get to see the input point cached so

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.730 
get to see the input point cached so
this<00:05:43.600> will<00:05:43.780> cache<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.230> node<00:05:44.410> for<00:05:44.650> this

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
this will cache the node for this

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.050 
this will cache the node for this
particular<00:05:44.860> frame<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:45.610> we<00:05:45.670> can<00:05:45.790> see<00:05:45.910> we<00:05:46.030> have

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
particular frame and we can see we have

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.240 
particular frame and we can see we have
this<00:05:46.300> yellow<00:05:46.660> bar<00:05:46.870> here<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.230> indicate<00:05:48.040> that

this yellow bar here to indicate that
postage<00:05:49.180> stamp<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:51.070> will<00:05:51.280> now

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.029 

give<00:05:54.240> a<00:05:54.270> postage<00:05:54.689> stamp<00:05:54.720> with<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.139> node<00:05:55.319> up

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
give a postage stamp with the node up

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.399 
give a postage stamp with the node up
until<00:05:56.340> that<00:05:56.759> point<00:05:56.819> in<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.180> script<00:05:57.479> and<00:05:57.720> then

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
until that point in the script and then

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.309 
until that point in the script and then
disable<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:59.280> will<00:05:59.699> disable<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.360> particular

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
disable I will disable the particular

disable I will disable the particular
node<00:06:01.530> so<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:02.240> information<00:06:03.240> will<00:06:03.330> pass

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
node so the information will pass

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.839 
node so the information will pass
through<00:06:03.870> we<00:06:04.349> could<00:06:04.500> also<00:06:04.620> set<00:06:04.979> an<00:06:05.189> animation

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
through we could also set an animation

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.999 
through we could also set an animation
on<00:06:06.090> here<00:06:06.300> so<00:06:06.479> we<00:06:06.629> could<00:06:06.750> right-click<00:06:07.050> and<00:06:07.530> say

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
on here so we could right-click and say

set key then we could go on another

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.100 
set key then we could go on another

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.200 
is disabled but when it's a single line
like<00:06:25.830> that<00:06:25.860> it<00:06:26.159> means<00:06:26.310> it's<00:06:26.550> been<00:06:26.759> disabled

either by an expression or with
animation<00:06:29.000> so<00:06:30.000> that's<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:30.990> property<00:06:31.349> bin<00:06:31.560> and

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800
