00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
this out and I cut this out with a pair

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.780 
this out and I cut this out with a pair
of<00:02:44.390> tin<00:02:45.390> snips<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.960> just<00:02:46.920> used<00:02:47.100> tin<00:02:47.280> snips<00:02:47.580> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
of tin snips I just used tin snips and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
of tin snips I just used tin snips and
cut<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.720> out<00:02:48.900> with<00:02:48.990> tin<00:02:49.200> snips<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.810> so

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
cut this all out with tin snips and so

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.210 
cut this all out with tin snips and so
minimal<00:02:52.680> tools<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.310> put<00:02:53.910> one<00:02:54.120> little<00:02:54.860> tip<00:02:55.860> right

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
minimal tools I put one little tip right

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.940 
minimal tools I put one little tip right
here<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:57.180> when<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.420> push<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.290> against<00:02:58.830> a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
here so when I push this up against a

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.800 
here so when I push this up against a
tree<00:02:59.340> that's<00:02:59.700> gonna<00:02:59.880> stick<00:03:00.270> in<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.540> tree

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
tree that's gonna stick in the tree

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.350 
tree that's gonna stick in the tree
that's<00:03:01.020> gonna<00:03:01.170> help<00:03:01.440> hold<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.520> up<00:03:02.910> against

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
that's gonna help hold that up against

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.630 
that's gonna help hold that up against
the<00:03:03.480> tree<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.050> put<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.100> one<00:03:05.160> little

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
the tree I put that just that one little

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.390 
the tree I put that just that one little
tip<00:03:05.850> right<00:03:06.090> there<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.540> then<00:03:07.290> my<00:03:07.860> tree<00:03:08.280> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
tip right there and then my tree of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.730 
tip right there and then my tree of
course<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.790> got<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.000> drill<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.270> couple<00:03:09.450> holes<00:03:09.740> and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
course I got to drill a couple holes and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.860 
course I got to drill a couple holes and
a<00:03:10.830> one<00:03:11.010> here<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.430> here<00:03:11.460> for<00:03:11.850> my<00:03:11.970> rope<00:03:12.600> or<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
a one here one here for my rope or a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.830 
a one here one here for my rope or a
bungee<00:03:13.170> cord<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.710> then<00:03:14.280> one<00:03:14.490> here<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:15.270> this

bungee cord and then one here but this

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.910 
bungee cord and then one here but this
stuff<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.440> tough<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.630> know<00:03:18.630> I'm<00:03:19.500> gonna<00:03:19.709> hold

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
so this is tough enough definitely for a

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.600 
so this is tough enough definitely for a
good<00:03:43.769> rugged<00:03:44.700> tree<00:03:45.450> table<00:03:45.830> and<00:03:46.830> that's<00:03:47.430> what<00:03:47.580> I

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
good rugged tree table and that's what I

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.880 
good rugged tree table and that's what I
used<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:48.870> draw<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.290> there<00:03:49.590> cut

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
used so you just draw it on there cut

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.180 
used so you just draw it on there cut
that<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.190> tin<00:03:50.340> snips<00:03:50.670> drill<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.690> couple<00:03:51.900> holes

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190

I'm gonna put 3/8 inch holes in here one

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.720 
I'm gonna put 3/8 inch holes in here one
in<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.060> center<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:58.370> there's<00:03:59.370> other<00:03:59.519> videos

out there that will show you how to rig

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.600 
out there that will show you how to rig
them<00:04:03.239> up<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.900> showed<00:04:04.590> how<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.250> did<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> video

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.400 
them up I showed how I just did a video
on<00:04:06.000> tree<00:04:06.390> tables<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.989> will<00:04:10.110> show<00:04:10.350> you

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
on tree tables and so that will show you

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.410 
on tree tables and so that will show you
also<00:04:10.680> how<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.070> break<00:04:11.310> them<00:04:11.459> up<00:04:11.580> but<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.120> here

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
also how to break them up but this here

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.599 
also how to break them up but this here
is<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.600> good<00:04:12.769> deal<00:04:13.769> why<00:04:14.870> project<00:04:16.489> do<00:04:17.489> it

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
is a good deal why project do it

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.740 
is a good deal why project do it
yourself<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:19.489> it's<00:04:20.489> very<00:04:20.669> handy<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.239> look

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
how easy that is to put in a pack there

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.850 
how easy that is to put in a pack there
it<00:04:25.560> is

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
it is

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.170
