00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
so wanting to record to figure this out

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.259 
so wanting to record to figure this out
and<00:03:33.100> if<00:03:34.100> I<00:03:34.250> showed<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.580> guys<00:03:34.670> exactly<00:03:35.000> how<00:03:35.239> I

and if I showed you guys exactly how I
do<00:03:35.420> my<00:03:35.540> stuff<00:03:35.989> then<00:03:36.400> we'll<00:03:37.400> see<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.700> like<00:03:37.790> an

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
do my stuff then we'll see you like an

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.250 
do my stuff then we'll see you like an
influx<00:03:38.269> of<00:03:38.450> people<00:03:38.570> doing<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.959> exact<00:03:39.230> same

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
influx of people doing the exact same

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.570 
influx of people doing the exact same
thing<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.860> that's<00:03:40.010> not<00:03:40.190> really<00:03:40.400> good<00:03:40.549> for

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
thing and that's not really good for

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.970 
thing and that's not really good for
community<00:03:41.209> because<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.110> do<00:03:42.170> know<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.440> there's

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
community because I do know that there's

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.590 
community because I do know that there's
not<00:03:43.100> really<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.370> much<00:03:43.549> people<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.150> record

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
not really that much people that record

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.310 
not really that much people that record
posle<00:03:44.870> dragons<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.380> side<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.720> for<00:03:47.930> all<00:03:47.989> using

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
posle dragons in a side so for all using

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.840 
posle dragons in a side so for all using
the<00:03:48.350> same<00:03:48.440> techniques<00:03:49.040> then<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.579> know<00:03:49.700> it

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
the same techniques then you know it

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.520 
the same techniques then you know it
just<00:03:49.970> kind<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.209> becomes<00:03:50.540> muddy<00:03:50.930> down<00:03:51.230> and

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
just kind of becomes muddy down and

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.960 
just kind of becomes muddy down and
everybody's<00:03:51.950> videos<00:03:52.220> will<00:03:52.370> look<00:03:52.459> exactly<00:03:52.700> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
everybody's videos will look exactly the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.300 
everybody's videos will look exactly the
same<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.360> that's<00:03:53.650> that's<00:03:54.650> probably<00:03:55.010> not<00:03:55.100> good

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
same and that's that's probably not good

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.250 
same and that's that's probably not good
for<00:03:55.340> any<00:03:55.549> any<00:03:56.060> community<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.660> know<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.780> mean<00:03:56.959> so

for any any community you know I mean so

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.199 
for any any community you know I mean so
I'll<00:03:57.860> probably<00:03:58.010> do<00:03:58.340> some<00:03:58.549> videos<00:03:58.820> kind<00:03:59.150> of

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
I'll probably do some videos kind of

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.280 
I'll probably do some videos kind of
like<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.540> but<00:03:59.690> I'll<00:03:59.780> show<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.019> different

after<00:05:32.550> this<00:05:32.669> event<00:05:32.910> is<00:05:33.240> over<00:05:33.389> probably<00:05:33.990> just

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
after this event is over probably just

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.500 
after this event is over probably just
because<00:05:34.410> there<00:05:34.590> won't<00:05:34.919> be<00:05:35.099> anything<00:05:35.510> because

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
because there won't be anything because

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.270 
because there won't be anything because
other<00:05:36.660> than<00:05:36.750> part<00:05:37.229> two<00:05:37.380> of<00:05:37.410> this<00:05:37.620> event<00:05:37.889> that's

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
other than part two of this event that's

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.950 
other than part two of this event that's
going<00:05:38.340> on<00:05:38.550> right<00:05:38.610> now<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:39.060> don't<00:05:39.570> think<00:05:39.720> there's

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
going on right now I don't think there's

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.230 
going on right now I don't think there's
gonna<00:05:40.020> be<00:05:40.110> much<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:41.310> between<00:05:41.460> these<00:05:41.789> two<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:42.150> if

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
gonna be much in between these two so if

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.879 
gonna be much in between these two so if
there<00:05:42.360> isn't<00:05:42.750> I'll<00:05:43.139> be<00:05:43.320> definitely<00:05:43.650> doing
