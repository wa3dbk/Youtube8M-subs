00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
exciting for me I think I could take a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.690 
exciting for me I think I could take a
bunch<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.090> clips<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.799> hit<00:01:14.490> my

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
bunch of clips and not have to hit my

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
bunch of clips and not have to hit my
Elgato<00:01:15.180> over<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> over<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.350> over<00:01:16.470> again<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
Elgato over and over and over again and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.580 
Elgato over and over and over again and
you<00:01:17.580> know<00:01:17.729> edit<00:01:18.119> my<00:01:18.270> stuff<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.380> stuff

you know edit my stuff and and do stuff
like<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.580> think<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.299> cool<00:01:21.659> I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
like that so I think it's really cool I

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.230 
like that so I think it's really cool I
think<00:01:21.900> it'll<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.290> cool<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.979> helpful<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
think it'll be cool and helpful but I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.929 
think it'll be cool and helpful but I
know<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.659> doesn't<00:01:24.869> record<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.380> 1080p<00:01:25.860> which<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
know it doesn't record in 1080p which is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.810 
know it doesn't record in 1080p which is
kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> disappointing<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:28.560> 720p<00:01:29.310> 30

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
kind of disappointing it's 720p 30

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850 
kind of disappointing it's 720p 30
frames<00:01:30.150> per<00:01:30.270> second<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.170> we're<00:01:31.350> gonna<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
frames per second so we're gonna have to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.649 
frames per second so we're gonna have to
see<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.220> video<00:01:32.549> quality<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.329> looks

it's<00:01:52.649> gonna<00:01:52.799> affect<00:01:52.890> youtube<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:54.000> that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it's gonna affect youtube I think that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300 
it's gonna affect youtube I think that
unless<00:01:54.930> people<00:01:55.290> are<00:01:55.320> uploading<00:01:55.619> quality

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
unless people are uploading quality

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.760 
unless people are uploading quality
videos<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.659> they're<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.649> get

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
