00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.650
 like to be presented as examiner this 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.480

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.780
 already well over 100 years old and has 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.100
 whether at 50 degrees or 50 degrees 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.080
 proven throughout the world 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.480
 Riflescope in these weapons are very 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.430
 often even a hag montanus school 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.290
 hack assembly provided at the school 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.839
 I just need this unit assembly 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.839
 Pull back the lever and the riflescope 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.970
 simply hanging upside down you hook 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.769
 in front 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.909
 with a little pressure is the weapon 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.890
 again full of cyprus only arrested 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:06.290
 at the school a hack montage one must 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.479
 just this little pinch this dear 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.110
 pull back and just that 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.150
 riflescope from back to front 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.040
 Lever 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.799
 conversely we are stuck by the two for 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.320
 Lock the mounting socket into the socket 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.740
 with a firm hit this is 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.140
 riflescope reassembled to load 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.740
 this weapon is the chamber stalk 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.079
 closed 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.780
 You can pull it back quickly 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.740
 you take the cartridges and put it 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.840
 just with the thumb of the right or 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.990
 here with the thumb of the left hand in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.030
 the zigzag magazine in the caliber 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.090
 30.06 like this weapon here 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.789
 we can present five cartridges 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.920
 to introduce the magazine is to 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.469
 Pay attention that the cartridges are correct 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.450
 are pressed and no bullet far out 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.450
 looking out of the magazine 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.229
 We load the weapon in which you 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.249
 chambers stems directly forward and 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.229
 fire 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.720
 now the weapon is loaded and 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.460
 unlocked we secure the weapon in the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.160
 We follow this wing security 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.510
 austrian far right outside we 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.310
 now recognize that the choice for 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.060
 secured by us stems the chambers 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.580
 can not open the weapon anymore 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.280
 Unsecure we just put this 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.310
 wing on your left side 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.870
 you see the chamber is stuck again 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.790
 open bar and we could close 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.860
 We secure the weapon by using this 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.110
 Turn the wing to the right 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.150
 one recognizes clearly the chamber 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.520
 Stem is now open 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.280
 that means the weapon is in one 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.100
 absolutely secure condition i want the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.660
 Weapon must withdraw this wing after 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.360
 be turned left 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.810
 now the weapon is unlocked smaller 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.490
 test one can go stingl again 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.950
 when the weapon is loaded and me 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.040
 you want to unload it at the 98th 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.710
 a possibility that the water 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.690
 safe and secure condition and 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.750
 can be land by simply 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.400
 this wing in this the vertical 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.200
 go straight up 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.290
 I can the chambers is angel now 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.980
 safely open the water remains 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.830
 secured 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.310
 and i can get the ammo out 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.310
 Leave a Comment 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.110
 at 98 systems from the military still 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.580
 were not changed remains the 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.380
 kameraschwenk in the rear position 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.420
 If the weapon is empty you are shot 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.150
 must only in this thumb bend the 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.250
 magazine live something down the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.540
 bring closure to the front and already 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.720
 I can do it again as soon as I am 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.760
 pull back locked that leaves everyone 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:02.990
 Fix yourself by loving them 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.090
 a little bit abschleift 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.390
 I take out the lock at 98 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.640
 I want to proceed as follows 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.430
 In this wing , I put my thumb 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.280
 slightly backwards more often the chambers stems 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.989
 hold the wing and you the lock 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.190
 out easily reverse it assumes, 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.790
 easily pushed the magazine in again 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.440
 and the lock is back 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.440
 connected to the weapon 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.550
 This weapon has a German 

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:47.309
 You can see cities near the German city of Steinen 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.499
 always one has two deductions and the 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:52.679
 The last trigger is for the weapon 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:54.899
 To estimate the weapon is loaded and 

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:56.520
 I want to shoot over Stecher pull 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:58.679
 I the rear trigger 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.479
 You hear a soft click you see 

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:03.360
 also that the front trigger engaged 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.899
 is and now the weapon is stabbed 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.849
 I have the weapon unlocked jumps 

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:10.289
 now the piece wild and I want 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.499
 a sting is a very 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.919
 dangerous condition at 98 system 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:21.089
 I only need this wing vertically 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.259
 to put and easy in their attitude 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:25.559
 pull the trigger 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.389
 I can also do that quietly by myself 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:30.959
 with the middle finger pulled the plug 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.059
 leave and with the index finger both 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:35.969
 deductions then go on land at the same time 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:39.240
 once middle finger and index finger 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.550
 solve the cities at the same time 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.830
 weapon again met and secured 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.499
 but you can also if the weapon 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.879
 Sting is perpendicular to hold high 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:52.919
 opening and pulling off the stem 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:54.839
 There are several options you can see 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.669
 but how complicated a German 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:58.819
 Stark is and I hold him in the 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.089
 modern weapons absolutely superfluous 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:05.939
 or 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:08.639
 even dangerous the 890 system is one 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:09.959
 over 100 years proven system 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.819
 about securing the word 

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:14.629
 I really deserve your assurance 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.409
 no assurance that absolutely better 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.300
 works like this system 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.300
 latches securing the latches 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.879
 is kept absolutely the industry holds 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.689
 many innovations for the system 98 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:31.399
 ready to get out of this 98 system 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.399
 to make modern hunting weapon
