00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.700
 c's 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.870
 photography and video courses face-to-face and distance Bolivia 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.870
 difficult point with a point 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.490
 when we see in the picture 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.739
 with contrast the correct color and optics 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.509
 sometimes it's hard for us to realize that it comes from an original camera 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.829
 pretty unattractive 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:31.789
 observe 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.929
 what is the original aspect of this image 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.170
 when he comes out of the camera and see what with a little 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.899
 production 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.899
 we can give it a much more attractive look 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.030
 as we have taken this photo in robbery format we are going to do 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 the corresponding corrections in the first place 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.850
 regulates cute exposure 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.610
 we realize what contrast is very low therefore we are going to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.670
 increase it almost to the maximum 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.030
 there we have the exhibition 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.450
 correct 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.910
 let's increase the clarity setting a bit to better distinguish 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.790
 some details a bit of intensity and obviously 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.889
 the color balance is not all right that we would like 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.760
 Thus 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.510
 we are going to be a sum 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.240
 and we're going to take the automatic white balance tool 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.950
 and we're going to do a white balance on ark statue that we assume is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.440
 I like it relatively 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.460
 Once this is done let's see if loading is not 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.220
 the original camera profile with work 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.440
 with the standard profile we will load the police camera profile 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.470
 and let's touch now yes manually 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 the color temperature setting 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.180
 there is more or less we have 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.370
 let's increase 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.860
 the black tones 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 to have better men 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.169
 we go to the corrections part of the entity 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.729
 and see how the corrections for the type of lens and camera are loaded 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.899
 we want employee for this photograph 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.259
 we go to the part of former rectors 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.649
 and we are going to 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:24.249
 add bullets to have a more photo-like appearance 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.779
 there is 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.629
 later we have veined we do not know why they put veined him because after 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.069
 summer 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.179
 good mysteries of translation 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.109
 we add a bit of grain simulation 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.519
 we go back to review our image maybe 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.449
 now a little more intensity 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.959
 cam to come well 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.819
 we enter the tone area 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.809
 we modify the yellow tones a little 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.869
 to avoid greenish reflections in the sand that are always 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.269
 aerial means 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.959
 we make some local corrections 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.299
 with the adjustment brush 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.699
 and we are ready to open our photo in photoshop 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.120
 what we first do that duplicate 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.399
 the background layer 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:25.349
 i place this layer 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.660
 in the option 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.389
 Lineal light 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.290
 see what the contrast increases a lot in the very different way by 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.389
 supposed to how it increases and contrast with the curves 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.550
 i will go down 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.119
 the opacity 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.539
 more or less 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.139
 19 percent 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.680
 it seems that nothing had happened but 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.720
 if we turn off here we will observe the change in the contrast and in the strength of 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.309
 the picture 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.629
 let's make another one located 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.629
 wolves to place up here 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.999
 i will give you 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.619
 the users mode 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:05.659
 applying 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.679
 the filter 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.379
 high pass 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.819
 we are going to give you a number 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.819
 just well up 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.849
 They say that if we use 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.590
 in a number under the high pass filter comments the definition 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.210
 but we do use it at a high level the high pass filter works in a way 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.210
 different and increases the local contrast 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 wolves to send super high 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.059
 of course we are going to lower the transparency 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.689
 at a very low point maybe 9 percent is right 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.259
 we turn off both 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:51.219
 the effect that occurs 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.379
 finally to adjust our image 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.699
 to a correct copy we will create a layer of levels 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.909
 and we are going to exhaust 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.639
 the faults and low lights pressing the high key in this case 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.820
 to make sure we're using a full tonal bouquet 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.979
 this is not to agree the contrast 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:16.229
 simply inycom object adjust the values â€‹â€‹of the highest light and light 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.620
 lower look this is 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.009
 unadjusted 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.309
 i adjusting 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:26.289
 finally here we have the two images on the left the photograph 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.620
 just as it came out of the camera 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.090
 simply by making a correct measurement of the light and a balance of 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.650
 White 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.710
 for sunlight 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.180
 and the photography was right after having received post-production 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.870
 adequate
