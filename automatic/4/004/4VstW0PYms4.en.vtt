grandfather<00:01:18.180> whom<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.689> loved<00:01:18.840> dearly<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
grandfather whom we loved dearly so I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
grandfather whom we loved dearly so I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
think it's quite easy to love and adore

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.600 
think it's quite easy to love and adore
them<00:01:22.530> because<00:01:22.799> you're<00:01:22.950> reading<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.400> through

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
them because you're reading them through

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.850 
them because you're reading them through
the<00:01:23.759> eyes<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.570> somebody<00:01:24.840> who<00:01:25.200> loved<00:01:25.409> endured

the eyes of somebody who loved endured

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
the eyes of somebody who loved endured
them<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.400> massive<00:01:29.400> part<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.759> this

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880

story<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.540> they're<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> crux<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
story but they're not the crux of it
