 I'll tell you later 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.990
 our company experts do not recommend 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 include in the image of the system in the archives 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.869
 data 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.880

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.050
 space drives 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.030
 system image can be made in any 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.710
 another way in which way I 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.720

 check out something else click on the link and 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.170
 change schedule 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.759

 Connect the hard drive is not worth it 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.369
 panic fresh menu will wait 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:50.109

 create an archive at least once a month 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.040
