00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 I'm with conjunctivitis, my eye is 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.100
 looking like a vagina with simple is by 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.810
 I 'm wearing dark glasses because 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.670
 I have syphilis in my eye in the week 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.380
 I was with my boyfriend and I last. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.000
 I decided to play with my finger in my eye. 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.400
 him while he was driving to 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 'My God wants each serve crisis 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.720
 basically I'm an idiot myself and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.550
 They do not think I'm proud of that I know. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 that's the kind of thing did not play 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 I'm good, I already know that I'm wrong, not 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.490
 It was nothing serious where you have my god. 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.220
 was a very great speed not 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.660
 tava was finally stopped at traffic lights and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.030
 I was gently stick your finger in 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.770
 his eye on line 1a and say they want 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.989
 the other side because it bumped into a cart 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.899
 beside him and scraped a little not 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.840
 It was nothing serious, I started laughing. 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.820
 when they are in a car in the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 little friend on the side I do not know why I did 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.600
 This too, I do not know, I do. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.190
 because I was funny then 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.300
 This I've heard of disgrace 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.789
 because there is that theory 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 someone is not you 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.059
 What do you think is said and this thing? 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 You laugh at the misfortune of others. 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.289
 basically very well translated by 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.180
 that chili phrase with 200 is 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.129
 refresh people are stronger than I am 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.990
 times and laughs and a misfortune that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.229
 it's not your fault sometimes happens 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.780
 Escape I know there's someone there 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.560
 doing this now making fun of my 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.299
 problem is passing a ball and then 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.259
 You 're laughing at my face in the dispute. 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.820
 very happy, right? 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.799
 another classic example of laughing 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 disgrace is when you finish a 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.390
 dating spending time your ex boyfriend or 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.020
 girlfriend gets fat when that's yours 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.520
 Baranga, you're happy for the achievement. 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 because 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.850
 I hope you are too. 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 because if unconvincing only with zone 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.689
 of history but has all the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.009
 scientist who also explains that laughing 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.930
 the enemy is released 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.250
 lie is involved dead of 70 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.290
 Do not laugh 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.880
 It was never my god, you should not be 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.009
 used when there is that girl you 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.720
 Heck, you log into her facebook 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.979
 because anyway because you are not a fool 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.810
 has nothing to do in life but who? 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.520
 Never logged in, facebook has a connection. 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.760
 You will see the photos tagged and have 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.860

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.450

 Glory are you going there only the photo in the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.440
 computer shows your friends are 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.130
 laughing at that only when there is 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.320
 with you 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.390
 Then you took in your time there you 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.250
 begins to cry if he despairs to think 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.290
 because I stopped but surely an enemy 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.940
 letting a great laugh out of his face and 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.010

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.900
 from the point of view of each one then forces 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.870
