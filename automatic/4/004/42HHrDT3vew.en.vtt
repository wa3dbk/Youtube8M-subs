00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.940 

put<00:02:01.330> forward<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:01.900> back<00:02:02.080> pretty<00:02:02.440> quick<00:02:02.770> in

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
put forward and back pretty quick in

put forward and back pretty quick in
that<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:04.210> I'll<00:02:04.420> just<00:02:04.540> kind<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.780> space<00:02:05.020> itself

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
that and I'll just kind of space itself

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.850 
that and I'll just kind of space itself
apart<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.010> right<00:02:06.190> distance<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.970> that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
apart to the right distance and that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
apart to the right distance and that
seems<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.979> work<00:02:09.220> pretty<00:02:09.729> good<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:10.090> me<00:02:10.270> but

set that's one way I showed you another

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.960 
set that's one way I showed you another
way<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.830> situation<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.700> paper

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
way but in a situation that the paper

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.660 
way but in a situation that the paper
trick<00:02:46.650> won't<00:02:47.650> work<00:02:47.769> with<00:02:48.070> setting<00:02:48.340> your<00:02:48.430> gear

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
trick won't work with setting your gear

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.949 
trick won't work with setting your gear
mesh<00:02:48.850> is<00:02:50.820> if<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.910> have<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.030> low<00:02:52.269> c<00:02:52.510> micro<00:02:53.670> and

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
mesh is if you have a low c micro and

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.110 
mesh is if you have a low c micro and
one<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.110> reasons<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.519> because

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.900 

the<00:03:01.120> spur<00:03:01.390> gear<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:03.220> really<00:03:03.370> small<00:03:03.730> has

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
the spur gear it's really small has

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.500 
the spur gear it's really small has
really<00:03:04.120> fine<00:03:04.510> teeth<00:03:04.900> on<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:06.090> if<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.269> put

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
really fine teeth on it and if you put

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.110 
really fine teeth on it and if you put
the<00:03:07.570> piece<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.750> paper<00:03:07.840> on<00:03:08.320> there<00:03:08.830> in<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.910> paper

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the piece of paper on there in the paper

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.490 
the piece of paper on there in the paper
is<00:03:10.390> almost<00:03:10.690> as<00:03:10.959> thick<00:03:11.580> as<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:13.390> gears<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:14.019> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
is almost as thick as the gears on the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.009 
is almost as thick as the gears on the
spur<00:03:14.800> gear<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:16.420> that's<00:03:16.540> not<00:03:16.660> really<00:03:16.840> going<00:03:16.959> to

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
spur gear so that's not really going to

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.949 
spur gear so that's not really going to
work<00:03:17.170> we're<00:03:17.620> going<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.860> push<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.810> real<00:03:19.810> well

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
work we're going to push in real well

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.770 
work we're going to push in real well
and<00:03:20.260> set<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.800> right<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:22.180> with<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.540> you're

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
and set it right so with that you're

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.160 
and set it right so with that you're
just<00:03:22.930> going<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.200> kind<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.440> have<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:24.299> leave<00:03:25.299> your

it<00:03:28.030> back<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.360> forth<00:03:28.420> it'll<00:03:28.959> kind<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.170> space

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
it back and forth it'll kind of space

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.800 
it back and forth it'll kind of space
itself<00:03:29.530> out<00:03:29.980> or<00:03:30.730> you're<00:03:31.269> just<00:03:31.330> going<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.630> kind

different<00:03:35.950> links<00:03:36.600> because<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.630> mean<00:03:37.780> if<00:03:37.930> it's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
different links because I mean if it's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.930 
different links because I mean if it's
set<00:03:38.769> right

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
set right

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.350

it<00:03:40.750> will<00:03:40.900> roll<00:03:41.140> back<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.740> forth<00:03:42.010> easy<00:03:42.490> but<00:03:43.270> if

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
it will roll back and forth easy but if

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.190 
it will roll back and forth easy but if
it's<00:03:43.510> set<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.870> tight<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:46.360> will<00:03:46.630> be<00:03:46.810> really<00:03:47.050> hard

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
it's set to tight it will be really hard

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.960 
it's set to tight it will be really hard
