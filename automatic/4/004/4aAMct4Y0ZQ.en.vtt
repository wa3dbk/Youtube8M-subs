a<00:05:12.020> teabag<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.910> you<00:05:14.910> take<00:05:15.270> this<00:05:17.539> superglue<00:05:18.539> and

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.920 

you<00:05:22.620> cut<00:05:22.860> them<00:05:23.010> into<00:05:23.220> pieces<00:05:23.570> so<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:24.599> would

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
you cut them into pieces so you would

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.060 
you cut them into pieces so you would
cut<00:05:25.199> like<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.470> small<00:05:25.919> piece<00:05:26.220> like<00:05:26.610> this<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:28.070> you

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
cut like a small piece like this and you

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.520 
cut like a small piece like this and you
would<00:05:29.250> put<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:29.729> little<00:05:30.150> I'm<00:05:30.570> demonstrating<00:05:30.960> one
