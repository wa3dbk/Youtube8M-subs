as far as gaming headsets go I mean

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.070 
as far as gaming headsets go I mean
that's<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.680> first<00:01:22.070> thing<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.540> want<00:01:23.570> to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080

get if you want to improve your your
gameplay<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:27.710> probably<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.400> biggest<00:01:28.670> thing

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
gameplay it's probably the biggest thing

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.870 
gameplay it's probably the biggest thing
that<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.510> can<00:01:29.720> purchase<00:01:29.980> that<00:01:30.980> is<00:01:31.250> definitely

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
that you can purchase that is definitely

going<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.210> make<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:32.360> marked<00:01:32.840> difference<00:01:33.140> in<00:01:33.830> in

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
going to make a marked difference in in

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.280 
going to make a marked difference in in
how<00:01:34.400> well<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.760> do<00:01:34.940> in<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.480> average<00:01:35.810> game<00:01:36.080> I

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
how well you do in the average game I

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.680 
how well you do in the average game I
mean<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:37.400> have<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.580> way<00:01:37.880> better<00:01:38.090> sense<00:01:38.540> of

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
mean you have a way better sense of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.920 
mean you have a way better sense of
where<00:01:38.870> people<00:01:39.290> are<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.090> you're<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.270> you're

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
where people are and you're just you're

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.160 
where people are and you're just you're
going<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.140> find<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:42.950> get<00:01:43.130> kills<00:01:43.490> that

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
going to find that you get kills that

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.780 
going to find that you get kills that
maybe<00:01:45.170> normally<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:45.740> wouldn't<00:01:46.040> or<00:01:46.370> at<00:01:46.670> very

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
maybe normally you wouldn't or at very

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.790 
maybe normally you wouldn't or at very
least<00:01:46.940> you're<00:01:47.900> going<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.080> get<00:01:48.200> kills<00:01:48.470> and

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
least you're going to get kills and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.650 
least you're going to get kills and
they're<00:01:48.920> gonna<00:01:48.980> be<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.490> lot<00:01:49.730> easier<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.330> get

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
they're gonna be a lot easier to get

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.480 
they're gonna be a lot easier to get
than<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:51.080> normally<00:01:51.140> would<00:01:51.530> be<00:01:51.860> just<00:01:52.250> because

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
than I normally would be just because

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.310 
than I normally would be just because
you<00:01:52.610> can<00:01:52.760> hear<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.060> footsteps<00:01:53.240> hear<00:01:53.780> gunshots

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
you can hear the footsteps hear gunshots

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.460 
you can hear the footsteps hear gunshots
all<00:01:55.040> sorts<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.670> things<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.270> they're<00:01:57.230> really

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470

are pretty standard pretty
straightforward<00:02:01.070> now<00:02:01.300> what<00:02:02.300> makes<00:02:02.510> a<00:02:02.660> good

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
because they are wireless and they

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.040 
because they are wireless and they
operate<00:05:59.440> on<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.909> 2.4<00:06:00.909> gigahertz<00:06:01.050> frequency

operate on the 2.4 gigahertz frequency

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.309 
operate on the 2.4 gigahertz frequency
they<00:06:03.009> do<00:06:03.069> get<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.610> lot<00:06:03.909> of<00:06:03.969> interference<00:06:04.360> from

around it you can change the channel of
your<00:06:21.009> router<00:06:21.279> and<00:06:21.699> you<00:06:22.599> know<00:06:22.690> force<00:06:22.990> it<00:06:23.199> away

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469

from the channel that the X 40 ones use

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.309 
from the channel that the X 40 ones use
