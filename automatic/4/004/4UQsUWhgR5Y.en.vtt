 one-way traffic ends 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.250
 the full triangle sign begins and 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.929
 the oncoming traffic is therefore necessary 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.210
 turn about the far lane 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.719
 Well that's how the car turned on 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.090
 pay attention to know what is coming 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.960

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.190

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 zero and go 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.780
 about these railway crossing 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.780
 stop before meeting 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.670

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.630
 let's see how it sparkles further 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.720

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 so what are the signs on this side when 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.280
 We have done 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:09.039
 a turn in three steps and a traffic light and 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:13.769
 movement only left only hired 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.769
 accordingly here you rise 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.600
 whether we have a clue is worth 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.780
 stop and yo rub and 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.780

 quietly the rails did not stop further 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:11.079
 getting ready and lifting stop 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:15.079
 we clamp the handbrake we include the first transfer 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:21.709
 under the gas when the nose rises forward 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:25.000
 smoothly release the handbrake invisibly what 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.000
 item failed 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.990
 there is written down why it is necessary on the hill 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.740
 yet we finished in the garage 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.740
 like this 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.840
 finally got under way but i think that on 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.840
