00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240 
do that if you move like 10 feet out and
then<00:01:24.900> walk<00:01:25.140> back<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> same<00:01:25.950> direction

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
then walk back up the same direction

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
then walk back up the same direction
that<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> stairs<00:01:27.000> were<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.840> should<00:01:28.110> be

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that the stairs were you should be

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.800 
that the stairs were you should be
walking<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.740> an<00:01:28.860> invisible<00:01:29.070> staircase<00:01:29.810> now

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
walking up an invisible staircase now

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.179 
walking up an invisible staircase now
what<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.170> does<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.590> you're<00:01:31.799> making<00:01:32.070> your

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
what this does is you're making your

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.230 
what this does is you're making your
character<00:01:32.520> think<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> staircase

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
character think there's a staircase

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
character think there's a staircase
there<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.869> there's<00:01:34.020> actually<00:01:34.380> nothing<00:01:34.500> but

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
there when there's actually nothing but

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530 
there when there's actually nothing but
air<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.490> continuously<00:01:35.939> walk<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
air so you can continuously walk up the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.690 
air so you can continuously walk up the
staircase<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> way<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> infinity<00:01:37.860> or

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
staircase all the way to infinity or

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
staircase all the way to infinity or
until<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.060> hit<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> sky<00:01:39.540> barrier<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.650> weird

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
until you hit the sky barrier the weird

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.319 
until you hit the sky barrier the weird
part<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.280> though<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.520> you're<00:01:41.759> walking<00:01:42.000> in

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
part is though when you're walking in

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.910 
part is though when you're walking in
that<00:01:42.450> single<00:01:42.810> direction<00:01:43.409> you'll<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.710> walking

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that single direction you'll be walking

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100 
that single direction you'll be walking
up<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> staircase<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> decide<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
up the staircase but if you decide to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.389 
up the staircase but if you decide to
walk<00:01:46.259> left<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:46.920> you'll<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.250> be

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
walk left or right you'll just be

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.550 
walk left or right you'll just be
walking<00:01:47.640> level<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.049> walk<00:01:49.259> back

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
walking level and then if you walk back

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
walking level and then if you walk back
down<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.220> actually<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.610> down<00:01:50.850> an

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
down you can actually go down an

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.240 
down you can actually go down an
invisible<00:01:51.600> staircase<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> guys<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.070> use

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
invisible staircase so you guys can use

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.710 
invisible staircase so you guys can use
this<00:01:53.369> glitch<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.759> discontinuously<00:01:54.420> walk

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
this glitch to discontinuously walk

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.230 
this glitch to discontinuously walk
upwards<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.439> into<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> clouds<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.939> found

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
upwards up into the clouds what I found

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.880 
upwards up into the clouds what I found
funny<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> around<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> airport

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
funny was to do this around the airport

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.620 
funny was to do this around the airport
because<00:01:59.340> people<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.880> flying<00:02:00.090> airplanes

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
because people will be flying airplanes

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.850 
because people will be flying airplanes
and<00:02:00.899> stuff<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.170> they're<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.590> seeing

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and stuff and they're going to be seeing

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.929 
and stuff and they're going to be seeing
you<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> clouds<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.850> they're

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
you up in the clouds and they're

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:03.920 
you up in the clouds and they're
probably<00:02:03.030> gonna<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.600> heart<00:02:03.810> attack

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
probably gonna have like a heart attack

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.820 
probably gonna have like a heart attack
