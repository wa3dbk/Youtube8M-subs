00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:08.717
ViruSSofT company presents

00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:13.117
Sonic the HEDHUG

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:16.950
Sonic the HEDHUG: 2012, part 3

00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:24.183
13:47, Tails`s hut

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.240
I got this parts for you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.300
but tell me what do you need it for?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.420
I will show you something...

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.580
Here it is! My creation!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.180
Um... What`s this?

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.860
This is the Time Machine.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.940
Using this I`m going to go back in time

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.100
and uncover all mysteries of this story.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.080
Hey... Where did you get the blueprints for this?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.360
I made it myself, of course.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.760
Enough of your lie! I can see right through you.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.180
I give my word!

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.200
Lying, bitch,
I give my word!

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.800
Lying, bitch,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.040
lying like breathing!

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800
Okay, you got me.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.340
I found the blueprints today outdoors.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.720
Maybe I tried to create something like this before, and forgot.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.100
Well, that`s more like the truth

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.100
but if you already made it,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.900
what the hell I brought this details for?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.480
Details will be the filling,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.840
this is only the body.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.580
By the way, I found it in my dump.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.560
Lucky, isn`t it?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800
Too lucky to be the truth.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200
Okay then, let`s work!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.680
You will help me.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.500
Okay.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.680
Give me a box with bolts.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520
How about a magic word?

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.000
*******, give me that stupid box!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Okay, okay, calm down.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.340
Now a wrench with the size of 30.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.340
Whut?

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.560
Damn, give the biggest one!

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.560
Okay, speak it firstly,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.920
two-tailed ram.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.720
I heard that!

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140
Yeah! I found it! Catch!

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.940
YOU IDIOT!!!

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.640
Give me beer!

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.460
Wait. What do you need beer for?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.620
It is for keeping my working state.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.360
Who could this be?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.580
Hey, guys, open up,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.820
it`s me, Knuckles, I have a message!

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.940
Stay here, I go open it.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.360
Well, well, well... If Knuckles is out of his hole

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.020
that means something really serious.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.000
Yes, this is unbelievable!

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.180
Eggman`s flying battery... Flies again!

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.420
What???

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.700
Since we broke his flying battery

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.700
it never flied again!

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700
This fat bastard...

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.660
He cheated us with the Doomsday. Stole the Master Emerald.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.660
and he also repaired his Flying Battery.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.320
I`m sure he is up to something.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.140
Let`s go to my office, we`ll speak about it.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.560
So. Eggman tricked us again.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.560
Looks like this.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.500
I don`t know what he has on his mind, but we must stop him!

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.540
Let`s do this way.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.780
I will finish my Time Machine and go back in time,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.180
you two are heading to Eggman and try to stop him.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.720
I have a question.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.460
What the f**k a Time Machine?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.700
It`s too long to explain. You will be confused.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.960
Who could this be?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.260
Hey, Tails, open up! I brought you book!

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.820
Blya! This is Amy!

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.200
Hide, guys, I`ll delay her.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.140
I...

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.200
Here, I want to return you book about... a...

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.380
An Ancient Civilizations!

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.380
Ye, ye, I know,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.960
just leave it in the library - at the end of the hall.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.960
Don`t touch anything!

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.860
Okay.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.540
Hey, Sonic, are you there?

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.260
Yea. How did you find me?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.400
With your boots` smell,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.060
I have to clean this chair now.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.560
Let me get out of here, while she....

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.200
What`s happening?

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.480
Wait here, I`ll go check this out.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.680
Tails, saw a room,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.400
there was a big thing in it,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.620
I touched it and it screamed...

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.760
You idiot! I said you to touch nothing!

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.240
Give me this damn book, I`ll bring it myself.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.420
Amy, I asked you politely to leave, aren`t I?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.900
No, I want to have some rest,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.900
I ran so much today.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.400
Well, I can have a rest at home. Bye!

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.440
Come on, get him out!

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.900
Now what? Must I take him out again?

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.400
He will not move while he is off.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.020
Give his some chili dog to sniff - he will get up easily.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.140
And go to Eggman, I have work to do!

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.300
Roger that, commando!

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.820
Hum... Knuckles got some brain?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.100
I`m scared.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.480
Well, let`s finish this as soon as possible.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.680
Give me a drill.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.920
Hey, is anybody going to give this damn drill?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.020
Sonic, are you slee...

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.500
Damn you!

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.580
15:23, Seaside of Chemical plant

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.580
So, where is this Flying Battery?

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.840
Are you sure you saw it?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.040
I saw it with my eyes!

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.660
How long will I wait?

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.320
Look back, piece of idiot.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.380
Wow! I see that.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.800
But how will we get on it?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.680
I don`t know. Only I can glide.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.080
Noo, I will not do that!

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.160
Nobody asks you.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.200
Sonic!!!

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.760
Come on, horsey, vpered!

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.800
I will kill you, spiky bastard!

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.120
Don`t press on my neck.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.040
Look! They sent some interceptors for us!

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.040
This will be funny.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.540
That was cool!

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.840
I wonder why Eggman creates such ugly robots?

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.460
Yeah, especially that ones who look like you.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.820
You better shut up and watch the road.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.700
SHIT!

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.000
Damn, that was close.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.880
Look, another enemy`s ace!

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.220
He-heh, I made him, Knuckles!

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.340
Knuckles?

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.280
Oh HOLYCRAP!

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.760
I`m the first!
