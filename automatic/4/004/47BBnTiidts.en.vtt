portrait lighting effect several in fact
and<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:34.020> actual<00:01:34.740> app<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.369> under<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and the actual app is a little under a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.569 
and the actual app is a little under a
hundred<00:01:36.000> megabytes<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:37.290> fairly<00:01:37.920> average

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
hundred megabytes that's fairly average

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
hundred megabytes that's fairly average
by<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.880> way<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> could<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.630> more

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
by the way and you could see more

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.560 
by the way and you could see more
supported<00:01:40.409> models<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.210> what's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
supported models there and that's what's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.210 
supported models there and that's what's

something like motion shot is clearly

in one breathtaking photo created from a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.990 
in one breathtaking photo created from a
sequence<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.810> shots<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.590> they're<00:02:21.400> combining

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
sequence of shots so they're combining

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.970 
sequence of shots so they're combining
shots<00:02:22.270> in<00:02:22.450> order<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.750> create<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.320> cool<00:02:23.710> effect

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
shots in order to create a cool effect

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.310 
shots in order to create a cool effect
and<00:02:24.550> that's<00:02:24.970> exactly<00:02:25.570> what<00:02:25.720> you'll<00:02:25.870> see<00:02:26.110> right

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
and that's exactly what you'll see right

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.910 
and that's exactly what you'll see right
here<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:28.270> think<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.320> something<00:02:29.680> that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
here and I think this is something that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.550 
here and I think this is something that
a<00:02:29.950> lot<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.280> people<00:02:30.670> have<00:02:31.540> been<00:02:31.660> doing<00:02:31.990> in<00:02:32.260> post

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
a lot of people have been doing in post

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.010 
a lot of people have been doing in post
and<00:02:33.010> now<00:02:33.700> they<00:02:33.880> don't<00:02:34.030> have<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.870> that's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
and now they don't have to and that's

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.740 
and now they don't have to and that's
why<00:02:35.380> Sony<00:02:35.710> creates<00:02:36.220> these<00:02:36.750> applications

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
why Sony creates these applications

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.070 
why Sony creates these applications
clearly<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.710> one<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.100> more<00:02:39.390> creative<00:02:40.390> than

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
clearly this one is more creative than

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.980 
clearly this one is more creative than
the<00:02:41.410> others<00:02:41.830> at<00:02:42.670> least<00:02:42.970> at<00:02:43.150> its<00:02:43.300> core<00:02:43.570> nature

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
the others at least at its core nature

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.680 
the others at least at its core nature
but<00:02:44.530> still<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.980> very<00:02:45.280> useful<00:02:45.970> app<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.450> my

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
but still a very useful app in my

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.100 
but still a very useful app in my
opinion<00:02:47.260> last<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.460> not<00:02:48.580> least<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.240> fact<00:02:49.870> as<00:02:50.020> I

demoed in the past you can see I just
triggered<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:39.990> EVF<00:04:40.990> sensor<00:04:41.560> there<00:04:41.830> another

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
triggered the EVF sensor there another

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.300 
triggered the EVF sensor there another
nice<00:04:42.400> enhancement<00:04:42.910> on<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.840> HX<00:04:44.170> 400<00:04:44.620> V<00:04:44.770> but

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
nice enhancement on the HX 400 V but

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.400 
nice enhancement on the HX 400 V but
that<00:04:45.550> pretty<00:04:45.700> much<00:04:45.910> rounds<00:04:46.180> out<00:04:46.450> my<00:04:46.900> update

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
that pretty much rounds out my update

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.230 
that pretty much rounds out my update
about<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.680> play<00:04:47.920> memory<00:04:48.280> application<00:04:48.940> store

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
about the play memory application store

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.690 
about the play memory application store
it<00:04:49.960> just<00:04:50.230> is<00:04:50.410> continuing<00:04:51.010> to<00:04:51.040> grow<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.580> is

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
it just is continuing to grow and is

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.550 
it just is continuing to grow and is
definitely<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.300> good<00:04:52.360> thing<00:04:52.540> whether<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.230> own

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
definitely a good thing whether you own

because<00:04:59.620> really<00:05:00.010> there's<00:05:00.370> no<00:05:00.580> other<00:05:00.960> platform

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
because really there's no other platform

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960 
because really there's no other platform
like<00:05:02.500> this<00:05:02.710> currently<00:05:03.310> available<00:05:03.640> and

like this currently available and

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.460 
like this currently available and
considering<00:05:04.480> it's<00:05:04.630> paired<00:05:04.900> with<00:05:04.960> some<00:05:05.260> of<00:05:05.380> the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
considering it's paired with some of the

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.750 
considering it's paired with some of the
best<00:05:05.620> hardware<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.160> innovation<00:05:06.640> in<00:05:06.730> the

best hardware and innovation in the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.270 
best hardware and innovation in the
business<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.410> think<00:05:08.410> it's<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.620> great<00:05:08.830> add-on

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
business I think it's a great add-on

business I think it's a great add-on
especially<00:05:10.180> considering<00:05:10.690> you<00:05:11.530> can<00:05:11.680> pick<00:05:11.860> and
