00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
just build that so that I can lay down

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.129 
just build that so that I can lay down
my<00:00:11.280> template<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:13.610> my<00:00:14.610> three-inch<00:00:15.210> tape<00:00:15.690> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
I've done in my other videos but the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.950 
I've done in my other videos but the
reason<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.609> built<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:24.180> plate<00:00:24.720> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
reason that I built this little plate is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
reason that I built this little plate is
I<00:00:25.230> did<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> really

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
I did that so that I can get a really

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.890 
I did that so that I can get a really
good<00:00:27.660> nice<00:00:28.760> tight<00:00:29.760> mold<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.330> there<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.720> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
good nice tight mold in there if you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.319 
good nice tight mold in there if you
don't<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:32.219> little<00:00:32.520> pocket<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.210> get

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
don't do this little pocket then you get

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.930 
don't do this little pocket then you get
a<00:00:33.360> lot<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.660> play<00:00:33.870> inside<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> tape<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.790> just

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
a lot of play inside the tape so we just

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150 
a lot of play inside the tape so we just
did<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.239> way<00:00:36.390> I'm<00:00:36.989> gonna<00:00:37.530> tape<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.100> up

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
