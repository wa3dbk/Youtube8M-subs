00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
I'm gonna check the motor oil level all

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.559 
I'm gonna check the motor oil level all
right<00:05:17.139> you<00:05:17.289> can<00:05:17.439> see<00:05:17.819> right<00:05:18.819> there<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:19.120> engine

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
right you can see right there the engine

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.529 
right you can see right there the engine
oil<00:05:19.689> level<00:05:19.719> is<00:05:20.169> right<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:21.669> where<00:05:21.819> it<00:05:21.939> should<00:05:21.969> be

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
oil level is right to where it should be

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.570 
oil level is right to where it should be
covers<00:05:23.229> that<00:05:23.319> entire<00:05:23.650> midsection<00:05:23.979> but

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
covers that entire midsection but

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.760 
covers that entire midsection but
doesn't<00:05:24.819> go<00:05:24.909> any<00:05:25.060> further<00:05:25.240> past<00:05:25.599> that<00:05:25.870> so

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
doesn't go any further past that so

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.540 
doesn't go any further past that so
we're<00:05:26.919> at<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.039> correct<00:05:27.279> level<00:05:29.340> so<00:05:30.340> we<00:05:30.430> know

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
we're at the correct level so we know

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.879 
we're at the correct level so we know
we're<00:05:30.699> all<00:05:30.819> good<00:05:30.969> on<00:05:31.090> that<00:05:31.529> now<00:05:32.529> the<00:05:32.590> second

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
we're all good on that now the second

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
change just check for leaks real quick

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.700 
change just check for leaks real quick
so<00:05:37.349> make<00:05:38.349> sure<00:05:38.560> that<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:40.289> drain<00:05:41.289> plug<00:05:41.439> isn't

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
so make sure that the drain plug isn't

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.029 
so make sure that the drain plug isn't
leaking<00:05:42.129> it<00:05:42.520> won't<00:05:42.729> be<00:05:43.770> and<00:05:44.770> also<00:05:45.099> check<00:05:45.999> your

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
leaking it won't be and also check your

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.800 
leaking it won't be and also check your
reservoir<00:05:48.039> level<00:05:48.430> here<00:05:48.669> are<00:05:48.909> your<00:05:49.240> your

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
reservoir level here are your your

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.939 
reservoir level here are your your
filter<00:05:50.080> housing<00:05:50.439> make<00:05:50.589> sure<00:05:50.740> it's<00:05:50.860> not

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
filter housing make sure it's not

00:05:50.949 --> 00:06:00.760 
filter housing make sure it's not
leaking<00:05:51.330> and<00:05:52.330> it<00:05:52.449> shouldn't<00:05:52.750> be
