00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
way because this is very small corner so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.330 
way because this is very small corner so
why<00:00:50.820> should<00:00:51.199> first<00:00:55.640> extends<00:00:56.640> from<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:58.340> black

why should first extends from here black

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.510 
why should first extends from here black
blocks<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.590> white<00:01:01.590> still<00:01:01.949> don't<00:01:02.190> want<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
blocks and white still don't want to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.130 
blocks and white still don't want to
enter<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> corner<00:01:03.530> at<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.739> time<00:01:05.659> yes<00:01:06.659> this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140

corner<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> still<00:01:07.890> too<00:01:08.640> small<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.210> y<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:12.350> it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
corner is still too small for y so it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.330 
corner is still too small for y so it
should<00:01:13.740> cut<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.720> black<00:01:15.720> extends<00:01:16.340> now
