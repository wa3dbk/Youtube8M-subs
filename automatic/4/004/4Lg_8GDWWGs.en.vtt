00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.740
 hello my dear, let's have a talk 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.560
 about the icms issue 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.940
 due to tax substitution 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.920
 especially in cases where many people have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.960
 inscribed to ask about it 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.449
 in those cases where you buy 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.130
 inputs to produce meal by 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.769
 example most recently who wrote 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.289
 I was talking about pizzeria then gilberto gil 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.780
 hit a pizzeria he buys several 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.210
 inputs to prepare their tweezers and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
 these inputs he buys are 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.329
 subject to tax substitution of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.239
 the way the manufacturer sells it to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.489
 it does there the collection of the value of the icms 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.230
 due to tax substitution that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.690
 Gilberto wanted to know when he came to see me. 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.550
 Decent I should or should not stay 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.920
 paying these ms for replacement 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.070
 because in the end I 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.500
 I get that product turns into pizza 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.989
 and seeing my pizza so it is a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.160
 sumo for my gilberto productive process 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.929
 it's very correct 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.000
 I went after very precise information 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.710
 before recording the video and found here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.910
 To S達o Paulo, this answer is good. 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.070
 I'm passing on to you it's da 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.100
 tax advisor to the secretariat of the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.650
 S達o Paulo farm is the number 9 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.040
 93 2008 and they say the following 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.960
 that any input you buy that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.710
 intended for the production of food 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.600
 only meal preparation should not be 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.700
 subject to tax substitution by the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.020
 then the gilberto who was the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.810
 consulted me and you, who are in 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.610
 watching that works with production of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.550
 foods that prepare meals that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.800
 prepare pizza for example you must communicate 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.960
 to your supplier that you will use 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.760
 those ingredients as an input into the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.710
 feed preparation if you want can 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.340
 until put according to the response of the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.950
 tax consultancy 993 of 2008 here 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.350
 of s達o paulo and that therefore he should not 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.940
 charge you should not apply to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.800
 tax substitution in a way that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.690
 You are free to have to pay this 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.960
 additional cost is fine then summarizing 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.990
 you prepare food and uses inputs 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.879
 subject to tax substitution advises 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.370
 the vendor him not charging solution 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.629
 you because it is unduly 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.579
 less here in the state of S達o Paulo is 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.939
 very clear that it is also undue then 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.939
 switched on 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.750
 seville accounting we sell 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.750
