00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:05.409
 12 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.360
 we did some work to solve 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.220
 some for small problem the 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.810
 problematic identity was the management 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.400
 interesting franc public who 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.110
 welcomes 500 miles between each year 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.970
 an output Placement was recreated 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.200
 billion to avoid the crossings that 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.070
 can always be tricky in times 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.740
 high affluence 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.240
 we have 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.440
 enlarged a little the lobby of 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.780
 billion the role a little bit more 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.880
 comfortable have the answer is all 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.100
 the organization of traffic in 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.900
 the establishment and we recreated invest 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.580
 collective untying for schools the 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.110
 clubs and recreation centers and 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.300
 family desserts and cabins a 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:01.960
 grown up and a nursery space for 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:03.940
 the event via a separate network that 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.890
 can offer comfort for those 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.180
 club users they are safe 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.310
 behind this curtain they can lose 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.050
 all their fat body that for them 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.760
 synchronized swimmers you know 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.740
 athletes must train 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.630
 serenely and for the public it gives 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.500
 a visual indication that the basin 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.500
 sport is no longer accessible 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 me 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.790
 according to the same issues 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.380
 techniques this is what is not 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.330
 visible at the public level 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.010
 it's all about treatment 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.080
 water so we redesigned our whole 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.910
 installation in order to improve our 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.910
 water quality performance 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.050
 because of record influx within 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.000
 the nautical space jean vauchère avant 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.250
 the renovation work needed 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.140
 bring 230 liters of new water through 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.209
 bather to reduce the volume 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.680
 several improvements have been 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.349
 made in the treatment of water 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.239
 in the pools chloramines are 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.830
 produced by the action of chlorine on 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.019
 nitrogenous matter left by 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.610
 bathers such as hair their 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.040
 presence causes problems of 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.780
 health and without specific treatment a 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.040
 significant renewal of water is 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.450
 necessary 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.880
 that is why chloramines 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.959
 uv installers have been installed and are processing 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.209
 the water of each basin 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.950
 they have the principle of generating 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.170
 ultraviolet light within a 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.030
 treatment chamber its rays it 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.769
 activates living cells content 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.019
 in the liquid passing through the device 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.700
 in addition to this technology 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.099
 swim caps are now 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.380
 mandatory new filters to 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.630
 automated cleaning have been installed 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.010
 this allowed to enlarge the beaches 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.019
 opening hours of the space 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.690
 nautical since cleaning cycles 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.459
 will from now on be masses 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.650
 filters that is used in these 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.780
 new filters is ecological since 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.400
 of issue of recycled materials and more 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.019
 water efficient today is that all 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.480
 your friends synthetic king was brought 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.670
 he takes us we hope 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.470
 can only consume 90 liters of water 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.360
 new by bather that's on the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.860
 water treatment and roofing we have 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.890
 laid 67 square meters of panels 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.959
 solar that will allow us to be in 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.769
 total autonomy from May to 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.440
 october for hot water 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.819
 sanitary to athic space and service 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.560
 precursor on the joke colony of the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.099
 community actually we put in 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.890
 place the map via colomiers ianu va 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.540
 allow columérins to use will be 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.150
 single support pool access 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.230
 soon media library restoration 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.230
 cinema school 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.950
 a real bar restaurant that offers a 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.170
 quality service with a real map 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.470
 we wanted to have an open place 7 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.209
 days out of 7 from 9h to 19h accessible also 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.130
 well from the outside for people 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.170
 who want to come only for 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.770
 embody that for swimmers so we 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.450
 has a zone 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.250
 friendliness inside 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.390
 the nautical space permanently open 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.820
 now we can consider that 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.860
 economy there are two pools a pool 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.880
 for school clubs and 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.250
 recreation centers etc an entry 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.170
 private and a public pool 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.890
 Open seven days a week at a minimum of 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.890
 9h to 19h
