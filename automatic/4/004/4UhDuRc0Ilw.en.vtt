00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
players that have been converted from

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.990 
players that have been converted from
the<00:01:00.930> guitar<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> base<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the guitar to the base it's the one in

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.770 
the guitar to the base it's the one in
five<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:03.750> power<00:01:03.989> cord<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> guitar

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
five is like your power cord on a guitar

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
five is like your power cord on a guitar
you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> bass<00:01:07.560> tube<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you can do that on the bass tube is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.120 
you can do that on the bass tube is
usually<00:01:08.909> sounds<00:01:09.210> better<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.920> higher

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
usually sounds better on the higher

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.120 
usually sounds better on the higher
register<00:01:12.110> but<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> mean<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> works<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
register but I mean it works but I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.249 
register but I mean it works but I
usually<00:01:14.400> play<00:01:14.490> them<00:01:14.700> singly<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
usually play them singly because that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.190 
usually play them singly because that
creates<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.740> baseline<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> that's

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
creates your baseline right so that's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.080 
creates your baseline right so that's
one<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.650> that's<00:01:19.770> five<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:20.340> just

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
one and that's five right now just

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.910 
one and that's five right now just
playing<00:01:21.270> them<00:01:21.420> singular<00:01:21.810> rather<00:01:22.020> than<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
playing them singular rather than you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.530 
playing them singular rather than you
know<00:01:22.950> hitting<00:01:23.159> together<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:24.000> when

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
know hitting together because when

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.590 
know hitting together because when
you're<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> low<00:01:25.200> frequency<00:01:26.509> hitting<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
you're in a low frequency hitting it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
you're in a low frequency hitting it
together<00:01:27.900> might<00:01:28.220> cancel<00:01:29.220> each<00:01:29.490> other<00:01:29.610> out<00:01:29.759> or

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
together might cancel each other out or

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.060 
together might cancel each other out or
just<00:01:30.240> sound<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> droney<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.920> play

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
just sound really to droney I can play

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.350 
just sound really to droney I can play
them<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> Opera<00:01:32.610> registered<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> the

you<00:01:42.470> know<00:01:42.620> so<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.310> can<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.790> can<00:01:43.970> do<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.560> if

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
you know so you can you can do that if

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.620 
you know so you can you can do that if
you're<00:01:46.130> okay<00:01:46.400> with<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.580> I'm<00:01:47.270> mainly

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
you're okay with that I'm mainly

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.780 
you're okay with that I'm mainly
applying<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.500> today<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.800> just<00:01:49.100> like<00:01:49.670> in

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
applying it today to just like in

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.410 
applying it today to just like in
additions<00:01:51.729> this<00:01:52.729> works<00:01:52.940> really<00:01:53.150> well<00:01:53.300> for

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
additions this works really well for

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:08.650 
additions this works really well for
country<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.580> play<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:07.970> anywhere<00:02:08.539> it

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
country you can play this anywhere it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.820 
country you can play this anywhere it
followed<00:02:08.959> up<00:02:10.690> get<00:02:11.690> used<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.110> pattern

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
followed up get used to the pattern

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.190 
followed up get used to the pattern
between<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.550> there<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.239> pattern<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.840> happens

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
between it there is a pattern it happens

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.370 
between it there is a pattern it happens
between<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:16.130> octave<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.390> fifth<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.900> a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
between the octave and the fifth in a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.770 
between the octave and the fifth in a
minute<00:02:18.650> i'll<00:02:18.739> be<00:02:18.890> talking<00:02:19.100> about<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:22.780> okay

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
minute i'll be talking about that okay

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.140 
minute i'll be talking about that okay
so<00:02:24.100> when<00:02:25.100> we're<00:02:25.220> doing<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.550> fifth<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.940> sells

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
so when we're doing the fifth it sells

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.710 
so when we're doing the fifth it sells
the<00:02:26.330> root<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.720> then<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.989> fifth<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.450> my

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
the root and then the fifth so a is my

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.120 
the root and then the fifth so a is my
root<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.320> fissile<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:33.830> going<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.010> be

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
root then the fissile is going to be

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.449 
root then the fissile is going to be
