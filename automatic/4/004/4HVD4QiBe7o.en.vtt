00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.049
 hello her love i am junkie and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.830
 welcome to my new 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.820
 Video 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.210
 I have something very new for me today 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.210
 on 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.350
 it starts with a new one 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.020
 Facial care and I am completely 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.300
 that's what the skills are 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.700
 never my dear friend suri 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.260
 Got me this product as a small sample 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 brought along and I was so excited 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.370
 that I will immediately start running for myself 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.949
 the right cream you've got the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.690
 50 miracles are green the cream should be 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.379
 skin image be negotiator 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.640
 this cream is the 1 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.440
 the moderately good and has such a 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.620
 little 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 I would say this one so it has 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.940
 a little bit the baby effect 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.850
 is here now but first as soon as 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.770
 you apply it to the skin and take it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.460
 So put on your skin color a bit 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.130
 and at the same time covers a bit so 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.490
 it gets off so easily i say i 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.100
 times 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.560
 and that's why I like the cream so much 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.929
 a nice even skin similar 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.610
 like the bi Krems but at the same time 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.130
 so a little bit the tiredness sign 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 The skin should improve so small 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.880
 reduce wrinkles you can do something like that too 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.440
 take a little bit preventive 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 So she has quite a lot 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.330
 Some users mainly use them 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.679
 As a moisturizer she smells delicious 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.690
 And she stops for the cream too 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.240
 a very good even skin picture that 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.369
 is about a rediscovery 2015 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 I'm totally the tea drinker and that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.179
 not only in winter had to default 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.640
 then, of course, the Roche vanilla team 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.039
 with yes that is already an absolute must 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.170
 have in my collection 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.630
 but what I rediscovered and love 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.000
 I could drink white and cup wise 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.880
 Christmas is over but I am 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.390
 still in winter mood and the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.440
 latte from teapot is a chimney 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.900
 dream 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.730
 it tastes so delicious 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.930
 I do not even honey cleans the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.030
 drinking cure and there is really Christmas 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.140
 this is both bousquet mix 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.750
 and because it's such an orange 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.770
 marzipan aroma and this marzipan high 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.780
 I love it so dt a little tears 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.910
 then I have essens still this 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.910
 beautiful winter range taken away 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.340
 that was such a virtual of essence where 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.660
 now some stocks still I overcame 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.600
 I still brought a palette with me 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.459
 I made this totally sweet if you 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:54.020
 This complains then goes to the ski hut 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:55.970
 down here are the colors and us 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.860
 stay with essenens- and this one 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.890
 brush here with this beautiful 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.170
 pink bristles also landed in 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.050
 my shopping basket with this brush 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.900
 the beveled bristles will become whole 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.940
 like to handle alone or to wear 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.640
 just around the eyeshadow at the lower 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.530
 Apply the eyelashes are the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.450
 in my opinion perfect and shipping 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.190
 then I still need something 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.750
 against this shine in the face so 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.030
 especially when you are in front of the camera with the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.370
 lighting is shining yes why 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.170
 a bacon rind and there I am 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.019
 for maybelline that max america brother 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.780
 taken something yes does something against the shine 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.320
 let's say more about that 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.390
 no doubt no libdems still landed in 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.579
 my shopping cart for 1 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.670
 For one, this is the one that is essential 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.829
 that's so great because I have in 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.440
 have a question and the last red 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.750
 but I'm spilled somewhere and they are 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.459
 just the smell of the direction 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.530
 like Cuba , these candy hoovers still know each other 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.760
 chewing gum I try that I would am 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.980
 My favorite lips all day long 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.549
 dissuasive and he makes so easy 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.160
 you see that so easily pinkish red 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.790
 makes for a very light rosÃ© already 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.070
 the lips 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.440
 I would say that it is the top 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.590
 product is because there is still a le 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.479
 I will show you the pen right away 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.250
 completely convinced of the care 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.290
 but this one is alone 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.970
 the judge feels good on the 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.860
 lips and stop it just like that 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.350
 little bit of color and my highlight 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.430
 lipp construction helmets in terms of care 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.530
 especially in winter 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.060
 that's just the cara mix so 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.770
 I think so many times in 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.840
 Youtube kept in cameras because of that 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.100
 I do not need to say that much anymore 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.190
 super care we stay with the lips 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.840
 with the p2 lipstick that way 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.030
 Funny and I found the color 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.730
 very nice and he has to shine 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.980
 state's finishes are in everyday life 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:59.030
 I think so much more on his rosi colors 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:02.240
 natural lipstick colors and of it 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.830
 not very good, I can exactly 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.510
 I can carry on here for you because 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.910
 you see the new building so that is already 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.820
 pretty pinto but I have it now 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.380
 also generously applied 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.400
 With the pen, the order is really 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.930
 super easy I 'm just watching that 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.430
 For me, I do not believe in winter 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.620
 So good is where I am now 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.250
 he is not very dry 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:32.570
 beneficial because of my lips faith 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.979
 I dry up even more and I notice 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.570
 like that in every little lip 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.229
 which really sets off and the lips 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.140
 maybe even a bit 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.070
 dry I had to make again 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.110
 debug 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.530
 if my lips are a bit again 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.030
 air league are a bit softer then 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.510
 needs the replenishment of artificial 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.520
 eyelashes 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.470
 my favorite track you unfortunately times 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.780
 sold out again so I have now 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.220
 Take the ones from essens if you 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.110
 I love to get to know you 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.540
 experience with it in the comments 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.030
 I think they look pretty good and sometimes 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.620
 see how they look on their eyes 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.479
 and then I have two more 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.890
 products for my handbag and that 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.720
 is on the one hand hairspray 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.919
 I always like that in the small one 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.380
 also variations again a 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.500
 handbag with it because without hairspray 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.840
 I can not live and second 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.249
 I always have disinfectant spray 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.079
 so small disinfecting wipes 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.759
 pocket and now you have problems with that 

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:29.699
 spray that certainly sets in 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.799
 a bit more handy and I take that 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.179
 in between during the day for the hands around 

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:35.309
 to disinfect me once 

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:37.139
 or if you want somehow 

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:39.629
 it can not hurt on the way 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:42.119
 always a small disinfectant 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:44.009
 to have in your handbag and that's why 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:46.309
 I need that again and again 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:48.719
 Now try a spray and 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:51.599
 we are already at the end of this 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:54.389
 that was my little dm exploiting for 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.769
 I hope you enjoyed it and you 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.569
 If so, then I would of course 

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:59.729
 happy if you give the video a thumb 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.979

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.299
 again two of my last videos and 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.689
 Until then I wish you a nice 

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:08.729
