transporter<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> guess<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.720> it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
transporter so I guess that's what it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.749 
transporter so I guess that's what it's
supposed<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.750> design

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
supposed to be and I do like this design

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.550 
supposed to be and I do like this design
especially<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.150> orange<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.900> looks<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.290> nice

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.810 
especially in orange it looks very nice
and<00:01:22.920> bright<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.689> just<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> motorcycle

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
and bright and just like a motorcycle

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.340 
and bright and just like a motorcycle
the<00:01:26.820> robber<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.509> stand<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the robber will just stand in here and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.330 
the robber will just stand in here and
his<00:01:28.470> hands<00:01:28.710> will<00:01:28.890> clip<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> handlebars

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
his hands will clip on to the handlebars

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.810 
his hands will clip on to the handlebars
