switch right here when I release then I

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.130 
switch right here when I release then I
take<00:02:05.869> this<00:02:06.049> one<00:02:06.350> again<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.979> then<00:02:07.819> I<00:02:07.850> lower<00:02:08.179> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
take this one again and then I lower the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.259 
take this one again and then I lower the
noose<00:02:09.349> neck<00:02:09.590> down<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> ground<00:02:10.429> or<00:02:11.239> the

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
noose neck down to the ground or the

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:19.260 
noose neck down to the ground or the
trailer<00:02:11.810> down<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.319> ground<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.709> should<00:02:12.920> say

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.380 

we<00:02:19.780> laid<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.290> ground

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
we laid on the ground

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
we laid on the ground
then<00:02:22.900> what<00:02:23.770> we<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.040> we<00:02:24.280> take<00:02:24.460> this<00:02:25.420> arm

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
then what we do is we take this arm

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.430 
then what we do is we take this arm
again

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.300 

just<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.040> that

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
just like that

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.230 
just like that
actually<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:37.300> I'm<00:02:37.510> thinking<00:02:37.810> of

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.110 

I<00:02:43.330> had<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.050> lower<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.710> down<00:02:44.740> some<00:02:45.190> more<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:46.000> we

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
I had to lower it down some more so we

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.510 
I had to lower it down some more so we
can<00:02:46.240> get<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:46.570> hair<00:02:46.870> get<00:02:47.710> some<00:02:47.890> space<00:02:48.190> hair

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
can get this hair get some space hair

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.610 
can get this hair get some space hair
off<00:02:48.760> these<00:02:49.030> taps<00:02:49.390> because<00:02:50.050> this<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.470> actually

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
off these taps because this is actually

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.350 
off these taps because this is actually
what<00:02:50.920> holds<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
what holds the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.120 
what holds the
that<00:02:52.510> Gothia<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.320> trailer<00:02:53.620> off<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.920> ground

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that Gothia the trailer off the ground

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.960 
that Gothia the trailer off the ground
with<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.400> gooseneck

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
with the gooseneck

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.080 
with the gooseneck
Vennela<00:02:56.420> lower<00:02:56.780> the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.900 

the<00:03:01.450> way

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the way

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.870 
the way
there<00:03:03.830> did<00:03:05.180> now<00:03:06.180> we'll<00:03:06.930> come<00:03:07.140> back<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.470> here

and when I do that you'll see this pin
pop<00:03:38.579> up<00:03:39.560> see<00:03:40.560> that

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
sometimes you gotta give it a little bit

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.559 
sometimes you gotta give it a little bit
of<00:03:57.210> persuasion

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.479 
is did what it's gone is in here there's
a<00:04:10.810> pin<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.469> goes<00:04:11.500> down<00:04:11.829> there<00:04:12.129> that's<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
a pin that goes down there that's the

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.309 
a pin that goes down there that's the
pin<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:12.849> popped<00:04:13.150> up<00:04:13.359> which<00:04:13.900> goes<00:04:14.109> down

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
pin that I popped up which goes down

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.949 
pin that I popped up which goes down
into<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.650> slot<00:04:15.010> there<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:16.209> that's<00:04:16.419> done

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
into a slot there so that's done

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.039 
into a slot there so that's done
so<00:04:17.799> now<00:04:17.949> what<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.639> would<00:04:18.759> do<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.449> would

so now what I would do is I would

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.749 
so now what I would do is I would
disconnect<00:04:20.620> my<00:04:20.739> ear<00:04:20.919> lines<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.579> my

disconnect my ear lines and my
electrical<00:04:22.419> line<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.500> Drive<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:24.270> reverse

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
electrical line and I Drive up reverse

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.270 
electrical line and I Drive up reverse
order<00:04:25.600> I'm<00:04:25.870> not<00:04:25.990> gonna<00:04:26.110> do<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:27.100> reverse

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
order I'm not gonna do it the reverse

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.210 
order I'm not gonna do it the reverse
order<00:04:27.729> would<00:04:28.000> be<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:29.080> back<00:04:29.259> back<00:04:29.530> in<00:04:29.710> again

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
order would be the back back in again
