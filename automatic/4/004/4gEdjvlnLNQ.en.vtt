00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
lot of coordination with top so once you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.780 
lot of coordination with top so once you
start<00:03:52.739> building<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.280> steps<00:03:53.489> come<00:03:53.760> a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
start building that the steps come a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.600 
start building that the steps come a
little<00:03:53.970> bit<00:03:54.120> more<00:03:54.239> not

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610
