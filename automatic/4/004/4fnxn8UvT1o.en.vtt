products but the advantage to that is

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.640 
products but the advantage to that is
we're<00:01:14.299> going<00:01:14.479> for<00:01:14.750> texture<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.259> flavor

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
we're going for texture and flavor

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.830 
we're going for texture and flavor
rather<00:01:16.430> than<00:01:16.909> overall<00:01:17.240> decorative

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
rather than overall decorative

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.370 

that<00:01:25.060> makes<00:01:25.360> a<00:01:25.480> big<00:01:25.510> difference<00:01:26.020> in<00:01:26.170> how<00:01:26.320> you

that makes a big difference in how you

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.850 
that makes a big difference in how you
approach<00:01:26.740> what<00:01:27.460> you're<00:01:27.640> judging

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.560

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
quite a discerning taste palate to be

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:03.899 
quite a discerning taste palate to be
updated<00:01:53.830> slight<00:01:54.310> flavorings<00:01:55.000> upon<00:01:55.390> it

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.800 

you

you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.080 
you
I'm<00:02:06.350> judging<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.830> sugar-flower<00:02:07.310> class<00:02:07.729> and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
I'm judging the sugar-flower class and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.760 
I'm judging the sugar-flower class and
the<00:02:08.270> idea<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.840> class<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.440> they<00:02:09.619> have

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
the idea of this class is they have

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.199 
the idea of this class is they have
flowers<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.190> look<00:02:10.459> as<00:02:10.580> realistic<00:02:10.789> as

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
flowers that look as realistic as

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.600 
flowers that look as realistic as
possible<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.620> exhibits<00:02:13.069> are<00:02:13.220> totally

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
possible so the exhibits are totally

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.580 
possible so the exhibits are totally
edible<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:14.180> they're<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.569> wire<00:02:14.810> stems<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
edible because they're on wire stems and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.830 
edible because they're on wire stems and
same<00:02:15.860> as<00:02:16.040> around<00:02:16.459> but<00:02:16.970> all<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.240> actual<00:02:17.510> petals

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
same as around but all the actual petals

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:28.950

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.240 

this<00:02:29.770> class<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.630> sculptured<00:02:31.630> No

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
this class is the sculptured No

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
this class is the sculptured No
and<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:33.000> has<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.780> shape<00:02:34.020> that's<00:02:34.230> been

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.620 
and it has to be of a shape that's been
carved<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.070> take<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> cake<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.150> carve<00:02:36.510> it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
carved so we take a cake and we carve it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.450 
carved so we take a cake and we carve it
into<00:02:36.870> whatever<00:02:37.290> shape<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.830> design<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.250> want
