00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
that's what she was there to do that day

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.940 
that's what she was there to do that day
so<00:01:49.940> she<00:01:50.119> didn't<00:01:50.509> miss<00:01:50.690> out<00:01:50.869> on<00:01:51.110> any<00:01:51.319> any

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
so she didn't miss out on any any

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.190 
so she didn't miss out on any any
moments<00:01:52.700> because<00:01:53.390> she<00:01:53.750> was<00:01:53.840> part<00:01:54.080> of<00:01:54.110> the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
moments because she was part of the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.480 
moments because she was part of the
family<00:01:54.410> or<00:01:54.619> because<00:01:54.890> she<00:01:54.920> was<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.190> friend

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
family or because she was a friend

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.249 
family or because she was a friend
trying<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.880> help<00:01:56.030> one<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.390> us<00:01:56.479> get<00:01:56.690> ready<00:01:56.840> or

trying to help one of us get ready or

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.080 
trying to help one of us get ready or
you<00:01:57.800> know<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.009> take<00:01:58.310> care<00:01:58.490> of<00:01:58.550> anything<00:01:58.759> else

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you know to take care of anything else

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.840 
you know to take care of anything else
I'd<00:01:59.300> I<00:01:59.509> definitely<00:02:00.080> think<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.890> know<00:02:01.009> that<00:02:01.280> you

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
I'd I definitely think you know that you

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.790 
I'd I definitely think you know that you
do<00:02:02.119> make<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> lot<00:02:02.660> of<00:02:02.720> investments<00:02:03.319> planning<00:02:03.740> a

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
do make a lot of investments planning a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.469 
do make a lot of investments planning a
wedding<00:02:03.950> but<00:02:04.340> at<00:02:04.459> the<00:02:04.520> end<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.849> day<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
wedding but at the end of the day the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.120 
wedding but at the end of the day the
the<00:02:05.840> pictures<00:02:06.200> are<00:02:06.319> what<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.530> have<00:02:06.679> left<00:02:06.890> and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
the pictures are what you have left and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.380 
the pictures are what you have left and
so<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.310> definitely<00:02:07.520> think<00:02:07.819> it's<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.179> most

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
so I definitely think it's the most

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.839 
so I definitely think it's the most
important<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.590> can<00:02:09.800> make<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.250> think<00:02:10.700> that

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
important that you can make I think that

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.970 
important that you can make I think that
people<00:02:11.209> who<00:02:11.420> aren't<00:02:12.230> professionals<00:02:12.770> they

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
people who aren't professionals they

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.740 
people who aren't professionals they
want<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.490> capture<00:02:13.670> those<00:02:13.910> moments<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.480> they

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
want to capture those moments and they

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.930 
want to capture those moments and they
know<00:02:14.930> kind<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.680> kind<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.459> what<00:02:16.550> they<00:02:16.730> look<00:02:16.910> like

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940
