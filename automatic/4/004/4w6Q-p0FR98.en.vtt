00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
it's ridiculous

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.440 
it's ridiculous
actually<00:01:11.610> reminded<00:01:11.939> me<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.240> bit<00:01:12.330> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
actually reminded me a little bit of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.880 
actually reminded me a little bit of
Killzone<00:01:12.810> every<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> was

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
Killzone every now and then and I was

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.410 
Killzone every now and then and I was
trying<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> figure<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.430> why<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> think<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
trying to figure out why and I think I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420 
trying to figure out why and I think I
just<00:01:15.689> did<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> few<00:01:16.229> minutes<00:01:16.350> ago<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.250> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
just did a few minutes ago I think it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
just did a few minutes ago I think it's
partly<00:01:17.729> because<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.180> looks<00:01:18.420> amazing<00:01:18.750> maybe

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
partly because it looks amazing maybe

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.469 
partly because it looks amazing maybe
there's<00:01:19.890> some<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.640> sort<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> film

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
there's some of that it's sort of film

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
there's some of that it's sort of film
grainy<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.110> don't<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.619> tell<00:01:22.860> but

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it just sort of reminds me a little of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.070
