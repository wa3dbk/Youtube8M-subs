 we are here with the 50 and here we are 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.410
 in a new video today it touches us and I come to 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.850
 bring you and show you a game that 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.040
 we are proving that he has just entered into 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.870
 phase europe in beta and that soon the day 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.280
 October 17 will enter phase of 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.920
 launch is nothing more and nothing 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.900
 less than legit online but online a 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.850
 title distributed by air game where 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.570
 will bring you from the world fully into the world 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.400
 to trust in its way let's say online in that 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.170
 it looks like this game another one because not the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.940
 true that not much simply keeps 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.769
 some let's say resources of the games 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.360
 previous but that adds it to this 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.899
 game and it gives it a new air so that 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.850
 can enjoy it cool online where 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.770
 we will have cooperative ways let's go some 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.290
 friend this pvp mode the critics of 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.600
 any type or any kind of 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.460
 play this kind sweetest rip modes 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.750
 with knives or demolition and also 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.940
 missions of the cooperative world as 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.130
 up to four friends to be able to say 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.110
 enjoy in company also opens us 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.820
 a small tutorial where he will introduce us 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.450
 full let's say in the basics 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.570
 to start them 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.340
 the game and where it will get us and show 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.369
 how are we say the basic movements 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.350
 and how the game works in this little 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.229
 mission that we have to go playing for 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.729
 go doing various types of actions and 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.409
 that little by little will show us how 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.579
 it moves in a very fluid way how 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.530
 moves and works the game of the game 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.600
 graphically it looks pretty good without 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.759
 get to many boasts but the advantage 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.409
 is that they get it to work in many 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.179
 computers although they are not very powerful 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.250
 the little orioles is also very well 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.319
 gotten quite scares during 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.759
 the games in the girl visits us from 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.200
 occasionally as it can be seen in 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.289
 these images we are really liking for 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.030
 here but also have also still 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.189
 something different the game once 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.390
 we have finished the tutorial then 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.649
 we can choose the servers now 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.390
 we have corrections to be able to 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.920
 play with North America and Europe 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.239
 Once we choose the region, we will 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.340
 It is already full in the lag of 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.049
 our player our players in 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.110
 this case writes in the players that 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:22.490
 let's say you are the player 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.650
 of tc and tc is important and let's say and 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.840
 I emphasize it important to equip the two 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.330
 well-equipped players with everything 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.160
 you can because depending on good 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.470
 games on one side or another will catch us 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.000
 one avatar or another is so bad that is to say no 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.740
 we have an avatar to play a side or 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.030
 another but that is because we have one going 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.280
 transforming with what you have to go 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.110
 equipping the feet so we can go 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.480
 let's say well equipped to combat and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.730
 depending on the habana say that 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.990
 we have we can also equip the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.670
 necessary knowledge as we go 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.070
 unlocking the is to say that the game 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.490
 It has a lot of customization without showing 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.020
 technicians follow and weird thing just 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.310
 the minimum to be able to enjoy and give us 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.900
 a little bit of a role at the time of 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.570
 to equip our team our 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.130
 soldier and that is not equal to all and 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.720
 we also have many ways to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.720
 get resources and weapons 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.100
 it also has a kraft mode where a 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.290
 through the games we can go 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.760
 unlocking and getting resources and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.770
 depending on the letters we want 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.180
 unblock with castells then we 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.980
 they will ask for more or less resources and according to 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.780
 let's have the resources then 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.900
 an amount of money and we will build 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.580
 the weapon right now there are only weapons to 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.980
 castella I guess I'll have with 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.170
 the time more little things we will also have 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.940
 the ionic powers powers that we 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.989
 will give some benefits of the games 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.840
 once 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.330
 unlocked some achievements for example 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.880
 to unlock an achievement of for example 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.040
 this one that tells us here 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.450
 reduces the damage by grenades you have to 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.740
 get a series of objectives 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.390
 who continue for example to kill soldiers 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.590
 every time we do it the power is 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.300
 active and neca but nothing more to the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.640
 powers so that teams are activated 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.500
 alone once we get them let's say 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.500
 the wolves in battle is important 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.570
 equip the achievements in each player 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.880
 I remember that you do not have to stop in a single 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.490
 team in both of us let's say them 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.140
 achievements the ionic powers can be 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.340
 buy for time all the time 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.450
 limited for one day for seven days or 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.580
 powerful days 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.990
 we buy them here could really 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.990
 get during the game although there 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.250
 let's also say resources that we can 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.440
 buy everything real but in this case 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.150
 the ionic powers are not the ones that 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.799
 make up they got confused the game 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.420
 we have here the equipment to our 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.030
 soldiers where also the store also 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.220
 We can buy various weapons weapons that 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.070
 if we buy some with money then we 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.600
 will be worth not be permanent worth these 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.540
 are the ones that come with the red coins 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.880
 are let's say permanent weapons 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.470
 but with game money that come with 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.720
 the red mostly of the game and they write 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.700
 with yellow are let's say you buy 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.100
 with real money you pay you have a 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.290
 quantity 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.720
 like any kind we can converse 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.930
 more to buy we have permanently 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.730
 and not have to walk with say 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.960
 of a day two days also once as 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.150
 the games can be unlocked 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:06.800
 weapons of the games that will remain 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.300
 as well as equipment of the games 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.040
 I was quite full that suffers 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.840
 pretty fun and we can 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.910
 Enjoy for free without spending a 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.290
 just hard because as you can see it does not 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.140
 you are not hard to have a good time 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.990
