00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.060
 some restlessness 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.370

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.740

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.240
 michael schanze you know when the me 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.650
 Excessive selection of ours 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.389
 overflow society again 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.100
 I want to go insane 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.020
 would have to simplify the decision 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.419

 left cake piece is the apple pie 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.860
 Now, the young man thinks to the left of 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.860
 my side left or from your side 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.860
 Yes 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.770
 The young man looks at his hands and 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.129
 a donkey bridge sounds like that 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.689
 like luxor or the really problematic 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.310
 on order left and right to 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.139
 research is, however, that his 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.840
 palms pointing upwards he lies 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.969
 so wrong if he believes that to be 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.439
 right thumb the left one is asking 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.789
 He asks his customer if this is the case 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.289
 faded piece of cake with the himself 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.060
 liquefy something under the 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.590
 bloated rumbling means that I am 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.009
 hochbeet on both ends like ambi 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:32.469
 exactly that's what I mean 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:34.000
 I also have to say the words we expect 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:38.379
 Baked goods specialist brings his cell phone 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.319
 out and photographed cake and and 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.670
 the wasps have an app on it 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.710
 that recognizes the cake 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.390
 jolo the young man says i can see 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.310
 we google that photo to anyone 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.230
 probably with the standard question what 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.000
 is this cake fucking three 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.850
 Seconds later, the phone buzzes 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.160
 young man pump nozzle struzl sprinkles 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.590
 with wasps then he asks the coat one 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.720
 then he asks the coat to wrap up 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.970
 or if the post wrap says 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.500
 coat one should not dry out and 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.580
 forgive the other two pieces as well 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.920

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.600
 certified bakery seller no 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.600

 how capital a coat one buys me 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.999
 So just the last balls in the neighborhood 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.649
 there's nothing left for me to do 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:33.839
 more left resigned because he is the 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:35.459
 cake too loaded and waiting outside 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.110
 the traffic light suddenly turns off the coat 

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:37.679
 man next to me in the company of the two 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.079
 wasps 

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:42.179
 fortunately there was not in the store too 

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:44.219
 yet, on the other hand, it would have some 

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:45.389
 given there were no wasps 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:48.449
 Three are playing over my head 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.549
 could catch question mark that comes 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.409
 from an animal documentation I ask 

00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:54.779
 they say no out of my mouth 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:56.489
 coat one of these kill namely 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:57.989
 wasps nibble their heads off 

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:59.909
 and drag on the twitching torso 

00:06:57.989 --> 00:07:03.419
 home to feed her breed i 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:05.399
 get back hungry if they so my 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.869
 Without seeing you know that you are safe 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.919
 before wasps they are then able to completely 

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:09.719
 be calm 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.579
 either I have something right now 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:13.349
 learned or the man hallucinated 

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:15.869
 apparently he already has one of the 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:17.909
 Pieces would be bitten tomorrow 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:19.529
