oh you can totally see the planes in the
sunlight<00:02:36.099> now<00:02:36.340> I'm<00:02:37.120> lifting<00:02:38.430> there's<00:02:39.430> two

well<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:56.910> mean<00:02:57.240> assuming<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.990> chance<00:02:58.200> of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
well I mean assuming the the chance of

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.460 
well I mean assuming the the chance of
it<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.770> know<00:02:58.890> one<00:02:59.880> digit<00:03:00.360> repeating<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.320> like

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
it you know one digit repeating is like

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:19.370 
it you know one digit repeating is like
you<00:03:01.650> know<00:03:01.740> one<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.040> 10<00:03:17.810> there<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.290> there

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
you know one in 10 there it is and there

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:28.600 
you know one in 10 there it is and there
they<00:03:19.530> go

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:04:08.370 

then<00:03:29.610> they<00:03:29.670> go<00:03:29.790> off<00:03:29.820> into<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.210> fog

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.819 

they<00:04:09.380> had<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.830> curvature

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.740 

in<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.519> smile<00:04:17.879> you're<00:04:18.870> coming<00:04:19.139> through

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
like a circle it would actually be

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.590 
like a circle it would actually be
amazing<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.800> be<00:04:34.890> there<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.790> they<00:04:36.060> started

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
they're gonna do a circle there and to

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.650 
they're gonna do a circle there and to
get<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.830> last<00:04:41.010> hundred<00:04:41.580> or<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:41.970> numbers<00:04:42.360> or

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.000 
get the last hundred or so numbers or
fifty<00:04:43.080> numbers<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.710> then<00:04:43.800> they're<00:04:43.950> gonna

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
fifty numbers and then they're gonna

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.220 
fifty numbers and then they're gonna
land<00:04:44.340> okay<00:04:45.270> where<00:04:45.420> they<00:04:45.480> start<00:04:45.750> yes<00:04:45.990> they're
