okay<00:00:36.040> yeah<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:40.710> we're<00:00:41.710> out<00:00:41.860> trying<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.640> figure

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
okay yeah so we're out trying to figure

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.160 
okay yeah so we're out trying to figure
out<00:00:43.120> how<00:00:43.270> to<00:00:43.329> make<00:00:43.629> this<00:00:43.809> movie<00:00:44.289> and<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.989> were<00:00:47.140> a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
out how to make this movie and we were a

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.510 
out how to make this movie and we were a
group<00:00:47.440> though<00:00:47.680> that<00:00:47.859> had<00:00:47.949> been<00:00:48.219> through

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
group though that had been through

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.400 
group though that had been through
failures<00:00:49.480> together<00:00:49.899> so<00:00:50.140> we'd<00:00:50.260> all

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
failures together so we'd all

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.979 
failures together so we'd all
experienced<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:52.090> it<00:00:52.600> was<00:00:52.719> really

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
experienced that and it was really

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.840 
experienced that and it was really
difficult<00:00:53.109> to<00:00:53.620> figure<00:00:53.800> this<00:00:53.980> out<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.399> we<00:00:54.460> made

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
difficult to figure this out and we made

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.000 
difficult to figure this out and we made
a<00:00:54.879> lot<00:00:55.090> of<00:00:55.149> miss<00:00:55.420> estimates<00:00:55.960> and<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.769> first

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
a lot of miss estimates and the first

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.619 
a lot of miss estimates and the first
versions<00:00:57.429> didn't<00:00:57.789> work<00:00:57.969> very<00:00:58.269> well<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:00.489> we<00:01:00.820> as

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
versions didn't work very well but we as

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.790 
versions didn't work very well but we as
we<00:01:01.840> got<00:01:01.989> closer<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:04.239> became<00:01:04.750> apparent<00:01:05.440> that<00:01:05.680> we

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
we got closer it became apparent that we

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.150 
we got closer it became apparent that we
were<00:01:05.920> onto<00:01:06.190> something<00:01:06.400> really<00:01:07.330> big<00:01:08.170> I<00:01:08.560> have<00:01:09.070> to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
were onto something really big I have to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160 
were onto something really big I have to
say<00:01:09.340> John<00:01:10.150> Lasseter<00:01:10.600> bolivar<00:01:10.960> from<00:01:11.110> the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
say John Lasseter bolivar from the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.260 
say John Lasseter bolivar from the
minute<00:01:11.380> that<00:01:11.410> this<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.710> going<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:11.980> be<00:01:12.270> gigantic

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
minute that this is going to be gigantic

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.020 
minute that this is going to be gigantic
but<00:01:14.200> from<00:01:14.440> Disney's<00:01:15.130> point<00:01:15.400> of<00:01:15.520> view<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.910> was<00:01:15.970> a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
but from Disney's point of view it was a

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.540 
but from Disney's point of view it was a
boutique<00:01:16.420> film<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:16.960> they<00:01:17.080> didn't<00:01:17.380> put<00:01:17.620> any

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
boutique film so they didn't put any

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.730 
boutique film so they didn't put any
consumer<00:01:18.820> products<00:01:19.270> behind<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.780> because<00:01:20.620> they

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
consumer products behind it because they

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.360 
consumer products behind it because they
didn't<00:01:21.010> see<00:01:21.160> it<00:01:21.250> being<00:01:22.240> anything<00:01:22.800> but<00:01:23.800> it<00:01:24.250> got

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
didn't see it being anything but it got

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.400 
didn't see it being anything but it got
into<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.820> last<00:01:25.030> year<00:01:25.480> it<00:01:25.600> was<00:01:25.720> now<00:01:25.930> parent<00:01:26.350> it

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
into the last year it was now parent it

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.590 
into the last year it was now parent it
was<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.770> was<00:01:26.920> big<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.190> so<00:01:27.490> Steve<00:01:27.790> said<00:01:28.210> okay

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
was it was big and so Steve said okay

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.320

now we are we are going to revolutionize
this<00:01:32.200> industry<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:35.170> we're<00:01:35.590> also<00:01:35.830> in<00:01:36.160> a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
this industry but we're also in a

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.310 
this industry but we're also in a
position<00:01:36.430> where<00:01:37.000> because<00:01:37.690> we've<00:01:37.930> got<00:01:38.110> the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
position where because we've got the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.500 
position where because we've got the
experience<00:01:38.650> here<00:01:39.190> not<00:01:39.850> only<00:01:39.970> do<00:01:40.180> we<00:01:40.300> have<00:01:40.330> the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
experience here not only do we have the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.420 
experience here not only do we have the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
first film on we will probably have the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.480 
first film on we will probably have the
second<00:01:42.850> film<00:01:43.690> out<00:01:43.840> before<00:01:44.110> anybody<00:01:44.410> else<00:01:44.590> can
