00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
alright I did put the cast-iron skillet

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.670 
alright I did put the cast-iron skillet
on<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.520> then<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.670> started<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.060> timer<00:02:10.680> some

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680

reason<00:02:11.920> work<00:02:12.040> with<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.220> past<00:02:12.430> cast<00:02:12.820> iron

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
reason work with the past cast iron

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.760 
reason work with the past cast iron
skillet<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.750> starts<00:02:13.990> smoking<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.560> little

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
skillet on it starts smoking a little

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.430 
skillet on it starts smoking a little
bit<00:02:14.920> I'm<00:02:15.520> thinking<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.510> needs<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.990> be<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> little

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
bit I'm thinking it needs to be a little

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.270 
bit I'm thinking it needs to be a little
higher<00:02:17.770> off<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:19.050> rocket<00:02:20.050> stove

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.370 

that's<00:02:26.280> what<00:02:26.459> I'm<00:02:26.610> thinking<00:02:27.080> maybe<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.200> should

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
that's what I'm thinking maybe I should

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
that's what I'm thinking maybe I should
use<00:02:28.530> trading<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.040> can't<00:02:29.430> use<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> pot<00:02:29.850> skirt<00:02:30.120> on

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
use trading I can't use the pot skirt on

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.510 
use trading I can't use the pot skirt on
it's<00:02:30.540> got<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> tapered<00:02:31.110> angle<00:02:32.720> anyways<00:02:34.520> so

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
it's got a tapered angle anyways so

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.030 
it's got a tapered angle anyways so
there<00:02:35.819> we<00:02:35.940> go<00:02:37.850> drifting<00:02:38.850> on<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.150> Rockets<00:02:39.600> too

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
there we go drifting on the Rockets too

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.110 
there we go drifting on the Rockets too
and<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.130> need<00:02:41.250> some<00:02:41.489> height<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.090> camera

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.710 

alright<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.390> future<00:02:48.720> references<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:50.720> probably

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
alright for future references I probably

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.090 
alright for future references I probably
want<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.080> let<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.440> heat<00:02:52.680> up<00:02:52.709> for<00:02:52.890> seven<00:02:53.850> minutes
