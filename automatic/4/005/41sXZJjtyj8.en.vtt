takes forever to do I should know

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.010 
takes forever to do I should know
whenever<00:00:42.710> I<00:00:42.860> first<00:00:43.070> started<00:00:43.840> started<00:00:44.840> out

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
whenever I first started started out

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.209 
whenever I first started started out
doing<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:45.829> this<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:46.850> rather<00:00:47.120> older

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
doing this but this is a rather older

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.790 
doing this but this is a rather older
Barbie<00:00:49.219> head<00:00:49.430> or<00:00:49.700> something<00:00:50.380> she's<00:00:51.380> not<00:00:51.500> old

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
but she's been played with quite a lot

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.510 
but she's been played with quite a lot

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.529 
as you can tell she's scuffs all over
face<00:00:58.850> but<00:01:00.520> I'm<00:01:01.520> probably<00:01:01.789> going<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.090> repaint

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539

do first is cut all the hair off from
the<00:01:14.000> doll<00:01:14.180> head<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.010> you<00:01:16.010> can<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.310> use

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
the doll head and you can just use

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.820 
the doll head and you can just use
scissors<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:16.939> do<00:01:17.119> that<00:01:17.299> you<00:01:17.540> know<00:01:17.830> y'all

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
scissors to do that you know y'all

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.260 
scissors to do that you know y'all
already<00:01:19.100> know<00:01:19.310> how<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.520> do<00:01:19.700> all<00:01:19.850> that

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.940 

so<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:25.450> you're<00:01:25.570> going<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.720> do<00:01:25.899> basically<00:01:26.590> is

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
so what you're going to do basically is

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.690 
so what you're going to do basically is
to<00:01:27.159> speed<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.700> process<00:01:27.729> up

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to speed the process up

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.690 
to speed the process up
you<00:01:30.700> are<00:01:30.880> going<00:01:31.299> to<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:33.040> can<00:01:33.189> do<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.490> with<00:01:33.670> a

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
you are going to you can do this with a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.830 
you are going to you can do this with a
screwdriver<00:01:34.479> as<00:01:34.840> well<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.700> I'm<00:01:37.060> going<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.659> be

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
screwdriver as well but I'm going to be

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.580 
screwdriver as well but I'm going to be
using<00:01:38.320> these<00:01:38.920> are<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:39.789> sewing<00:01:40.509> scissors<00:01:40.960> or

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
using these are like sewing scissors or

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.130 
using these are like sewing scissors or
something<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.549> tip<00:01:43.210> of<00:01:43.390> them<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.750> really

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
something and the tip of them is really

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.399 
something and the tip of them is really
dull<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.850> not<00:01:46.090> sharp<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:49.060> basically

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
dull it's not sharp so but basically

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.960 
dull it's not sharp so but basically
what<00:01:50.409> you're<00:01:50.530> going<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.679> do<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:51.130> stick<00:01:51.670> them

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
what you're going to do is stick them

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.419 
what you're going to do is stick them
inside<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.350> head<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:53.920> speeds<00:01:54.250> up

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
inside of the head and this speeds up

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.020 
inside of the head and this speeds up
the<00:01:54.610> process<00:01:55.149> very<00:01:55.720> fast<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.580> you're

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
the process very fast so you're

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.990 
the process very fast so you're
basically<00:01:58.569> going<00:01:58.959> to<00:01:59.229> you<00:02:00.100> can<00:02:00.250> see<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.520> bump

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
basically going to you can see the bump

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.779 
basically going to you can see the bump
I'm<00:02:01.240> scraping<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.170> inside<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.549> that's

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
I'm scraping the inside so that's

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.190 
I'm scraping the inside so that's
basically<00:02:04.240> what<00:02:04.420> you're<00:02:04.450> going<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.659> do<00:02:04.899> but

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
basically what you're going to do but

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.930 
basically what you're going to do but
you<00:02:05.289> do<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.619> along<00:02:05.950> where<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.159> hair<00:02:06.490> plugs

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
you do that along where the hair plugs

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.620 
you do that along where the hair plugs
are<00:02:07.209> and<00:02:07.509> that<00:02:07.630> removes<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.410> hair<00:02:08.590> quicker

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
are and that removes the hair quicker

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.150 
are and that removes the hair quicker
instead<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.720> having<00:02:11.049> to<00:02:11.230> stick<00:02:11.739> tweezers

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
instead of having to stick tweezers

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.309 
instead of having to stick tweezers
inside<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.700> head<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:12.910> pluck<00:02:13.690> out<00:02:13.900> every

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
inside the head and pluck out every

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.330 
inside the head and pluck out every
single<00:02:14.560> one<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.850> basically<00:02:16.299> we<00:02:16.660> do<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.850> scrape

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
single one so basically we do is scrape

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.690 
single one so basically we do is scrape
along<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.700> inside<00:02:22.860> where<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.010> hair<00:02:24.220> line<00:02:24.430> is

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
along the inside where the hair line is

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.810 
along the inside where the hair line is
or<00:02:25.000> where<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.239> hair<00:02:25.420> plugs<00:02:25.690> are<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.820> just

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
or where the hair plugs are and just

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.039 
or where the hair plugs are and just
scrape<00:02:29.609> and<00:02:30.609> the<00:02:30.790> scissors<00:02:31.209> are<00:02:31.480> actually

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049

pulling<00:02:32.410> out<00:02:32.709> all<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.220> hair

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.690 

see<00:02:57.410> look<00:02:57.590> at<00:02:57.740> it<00:02:57.830> pulling<00:02:58.070> all<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.550> those

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
see look at it pulling all of those

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:16.780 
see look at it pulling all of those
hairs<00:02:59.030> out

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.509 

see<00:03:17.510> I've<00:03:17.629> already<00:03:17.780> done<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.290> side<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.099> all

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
see I've already done that side and all

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.059 
see I've already done that side and all
that<00:03:19.849> is<00:03:20.060> gone

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.890 

just<00:03:25.069> scrape<00:03:25.549> some<00:03:26.030> more<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:29.599> works

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
just scrape some more and this works

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.229 
just scrape some more and this works
excellent<00:03:30.799> with<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.430> barb<00:03:31.640> with<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:32.000> newer

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
excellent with the barb with the newer

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.800 
excellent with the barb with the newer
ones<00:03:32.510> who<00:03:32.780> have<00:03:32.989> glue<00:03:33.319> inside<00:03:33.709> of<00:03:33.890> their<00:03:34.040> heads

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
ones who have glue inside of their heads

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.900 
ones who have glue inside of their heads
because<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:35.959> grabs<00:03:36.440> on<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.280> glue<00:03:37.610> and

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
because it grabs on to that glue and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:48.220 
because it grabs on to that glue and
pulls<00:03:38.299> all<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.349> old<00:03:40.099> hair<00:03:40.580> out<00:03:47.079> but<00:03:48.079> I've

pulls all of that old hair out but I've

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.860 
pulls all of that old hair out but I've
I've<00:03:48.920> heard<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.819> tweezer<00:03:50.150> technique

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
I've heard that the tweezer technique

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.369 
I've heard that the tweezer technique
takes<00:03:51.170> hours<00:03:52.720> see<00:03:53.720> some<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:54.019> them<00:03:54.170> like<00:03:54.349> that

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
takes hours see some of them like that

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.740 
takes hours see some of them like that
one<00:03:54.769> right<00:03:54.799> there<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:56.000> hair<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.269> loose<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:56.690> you

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
one right there the hair is loose so you

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:07.569 
one right there the hair is loose so you
can<00:03:56.930> pull<00:03:57.109> it<00:03:57.140> right<00:03:57.260> out<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.799> just<00:04:06.859> continue

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
can pull it right out and just continue

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.330 
can pull it right out and just continue
to<00:04:07.700> scrape<00:04:10.150> until<00:04:11.150> every<00:04:11.599> hair<00:04:12.410> is<00:04:12.680> out<00:04:12.950> of<00:04:12.980> the

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
to scrape until every hair is out of the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.430 
to scrape until every hair is out of the
head

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.500 

see<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.250> thing<00:04:18.459> is<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.850> reason<00:04:19.090> this<00:04:19.239> one's

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
see a thing is the reason this one's

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.300 
see a thing is the reason this one's
hairs<00:04:19.810> aren't<00:04:20.080> coming<00:04:20.440> out<00:04:20.560> very<00:04:20.769> good<00:04:21.070> as<00:04:21.280> I

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
hairs aren't coming out very good as I

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.160 
hairs aren't coming out very good as I
didn't<00:04:21.670> cut<00:04:21.850> them<00:04:22.060> very<00:04:22.240> short<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.020> that's

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
didn't cut them very short and that's

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.830 
didn't cut them very short and that's
one<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.650> problems<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.970> not<00:04:25.420> only<00:04:25.540> that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
one of the problems and not only that

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.780 
one of the problems and not only that
she<00:04:26.080> was<00:04:26.110> played<00:04:26.530> with<00:04:26.800> after<00:04:27.280> her<00:04:27.430> hair<00:04:27.610> was

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
she was played with after her hair was

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.760 
she was played with after her hair was
cut<00:04:28.060> off<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.240> her<00:04:28.660> hair<00:04:28.870> has<00:04:28.960> been<00:04:29.110> chopped<00:04:29.560> off

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
cut off so her hair has been chopped off

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.460 
cut off so her hair has been chopped off
for<00:04:29.830> some<00:04:30.310> time<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:31.570> some<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.960> hairs<00:04:32.170> have

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
for some time so some of the hairs have

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.850 
for some time so some of the hairs have
become<00:04:32.890> have<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:34.110> don't<00:04:35.110> know<00:04:35.290> like<00:04:35.350> fused

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
become have a I don't know like fused

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.440 
become have a I don't know like fused
together<00:04:36.310> maybe<00:04:36.880> they've<00:04:37.390> like<00:04:37.690> gotten

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
together maybe they've like gotten

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.740 
together maybe they've like gotten
frizzed<00:04:40.450> together<00:04:41.350> something<00:04:41.950> and<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:45.630> it's<00:04:46.630> a

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
frizzed together something and so it's a

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.910 
frizzed together something and so it's a
little<00:04:46.960> harder<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.500> pull<00:04:47.710> them<00:04:47.830> out<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:50.710> is

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
little harder to pull them out this is

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.720 
little harder to pull them out this is
one<00:04:51.040> of<00:04:51.130> my<00:04:51.250> older<00:04:51.700> Barbies

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.270 

yeah<00:04:57.300> you<00:04:57.420> just<00:04:57.720> continue<00:04:58.140> to<00:04:58.320> scrape<00:04:58.890> all

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
yeah you just continue to scrape all

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:08.150 
yeah you just continue to scrape all
those<00:05:00.000> hairs<00:05:00.360> out<00:05:05.840> this<00:05:06.840> one<00:05:07.140> this<00:05:07.320> also<00:05:07.530> works

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
those hairs out this one this also works

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.720 
those hairs out this one this also works
excellent<00:05:08.910> with<00:05:09.060> Monster<00:05:09.570> High<00:05:09.750> dolls<00:05:10.050> too<00:05:10.560> I

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.330 

mean<00:05:14.730> with<00:05:15.120> scissors<00:05:15.570> it's<00:05:15.870> okay<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.650> guess<00:05:17.040> if

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
mean with scissors it's okay I guess if

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.860 
mean with scissors it's okay I guess if
you<00:05:17.430> don't<00:05:17.460> really<00:05:17.850> care<00:05:18.120> about<00:05:18.210> this<00:05:18.630> because

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
you don't really care about this because

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.460 
you don't really care about this because
it<00:05:19.080> does<00:05:19.260> tend<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:19.800> mess<00:05:20.310> up<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:21.470> little

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
it does tend to mess up this a little

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.020 
it does tend to mess up this a little
bit<00:05:22.620> but<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:22.890> can<00:05:22.920> just<00:05:23.250> clean<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:23.670> up<00:05:23.700> like

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
bit but you can just clean that up like

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.060 
bit but you can just clean that up like
scrape<00:05:24.390> it<00:05:24.540> off<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:25.080> clean<00:05:25.290> it<00:05:25.320> up<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.800> sand

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
scrape it off and clean it up and sand

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.970 
scrape it off and clean it up and sand
it<00:05:26.190> down<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.870> a<00:05:27.900> screwdriver<00:05:28.410> would<00:05:28.770> work

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
it down but a screwdriver would work

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.920 
it down but a screwdriver would work
better<00:05:29.190> if<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:29.580> know<00:05:29.700> if<00:05:29.940> you<00:05:30.120> are<00:05:30.480> picky

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
better if you know if you are picky

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.870 
better if you know if you are picky
about<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:32.310> neck<00:05:34.430> but<00:05:35.430> I'm<00:05:35.550> not<00:05:35.700> really

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
about the the neck but I'm not really

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.470 
about the the neck but I'm not really
that<00:05:36.180> picky<00:05:36.600> about<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:38.520> I'm<00:05:38.940> going<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.270> use

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
that picky about it so I'm going to use

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.600 
that picky about it so I'm going to use
the<00:05:39.720> scissors<00:05:40.110> but<00:05:40.470> a<00:05:40.710> screwdriver<00:05:41.220> would

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
the scissors but a screwdriver would

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.120 
the scissors but a screwdriver would
work<00:05:41.840> better<00:05:42.840> because<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.500> doesn't<00:05:43.800> have<00:05:43.980> the

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
work better because it doesn't have the

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.360 
work better because it doesn't have the
sharp<00:05:44.460> edges<00:05:44.670> on<00:05:45.030> it<00:05:45.240> that<00:05:45.420> could<00:05:46.190> kind<00:05:47.190> of

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
sharp edges on it that could kind of

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.660 
sharp edges on it that could kind of
mess<00:05:48.240> up<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:50.990> head<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.620> neck<00:05:53.130> hole<00:05:53.400> or

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
mess up the head the neck hole or

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.540 
mess up the head the neck hole or
whatever

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.190 

and<00:05:59.110> finishing<00:06:00.110> up<00:06:00.259> here
