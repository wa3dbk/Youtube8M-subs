00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.840
 macarena pinto 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.690
 flying through the air to continue 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.940
 advancing in jumps if you can you have to 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.750
 beat federico that I love him 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.290
 ask how you saw macarena federico 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.170
 good the truth 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.699
 again it has a very good level 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.699
 in the midst of the pressure of the world 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.040
 I dedicate myself 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:17.160
 of religion from the 7.5 meters not 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.990
 I want to leave the competition did a 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.760
 bad trial according to him and me in the 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.470
 competition I saw it well as what this one 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.990
 had macarena 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.630
 pretty good because in the trial he had 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:33.530
 a difficulty of having more 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.530
 beyond the jump 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.080
 come on, daughter, I know that your little girl has not 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.830
 been fine and that's why I want to know how 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.020
 these 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.880
 in fact what they were asked to see 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.880
 what will the stress of the jump 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.709
 it is something that can be 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.490
 It's not easy because he can not find it 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.620
 what it has 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.480
 if it is stable 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.480
 it's difficult because how to count them you have to 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.310
 run you have to run to the clinic to the 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.430
 clinic to run for training there is 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.780
 stay will stay and there one sleeps 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.720
 So there are many things that 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.200
 unfortunately there is not like 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.760
 excuse in my class that the rogue but is 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.049
 is that they do not make me be 100% here 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.909
 because I have my head unfortunately 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.290
 on the other side and all my energies are 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.900
 that my daughter left as soon as possible 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.239
 and it's absolutely understandable and I'll 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.489
 we ask just to understand that 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.799
 that face this legend that says let's go 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.019
 daughter because there are many people who read your 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.250
 Chest, let's go, daughter, and wonder what it is 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.440
 what happens to the daughter of federico 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.540
 we know it but part of the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.700
 audience does not know we understand you 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.180
 moment and receives all the love of 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.180
 we
