00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 
contributors actually to this is pace
around<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.200> table<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.770> actual<00:00:35.130> pace<00:00:35.399> you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
around the table the actual pace you

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.370 
around the table the actual pace you
walk<00:00:35.820> around<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.329> table<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.899> now<00:00:37.320> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
walk around the table and now you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.830 
walk around the table and now you
actually<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:38.129> about<00:00:38.520> potting<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> balls<00:00:39.629> that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
actually go about potting the balls that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.600 
actually go about potting the balls that
are<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.020> front<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:41.430> really

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
are in front of you because really

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.330 
are in front of you because really
speaking<00:00:42.180> once<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> certain

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
speaking once you get to a certain

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.880 
speaking once you get to a certain
standard<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.180> miss<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> easy<00:00:45.629> balls<00:00:45.989> but

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
standard we all miss the easy balls but

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.700 
standard we all miss the easy balls but
the<00:00:47.190> better<00:00:47.399> players<00:00:47.910> miss<00:00:48.210> last<00:00:48.710> then

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the better players miss last then

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.439 
the better players miss last then
obviously<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.460> plays<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.000> over<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
obviously the plays be all over them and

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
obviously the plays be all over them and
this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> where<00:00:52.440> there's<00:00:52.649> consistency<00:00:53.039> factor

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this is where there's consistency factor

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
this is where there's consistency factor
comes<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.300> they're<00:00:54.629> more<00:00:54.930> consistent<00:00:55.530> at

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
comes in they they're more consistent at

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.389 
comes in they they're more consistent at
potting<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.309> simpler<00:00:57.030> balls<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.309> just<00:00:59.309> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you do it in properly and you going

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
you do it in properly and you going
through<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.340> properly<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
through it properly then you will see a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
through it properly then you will see a
massive<00:01:10.080> improvement<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.159> potting

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
massive improvement when you're potting

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
massive improvement when you're potting
the<00:01:11.760> more<00:01:12.630> simple<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.110> balls<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:16.740> was

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the more simple of balls so it was

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.929 
the more simple of balls so it was
imagined<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.369> somebody's<00:01:17.759> actually

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
imagined that somebody's actually

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.590 
imagined that somebody's actually
referring<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.990> me<00:01:19.880> obviously<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
referring for me obviously I'm here on

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.060 
referring for me obviously I'm here on
my<00:01:21.750> own<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:21.990> doing<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> clips<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.740> try<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
my own I'm doing the clips so try and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.230 
my own I'm doing the clips so try and
imagine<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.490> I've<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:23.759> somebody<00:01:23.970> who's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
imagine that I've got somebody who's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.899 
imagine that I've got somebody who's
refereeing<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.049> me<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:26.340> way<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
refereeing for me and that way then I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.420 
refereeing for me and that way then I
sort<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> explain<00:01:27.750> things<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> lot<00:01:28.200> better<00:01:28.430> so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
sort of explain things a lot better so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.920 
sort of explain things a lot better so
we'll<00:01:29.610> take<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.450> opponent's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
we'll take it now that your opponent's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.249 
we'll take it now that your opponent's
missed<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.360> after<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.720> position

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
missed and will after this position

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.960 
missed and will after this position
there's<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.040> few<00:01:35.310> balls<00:01:35.520> scattered

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there's just a few balls scattered

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
there's just a few balls scattered
around<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> block<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.630> pink<00:01:36.869> area<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
around the block in the pink area and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.499 
around the block in the pink area and
what<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> need<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.670> doing<00:01:39.000> forget<00:01:39.360> this

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
what you need to be doing forget this

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
what you need to be doing forget this
nice<00:01:39.720> pace<00:01:40.170> around<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> tables<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
nice pace around the tables just have a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.340 
nice pace around the tables just have a
nice<00:01:41.579> routine<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.840> way<00:01:43.020> you're<00:01:43.200> actually

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
nice routine in the way you're actually

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.770 
nice routine in the way you're actually
going<00:01:43.710> about<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.880> obviously<00:01:45.210> now<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> best

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
going about it so obviously now is best

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780 
going about it so obviously now is best
if<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.020> come<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> table<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
if you come to the table and one of the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
if you come to the table and one of the

nice and quick is the fact is it always

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.010 
nice and quick is the fact is it always
in<00:04:58.780> position<00:04:59.380> now<00:05:00.160> any<00:05:00.460> cruel<00:05:00.840> clean<00:05:01.840> water

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
in position now any cruel clean water
