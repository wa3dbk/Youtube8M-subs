00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.430
 Mushroom omelette 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.840
 are we are going to calculate two eggs for each 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.960
 person 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.180

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.840
 link in the description for you to learn 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.940
 to disinfect the o in the same way 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.230
 you can use the record of which you 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.360
 you prefer two teaspoons of tomato 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.120
 finely chopped a tablespoon of 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.180
 finely chopped onion black pepper 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.370
 ground ground salt 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.129
 chicken broth in shape and already 6 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.550
 what we are going to do first for this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.690
 let's use two pans to both 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.990
 we are going to light them with fire and 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.350
 let's put this as where we will 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.310
 put the egg let's put oil to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.240
 cover the bottom 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.250
 that is covered but that is not done tanaka 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.619
 simply with that cross is healed and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.810
 I swallowed key has this gold too 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.600
 we go understand you also we put you 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.430
 But here we are going to put a 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.189
 little less oil because this is going to 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.920
 be to fry mushrooms 3 and 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.259
 tomato and onion 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.619
 while the hot oil is going to 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.619
 put in a deep dish the two eggs 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.550
 in this way pepper moss 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.250
 to taste and with a wolf beater 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.170
 we are not going to mix this channel with a 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.170
 fork with what you were super 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.340
 in this way 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:41.650
 as we have it here for this I already know that 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.650
 within the countries 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.510
 We are going to do this on a low heat like 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.510
 I told you 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.210
 we put here 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.620
 and while the egg is cooking already 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.659
 we have this oil ready 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.659
 here we are going to put the onions 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.420
 we give a small mix 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.930
 quickly 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.930
 yes 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.180
 and we put the whistle hand 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.379
 but not 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.220
 old age for 20 seconds here we are going to 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.100
 add the mushrooms 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.780
 if we are going to put each of the chicken 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.780
 powder for seasoning 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.769
 it's okay 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.049
 likewise if you do not want to say 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.049
 with the chicken and you can talk 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:59.189
 point of character since we have it that way 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.299
 the mushrooms are quickly in 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.299
 we are going to pay for it 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.310
 but to give it a taste, we're going to 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.209
 check to see how it goes 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.209
 our ml 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.840
 and you're ready to approximately 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.310
 about 3 or 4 minutes to fire boat here 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.030
 very carefully and in one 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.910
 we turn them around 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.420
 and up here we're going to put what 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.420
 they prepare 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.419
 we leave it for a little while 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.930
 to be able to fold it 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.259
 mushroom 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.280
 It's not so much 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.280
 here we are going to double 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.619
 in this way 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.619
 and nothing more than America's Cup 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.180

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.240
