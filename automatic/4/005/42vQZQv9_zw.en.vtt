okay adding complex numbers subtracting
complex<00:00:04.240> numbers<00:00:04.540> not<00:00:04.900> a<00:00:04.960> big<00:00:05.170> deal

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350

multiplying complex numbers just

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.580 
multiplying complex numbers just
requires<00:00:07.360> a<00:00:07.450> little<00:00:07.540> bit<00:00:07.630> of<00:00:07.720> foiling<00:00:07.960> what

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
requires a little bit of foiling what

requires a little bit of foiling what
about<00:00:08.800> dividing<00:00:09.490> complex<00:00:10.059> numbers<00:00:10.450> well<00:00:11.230> in

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
about dividing complex numbers well in

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.680 
about dividing complex numbers well in
fact<00:00:11.530> there's<00:00:11.799> a<00:00:11.860> little<00:00:12.190> bit<00:00:12.339> of<00:00:12.519> trickery<00:00:13.360> in

fact there's a little bit of trickery in

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.270 
fact there's a little bit of trickery in
here<00:00:13.900> too<00:00:14.110> which<00:00:14.410> once<00:00:14.589> you<00:00:14.679> see<00:00:14.829> the<00:00:14.950> idea

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
here too which once you see the idea

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.920 
here too which once you see the idea
it's<00:00:15.519> not<00:00:15.610> a<00:00:15.700> big<00:00:15.910> deal<00:00:16.119> but<00:00:16.570> it<00:00:16.660> does<00:00:16.780> require

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
it's not a big deal but it does require

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.570 
it's not a big deal but it does require
something<00:00:17.350> let's<00:00:18.130> take<00:00:18.250> a<00:00:18.279> look<00:00:18.429> at<00:00:18.519> an

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
something let's take a look at an

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
something let's take a look at an
example<00:00:18.820> suppose<00:00:19.689> I<00:00:19.840> wanted<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:21.269> consider

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
example suppose I wanted to consider

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.909 
example suppose I wanted to consider
four<00:00:24.070> plus<00:00:24.519> I<00:00:24.789> and<00:00:25.179> divided<00:00:25.960> by<00:00:25.990> three<00:00:26.560> plus<00:00:26.589> 5i

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
four plus I and divided by three plus 5i

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.439 
four plus I and divided by three plus 5i
well<00:00:29.919> you<00:00:30.009> know<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.189> inspire<00:00:30.669> this<00:00:30.939> let<00:00:31.359> me

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
well you know to inspire this let me

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.810 
well you know to inspire this let me
actually<00:00:31.749> remind<00:00:32.169> you<00:00:32.439> of<00:00:32.680> what<00:00:33.160> this<00:00:33.520> really

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
actually remind you of what this really

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.790 
actually remind you of what this really
is<00:00:34.120> I<00:00:34.480> mean<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.140> have<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.289> remember<00:00:35.410> what<00:00:35.590> I<00:00:35.620> is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
is I mean you have to remember what I is

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.290 
is I mean you have to remember what I is
here<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.260> I<00:00:38.289> have<00:00:38.469> four<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.160> I'll<00:00:39.789> put<00:00:40.059> square

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
here so I have four and I'll put square

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.549 
here so I have four and I'll put square
root<00:00:40.480> of<00:00:40.570> -1<00:00:40.980> divided<00:00:41.980> by<00:00:42.070> 3<00:00:42.610> plus<00:00:43.120> 5<00:00:43.559> square

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
root of -1 divided by 3 plus 5 square

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.389 
root of -1 divided by 3 plus 5 square
root<00:00:44.800> of<00:00:44.829> -1<00:00:46.109> aha<00:00:47.140> square<00:00:47.920> roots<00:00:48.190> in<00:00:48.309> the

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
root of -1 aha square roots in the

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.459 
root of -1 aha square roots in the
bottom<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:48.879> you<00:00:48.940> may<00:00:49.480> recall<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:49.899> there<00:00:50.410> are

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
bottom and you may recall that there are

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.189 
bottom and you may recall that there are
some<00:00:51.010> prejudicial<00:00:51.699> people<00:00:52.000> in<00:00:52.570> mathematics

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
some prejudicial people in mathematics

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.229 
some prejudicial people in mathematics
just<00:00:53.859> don't<00:00:54.100> like<00:00:54.219> that<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:54.879> they<00:00:54.969> want<00:00:55.180> to

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
just don't like that so they want to

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.119 
just don't like that so they want to
rationalize<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:56.289> denominator<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.070> that

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
rationalize the denominator and that

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.209 
rationalize the denominator and that
would<00:00:57.940> actually<00:00:58.269> require<00:00:59.010> multiplying<00:01:00.010> by<00:01:00.190> a

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
would actually require multiplying by a

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.549 
would actually require multiplying by a
very<00:01:00.519> clever<00:01:00.609> choice<00:01:01.269> of<00:01:01.570> 1<00:01:01.780> in<00:01:02.050> this<00:01:02.500> case

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
very clever choice of 1 in this case

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.799 
very clever choice of 1 in this case
something<00:01:03.309> over<00:01:03.609> itself<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.690> this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
something over itself and in this

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.020 
something over itself and in this
particular<00:01:05.019> case<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.830> trick<00:01:06.070> remember<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.850> to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
particular case the trick remember is to

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.399 
particular case the trick remember is to
multiply<00:01:07.360> top<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:07.600> bottom<00:01:07.750> by<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.049> conjugate

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
multiply top and bottom by the conjugate

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.950 
multiply top and bottom by the conjugate
of<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.100> denominator<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:10.000> conjugate<00:01:10.360> is

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
of the denominator and the conjugate is

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.870 
of the denominator and the conjugate is
exact<00:01:11.259> same<00:01:11.439> thing<00:01:11.710> as<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:12.070> was<00:01:12.189> before<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
exact same thing as it was before the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.700 
exact same thing as it was before the
same<00:01:13.150> thing<00:01:13.180> as<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:13.689> number<00:01:13.900> except<00:01:14.500> this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
same thing as this number except this

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.569 
same thing as this number except this
sign<00:01:15.040> is<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.810> changed<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.310> if<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.460> multiply

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
sign is it's changed so if you multiply

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.069 
sign is it's changed so if you multiply
top<00:01:18.939> and<00:01:19.000> bottom<00:01:19.150> by<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.390> conjugate<00:01:19.630> what

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
top and bottom by the conjugate what

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.960 
top and bottom by the conjugate what
happens<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:21.130> becomes<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.850> good

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
happens is this becomes a good

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.670 
happens is this becomes a good
old-fashioned<00:01:22.509> real<00:01:22.780> number<00:01:23.110> as<00:01:23.259> we'll<00:01:23.470> see

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
old-fashioned real number as we'll see

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.410 
old-fashioned real number as we'll see
because<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.340> inner<00:01:24.490> terms<00:01:24.790> will<00:01:25.000> cancel<00:01:25.119> out

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
because the inner terms will cancel out

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.170 
because the inner terms will cancel out
so<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> trick<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:26.770> dividing<00:01:27.490> complex<00:01:27.820> numbers

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
so the trick in dividing complex numbers

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.139 
so the trick in dividing complex numbers
is<00:01:28.750> going<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.590> be<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:30.280> multiply<00:01:30.460> top<00:01:31.090> and

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
is going to be to multiply top and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.660 
is going to be to multiply top and
bottom<00:01:31.329> by<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.229> conjugate<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.979> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
bottom by the conjugate of the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.789 
bottom by the conjugate of the
denominator<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.990> how<00:01:35.110> would<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.259> look<00:01:35.530> I

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
denominator so how would that look I

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.060 
denominator so how would that look I
would<00:01:36.340> have<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.520> 3<00:01:37.240> minus<00:01:38.200> 5i

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
would have a 3 minus 5i

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.550 
would have a 3 minus 5i
that's<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.759> conjugate<00:01:40.240> at<00:01:40.329> the<00:01:40.390> bottom<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:40.840> 3

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
that's the conjugate at the bottom and 3

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.710 
that's the conjugate at the bottom and 3
minus<00:01:41.920> 5i<00:01:42.159> so<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.210> doesn't<00:01:43.420> change<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.630> value

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
minus 5i so it doesn't change the value

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.510 
minus 5i so it doesn't change the value
so<00:01:44.290> this<00:01:44.380> cancels<00:01:44.740> out<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:44.890> it's<00:01:45.070> just<00:01:45.189> 1<00:01:45.399> so

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
so this cancels out and it's just 1 so

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.370 
so this cancels out and it's just 1 so
it<00:01:45.610> doesn't<00:01:45.820> change<00:01:45.969> the<00:01:46.210> value<00:01:46.240> okay<00:01:46.960> but<00:01:47.290> now

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
it doesn't change the value okay but now

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.389 
it doesn't change the value okay but now
what<00:01:47.590> happens<00:01:47.860> when<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:47.979> multiply<00:01:48.100> this

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
what happens when I multiply this

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.910 
what happens when I multiply this
through<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.170> multiply<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.530> tops<00:01:50.740> and

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
through I have to multiply the tops and

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.440 
through I have to multiply the tops and
I<00:01:50.950> have<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.130> multiply<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.460> bottoms<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.090> this

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
I have to multiply the bottoms so this

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.520 
I have to multiply the bottoms so this
is<00:01:52.540> going<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:52.719> be<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> whole<00:01:52.960> bunch<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.170> foiling

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
is going to be a whole bunch of foiling

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530 
is going to be a whole bunch of foiling
like<00:01:53.649> we<00:01:53.740> just<00:01:53.890> talked<00:01:54.250> about<00:01:54.369> in<00:01:54.790> terms<00:01:55.329> of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
like we just talked about in terms of

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.240 
like we just talked about in terms of
multiplying<00:01:56.140> complex<00:01:56.409> numbers<00:01:56.680> so<00:01:57.100> let's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
multiplying complex numbers so let's

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.660 
multiplying complex numbers so let's
take<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.460> look<00:01:57.579> at<00:01:57.700> how<00:01:57.759> that<00:01:57.820> would<00:01:57.969> work<00:01:59.670> well

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
take a look at how that would work well

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.340 
take a look at how that would work well
I'd<00:02:00.789> have<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:01.180> 4<00:02:01.479> times<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.930> 3<00:02:02.170> which

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
I'd have the 4 times the 3 which

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.940 
I'd have the 4 times the 3 which
produces<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.799> 12<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:04.840> my<00:02:05.049> inside<00:02:05.649> term

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
produces a 12 and then my inside term

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.800 
produces a 12 and then my inside term
produces<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.579> complex<00:02:07.119> number

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
produces the complex number

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.210 
produces the complex number
3i

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
3i

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.700 
3i
you<00:02:10.180> may<00:02:10.300> start<00:02:10.600> doing<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:10.930> all<00:02:11.200> in<00:02:11.470> one<00:02:11.650> step

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
you may start doing this all in one step

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.470 
you may start doing this all in one step
but<00:02:12.130> I'm<00:02:12.250> not<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.640> right<00:02:12.730> now<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.030> then

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
but I'm not going to right now and then

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.000 
but I'm not going to right now and then
this<00:02:13.600> produces<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> outsides<00:02:14.620> produced<00:02:14.950> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
this produces the outsides produced a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.040 
this produces the outsides produced a
complex<00:02:15.340> number<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.970> minus<00:02:16.630> 20<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:19.050> then

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
complex number of minus 20 I and then

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.480 
complex number of minus 20 I and then
the<00:02:20.170> last<00:02:20.410> times<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.920> last<00:02:21.100> now<00:02:21.250> I'm<00:02:21.310> going<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
the last times the last now I'm going to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.410 
the last times the last now I'm going to
do<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.700> one<00:02:21.850> fell<00:02:22.000> swoop

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
do this in one fell swoop

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.710 
do this in one fell swoop
it<00:02:22.660> looks<00:02:22.900> like<00:02:23.080> minus<00:02:23.560> 5i<00:02:24.250> squared<00:02:24.940> but

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
it looks like minus 5i squared but

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.530 
it looks like minus 5i squared but
remember<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.230> squared<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:27.160> negative<00:02:27.190> 1<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.480> I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
remember I squared is negative 1 so I

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.170 
remember I squared is negative 1 so I
actually<00:02:28.720> see<00:02:28.960> minus<00:02:29.410> 5<00:02:29.710> times<00:02:30.550> negative<00:02:30.850> 1

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
actually see minus 5 times negative 1

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.620 
actually see minus 5 times negative 1
which<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> plus<00:02:31.750> 5<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.240> takes<00:02:34.390> care<00:02:34.510> of

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
which is a plus 5 so that takes care of

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.260 
which is a plus 5 so that takes care of
the<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.140> top<00:02:35.380> what<00:02:35.950> about<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.220> bottom<00:02:36.550> the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
the the top what about the bottom the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.440 
the the top what about the bottom the
bottom<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.710> 3<00:02:38.710> times<00:02:38.890> 3<00:02:39.130> which<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.280> 9<00:02:39.550> inside

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
bottom I see 3 times 3 which is 9 inside

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.680 
bottom I see 3 times 3 which is 9 inside
term<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.930> 15<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.460> outside<00:02:42.880> term<00:02:43.090> notice<00:02:43.540> is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
term is 15 I the outside term notice is

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.630 
term is 15 I the outside term notice is
minus<00:02:44.230> 15<00:02:44.740> I<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:46.000> 15<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.600> minus<00:02:47.290> 15<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.160> cancel

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
minus 15 I so 15 I minus 15 I the cancel

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.340 
minus 15 I so 15 I minus 15 I the cancel
that<00:02:49.120> was<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.360> whole<00:02:49.510> point<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.050> by<00:02:50.320> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
that was the whole point of this by the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.320 
that was the whole point of this by the
way<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.250> last<00:02:51.490> times<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> last<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.300> a

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
way and the last times the last is a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.650 
way and the last times the last is a
minus<00:02:52.870> 5i<00:02:53.500> squared<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:55.240> remember<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.510> squared

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
minus 5i squared but remember I squared

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.550 
minus 5i squared but remember I squared
is<00:02:56.080> negative<00:02:56.110> 1<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:57.280> see<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.550> minus<00:02:58.060> 5<00:02:58.560> times

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
is negative 1 so I see a minus 5 times

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.760 
is negative 1 so I see a minus 5 times
minus<00:02:59.830> 1<00:03:00.160> which<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.580> plus<00:03:00.850> 5<00:03:01.680> notice<00:03:02.680> the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
minus 1 which is a plus 5 notice the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.560 
minus 1 which is a plus 5 notice the
denominator<00:03:03.250> now<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> real<00:03:04.060> number<00:03:04.240> that

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
denominator now is a real number that

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.360 
denominator now is a real number that
was<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> whole<00:03:05.080> point<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:05.800> exercise<00:03:06.070> is

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
was the whole point of this exercise is

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.730 
was the whole point of this exercise is
to<00:03:06.610> divide<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.210> into<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.870> have<00:03:08.260> no<00:03:08.470> eyes

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
to divide this into it and have no eyes

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.590 
to divide this into it and have no eyes
in<00:03:09.100> here<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.700> multiply<00:03:10.090> top<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.300> bottom<00:03:10.420> by

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
in here so I multiply top and bottom by

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.190 
in here so I multiply top and bottom by
the<00:03:10.690> conjugate

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
the conjugate

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.840 
the conjugate
let's<00:03:11.770> now<00:03:11.920> reduce<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.400> little<00:03:12.520> bit<00:03:12.670> if<00:03:12.760> we

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
let's now reduce this a little bit if we

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.790 
let's now reduce this a little bit if we
can't<00:03:13.060> simplify<00:03:13.330> put<00:03:13.660> together<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.470> real

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
can't simplify put together the real

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.540 
can't simplify put together the real
parts<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.790> produce<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.410> 17<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:18.010> imaginary

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
parts that produce a 17 the imaginary

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.080 
parts that produce a 17 the imaginary
parts<00:03:18.880> minus<00:03:19.330> 20<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:19.750> plus<00:03:20.350> 3i<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:21.040> like<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.580> minus

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
parts minus 20 I plus 3i is like a minus

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.680 
parts minus 20 I plus 3i is like a minus
17<00:03:23.050> I<00:03:26.010> divided<00:03:27.010> by<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.550> then<00:03:28.060> let's<00:03:28.450> see<00:03:28.570> that

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
17 I divided by and then let's see that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.520 
17 I divided by and then let's see that
let's<00:03:28.870> make<00:03:29.020> sure<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.170> did<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.410> correctly

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
let's make sure I did it correctly

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.330 
let's make sure I did it correctly
though<00:03:29.920> let's<00:03:30.550> see<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.150> I've<00:03:31.270> got<00:03:31.450> 17<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.650> then

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
though let's see so I've got 17 and then

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.290 
though let's see so I've got 17 and then
if<00:03:33.520> I<00:03:33.640> take<00:03:35.100> 20<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:37.510> subtract<00:03:38.140> 3<00:03:39.060> let's<00:03:40.060> see

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
if I take 20 and I subtract 3 let's see

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.660 
if I take 20 and I subtract 3 let's see
what<00:03:40.510> happens<00:03:40.900> here<00:03:41.650> now<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.430> there's<00:03:42.640> a

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
what happens here now this is there's a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
what happens here now this is there's a
problem<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.000> promised<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.360> can<00:03:43.480> figure<00:03:43.600> it

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
problem is promised you can figure it

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.380 
problem is promised you can figure it

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
got to always be careful I took this

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.380 
got to always be careful I took this
times<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:57.130> talked<00:03:57.430> through<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.090> I

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
times this and I talked through it and I

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.800 
times this and I talked through it and I
said<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.709> minus<00:04:00.280> 25<00:04:00.850> times<00:04:01.300> I

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
said that this is minus 25 times I

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.020 
said that this is minus 25 times I
squared<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.140> think<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.380> said<00:04:02.530> 5<00:04:02.800> minus<00:04:03.370> 5<00:04:03.610> I

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
squared I think I said 5 minus 5 I

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.910 
squared I think I said 5 minus 5 I
forgot<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.510> multiply<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:04.870> by<00:04:05.050> this<00:04:05.110> sorry

I'm so embarrassed by this I don't want

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.690 
I'm so embarrassed by this I don't want
you<00:04:12.730> even<00:04:12.880> look<00:04:13.030> at<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:15.400> let's<00:04:15.550> just

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
you even look at this so let's just

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.400 
you even look at this so let's just
cover<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.060> up<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.180> don't<00:04:16.269> want<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.600> patch<00:04:17.140> that

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
cover it up I don't want to patch that

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.599 
cover it up I don't want to patch that
up<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.739> just<00:04:17.859> want<00:04:18.039> you<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.160> not<00:04:18.280> even<00:04:18.340> think

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
up I just want you to not even think

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.620 
up I just want you to not even think
about<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.910> because<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.090> was<00:04:19.239> wrong<00:04:19.419> it

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
about it because that was wrong it

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.950 
about it because that was wrong it
should<00:04:19.900> have<00:04:20.020> been<00:04:20.080> 5<00:04:20.350> it<00:04:20.620> should<00:04:20.650> be<00:04:21.180> 25

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
should have been 5 it should be 25

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.350 
should have been 5 it should be 25
because<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.560> this<00:04:23.860> times<00:04:24.220> this<00:04:24.520> which<00:04:25.150> is<00:04:25.330> a

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
because it's this times this which is a

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.350 
because it's this times this which is a
minus<00:04:27.449> 25<00:04:28.449> I<00:04:28.750> squared<00:04:28.780> which<00:04:29.289> is<00:04:29.620> plus<00:04:30.009> 25<00:04:30.930> boy

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
minus 25 I squared which is plus 25 boy

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.249 
minus 25 I squared which is plus 25 boy
but<00:04:34.360> it's<00:04:34.449> good<00:04:34.570> for<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.870> see<00:04:35.050> that

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
but it's good for you to see that

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.110 
but it's good for you to see that
everyone<00:04:35.620> makes<00:04:35.740> mistakes<00:04:35.889> especially<00:04:36.310> me

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
everyone makes mistakes especially me

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.610 
everyone makes mistakes especially me
especially<00:04:37.660> me<00:04:37.750> okay<00:04:37.960> anything<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.470> top

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
especially me okay anything the top

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.590 
especially me okay anything the top
though<00:04:38.770> is<00:04:38.889> fine<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.310> then<00:04:39.610> if<00:04:39.699> I<00:04:39.789> take<00:04:39.970> 9<00:04:40.240> and

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
though is fine and then if I take 9 and

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.460 
though is fine and then if I take 9 and
I<00:04:40.630> add<00:04:40.780> 25<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:42.160> get<00:04:42.520> something<00:04:42.759> like<00:04:43.060> 34<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:46.470> oh

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
I add 25 I get something like 34 and oh

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.969 
I add 25 I get something like 34 and oh
I<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.710> factor<00:04:47.979> out<00:04:48.039> a<00:04:48.070> 17<00:04:49.050> out<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.320> top<00:04:50.590> and

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
I can factor out a 17 out of the top and

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.830 
I can factor out a 17 out of the top and
I'm<00:04:51.430> left<00:04:51.639> with<00:04:51.789> 1<00:04:52.090> minus<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:54.180> divided<00:04:55.180> by<00:04:55.330> 34

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
I'm left with 1 minus I divided by 34

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.620 
I'm left with 1 minus I divided by 34
and<00:04:56.050> look<00:04:56.199> 34<00:04:56.800> I<00:04:56.830> could<00:04:57.160> cancel<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.550> 17<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.180> 34

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
and look 34 I could cancel the 17 and 34

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.800 
and look 34 I could cancel the 17 and 34
and<00:04:59.099> that<00:05:00.099> leaves<00:05:00.250> me<00:05:00.340> with<00:05:00.370> I'm<00:05:00.729> 1<00:05:01.270> minus<00:05:01.599> I

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
and that leaves me with I'm 1 minus I

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.300 
and that leaves me with I'm 1 minus I
over<00:05:02.139> 2<00:05:02.789> which<00:05:03.789> I<00:05:03.910> could<00:05:04.120> write<00:05:04.330> this<00:05:04.509> way

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
over 2 which I could write this way

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.860 
over 2 which I could write this way
some<00:05:06.310> people<00:05:06.550> like<00:05:06.699> to<00:05:06.970> write<00:05:07.509> these<00:05:07.630> things

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
some people like to write these things

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.460 
some people like to write these things
this<00:05:08.020> way<00:05:09.780> because<00:05:10.780> then<00:05:10.990> you<00:05:11.080> can<00:05:11.229> see<00:05:11.349> the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
this way because then you can see the

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.040 
this way because then you can see the
real<00:05:11.650> part<00:05:11.979> is<00:05:12.190> 1/2<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.849> the<00:05:13.330> imaginary<00:05:13.750> part

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
real part is 1/2 and the imaginary part

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.499 
real part is 1/2 and the imaginary part
is<00:05:14.169> minus<00:05:14.500> 1/2<00:05:14.650> so<00:05:15.610> you<00:05:15.669> couldn't<00:05:16.240> break<00:05:16.360> up

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
is minus 1/2 so you couldn't break up

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.659 
is minus 1/2 so you couldn't break up
that<00:05:16.539> fraction<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.229> write<00:05:17.830> that<00:05:18.009> way<00:05:18.099> ok

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
that fraction and write that way ok

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.450 
that fraction and write that way ok
let's<00:05:19.060> let's<00:05:19.449> try<00:05:19.599> the<00:05:19.660> other<00:05:19.690> one<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.400> can

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
let's let's try the other one so you can

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.670 
let's let's try the other one so you can
get<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.789> hang<00:05:22.000> of<00:05:22.120> this<00:05:22.240> in<00:05:22.479> fact<00:05:22.900> let<00:05:23.229> me<00:05:23.320> let

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
get the hang of this in fact let me let

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.750 
get the hang of this in fact let me let
me<00:05:23.710> let<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:24.009> try<00:05:24.190> this<00:05:24.250> one<00:05:28.680> 6<00:05:29.680> up<00:05:29.889> 6<00:05:30.159> plus<00:05:30.550> I

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
me let you try this one 6 up 6 plus I

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.719 
me let you try this one 6 up 6 plus I
divided<00:05:31.720> by<00:05:31.990> I<00:05:32.289> want<00:05:33.250> you<00:05:33.310> do<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.520> division

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
divided by I want you do that division

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.909 
divided by I want you do that division
see<00:05:34.539> what<00:05:34.659> you<00:05:34.720> can<00:05:34.840> get<00:05:34.960> remember<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.740> trick

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
see what you can get remember the trick

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.740 
see what you can get remember the trick
is<00:05:36.039> to<00:05:36.130> multiply<00:05:36.460> by<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.669> conjugate<00:05:36.760> wonder
