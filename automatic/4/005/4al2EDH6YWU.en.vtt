00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
doing a few changes in here

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.010 
doing a few changes in here
we<00:00:20.430> had<00:00:20.550> some<00:00:20.730> paneling<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> walls<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
we had some paneling on the walls and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.929 
we had some paneling on the walls and
the<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.769> homeowner<00:00:23.160> decided<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.670> he<00:00:23.760> didn't

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the the homeowner decided that he didn't

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.490 
the the homeowner decided that he didn't
like<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> paneling<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.840> we're<00:00:25.019> taking<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
like the paneling so we're taking that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.710 
like the paneling so we're taking that
down<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.789> did<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.180> found<00:00:27.599> that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
down and when we did that we found that

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.660 
down and when we did that we found that
the<00:00:27.840> drywall<00:00:28.260> wasn't<00:00:28.650> completed<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.490> we've

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the drywall wasn't completed so we've

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.420 
the drywall wasn't completed so we've
had<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.150> finish<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> drywall<00:00:31.099> fill<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.250> all

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

had to finish up the drywall fill in all
the<00:00:32.550> holes<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> we're<00:00:35.070> pretty<00:00:35.460> well<00:00:35.730> done

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the holes and we're pretty well done

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.970 
the holes and we're pretty well done
with<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> exception<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.770> wall

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980

there were a number of shelves up on the
walls<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:23.280> completely<00:01:24.119> removed<00:01:26.299> when

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
walls which we completely removed when

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.420 
walls which we completely removed when
we<00:01:27.450> originally<00:01:27.930> drew<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> plans<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
we originally drew up the plans this

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.450 
we originally drew up the plans this
wall<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.750> added<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> 2x4

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
wall that we added was going to be a 2x4

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.780 
wall that we added was going to be a 2x4
wall<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.659> discovered<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:35.490> needed<00:01:35.729> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
wall but we discovered that we needed a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
wall but we discovered that we needed a
3-inch<00:01:36.210> vent<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.840> our<00:01:36.990> sewer<00:01:37.229> lines<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.799> we

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
3-inch vent for our sewer lines so we

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.560 
3-inch vent for our sewer lines so we
had<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> increase<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> size<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> wall<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
had to increase the size of the wall to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.109 
had to increase the size of the wall to
a<00:01:39.600> 2x6<00:01:40.380> wall<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:41.100> order<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.640> enough<00:01:41.880> room

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
a 2x6 wall in order to have enough room

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.510 
a 2x6 wall in order to have enough room

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
to get all the plumbing in the wall now

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.399 
to get all the plumbing in the wall now
the<00:01:45.060> water<00:01:45.270> heater<00:01:45.509> has<00:01:45.720> always<00:01:45.899> been<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.290> this
