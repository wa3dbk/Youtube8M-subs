00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.559
 alain prost just arrived at overweight but it's time to 

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:07.370
 to put his suitcases for a terminal recall 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.409
 in europe the growth at 16 hours in a rather scandalous way 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.329
 what is your first reaction 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.329
 we have a sense it's a reaction of 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.369
 there was really a different way of championship land I 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.139
 wanted to lose on taking a sporting way and especially not 

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:25.999
 that way 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.849
 from the start the race 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.849
 I said I thought the loss of land 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.290
 with that was quite correct since we realize 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.130
 since a few years 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.900
 I know I did not think at all he could make a note as it's a 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.080
 so a book is of course he had lost the race of farc that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.230
 it's definitely the car was faster 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.510
 race composition but in this way there really I find that 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.160
 this face to French 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.530
 it's not only often necessary one day to see that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.130
 in addition we apply regulations 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.300
 different each time 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.580
 what this year whose places quite a lot of 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.590
 of events that 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.560
 what has never bothered us for two years I had to let some 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.010
 regards monaco gaga and his two-year-old gray coming out 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.070
 2010The Senate and signed for the sale of cars remain in the first corner 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 loose the race 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960
 so to stop it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.680
 a month before Portugal 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.790
 but the formula regulations do not really fit 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 an investment that has been merged for large teams 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.700
 on that side it was really disgusting the costs of the 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.940
 formula 1 Saturday 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.880
 accept this universe loop in the team the technical side and very 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.750
 weakened has been shown tremendously but all that is around it is becoming 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.920
 completely disgusting 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.759
 i think m for people like senna are still showing today 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.920
 their true face 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 but in a way of match we always blamed a little less true 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.909
 the way of 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.179
 jokes but in any case more expenses in a clear way 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.289
 consequent by being content I'm not embarrassed and I always said the 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.400
 truth I have always been honest there are people who watch 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.850
 I try to show outside 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.420
 it's exactly the opposite of what they are children of the same 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.189
 after and that I find that for the for sport in general for youth 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.599
 for young pilots starting for young people who are watching for 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.789
 the sport in general I think it's disgusting 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.949
 let's anticipate that our possible deliberate week maneuver 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.929
 for you did not see putting off to imagine at that time 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:20.310
 among the targets affected 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.770
 from the back so 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.890
 I had about a length of your progress in a turn that was 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.319
 who is good 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.319
 after the start in sixth for us 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.369
 the turn is launched and it is absolutely% to double from here 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.039
 and yet I did not think he would do it that way at all 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.510
 he would have done elsewhere hours there was possibly a deep doubt 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.920
 mayennais does not even reach 1% you do the replacement of the pole 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.049
 position and he had complained you would have managed pole position at 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.849
 which was written will have made your choice if you had it right from this 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.999
 rice side can not really say that 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.979
 if I'm still here since I defended well 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:01.329
 in front of the officials saying that the split proposal of the branch 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.229
 so it's not my fault it's a point finally it's a problem that dates 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.289
 for a very long time since me when I go to the beginning when I have a lot of 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:09.409
 proposals 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.659
 I had asked the pilot who does for tennis by choosing her 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.479
 opportunity to choose is a regulation that has been changed because 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.689
 that just every time I was a little right a blow to 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.189
 left depending on circumstances 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.449
 I supported a regulation 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.109
 there was no reason for us to change rules to start from 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.079
 Japan 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.199
 according to agnÃ¨s impoverishing wanted a good start with a clear lead to hers 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.319
 according to you the at the current situation 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.719
 customers will leave to the lack of reaction from the officials and to 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.569
 the one-year evocation of this incident 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.459
 is the fact that he has no sanction for the door to all the abuses 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.869
 on the track 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.890
 7 5% this year will happen things 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.439
 not really acceptable 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.459
 if a team 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.539
 ferrari will never do it because they have a respected tradition 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.309
 if a team decides to send one to one 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.609
 I am a pilot 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.559
 as to the slaughterhouse at each race to protect another driver at this 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.949
 moment everyone can do it and if there is ever any 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.949
 regulator never knows of severe penalties penalties 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.669
 at that moment, then it becomes it was for me a successor 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.389
 rethink teaching put an end to your career after this 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.789
 roxy did not do anything 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.669
 that goes way above it's got to think about caring about tax 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.229
 christophe rambour 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.360
 because once pushed out one each 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.360
 a head of state receives during the war because m 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.900
 especially that I believe the finest that machined issued yesterday when I 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.180
 second time 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.639
 it's fantastic especially will fight really worries on the sporting level 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.059
 and Friborg I was very close to 10% 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.669
 it was the people who discussed this success to be eaten also for them 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.370
 mission to dance 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.490
 bompard this way there I thought a little if the bottom tracks is the door 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.870
 open to all abuses 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.999
 if that's not good 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:56.059
 he is an expert 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.639
 25 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.729
 Saturday by a large part of his orders 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.039
 not even tell you in a general way do not make you want to 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.319
 force we crossed the mind but I was so rejected 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.029
 after a local time the respondent continues for war crimes
