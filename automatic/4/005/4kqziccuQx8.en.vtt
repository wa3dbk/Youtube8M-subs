what<00:00:01.560> you're<00:00:01.709> looking<00:00:01.979> at<00:00:02.129> here<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.520> a

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
what you're looking at here is a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.230 
what you're looking at here is a
drainage<00:00:03.600> system<00:00:04.049> that<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.890> used<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.670> walkways

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
drainage system that is used in walkways

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.310 
drainage system that is used in walkways
and<00:00:06.570> driveways<00:00:06.740> and<00:00:08.329> basically<00:00:09.329> they<00:00:09.959> should

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
and driveways and basically they should

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.159 
and driveways and basically they should
be<00:00:10.469> placed<00:00:10.740> at<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> bottom<00:00:11.249> of<00:00:11.669> a<00:00:12.179> sloping

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:13.169 
be placed at the bottom of a sloping

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.240 
be placed at the bottom of a sloping
area<00:00:14.690> sidewalk<00:00:15.690> or<00:00:15.900> walkway<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.070> can

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
area sidewalk or walkway and you can

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.150 
area sidewalk or walkway and you can
basically<00:00:17.580> see<00:00:18.330> here<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.050> drain<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.500> located

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
basically see here the drain is located

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.689 
basically see here the drain is located
at<00:00:20.339> the<00:00:20.580> bottom<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:22.619> sidewalk<00:00:23.220> probably

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
at the bottom and the sidewalk probably

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.220 
at the bottom and the sidewalk probably
has<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.330> half<00:00:24.750> inch<00:00:25.019> slope<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
has about a half inch slope in it and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.140 
has about a half inch slope in it and
most<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> water<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.249> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> drain

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
most of the water that is going to drain

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.940 
most of the water that is going to drain
from<00:00:30.509> this<00:00:30.839> area<00:00:31.349> will<00:00:32.070> drain<00:00:33.380> down<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
from this area will drain down to the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.450 
from this area will drain down to the
bottom<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.990> into<00:00:36.990> this<00:00:37.290> particular<00:00:37.680> sidewalk

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
bottom and into this particular sidewalk

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.880 
bottom and into this particular sidewalk
or<00:00:38.730> walkway<00:00:39.150> drain<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.590> drain

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
or walkway drain now if this drain

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.060 
or walkway drain now if this drain
wasn't<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:42.150> then<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.080> water<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:43.740> this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
wasn't here then the water from this

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.870 
wasn't here then the water from this
walkway<00:00:45.000> would<00:00:45.540> actually<00:00:45.960> drain<00:00:46.380> on<00:00:46.650> to<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
walkway would actually drain on to the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.260 
walkway would actually drain on to the
next<00:00:48.510> walkway<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.800> course<00:00:50.040> if<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.880> next

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
next walkway and of course if this next

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.680 
next walkway and of course if this next
walkway<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.340> gently<00:00:53.340> sloped<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.420> water

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
walkway is gently sloped this water

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.440 
walkway is gently sloped this water
could<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.080> get<00:00:55.380> trapped<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.980> pockets<00:00:56.520> so

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
could actually get trapped in pockets so

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.750 
could actually get trapped in pockets so
these<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.960> great<00:00:58.140> ideas<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.580> is<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
these are great ideas this is a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.710 
these are great ideas this is a
fantastic<00:01:00.240> idea<00:01:00.770> for<00:01:01.770> anyone<00:01:02.640> who<00:01:02.940> needs<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
fantastic idea for anyone who needs to

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.380 
fantastic idea for anyone who needs to
divert<00:01:04.140> water<00:01:04.170> away<00:01:04.680> from<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.400> sloping<00:01:05.850> area<00:01:06.210> if

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
divert water away from a sloping area if

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.980 
divert water away from a sloping area if
you<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.440> long<00:01:08.100> sloping<00:01:09.060> area<00:01:09.630> for

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
you have a long sloping area for

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.620 
you have a long sloping area for
instance<00:01:10.290> something<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.550> is<00:01:11.880> longer<00:01:12.420> than

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
instance something that is longer than

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.040 
instance something that is longer than
20<00:01:13.140> foot<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:15.150> let's<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.510> say<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.870> about

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
20 foot and let's just say it's about

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.740 
20 foot and let's just say it's about
ten<00:01:16.830> foot<00:01:17.130> wide<00:01:17.490> could<00:01:18.120> you<00:01:18.210> imagine<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
ten foot wide could you imagine the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
ten foot wide could you imagine the
water<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.620> coming<00:01:19.980> off<00:01:20.190> of<00:01:20.220> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
water that would be coming off of this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.260 
water that would be coming off of this
area<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> has<00:01:21.690> no<00:01:21.930> place<00:01:22.230> to<00:01:22.260> go<00:01:23.270> then

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
area and if it has no place to go then

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.770 
area and if it has no place to go then
you<00:01:24.420> could<00:01:24.600> end<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:24.960> quite<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.040> large<00:01:27.000> pool

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
you could end up with quite a large pool

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.530 
you could end up with quite a large pool
of<00:01:27.810> water<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.130> again<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.300> have

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
of water and again if you have

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.160 
of water and again if you have
everything<00:01:30.960> sloping<00:01:31.710> accordingly<00:01:32.310> great<00:01:33.170> but

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
everything sloping accordingly great but

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.310 
everything sloping accordingly great but
if<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> lot<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> walkways<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.479> these

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
if you have a lot of walkways and these

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.850 
if you have a lot of walkways and these
walkways<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:38.130> drain<00:01:38.760> into<00:01:39.860> concentrated

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
walkways all drain into concentrated

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
walkways all drain into concentrated
areas<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> large<00:01:42.120> patio<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:43.049> example

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
areas like a large patio for example

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.630 
areas like a large patio for example
then<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.770> could<00:01:43.950> end<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.370> lot<00:01:44.610> of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
then you could end up with a lot of

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.330 
then you could end up with a lot of
water<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.900> short<00:01:46.229> period<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.740> time<00:01:46.830> and<00:01:47.220> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
water in a short period of time and this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
water in a short period of time and this
wouldn't<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:48.060> however<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.229> have

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
wouldn't be good however if you have

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.219 
wouldn't be good however if you have
these<00:01:49.710> types<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.250> drainage<00:01:50.760> systems<00:01:51.270> spread

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
these types of drainage systems spread

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.950 
these types of drainage systems spread
out<00:01:52.409> throughout<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.970> sloping<00:01:53.970> walkways<00:01:54.690> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
out throughout the sloping walkways and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
out throughout the sloping walkways and
don't<00:01:55.530> forget<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.159> walkway

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
don't forget if you have a walkway

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.660 
don't forget if you have a walkway
that's<00:01:56.909> 50<00:01:57.750> foot<00:01:58.020> long<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.890> always<00:01:59.040> put

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that's 50 foot long you can always put

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
that's 50 foot long you can always put
two<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.780> three<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.409> these<00:02:01.860> types<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.820> drains<00:02:03.240> in

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
two or three of these types of drains in

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.089 
two or three of these types of drains in
the<00:02:04.650> walkway<00:02:05.420> equally<00:02:06.420> spaced<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.290> trap<00:02:07.830> some

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the walkway equally spaced to trap some

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.609 
the walkway equally spaced to trap some
of<00:02:08.249> the<00:02:08.369> water<00:02:08.639> to<00:02:09.479> keep<00:02:09.779> it<00:02:09.959> from<00:02:10.170> flowing

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
of the water to keep it from flowing

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.379 
of the water to keep it from flowing
down<00:02:10.799> the<00:02:10.950> rest<00:02:11.159> of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> walkway<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.060> divert

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:12.389 
down the rest of the walkway and divert

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.510 
down the rest of the walkway and divert
it<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.569> other<00:02:12.930> air

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
it to other air

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.960 
it to other air
so<00:02:13.730> again<00:02:14.630> these<00:02:15.140> types<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.920> drains<00:02:16.340> really

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
so again these types of drains really

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.060 
so again these types of drains really
work<00:02:17.600> great<00:02:19.180> for<00:02:20.180> these<00:02:20.300> types<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.720> situations

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
however this is the word I think most of

maintenance<00:02:28.820> these<00:02:29.240> drains<00:02:29.600> will<00:02:29.840> need<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.170> be

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
maintenance these drains will need to be

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.650 
maintenance these drains will need to be
cleaned<00:02:30.680> every<00:02:30.950> once<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.580> while<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:32.060> most

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
cleaned every once in a while and most

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.420 
cleaned every once in a while and most
of<00:02:32.840> them<00:02:32.960> just<00:02:32.990> have<00:02:33.350> lift-off<00:02:33.800> grates<00:02:34.160> these

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
of them just have lift-off grates these

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.460 
of them just have lift-off grates these
grates<00:02:34.730> just<00:02:35.000> lift<00:02:35.270> off<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.930> clean<00:02:36.170> them<00:02:36.350> out

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
grates just lift off you clean them out

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.450 
grates just lift off you clean them out
and<00:02:36.740> you're<00:02:36.920> done

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
and you're done

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.040 
and you're done
so<00:02:37.580> they're<00:02:37.760> relatively<00:02:38.210> easy<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.680> clean
