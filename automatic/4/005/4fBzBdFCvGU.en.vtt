Zeppelin I think it's right that's right
so<00:01:01.640> what<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:02.600> do<00:01:02.750> is<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.080> start<00:01:03.320> off<00:01:03.410> with

shuffle you take your first figure a

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.109 
shuffle you take your first figure a
third<00:01:09.380> thing<00:01:09.560> knowing<00:01:10.549> that<00:01:10.700> before<00:01:11.060> it

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
third thing knowing that before it

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.700 
third thing knowing that before it
that's<00:01:11.270> just<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.539> classic<00:01:12.049> blues<00:01:12.259> shuffle
