00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.380 
push interest you pushing bumpers I can
use<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.719> tapping<00:01:01.170> down<00:01:01.320> crowns<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.090> can<00:01:03.090> use

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
use it for tapping down crowns I can use

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
use it for tapping down crowns I can use
it<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.260> motorcycle<00:01:04.860> tanks<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.580> be

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it actually for motorcycle tanks to be

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.520 
it actually for motorcycle tanks to be
honest<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.930> using<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
honest with you I really like using that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
honest with you I really like using that
but<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> apply<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.760> lot<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.210> heat<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
but when you apply a lot of heat just to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.219 
but when you apply a lot of heat just to
fair<00:01:10.170> warned<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.700> rubber<00:01:12.689> gets<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
fair warned you then the rubber gets a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
fair warned you then the rubber gets a
little<00:01:13.380> warm<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.729> tip<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.210> bust

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
little warm and then the tip can bust

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.820 
little warm and then the tip can bust
through<00:01:15.659> easier<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.439> put<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.680> little

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
through easier so I like to put a little

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
through easier so I like to put a little
gas<00:01:16.979> tape<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> end<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.689> are

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
gas tape on the end of that if you are

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.950 
gas tape on the end of that if you are
using<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.320> tip<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.890> hot<00:01:20.580> situations

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
using that tip in hot situations

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.359 
using that tip in hot situations
basically<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.530> repairs<00:01:22.860> from<00:01:23.009> getting

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
basically a lot of repairs from getting

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.249 
basically a lot of repairs from getting
chewed<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> first<00:01:24.360> started<00:01:24.810> doing<00:01:24.960> big

one on the left is made from ol cha it's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.179 
one on the left is made from ol cha it's
much<00:01:40.829> sharper<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:42.720> would<00:01:43.590> assume<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
much sharper and it would assume that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.760 
much sharper and it would assume that
it's<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.210> more<00:01:45.960> dangerous<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I want to leave this at home in order to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.660 
I want to leave this at home in order to
create<00:01:49.079> leverage<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.649> push<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.159> open<00:01:50.460> panel

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
create leverage to push on an open panel

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.420 
create leverage to push on an open panel
like<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> hood<00:01:51.210> roof<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:52.079> trunk<00:01:52.590> you'll<00:01:53.189> need<00:01:53.399> a

like a hood roof or trunk you'll need a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.499 
like a hood roof or trunk you'll need a
chain<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.350> rubber<00:01:55.920> caps<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.090> ultra
