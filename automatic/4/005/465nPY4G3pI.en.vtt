00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello and welcome but 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.490
 a video of me 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.200
 works under the new jailbreak 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.820
 almost no winter offered him 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.040
 However , I found one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.929
 which can already see here and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.519
 the whole thing is here and now 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.100
 one or the other app like for example 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.859
 phone photos camera news and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.320
 weather even got to this round 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.550
 design adapted to this is her 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.439
 I like it then I would like you now 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.269
 Let's show you in this video very briefly how 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.140
 you installed the whole thing is natural 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.140
 the whole thing for free 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.490
 yes as I said the theme at all he has 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.440
 it already knows it's about this 10 we 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.030
 the whole installed as said for 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.790
 many, that's important, too 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.350
 Of course we have to do it for free 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.250
 Once normal in cydia 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.170
 go in and then go under search and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.110
 there must be the following input so 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.330
 first winterboard looking for winterboard 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.730
 it's the nhl for where that 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.740
 Do not know when she 's the one where that 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.810
 design ever activated under the 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.770
 new team boss works as well as 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.300
 none of them 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.700
 I think most will be then 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.290
 Now in next time come out no matter 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.520
 which he will be here now if 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.530
 you have different sources, there is 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.210
 then of course the more vehicles 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.940
 get winterboard I recommend you 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.770
 but the normal standard 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.440
 to install apps 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.880
 popular because this is also free and 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.500
 when you downloaded winterboard 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.030
 then it should be safe 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.770
 Of course, the icon does not look that way 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.869
 is so far so because I already have that 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.390
 but have charged her team down 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.640
 I need ca I hope I have it right 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.440
 pronounced so if you winterboard 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.750
 downloaded from a device must once 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.580
 But rebooting is not a problem for me 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.560
 you have the untethered jailbreak 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.280
 and then as I said just here yet 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.360
 go in and give about 1 you see 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.100
 the whole is usually 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.320
 Chargeable but I said yes 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.610
 that the whole is completely free 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.229
 simply for the reason you have 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.690
 determines any other sources 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.610
 such as internet source or xls 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.500
 quality gets the whole thing for free 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.119
 If I show you then I will show you very briefly 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.250
 I will not put it in the source 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.440
 put description because it is only one 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.730
 only source and I'll show you 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.319
 one with which I staged the whole thing 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.200
 He works with everyone 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.200
 case and that it is the kripo 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.670
 inside.com so i will get one now 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.370
 go a bit more and focus 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.990
 So that's definitely the whole thing 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.880
 if you do not work then then 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.440
 I would recommend that also so markus 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.360
 to install you get the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.300
 most things and also most 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.280
 things like that for free yes as I said 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.320
 if he has about then you can 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.030
 choose between which you do that 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.350
 I recommend as I said the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.210
 wanted to have said now said of 1 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.820
 then simply change here with me 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.800
 is the whole install once and 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.340
 then go out in winter bot 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.990
 go 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.940
 selective and now you have to 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.920
 take note of something important if you do that 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 select it works then it should be here 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.900
 so choose these different ones 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.810
 that's just springboard that act 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.090
 are these round michaels then about then 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.620
 the phones have been adjusted so far 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.120
 lockscreen for whatever reason 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.840
 The dock green is actually nothing 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.030
 different and she is silke becker board 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.620
 if you all these four 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.240
 different all where with just about 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.920
 have installed beginning then is she 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.020
 back once and then very important 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.540
 right after bringing on left reese 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.030
 go if you have done that then 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.200
 should already be your iphone 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.940
 first open 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.030
 do not be surprised at the beginning 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.260
 now comes a bit outrageous 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.820
 Answer here how you can of mine 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.190
 iphone i have set with 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.100
 a quick and then I can here 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.570
 Just lock my device once and 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.850
 You see, I have the whole thing here now 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.320
 as I said what he came up with 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.720
 For example, this is the phone 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.250
 hessel my phone app is here 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.170
 completely different and in that case too 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.520
 yours actually and that's just off 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.280
 because we still have one 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.400
 Extra small team we have with 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.990
 this victory is with this circle 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.550
 Springboard with install 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.900
 otherwise that was actually already 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.820
 everything you can do as I said 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.950
 your own now around the one or 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.240
 others are even adjusted now 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.950
 Of course, there are a few more 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.510
 others that are still adapted 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.220
 otherwise if we are the example 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.470
 phone corners not nice then finds 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.350
 you can just under winterboard and 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.480
 then the phone app exactly he is not 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.060
 of once that you kid off then do it 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.980
 back and on riesling and if you do that 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.810
 then have the phone app 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.480
 again quite normal in the round format 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.400
 just cut off signs especially and you 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.390
 start what actually but also 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.280
 already with this video 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.200
 if you liked this video or 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.160
 helped then thumb up 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.160
 do not forget 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.480
 otherwise I hope is as I said 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.950
 I liked this video and then I would 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.250
 Say goodbye to you too 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.250
 next
