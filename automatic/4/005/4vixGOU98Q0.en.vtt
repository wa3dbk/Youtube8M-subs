00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
height advantage so instead of running

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.590 
height advantage so instead of running
along<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> suggest<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.030> guys<00:01:42.270> always

yeah that is that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.070 
yeah that is that
moving<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:15.210> went<00:02:15.390> all<00:02:15.510> moving<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.930> moving

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
moving on you went all moving on moving

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.280 
moving on you went all moving on moving
on<00:02:16.320> we<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.550> sort<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.420> neat<00:02:18.630> little<00:02:18.810> line<00:02:19.110> of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
on we have a sort of neat little line of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.070 
on we have a sort of neat little line of
sight<00:02:19.500> over<00:02:19.830> here<00:02:19.980> at<00:02:20.070> sea<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> there's<00:02:21.990> not

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
sight over here at sea so there's not

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.480 
sight over here at sea so there's not
really<00:02:22.230> too<00:02:22.410> many<00:02:22.590> secrets<00:02:22.710> have<00:02:23.040> spots<00:02:23.370> you

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
really too many secrets have spots you

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.340 
really too many secrets have spots you
know<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.640> can't<00:02:23.970> really<00:02:24.120> can't<00:02:25.020> really<00:02:25.200> hide

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
know you can't really can't really hide

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.310 
know you can't really can't really hide
behind<00:02:25.530> anything<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.160> capture<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.580> flag<00:02:27.320> not

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
behind anything to capture the flag not

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.990 
behind anything to capture the flag not
even<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.560> i'm<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.190> i<00:02:29.430> guess<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.760> could<00:02:29.970> if

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
even that i'm going i guess you could if

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.580 
even that i'm going i guess you could if
you<00:02:30.120> want<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:30.990> really<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
you want to have that but really the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.960 
you want to have that but really the
only<00:02:31.650> thing<00:02:31.830> interesting<00:02:32.130> here<00:02:32.460> is<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.640> a

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
only thing interesting here is that a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270 
only thing interesting here is that a
lot<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.180> people<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.690> camp<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.560> know<00:02:34.710> that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
lot of people like to camp you know that

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.070 
lot of people like to camp you know that
little<00:02:35.310> window<00:02:36.030> right<00:02:36.300> there<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.780> over<00:02:36.930> there

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
little window right there or over there

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.340 
little window right there or over there
and<00:02:37.620> basically<00:02:38.660> one<00:02:39.660> what<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> counter<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.230> is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
and basically one what a counter it is

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.740 
and basically one what a counter it is
that<00:02:40.500> if<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.710> Marshman<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.750> marcin

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that if you have Marshman on marcin

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.990 
that if you have Marshman on marcin
basically<00:02:43.110> allows<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.520> standard

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
basically allows you to on the standard

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.480 
basically allows you to on the standard
version<00:02:45.030> allows<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:47.010> their<00:02:47.280> name

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
version allows you to have their name

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.760 
version allows you to have their name
pop<00:02:47.760> up<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:48.180> red<00:02:48.480> from<00:02:48.930> farther<00:02:49.170> away<00:02:49.200> so

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
pop up in red from farther away so

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.440 
pop up in red from farther away so
that's<00:02:49.950> really<00:02:50.160> helpful<00:02:50.460> especially<00:02:50.970> for<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that's really helpful especially for the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.780 
that's really helpful especially for the
spot<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.140> lie<00:02:53.130> down<00:02:53.160> here<00:02:53.400> they

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
spot so you can just lie down here they

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.430 
spot so you can just lie down here they
won't<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.180> able<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.420> see<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.540> at<00:02:54.750> all<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.230> you

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
won't be able to see you at all and you

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.280 
won't be able to see you at all and you
can<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.830> spray<00:02:56.130> away<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.690> window<00:02:58.140> over

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
can just spray away at the window over

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.280 
can just spray away at the window over
there<00:02:58.460> okay<00:02:59.460> so<00:02:59.790> not<00:03:00.720> too<00:03:00.870> many<00:03:00.900> guns<00:03:01.140> some

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
there okay so not too many guns some

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.570 
there okay so not too many guns some
spots<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.770> game<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.220> tell<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.550> truth

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
spots in this game to tell you the truth

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.060 
spots in this game to tell you the truth
not<00:03:03.210> too<00:03:03.360> many<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:04.020> should<00:03:04.170> capture<00:03:04.380> spots<00:03:04.770> so

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
not too many you should capture spots so

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.730 
not too many you should capture spots so
math<00:03:05.850> isn't<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.360> not<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> lot<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.290> again<00:03:07.530> um

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
math isn't a not a lot of that again um

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.620 
math isn't a not a lot of that again um
when<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:08.730> happened<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.210> can<00:03:09.330> use<00:03:09.450> this

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
when it's happened be you can use this

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.330 
when it's happened be you can use this
thing<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:10.020> both<00:03:10.170> sides<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.680> got<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:11.010> and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
thing on both sides you got that and
