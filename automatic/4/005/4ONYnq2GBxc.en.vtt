00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi everyone and notice that if 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.040
 I hope you all have very good 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.169
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.910
 video little bit particular since 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.140
 this is a video that will be short 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.490
 but it's mostly a video where I 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.840
 need you actually I'm going to you 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.430
 ask for something and I need to 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.810
 your answers 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.679
 when you saw in the title of the 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.060
 video I'm in any case less alone or 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.119
 with other people either 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.829
 maybe surely peeled fans white stainless 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 Benedict rugby even perhaps will 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.349
 that I spoke about it on the live of de 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.550
 benoît but actually what I want that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.199
 I would like to do it at the time 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.059
 I had done at the time there is a good 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.280
 already a year maybe even two years 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 I had a labyrinth on minecraft 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.059
 there were quite a few people who were 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.440
 come to test him do it most 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.670
 people were pretty much i would say between 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 half an hour and an hour to 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.969
 go out so he was pretty big enough 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.469
 balèze the thing I put a long time to 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.210
 do it and then I thought why 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.129
 do not start again then the idea this 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.620
 would be to have a server actually where he 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.519
 there are a lot of people who can come 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.949
 but what I would like to do is 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.519
 organized a contest actually with this 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.429
 labyrinth 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.719
 so I'm going to make one he'll be I'll 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.549
 am saying that I would like for those who 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.530
 have the idea of ​​how he is and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.060
 the other one I'd like to do something 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.189
 nearly five or six times bigger than 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.720
 that but with different areas all to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.220
 maybe organize a game inside 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.439
 all that and that's where I need to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.380
 your ideas actually I would like you to me 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.720
 give you ideas or suggestions a 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.630
 about there how to organize a contest 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.860
 had on minecraft with labyrinth by 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 example there may be laws 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 guèye yes even surely it is the goal I 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.969
 will try to get by 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.530
 they have lots to win stuff 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.329
 more or less important depending on the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.770
 position and give less ideas then 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.750
 I had thought of a system of zones 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.700
 in fact every time that number 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 players pass an area but the zone 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.700
 before they close and the others that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.909
 could not find the exit 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.619
 before before those already exits 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.009
 bars they can further advance in the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.229
 Vienna 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.149
 I want to have ideas 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.710
 to have some small suggestions from your 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.060
 actually part to know maybe 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.530
 something that has already been done to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.579
 United States or something like that ago 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.020
 maybe some stuff we 've already been 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.640
 does he have maybe some very good ideas 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.350
 recover or at least to change 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.820
 maybe to get something out of 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.200
 blow so I would like to have your ideas in 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.659
 the comments so do not hesitate to 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.729
 those interested on minecraft for 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.990
 so do this contest if you have any 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.610
 suggestions ideas and then that's it 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.960
 or it will be broadcast I do not know 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.550
 not yet me I'm going to start doing 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.170
 a few lives especially I think the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.690
 sunday evening not necessarily all by itself 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.000
 and everything but I'm waiting - trial 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.660
 fusion to be able to do so 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.710
 minecraft I do not know if I can - 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.140
 stream and man kraft because me my 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.520
 connection is disgusting so I'm 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.260
 very restricted in terms of play this is 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.820
 to say I can stream and that's 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.690
 lonely and the deminer started to 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.460
 it's a catastrophe 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.720
 no, but here I have already sprouted and 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.760
 you understand the trick so it's 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.280
 for that we may be going to see 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.350
 with benoît ap the fans all that or it's 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.060
 compost south and how we organize the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.320
 thing and maybe we 'll do it on the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.790
 need live with you know for 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.650
 much need he does live all 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.420
 the evenings now from monday to 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.710
 Friday for two hours on his 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.700
 switch so like that at least that 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.690
 would do something 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.940
 cool so if you have any ideas 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.220
 do not hesitate it can always be good 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.980
 now that the life of you I said 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.330
 after what I want what I wanted 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.350
 I'm going to do a little something 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.360
 that is, I'm still going 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.870
 speak this is what I spend two to all 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.570
 something else 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.910
 I will tell you about this. 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.800
 actually look at this site I received in the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.000
 faith and since the time that I have them 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.410
 refuges had still not done 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.730
 little videos of little trick 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.440
 thanks to the 4 who sent it to me 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.540
 so it's mickaël who send them 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.320
 I thank her for passing the frame kiss 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.150
 on on twitter and yeah he got me 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.120
 sent this helmet so their four docks 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.780
 vix td and you see watching I'm going 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.040
 quickly did you show I had this one 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.540
 I had this one steelseries 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.799
 but do you remember me 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.780
 you were doing me like saying that the 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.310
 microphone quality was not top top so 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.829
 precisely that's why I got 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.799
 arranged and all and he sent me that 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.750
 so that can test it and so 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.760
 this is the quality of the microphone passed 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.439
 everything and I allow myself to make him a 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.209
 little bit of advertising saying 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.739
 that this headset is really nice and it 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.480
 it's true it's true it's really 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.099
 really very nice unlike this 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.599
 that people might believe the volige 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.340
 the soukous on my head he is 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.239
 relatively light so wait for me 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.239
 go remove two on my head 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.430
 this is something quite simple 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.729
 to see you and then there you have the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.820
 case actually to mount the sound to him 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.780
 decreased here you have not heard the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.160
 end of my sentence normally it's because 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.540
 that I cut the microphone we can do 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.510
 a lot of stuff is pretty enough 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.430
 quite nice enough and then and then 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.389
 so I wanted to thank him for 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.620
 have me to have son this helmet and and 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.580
 then here I advise you so in 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.290
 anyway because I know he had 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.699
 on facebook who ask me what case this 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.780
 that I had as new helmet seen 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.940
 that they had noticed that my voice 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.889
 had changed little or everything 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.570
 case better so here I am 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.240
 allow you to recommend this helmet 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.590
 but so this video here really says 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.270
 I really want to thank you those 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.160
 who will post noah ideas for the 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.990
 minecraft thing and I tell you to very 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.800
 quickly for next videos and I 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.330
 Guaranteed that I'm waiting with 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.950
 impatience trial fusion because I have 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.120
 planned a lot of things on 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.120
 here I have to bike
