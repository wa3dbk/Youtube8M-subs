find any did it have a simple guide for
my<00:01:21.360> part<00:01:22.100> usually<00:01:23.100> got<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.510> plastic<00:01:24.510> clips

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
my part usually got these plastic clips

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
my part usually got these plastic clips

front

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:54.680

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.320 

now<00:03:37.410> these<00:03:37.590> parts<00:03:37.920> here<00:03:38.099> usually<00:03:38.400> feed<00:03:38.790> your

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
now these parts here usually feed your

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.259 
now these parts here usually feed your
back<00:03:39.480> lights<00:03:40.730> that's<00:03:41.730> what<00:03:41.910> usually<00:03:42.030> light

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
back lights that's what usually light

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.930 
back lights that's what usually light
setup<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.989> monitor<00:03:43.519> got<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.550> feeling<00:03:44.879> that

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
setup this monitor got a feeling that

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.520 
setup this monitor got a feeling that
it's<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.390> power<00:03:45.599> supply<00:03:45.810> that's<00:03:46.080> issues

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
it's just a power supply that's issues

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.990 
it's just a power supply that's issues
so<00:03:46.680> I'm<00:03:46.769> going<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:46.920> go<00:03:47.040> ahead<00:03:47.160> straight<00:03:47.760> into

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
so I'm going to go ahead straight into

00:03:48.000 --> 00:05:11.770 
so I'm going to go ahead straight into
that

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.980 

beautiful<00:05:12.780> daddies<00:05:13.139> today

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
beautiful daddies today

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:52.239 
beautiful daddies today
I<00:05:15.110> should<00:05:15.650> work<00:05:15.800> outside<00:05:16.190> more<00:05:16.370> often

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:52.249 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.719 

there<00:05:52.879> you<00:05:52.969> have<00:05:53.149> it

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.629 

now<00:05:56.729> I<00:05:56.759> can<00:05:57.030> see<00:05:57.180> straight<00:05:57.540> away<00:05:58.460> this<00:05:59.460> one

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
now I can see straight away this one

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.330 
now I can see straight away this one
here<00:05:59.820> looks<00:05:59.910> faulty

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.230 

no<00:06:05.340> one<00:06:05.460> there<00:06:05.610> feels<00:06:05.910> fun

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
no one there feels fun

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.320 
no one there feels fun
I'll<00:06:09.240> just<00:06:09.800> have<00:06:10.800> a<00:06:10.830> zoom<00:06:11.160> in<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.490> hold<00:06:11.789> on

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
I'll just have a zoom in and hold on

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.999 
I'll just have a zoom in and hold on
identify<00:06:14.330> which<00:06:14.539> which<00:06:15.139> is<00:06:15.409> scarce<00:06:15.739> fly

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
identify which which is scarce fly

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.749 
identify which which is scarce fly
stuffed

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.290 

so<00:06:23.449> this<00:06:23.599> one<00:06:23.779> here<00:06:23.990> and<00:06:24.199> this<00:06:24.379> one<00:06:24.439> here<00:06:24.860> I

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
so this one here and this one here I

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.640 
so this one here and this one here I
reckon<00:06:26.300> if<00:06:26.389> I<00:06:26.509> replace<00:06:26.870> that<00:06:26.900> I<00:06:27.169> might<00:06:27.439> have<00:06:27.620> a

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
reckon if I replace that I might have a

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.890 
reckon if I replace that I might have a
keep<00:06:27.889> up

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
keep up

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.760 
keep up
obviously<00:06:29.900> I've<00:06:29.990> got<00:06:30.080> more<00:06:30.199> screws<00:06:30.499> there<00:06:30.680> to

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
obviously I've got more screws there to

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.790 
obviously I've got more screws there to
take<00:06:30.979> out<00:06:31.159> to<00:06:31.789> get<00:06:31.939> the<00:06:32.029> job<00:06:32.210> done<00:06:32.650> but<00:06:33.650> I'll

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
take out to get the job done but I'll

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.850 
take out to get the job done but I'll
order<00:06:34.099> it<00:06:34.219> and<00:06:34.460> I'll<00:06:34.610> see<00:06:34.819> how<00:06:34.939> we<00:06:34.999> go<00:06:35.240> and

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
order it and I'll see how we go and

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.869 
order it and I'll see how we go and
that's<00:06:36.860> how<00:06:37.039> you<00:06:37.159> pull<00:06:38.150> apart<00:06:38.240> an<00:06:38.569> LCD<00:06:38.870> monitor

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:39.879 
that's how you pull apart an LCD monitor

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:43.239 
that's how you pull apart an LCD monitor
didn't<00:06:40.879> take<00:06:41.029> long<00:06:41.240> and<00:06:41.479> I've<00:06:42.050> identified<00:06:42.770> a

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:43.249 
didn't take long and I've identified a

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:48.040 
didn't take long and I've identified a
problem<00:06:43.490> which<00:06:43.789> I<00:06:43.939> think<00:06:44.150> might<00:06:44.270> fix<00:06:44.479> it<00:06:47.050> now

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
problem which I think might fix it now

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.779 
problem which I think might fix it now
as<00:06:48.110> for<00:06:48.409> the<00:06:48.469> damage<00:06:48.830> that<00:06:49.039> has<00:06:49.219> been<00:06:49.249> caused

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
as for the damage that has been caused

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:52.360 
as for the damage that has been caused
by<00:06:50.330> pulling<00:06:50.689> it<00:06:50.779> apart<00:06:50.870> I've<00:06:51.680> actually<00:06:51.860> broken

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
by pulling it apart I've actually broken

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.529 
by pulling it apart I've actually broken
a<00:06:52.639> lot<00:06:52.759> of<00:06:52.819> these<00:06:52.909> little<00:06:53.059> clips<00:06:53.360> on<00:06:53.449> the

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
a lot of these little clips on the

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.959 
a lot of these little clips on the
inside<00:06:53.870> but<00:06:54.740> what<00:06:54.949> you<00:06:55.069> have<00:06:55.219> to<00:06:55.249> realize<00:06:55.699> is

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:55.969 
inside but what you have to realize is

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:58.029 
inside but what you have to realize is
that<00:06:56.330> you<00:06:56.990> can<00:06:57.169> just<00:06:57.349> get<00:06:57.499> a<00:06:57.559> bit<00:06:57.710> of<00:06:57.830> dab<00:06:58.009> a

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
that you can just get a bit of dab a

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.610 
that you can just get a bit of dab a
