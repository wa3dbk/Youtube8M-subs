one<00:03:06.300> key<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:06.960> want<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.440> search<00:03:07.680> you

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
one key and you don't want to search you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.970 
one key and you don't want to search you
just<00:03:08.130> press<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.850> key<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.840> do<00:03:10.200> quick

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
just press the key and then you do quick

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.300 
just press the key and then you do quick
record<00:03:11.460> symbols<00:03:12.330> typing<00:03:13.110> modes<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:14.100> can

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
record symbols typing modes you can

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.250 
record symbols typing modes you can
change<00:03:14.610> everything<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.180> can<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.900> place

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
change everything you can do it place

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.460 
change everything you can do it place
play<00:03:16.830> once<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.489> times<00:03:18.450> repeat<00:03:18.900> while<00:03:19.110> pressed

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
play once and times repeat while pressed

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.640 
play once and times repeat while pressed
auto<00:03:20.370> repeat<00:03:20.820> Oh<00:03:21.030> Toto<00:03:21.720> halt

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
auto repeat Oh Toto halt

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.300 
auto repeat Oh Toto halt
so<00:03:23.220> normally<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.180> play<00:03:24.360> once<00:03:24.950> now<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.130> can

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
so normally it's play once now you can

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.370 
so normally it's play once now you can
do<00:03:26.400> play<00:03:27.300> on<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.600> key<00:03:27.780> express<00:03:28.320> down<00:03:28.590> or<00:03:28.860> up<00:03:29.160> so

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
do play on the key express down or up so

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.500 
do play on the key express down or up so
it's<00:03:31.380> not<00:03:31.800> hard<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.310> understand<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.270> also

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
it's not hard to understand so you also

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.380 
it's not hard to understand so you also
have<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> macro<00:03:34.020> key<00:03:34.350> launcher<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:35.640> not<00:03:35.970> use

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
have the macro key launcher I do not use

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.310 
have the macro key launcher I do not use
micro<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.200> only<00:03:38.130> use<00:03:38.520> this<00:03:38.910> for<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.630> letter<00:03:39.959> L

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
micro I only use this for the letter L

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.509 
micro I only use this for the letter L
and<00:03:40.590> add<00:03:41.070> s4<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:42.660> check<00:03:42.900> around<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:44.220> game

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
and add s4 to check around and a game

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.470 
and add s4 to check around and a game
and<00:03:44.880> data<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.110> if<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.519> for<00:03:47.790> example<00:03:47.820> want<00:03:48.330> to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
and data so if you for example want to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.370 
and data so if you for example want to
change<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:49.080> section<00:03:49.980> from<00:03:50.160> color<00:03:50.489> you

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
change this section from color you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.040 
change this section from color you
press<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.910> then<00:03:53.210> you<00:03:53.330> can<00:03:53.510> change<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:54.020> to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
press this and then you can change it to

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
this easiest thing you can also change

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.240 
this easiest thing you can also change
this<00:04:01.610> what<00:04:02.120> I'm<00:04:02.360> doing<00:04:02.780> there's<00:04:03.710> a<00:04:03.800> cycle<00:04:04.160> to

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
this what I'm doing there's a cycle to

through the colors for me so you go
under<00:04:06.650> effects<00:04:06.980> normally<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.550> home-study

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
under effects normally is it home-study

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.230 
under effects normally is it home-study
to<00:04:08.840> go<00:04:08.990> on<00:04:09.200> an<00:04:09.380> effect<00:04:09.830> color<00:04:10.400> shift<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:11.090> then

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
safe so it's not that hard to understand

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.170 
safe so it's not that hard to understand
and<00:04:24.130> here<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.190> have<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> conflict<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.970> all

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
and here you have the conflict of all

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.420 
and here you have the conflict of all
the<00:04:26.330> layers<00:04:26.510> you're<00:04:26.780> using<00:04:27.080> obviously<00:04:27.530> using

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
the layers you're using obviously using

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.470 
the layers you're using obviously using
layer<00:04:28.670> 2<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.240> then<00:04:31.030> then<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.150> have<00:04:32.300> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
layer 2 and then then you have the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.770 
layer 2 and then then you have the
global<00:04:33.170> illumination<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.760> like<00:04:35.570> if<00:04:35.720> you

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
global illumination this is like if you

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.740 
global illumination this is like if you
want<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.020> make<00:04:36.200> your<00:04:36.380> keyboard<00:04:36.830> dark<00:04:37.160> or

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
really light like it's really light

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.940 
really light like it's really light
because<00:04:41.390> if<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:41.930> play<00:04:42.110> in<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:42.290> dark<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.890> can

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
because if you play in the dark you can

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.700 
because if you play in the dark you can
see<00:04:43.100> your<00:04:43.550> keyboard<00:04:44.000> really<00:04:44.480> well<00:04:44.780> then<00:04:45.650> you

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
see your keyboard really well then you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.580 
see your keyboard really well then you
have<00:04:45.860> your<00:04:45.980> polling<00:04:46.370> rate<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:47.870> max<00:04:48.350> it<00:04:48.500> out

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
have your polling rate just max it out
