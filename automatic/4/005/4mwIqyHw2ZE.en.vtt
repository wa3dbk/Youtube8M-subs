00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.740
 that's enough 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.420
 the goal was to get better will come down 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.120
 I would still say goal centered 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.590
 yes yes i am very happy with this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.250
 time also because it was a time that not 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.789
 i have table about 11 years 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.030
 time has flown but I must say that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 doing so now is definitely a lot 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.990
 important and mixed 200 it is true that it arrives 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.570
 from the collegiate arrivals of the height is not 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.730
 the time to prove something but 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.720
 makes you think that in the 200 style with 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 white a certain opponent that will be him 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.280
 It will also be a World Cup will be a challenge 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.040
 yes surely she is much more sprinter 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.309
 so in short you 50 and 100 so 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.140
 he does them easily 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.510
 for me it is not so and above all in 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 this moment see that mine 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.090
 however good speed even being 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.430
 down from the mountain the other day I 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.040
 happy animals room will show itself 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.719
 again we talked about her and I can 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.250
 ask since the region had 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.469
 said a federica who must seek 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.729
 some more motivation that has them 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.709
 lost 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.539
 who served to find these and 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.310
 connect this team with this period 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.409
 to get to the world and determined 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.689
 as maybe he didn't think he could be 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.469
 but it is certainly very usual together 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.550
 I must say that the difficult moments have me 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.430
 they are always served true 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 or otherwise improve myself then grow 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.220
 I think this absolute has fallen to 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.950
 brush like 200 style if you qualify 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.350
 for the final the caress 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.180
 he promised himself that this time if me 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.900
 semi-political qualification 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.900
 I'll be there 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.440
 I asked you no questions about departure 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.180
 a little bit maybe it came out last 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.620
 of the party group maybe one 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.060
 stronger start 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.740
 well let's say i'm not really 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.760
 sprinter like all the others 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.290
 so yes 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.240
 but frankly I didn't either 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.910
 view behind so departing more or less 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.990
 that is, the less my eye was the year o 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:19.150
 all less there as a second we evaluate for 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:22.890
 I had n't noticed the good for 11 years 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.890
 so I have to say good 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.860
 an important test of the most important 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.380
 which surely will be the test anymore 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.860
 important as I have repeated many times 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.930
 are not prepared competitions have come down though 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.140
 especially to do these times falls 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.390
 so fast that I 'm really into it 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.140
 this time not suited to what 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.330
 I'm doing 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.330
 in short, it gives me very similar 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:55.500
 we have suffered so much nature so here 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.500
 we suffer less it seems a little easier 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.590
 thank you
