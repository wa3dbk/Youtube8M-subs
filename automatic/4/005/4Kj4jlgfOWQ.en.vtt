00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.119 
frosting too I just prefer to use the
chocolate<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.469> acts<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> glue<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
chocolate because it acts as a glue and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.729 
chocolate because it acts as a glue and
it<00:00:53.370> tastes<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:53.730> good<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:55.020> too

it tastes really good and it's not too

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.610 
it tastes really good and it's not too
too<00:00:56.100> sweet<00:00:56.750> okay<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.199> doing<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.590> just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
too sweet okay so what I'm doing is just

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.290 
too sweet okay so what I'm doing is just
shoving<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.000> candy<00:01:00.329> corns<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:02.300> okay

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
I found I try to do it without

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.179 
I found I try to do it without
separating<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.420> Oreo<00:01:06.750> first<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.040> was

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
definitely do it this way it works out

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
definitely do it this way it works out

the<00:03:47.990> milk<00:03:48.170> chocolate<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.860> glue<00:03:49.580> this<00:03:49.760> on<00:03:49.970> and

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
the milk chocolate to glue this on and

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.280 
the milk chocolate to glue this on and
just<00:03:51.740> a<00:03:51.860> little<00:03:52.070> dab<00:03:52.840> because<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.960> don't<00:03:54.110> want

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
just a little dab because you don't want

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.920 
just a little dab because you don't want
it<00:03:54.460> all<00:03:55.460> over<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.030> place<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.480> just<00:03:56.660> want<00:03:56.840> it

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
it all over the place you just want it

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.140 
it all over the place you just want it
to<00:03:56.960> glue<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.590> just<00:03:58.330> stick<00:03:59.330> it<00:03:59.480> there<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:02.060> when

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
to glue and just stick it there and when

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.540 
to glue and just stick it there and when
you're<00:04:02.240> doing<00:04:02.540> chocolate<00:04:02.780> try<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.260> do<00:04:03.550> what

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
you're doing chocolate try to do what

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.820 
you're doing chocolate try to do what
other<00:04:04.810> whatever<00:04:05.810> color<00:04:06.140> is<00:04:06.320> going<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.530> be<00:04:06.680> in

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
other whatever color is going to be in

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.130 
other whatever color is going to be in
the<00:04:06.920> background<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:08.180> if<00:04:08.300> I<00:04:08.420> was<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.600> use<00:04:08.840> white

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
the background so if I was to use white

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.060 
the background so if I was to use white
there's<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.470> little<00:04:09.680> bit<00:04:09.800> of<00:04:09.890> milk<00:04:10.010> chocolate

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
there's a little bit of milk chocolate

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.880 
there's a little bit of milk chocolate
pouring<00:04:10.670> out<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.880> side<00:04:11.120> here<00:04:11.410> if<00:04:12.410> I<00:04:12.590> was<00:04:12.740> to

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
pouring out the side here if I was to

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.320 
pouring out the side here if I was to
use<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.190> white<00:04:13.340> chocolate<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:14.000> would<00:04:14.120> see

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
use the white chocolate you would see

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.670 
use the white chocolate you would see
that<00:04:14.510> right<00:04:14.720> there<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.350> don't<00:04:15.530> really

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
that right there and you don't really

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.770 
that right there and you don't really
want<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.820> try<00:04:17.270> to<00:04:17.299> stick<00:04:17.570> with<00:04:17.690> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
want that so try to stick with the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.450 
want that so try to stick with the
colors<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.410> are<00:04:18.739> going<00:04:18.890> off<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.280> back

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.460 
colors that are going off in the back

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.840 
colors that are going off in the back
row

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
row

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.979 
row
okay<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:20.910> now<00:04:21.150> I'm<00:04:21.239> going<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.449> take<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.780> white

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
okay so now I'm going to take the white

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.960 
okay so now I'm going to take the white
and<00:04:22.319> I'm<00:04:22.500> just<00:04:22.680> using<00:04:22.860> regular<00:04:23.039> piping<00:04:23.789> bags

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
and I'm just using regular piping bags

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.400 
and I'm just using regular piping bags
you<00:04:24.150> can<00:04:24.300> use<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:27.240> lunch<00:04:27.509> sandwich<00:04:27.960> bags<00:04:28.199> and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
you can use the lunch sandwich bags and

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.870 
you can use the lunch sandwich bags and
just<00:04:28.560> cut<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.770> hole<00:04:28.830> in<00:04:29.069> the<00:04:29.160> bottom<00:04:29.460> those<00:04:29.669> work

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
just cut a hole in the bottom those work

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.430 
just cut a hole in the bottom those work
fine<00:04:30.150> too<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.690> just<00:04:30.720> snipped<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.199> hole<00:04:31.380> at

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
fine too and I just snipped a hole at

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.469 
fine too and I just snipped a hole at
the<00:04:31.530> bottom<00:04:31.729> you<00:04:32.729> could<00:04:32.880> probably<00:04:33.030> do<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.419> a

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
the bottom you could probably do it a

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.900 
the bottom you could probably do it a
lot<00:04:33.630> better<00:04:33.840> than<00:04:34.050> I'm<00:04:34.169> doing<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.590> but<00:04:34.910> the

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
lot better than I'm doing it but the

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.909 
lot better than I'm doing it but the
meantime<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:36.569> is<00:04:36.630> going<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.470> work<00:04:37.650> for<00:04:37.889> us

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
meantime this is going to work for us

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.400 
meantime this is going to work for us
now<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:39.410> I<00:04:40.410> found<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:40.979> between<00:04:41.789> piping<00:04:42.569> if<00:04:42.720> you

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
now and I found it between piping if you

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.080 
now and I found it between piping if you
have<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.590> heating<00:04:43.979> pad<00:04:44.160> handy<00:04:44.430> go<00:04:44.789> ahead<00:04:44.970> and

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
have a heating pad handy go ahead and

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.670 
have a heating pad handy go ahead and
stick<00:04:45.330> these<00:04:45.509> bags<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.139> heating<00:04:46.470> pad

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
stick these bags in the heating pad

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.200 
stick these bags in the heating pad
because<00:04:47.039> it<00:04:47.069> will<00:04:47.250> keep<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:49.099> warm<00:04:50.099> and<00:04:50.400> melted

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
because it will keep it warm and melted

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.400 
because it will keep it warm and melted
so<00:04:51.389> you're<00:04:51.539> able<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.810> work<00:04:51.990> with<00:04:52.199> it<00:04:52.320> because

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
so you're able to work with it because

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.330 
so you're able to work with it because
chocolate<00:04:52.860> will<00:04:53.130> dry<00:04:53.310> pretty<00:04:53.639> quickly

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
chocolate will dry pretty quickly

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.120 
chocolate will dry pretty quickly
also<00:04:56.340> keep<00:04:56.610> handy<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.120> toothpick<00:04:57.630> so<00:04:58.320> like<00:04:58.889> this

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
also keep handy a toothpick so like this

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.980 
also keep handy a toothpick so like this

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
didn't come up perfect you can always go

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.200 
didn't come up perfect you can always go
back<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:01.500> trick<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.610> out<00:05:02.669> a<00:05:02.729> little<00:05:02.970> bit

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
back in and trick it out a little bit

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.600 
back in and trick it out a little bit
and<00:05:03.479> pop<00:05:04.259> down<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.620> edges<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:05.190> make<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.430> look

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
and pop down the edges and make it look

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.870 
and pop down the edges and make it look
good<00:05:06.050> that's<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.289> for<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.710> eyeball<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.669> can

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
good that's it for the eyeball you can

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.839 
good that's it for the eyeball you can
use<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.570> milk<00:05:09.780> chocolate<00:05:09.960> or<00:05:10.410> you<00:05:10.650> can<00:05:10.949> break

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
use the milk chocolate or you can break

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.580 
use the milk chocolate or you can break
up<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.120> little<00:05:12.300> piece<00:05:12.449> of<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.659> candy<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.409> just

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
up a little piece of the candy and just

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.800 
up a little piece of the candy and just
pop<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:13.800> in<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.190> middle<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:15.389> could<00:05:15.539> do<00:05:15.659> this

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
pop that in the middle you could do this

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.990 
pop that in the middle you could do this
in<00:05:15.960> any<00:05:16.139> color<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:16.650> want<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:17.520> don't<00:05:17.699> have<00:05:17.849> to

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
in any color you want you don't have to

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.550 
in any color you want you don't have to
necessarily<00:05:18.120> do<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.020> chocolate<00:05:19.199> but

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
necessarily do it in the chocolate but

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.600 
necessarily do it in the chocolate but
that's<00:05:19.770> what<00:05:19.919> I'm<00:05:20.009> going<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.190> do<00:05:20.400> right<00:05:20.550> now

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
that's what I'm going to do right now

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.939 
that's what I'm going to do right now
and<00:05:21.479> you<00:05:21.630> can<00:05:21.810> see<00:05:21.930> it's<00:05:22.080> kind<00:05:22.380> of<00:05:22.409> lifting<00:05:22.770> up

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
and you can see it's kind of lifting up

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.010 
and you can see it's kind of lifting up
it's<00:05:23.340> not<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.520> big<00:05:23.699> deal<00:05:23.909> because<00:05:24.720> you<00:05:24.810> just

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
it's not a big deal because you just

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.899 
it's not a big deal because you just
grab<00:05:25.259> your<00:05:25.440> little<00:05:25.710> toothpick<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.490> go<00:05:26.820> in

grab your little toothpick and go in

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.370 
grab your little toothpick and go in
there<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.150> fix<00:05:27.389> it<00:05:27.509> up<00:05:27.630> how<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.930> need<00:05:28.139> it<00:05:28.169> to

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
there and fix it up how you need it to
