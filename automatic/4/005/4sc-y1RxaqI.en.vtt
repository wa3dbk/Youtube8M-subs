this is for the PS Vita so I've been AI

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.509 
this is for the PS Vita so I've been AI
in<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:06.990> game<00:00:07.109> ever<00:00:07.500> since<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.890> came<00:00:08.069> out<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
in this game ever since it came out and

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.730 
in this game ever since it came out and
seemed<00:00:09.389> like<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.780> best<00:00:10.019> choice<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.620> get

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
seemed like the best choice just to get

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.580 
seemed like the best choice just to get
the<00:00:10.860> PS<00:00:11.099> Vita<00:00:11.610> version<00:00:12.049> as<00:00:13.049> we'll<00:00:13.259> see<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the PS Vita version as we'll see on the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.079 
the PS Vita version as we'll see on the
back<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.889> think<00:00:14.099> there's<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:14.460> exclusive

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
back I think there's some exclusive

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.019 
back I think there's some exclusive
content<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.430> front<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:17.880> just

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
content for it so on the front it's just

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.870 
content for it so on the front it's just
the<00:00:18.180> artwork<00:00:18.539> artwork<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:20.130> down<00:00:20.310> down<00:00:20.640> at<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.910 
side there it's not really focusing very
well<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:35.329> looks<00:00:36.329> like<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.110> should

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
well but looks like there we go should

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.430 
well but looks like there we go should
get<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> clear<00:00:38.340> view<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> side<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
get a clear view of the side and on the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
get a clear view of the side and on the
back<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.120> would<00:00:42.270> probably<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.570> quick
