00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello there again I am Vakhrushev Ivan and you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.480
 see the windows dedicated channel and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.710
 windows phone 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.870
 Tell me, have you seen the new clip psy 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.500
 for song i last hour 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.470
 if not, I highly recommend the link 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.029
 in the description of the video and so go ahead 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.609
 most recently on his channel Sergey 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.430
 Cap talked about the application project May 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.830
 screen and crane projector it is specially 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 an application that allows 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.970
 to broadcast 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 screen your windows phone smartphone on 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.340
 windows pc 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.100
 accordingly, why does it need it 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 the application allows you to do more with 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 one side quality but maybe 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.550
 slightly less interesting app reviews 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.680
 and various innovations in the operating room 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.460
 system, I also decided to try this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.660
 option with a screen projector app and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.700
 this video will be kinda small 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.699
 experiment please accomplish your goal 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.620
 comments what style creation 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.480
 reviews on the app you like 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.309
 more when i shoot the background transport on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.430
 camera or when I will use 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 screen projector describe the reasons for and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.450
 against and let's come to some 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.250
 consensus and dwell on what 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.040
 option I would like to hear your 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.049
 opinion and so demagoguery finished now 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.470
 go to the main topic of this video 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.810
 video literally a couple of days ago me 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.119
 asked about what are the ways 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 control wi-fi traffic on smartphones 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.799
 running windows phone viewer 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
 channels needed to track which 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.140
 the application is actively climbing the network and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.180
 I consume traffic to this question honestly 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.650
 saying shoots could not answer me 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.270
 it took some amount of time 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.659
 to walk around to understand 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.939
 topic 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.390
 and I came to the conclusion that the only 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.340
 way to control cellular traffic ah wi 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.310
 file traffic at the moment on windows 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.460
 it is an embedded control application 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.580
 dan which data originally appeared 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.350
 windows phone 8 with ddr2 update 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.950
 update 2 and then actively improved 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.500
 finished further updates and 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.180
 so on any smartphone starting with windows 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.569
 phone 8 1 2 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.850
 there is this data control application you 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.260
 you can take out that at this application 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.380
 Sorry Tile 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.440
 defective 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.480
 it only has them small size and 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.880
 medium to large by drinks and not 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.790
 stretched in principle this 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.739
 Tile enough live transparent and on 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.519
 it can display information about 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.110
 the amount of traffic you have left well 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.810
 actually a little bit more 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.250
 tell about this application application 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.650
 data control intended first 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.350
 queue in order to track and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.709
 control your cell consumption 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.540
 traffic since very often and very 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.239
 many use a different kind of package 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.640
 for tariffs for example there is one gigabyte in 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.610
 for a month and so on and on 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.079
 exceeding this limit starting money 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.049
 from the account to flow away very quickly because 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.630
 ny megabytes of traffic is very 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.870
 expensive and data control decides the first 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.690
 turn 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.430
 this problem control 100 traffic he 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.380
 allows you to set different limits 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.940
 You can set a monthly limit of one-time 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.239
 either limit without restrictions 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.920
 so then you can set the report date to any 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.940
 the day of the month from which it is necessary 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.860
 start counting and 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.600
 monthly traffic limit can be set 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.930
 units of measure or megabyte or 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.269
 I have a minimum gigabyte 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.640
 value because i have tele2 traffic 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.320
 expensive network is slow and so i 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.049
 I try to limit the background transfer 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.370
 data over the cellular network in addition 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.400
 setting you can just 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.989
 limiting the background data transfer always 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.720
 you can turn off the background transfer 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.060
 data roaming and besides here 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.630
 hid setting auto 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.690
 saving 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.790
 data browser as I told 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.100
 and videos where I chose the best browser for 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.440
 windows phone internet explorer 11 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.350
 versions learned to compress traffic and 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.240
 save it accordingly and so 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.890
 in principle, there is nothing more in 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.130
 application settings data control 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.350
 the main essence of it is ask that limitka 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.010
 traffic which you have for example on 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.860
 month and application accordingly 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.920
 counts spent traffic counts days 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.290
 before the reset and as soon as you come for 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.870
 limits of sensible application to you in this 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.120
 will say this is the main function of this 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.280
 apps if you swipe left 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.020
 then you will go to the usage tab 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.510
 and just here you can 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.400
 track all applications that 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.880
 consume your traffic and you can 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.740
 track how much traffic eats up then 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.810
 or another application and you separately 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.780
 can follow the cellular network separately wai 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.110
 fay exactly here you can understand 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.740
 what program climbs the internet through 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.880
 wifi and how much does it consume traffic 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.050
 Sorry sorting ascending 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.140
 descending there is no sorting by 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.610
 the alphabet here is also not at all incomprehensible 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.100
 top how does it get here 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.580
 application as they are displayed in which 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.250
 alright but at least you are here 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.169
 can track down how much traffic 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.780
 what application eats if suddenly you have 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.360
 There will be an application that will be very 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.460
 actively consume internet traffic you 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.040
 see it you can follow it with 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.230
 using the application data control to 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.640
 sorry the possibility of anything here 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.240
 block at least now 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.280
 also not 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.850
 not available but maybe someday 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.820
 this feature will be added for now 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.740
 this option is just manually visually 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.890
 track who consume how much 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.750
 climbs the internet and why 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.350
 No unfortunately no details here. 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.169
 what period when what could be 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.780
 someday we will all see well here 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.129
 here is the data control application i 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.489
 honest about him 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.069
 I never really talked and now 

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:05.619
 fixed your flaw use 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.379
 watch see write comment 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:10.149
 ask your questions this was a story about 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.809
 how to control Wi-Fi traffic on 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:14.949
 windows phone and with you was vakhrushev ivan
