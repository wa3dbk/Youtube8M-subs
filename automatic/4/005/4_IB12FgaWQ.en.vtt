know<00:02:19.190> like<00:02:19.910> when<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.239> put<00:02:20.599> it<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.870> went<00:02:21.170> like

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
know like when I put it on I went like

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.800 
know like when I put it on I went like
this<00:02:21.500> i<00:02:21.739> might<00:02:21.950> ok<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:23.000> where<00:02:23.300> my<00:02:23.540> waist

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
this i might ok here is where my waist

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.260 
this i might ok here is where my waist
pulls<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.610> amount<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.090> i

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
pulls in and this is the amount that i

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.370 
pulls in and this is the amount that i
need<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.840> take<00:02:27.110> off<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.580> um<00:02:28.959> what<00:02:29.959> i'm<00:02:30.080> going<00:02:30.290> to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
need to take off so um what i'm going to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.479 
need to take off so um what i'm going to
do<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.650> pin<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.520> all<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.630> way<00:02:32.750> down<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.349> then<00:02:33.489> i

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
do is pin it all the way down and then i

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.080 
do is pin it all the way down and then i
see<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.390> i<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.870> cut<00:02:36.319> off<00:02:36.800> some<00:02:36.910> from<00:02:37.910> the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
see that i have to cut off some from the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.740 
see that i have to cut off some from the
sleep

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
sleep

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.900 
sleep
sleep<00:02:38.960> is<00:02:39.080> really<00:02:39.110> big<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:39.950> i'll<00:02:40.100> probably<00:02:40.340> be

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
sleep is really big so i'll probably be

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.050 
sleep is really big so i'll probably be
cutting<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.490> same<00:02:43.700> thing<00:02:43.910> on

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
cutting like this and the same thing on

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.870 
cutting like this and the same thing on
this<00:02:44.240> side<00:02:44.300> cutting<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.190> then

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
this side cutting it like this and then

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.060 
this side cutting it like this and then
when<00:02:47.090> I'm<00:02:47.210> gonna<00:02:47.570> leave<00:02:47.750> about<00:02:48.230> an<00:02:48.410> inch<00:02:48.560> seam

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
when I'm gonna leave about an inch seam

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.340 
when I'm gonna leave about an inch seam
allowance<00:02:49.100> because<00:02:49.910> when<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.570> have<00:02:50.600> things

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
allowance because when you have things

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.160 
allowance because when you have things
it's<00:02:52.040> going<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.430> get<00:02:52.610> smaller<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.630> want<00:02:54.080> to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
it's going to get smaller so you want to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.820 
it's going to get smaller so you want to
give<00:02:54.380> an<00:02:54.560> extra<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:56.110> okay<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.170> two<00:02:57.530> for

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
give an extra in okay you two for

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.130 
give an extra in okay you two for
accuracy<00:02:58.580> purposes<00:02:59.180> what<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.450> ended<00:02:59.930> up<00:03:00.080> doing

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
accuracy purposes what I ended up doing

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.140 
accuracy purposes what I ended up doing
was<00:03:00.820> measuring<00:03:01.820> um<00:03:03.370> how<00:03:04.370> much<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.730> wanted<00:03:05.000> to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
was measuring um how much I wanted to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.910 
was measuring um how much I wanted to
cut<00:03:05.360> off<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.720> make<00:03:05.930> sure<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.350> I'm<00:03:06.470> cutting

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
cut off to make sure that I'm cutting

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.340 
cut off to make sure that I'm cutting
off<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.340> same<00:03:07.610> amount<00:03:07.820> on<00:03:08.209> each<00:03:08.240> side<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.320> to

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
off the same amount on each side so to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.590 
off the same amount on each side so to
start<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.220> started<00:03:10.730> off<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.880> little<00:03:11.000> bit<00:03:11.300> bigger

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
start I started off a little bit bigger

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.260 
start I started off a little bit bigger
I'm<00:03:12.140> going<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.530> be<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.890> pinned<00:03:13.370> down<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.000> sides

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
I'm going to be I pinned down the sides

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.260 
I'm going to be I pinned down the sides
if<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.600> can<00:03:14.750> see<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.020> pins<00:03:15.320> here<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.270> that's

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
if you can see the pins here and that's

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.010 
if you can see the pins here and that's
about<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.750> two<00:03:17.959> inches<00:03:18.560> into<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.280> sleeve

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
about the two inches into the sleeve

about the two inches into the sleeve
same<00:03:21.020> thing<00:03:21.260> on<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.560> other<00:03:21.590> side<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:22.130> measure<00:03:22.670> 2

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
same thing on the other side I measure 2

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.130 
same thing on the other side I measure 2
inches<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:25.180> into<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.330> sleeve<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.810> see<00:03:27.020> the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
inches and into the sleeve you see the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.610 
inches and into the sleeve you see the
pins<00:03:27.410> here<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.270> I've<00:03:29.810> got<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.260> down<00:03:30.590> to

pins here so that I've got it down to

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.860 
pins here so that I've got it down to
the<00:03:31.010> side<00:03:31.250> that<00:03:31.520> I<00:03:31.580> need<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.030> be<00:03:32.360> just<00:03:32.390> a

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.469 
so what I'm going to do to make it clean
is<00:04:36.200> just<00:04:36.500> probably<00:04:36.740> put<00:04:37.220> some<00:04:37.430> fabric<00:04:38.120> fabric

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
is just probably put some fabric fabric

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.960 
is just probably put some fabric fabric
glue<00:04:38.990> right<00:04:39.320> there<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.460> ends<00:04:40.790> that<00:04:40.940> are

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
glue right there so the ends that are

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.310 
glue right there so the ends that are
frayed

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
frayed

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.740

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
really didn't want to cut so what I did

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.110 
really didn't want to cut so what I did
was<00:04:52.670> I<00:04:52.940> put<00:04:53.090> elastic<00:04:54.280> here<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.830> measured<00:04:57.830> it

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
already and then to make for accuracy

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.060 
already and then to make for accuracy
purposes<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:02.600> made<00:05:02.840> sure<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:04.040> was
