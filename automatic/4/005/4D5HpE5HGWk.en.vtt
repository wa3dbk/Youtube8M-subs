new one I believe I came into that once
before<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.989> think<00:03:27.319> what<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.500> end<00:03:27.650> up<00:03:27.709> doing<00:03:27.769> is

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
before I think what I end up doing is

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.000 
before I think what I end up doing is
actually<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:29.500> cutting<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.650> little

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
actually just cutting that little

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.629 
actually just cutting that little
section<00:03:31.880> out<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.359> there<00:03:33.430> flattening<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.519> know
