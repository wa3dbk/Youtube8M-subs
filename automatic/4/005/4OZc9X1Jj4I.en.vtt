00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.660
 hi everybody today i will try you 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 to show 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 my meal plan we cook three 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.240
 dishes at one time and so the first step we 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.860
 I cut the chicken and embedding to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 it was easier when it shows easier 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.930
 cook for and generally she prepares 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.930
 faster in renne 10 20 minutes 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:49.000
 here 22 kilograms and chicken further 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.149
 seasoning chicken i use sauce top 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.930
 I recommend to anyone who wants chicken 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.930
 was delicious 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:11.829
 now again 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.170
 Now I like my red pepper 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.340
 you got an island 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.340
 so we mix everything 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.340
 so add sean lok 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.740
 become 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.330
 I know it doesnâ€™t look very good 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.330
 the version will be very tasty 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.670
 then pour Moscow pan and 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.670
 we put our chicken 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.920
 cook on moderate heat about 10 12 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.920
 minutes 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.370
 but 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:34.769
 Now let's cook rice first by 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:37.909
 I look for my potatoes here 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.909
 prepared it in advance 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.810
 further cook the fish 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.159
 i use sit paw you can 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.750
 use or some other 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:54.659
 fish we put the fillet strictly in the center and 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.340
 season them with the same spices. 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.420
 which we used when 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.420
 preparing to judge 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:19.019
 we prepare it approximately 7 8 th so now 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:26.849
 almost all of our food is cooked so 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:29.549
 let's make dinners in my children i'm im 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.170
 card judgment of you and so i will 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.709
 make 2 answers 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.349
 for 12 minutes potatoes indicated 12 oz 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.349
 it's about 340 grams 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.560
 our prepared so measure its weight 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.560
 here about 10 ounces is 280 grams 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.810
 now the chicken is cooked cool so 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.810
 that let 's break it down in portions 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.640
 now let's measure chicken me this 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.860
 chickens enough for two meals cooked 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.730
 I did 10 minutes so that it is preparing 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.730
 pretty simple 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.490
 so here all the cons is about 200 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.490
 grams are laid out again 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.030
 I need you for about two or three days 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.570
 if you consider eating eggs and oatmeal 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.340
 I use the game 330 30 grams of protein 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.660
 for an ordinary person this is enough for you 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.660
 camera 5-7 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.910
 and now we spread the risk approximately by 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.240
 10 functions is 300 grams each 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.240
 portion 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.600
 I cooked beef beforehand and add 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.600
 her in potatoes 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:22.279
 This is an example of how you can easily and simply 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.279
 cook yourself and you on the whole case
