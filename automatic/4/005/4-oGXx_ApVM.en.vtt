00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.190 

hello<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:05.940> welcome<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.870> very<00:00:07.049> first

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
hello and welcome to the very first

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.140 
hello and welcome to the very first
fight<00:00:07.680> had<00:00:07.799> news<00:00:07.980> squad<00:00:08.430> builder<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.969> don't

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
fight had news squad builder we don't

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.030 
fight had news squad builder we don't
typically<00:00:09.389> do<00:00:09.630> these<00:00:09.780> because<00:00:10.139> most<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
typically do these because most of the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.919 
typically do these because most of the
time<00:00:11.250> they're<00:00:11.730> built<00:00:12.360> around<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.720> player

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
time they're built around a player

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.280 
time they're built around a player
that's<00:00:13.139> unobtainable<00:00:13.620> like<00:00:14.190> Pele<00:00:14.700> or<00:00:15.290> the

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
that's unobtainable like Pele or the

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.800 
that's unobtainable like Pele or the
overall<00:00:16.770> squad<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.220> very<00:00:17.490> very<00:00:17.759> expensive<00:00:18.000> so

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
overall squad is very very expensive so

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.819 
overall squad is very very expensive so
we<00:00:18.840> kind<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.079> thought<00:00:19.169> well<00:00:19.349> what<00:00:19.500> if<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.710> do

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:19.829 
we kind of thought well what if we do

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.310 
we kind of thought well what if we do
something<00:00:20.220> that's<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:20.579> a<00:00:20.640> bit<00:00:20.849> stupid

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
something that's just a bit stupid

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.979 
something that's just a bit stupid
that'll<00:00:22.320> work<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.149> the<00:00:24.509> fuckhead

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
that'll work so this is the fuckhead

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.260 
that'll work so this is the fuckhead
most<00:00:25.680> hated<00:00:25.950> we<00:00:26.610> takin<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.910> little<00:00:27.029> bit<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
most hated we takin a little bit of

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.060 
most hated we takin a little bit of
creative<00:00:27.660> license<00:00:28.169> with<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.739> is<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.009> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
creative license with it this is not a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.069 
creative license with it this is not a
definitive<00:00:29.430> players<00:00:30.180> with<00:00:30.450> the<00:00:30.540> most<00:00:30.570> funds

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
definitive players with the most funds

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.840 
definitive players with the most funds
down<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.590> there<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> squad<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.489> fathead

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
down and there was a squad on fathead

calm<00:00:33.180> recently<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.840> had<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:35.129> kind

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:35.429 
calm recently that had that and we kind

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:37.040 
calm recently that had that and we kind
of<00:00:35.519> thought<00:00:35.699> well<00:00:35.940> why<00:00:36.480> don't<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.719> actually

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
of thought well why don't we actually

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.240 
of thought well why don't we actually
try<00:00:37.199> and<00:00:37.289> build<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.500> squad<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.129> could

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
try and build a squad that you could

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.830 
try and build a squad that you could
play<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.609> so<00:00:39.149> we've<00:00:39.300> done<00:00:39.449> is<00:00:39.570> taken<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
play with so we've done is taken a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.939 
play with so we've done is taken a
formation<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.589> looked<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:40.890> each

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
formation and they looked at each

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.889 
formation and they looked at each
position<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.640> looks<00:00:42.089> at<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.269> players<00:00:42.510> with

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
position and looks at the players with

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.639 
position and looks at the players with
the<00:00:43.079> most<00:00:43.109> down<00:00:43.649> votes<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.910> position<00:00:45.089> and

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
the most down votes in that position and

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.270 
the most down votes in that position and
decided<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.769> we'll<00:00:46.890> try<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.190> build

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
decided that we'll try and build

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.829 
decided that we'll try and build
something<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.059> could<00:00:48.149> take<00:00:48.329> online<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
something that we could take online and

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.049 
something that we could take online and
play<00:00:48.989> some<00:00:49.170> games<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.699> we<00:00:50.760> get

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
play some games with and see how we get

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.479 
play some games with and see how we get
on<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.989> definitely<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:52.859> standard<00:00:53.070> squad

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
so that's that little experiment over

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.409 
so that's that little experiment over
we'll<00:06:00.460> do<00:06:00.580> another<00:06:00.610> one<00:06:00.970> we<00:06:01.150> think<00:06:01.360> of

we'll do another one we think of

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.510 
we'll do another one we think of
something<00:06:01.599> sufficiently<00:06:02.050> interesting<00:06:02.740> maybe

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
something sufficiently interesting maybe

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.670 
something sufficiently interesting maybe
most<00:06:04.030> liked<00:06:04.389> but<00:06:04.720> that<00:06:04.870> would<00:06:05.020> be<00:06:05.199> really

most liked but that would be really

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:08.379 
really expensive I guess I'll be honest

really expensive I guess I'll be honest
that's<00:06:08.560> been<00:06:08.740> done<00:06:08.969> fastest<00:06:09.969> strongest<00:06:10.360> way
