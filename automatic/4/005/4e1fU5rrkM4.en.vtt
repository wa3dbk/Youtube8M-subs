00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.330
 hi girls how are you in the class of 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.340
 today we are going to see how to weave circle to 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.910
 crochet 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.889
 I knitted this circle to make a sheath 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.490
 for my thermos 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.670
 I'm going to do 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.770
 a video how do I do it like I did 5 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.110
 zoom out from this video so that if 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.599
 someone you care can see and now 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.599
 let's learn how to weave a circle 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.590
 well was the circle without waves and without 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.270
 that easily shrinks and knits 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.780
 really good first 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.280
 I'm going to mount 8 chains 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.329
 I have a 2 millimeter needle and wool 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.329
 pretty thick 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:07.260
 we started by riding 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:10.370
 eight chains 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.370
 we close it 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.930
 and now we have to knit 8 lows 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 around this of this circle 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.729
 we knit 8 low points by inserting the needle 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.079
 here in the center 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.079
 I'm going to get 8 points 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.630
 4 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.890
 5 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.760
 7 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.490
 and 8 we go up one point and now in each 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.209
 point I will knit increase you want 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.450
 say that we are going to chop twice in the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.330
 same point 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.330
 weaving point down 1 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.000
 2 we take the next point we chop 2 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.000
 times 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.230
 one 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.280
 the next 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.960
 one 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.260
 2 and so we pricked twice at each point 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.379
 until the first one 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.129
 and back we hope we are increasing in 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.129
 every point 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.080
 Below this video I will leave a link 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.830
 towards my class how to weave chain and 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.430
 how to knit low point I have classes 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.430
 filmed 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.080
 and we are biting twice in each 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.900
 and point 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.450
 in the last 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.130
 we made the first round now 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.040
 we went up a point 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.480
 and let's make the first increase point 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.480
 we pricked twice 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.640
 and the next point we weave without increase 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.550
 we chop once 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.489
 then the point that follows we do 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:21.250
 with increase itching twice 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.270
 the next point without increase 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.760
 and so we weave until the end of the round 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.970
 number 3 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.510
 at a point with increase a point like that in 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.510
 increase 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.400
 one point when it increased and another point 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.400
 increase 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.300
 we are finishing lap number 3 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.569
 we go up a point and we're going to spin 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:34.479
 number four 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.479
 what do we do a point with increase 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:44.759
 we chopped twice in the same place 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.759
 and then two points without increase 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.460
 a point with increase 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.169
 two points without increase 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.110
 and so obviously until you finish this 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.840
 lap number 4 on lap number 5 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.650
 they will knit a point with three increase 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.000
 points without increases and so on 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.950
 just the description how to knit 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.010
 the circle I will leave posted on my 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.080
 page on my page on my blog link van 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.350
 to find down this video in the 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.690
 information box 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.690
 and in the end we get this circle like this 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.550
 see you in my next videos that 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.550
 are all well chao chao
