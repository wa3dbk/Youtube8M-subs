00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
minus so it's all right so I have to let
a<00:01:52.500> shorter<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.159> longer<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.820> decide

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a shorter and longer one you just decide

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.999 
a shorter and longer one you just decide
through<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.840> any<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.860> do

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
through that any of you and if you do

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.319 
through that any of you and if you do
make<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.520> longer<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> turns<00:01:57.210> out

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
make it a little longer and it turns out

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.760 
make it a little longer and it turns out
you<00:01:57.450> need<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.630> shorter<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.439> copy<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you need a shorter you can just copy and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.639 
you need a shorter you can just copy and
paste<00:01:58.920> all<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> work<00:01:59.520> onto<00:01:59.759> your<00:02:00.030> shorter<00:02:00.390> one

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
paste all the work onto your shorter one

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.950 
paste all the work onto your shorter one
ok<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.310> you'll<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.670> these<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.090> files<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.659> ok

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
ok so you'll get these two files up ok

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260 
ok so you'll get these two files up ok
now<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.829> already<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> background<00:02:05.820> on

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
now they already do have a background on

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.969 
now they already do have a background on
