quite often it's the footwork and the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.290 
quite often it's the footwork and the
movement<00:02:40.740> that's<00:02:41.100> going<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.430> cause<00:02:41.700> people

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
movement that's going to cause people

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.750 
movement that's going to cause people
the<00:02:42.660> problems<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.500> fact<00:02:43.739> from<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.580> other

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
the problems or in fact from the other

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.240 
the problems or in fact from the other
side<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> coin<00:02:45.500> elevate<00:02:46.500> your<00:02:46.650> game<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:47.220> a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
new level so hopefully that explained a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.979 
new level so hopefully that explained a
little<00:02:50.760> bit<00:02:51.000> more<00:02:51.180> about<00:02:51.360> what<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.690> tennis

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
footwork formula was about where it came

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.350 
footwork formula was about where it came
from<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.630> what<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.209> your
