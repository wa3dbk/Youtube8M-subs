a half of the two eggs the reason you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.180 
a half of the two eggs the reason you

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.729 
you might only need to add one and a
half<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.329> them<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.959> really<00:03:10.049> depends<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
half of them it really depends on the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:20.720 
half of them it really depends on the
size<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.220> your<00:03:11.250> egg<00:03:19.159> once<00:03:20.159> you've<00:03:20.340> got<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.609> to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
size of your egg once you've got it to

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.360 
size of your egg once you've got it to
that<00:03:20.760> consistency<00:03:21.739> where<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.829> will<00:03:22.950> hold<00:03:23.159> its

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
that consistency where it will hold its

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.190 
that consistency where it will hold its
shape<00:03:24.680> when<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:25.829> dropped<00:03:26.930> you've<00:03:27.930> got

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
shape when it's dropped you've got

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.449 
shape when it's dropped you've got
yourself<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.829> perfect<00:03:29.250> choux<00:03:29.669> pastry

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
yourself a perfect choux pastry

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.649 
yourself a perfect choux pastry
now<00:03:32.459> hopefully<00:03:32.639> you<00:03:32.909> would<00:03:33.060> have<00:03:33.180> preheated

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
now hopefully you would have preheated

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.530 
now hopefully you would have preheated
your<00:03:33.689> oven<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.109> 200<00:03:34.650> degrees<00:03:34.680> Celsius<00:03:35.540> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
your oven to 200 degrees Celsius the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.770 
your oven to 200 degrees Celsius the
next<00:03:36.840> thing<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.169> do<00:03:37.319> is<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:38.280> line<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.790> tray<00:03:39.419> with

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
next thing to do is to line a tray with

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.379 
next thing to do is to line a tray with
baking<00:03:39.989> paper<00:03:40.459> but<00:03:41.459> before<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:41.939> do<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.239> you

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
baking paper but before you do that you

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.089 
baking paper but before you do that you
can<00:03:42.510> either<00:03:42.629> sprinkle<00:03:43.169> water<00:03:43.319> on<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.709> or<00:03:43.889> run

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
can either sprinkle water on it or run

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.080 
can either sprinkle water on it or run
it<00:03:44.220> under<00:03:44.489> attack

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
it under attack

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.619 
it under attack
that's<00:03:45.629> what<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.049> do<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.090> leave<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
that's what I do and just leave the

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.869 
that's what I do and just leave the
droplets<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.109> water<00:03:49.169> on<00:03:49.650> there<00:03:49.889> because<00:03:50.519> that

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
droplets of water on there because that

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.300 
droplets of water on there because that
steam<00:03:51.389> is<00:03:51.419> necessary<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:52.500> your<00:03:52.590> pastry<00:03:53.190> to

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
steam is necessary for your pastry to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.670 
steam is necessary for your pastry to
turn<00:03:53.519> into<00:03:54.109> perfectly<00:03:55.109> cooked<00:03:55.349> profiteroles

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.339 

now<00:04:01.879> take<00:04:02.879> about<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.329> teaspoon<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> mixture

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
now take about a teaspoon of the mixture

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.750 
now take about a teaspoon of the mixture
at<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> time<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.659> just<00:04:06.659> place<00:04:06.900> these<00:04:07.199> on<00:04:08.129> the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
at a time and just place these on the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.259 
at a time and just place these on the
baking<00:04:09.120> paper<00:04:10.340> no<00:04:11.340> closer<00:04:11.699> than<00:04:12.030> 3

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
baking paper no closer than 3

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:20.379 
baking paper no closer than 3
centimeters<00:04:12.510> apart

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.260 

from<00:04:20.959> now<00:04:21.169> you<00:04:21.349> bake<00:04:21.650> these<00:04:21.859> in<00:04:22.129> a<00:04:22.550> preheated

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
from now you bake these in a preheated

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.439 
from now you bake these in a preheated
200<00:04:23.629> degrees<00:04:24.229> Celsius<00:04:24.439> oven<00:04:25.039> and<00:04:25.270> take<00:04:26.270> them

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
200 degrees Celsius oven and take them

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.820 
200 degrees Celsius oven and take them
out<00:04:26.569> in<00:04:26.780> roughly<00:04:27.139> 25<00:04:27.770> minutes<00:04:29.229> frost<00:04:30.229> when

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
out in roughly 25 minutes frost when

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.350 
out in roughly 25 minutes frost when
your<00:04:30.949> profiteroles<00:04:31.520> have<00:04:31.759> finished<00:04:32.120> cooking

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
your profiteroles have finished cooking

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.730 
your profiteroles have finished cooking
just<00:04:33.319> pierce<00:04:34.009> them<00:04:34.340> in<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.360> top<00:04:35.629> to<00:04:36.469> let<00:04:36.620> the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
just pierce them in the top to let the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.869 
just pierce them in the top to let the
steam<00:04:37.009> out<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.800> put<00:04:39.979> them<00:04:40.159> back<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.729> oven

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
steam out and put them back in the oven

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:45.369 
steam out and put them back in the oven
for<00:04:41.259> about<00:04:42.259> 15<00:04:42.830> minutes<00:04:43.099> to<00:04:43.460> dry<00:04:44.000> out<00:04:44.379> make

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
for about 15 minutes to dry out make

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.170 
for about 15 minutes to dry out make
sure<00:04:45.409> the<00:04:45.740> oven<00:04:45.860> is<00:04:46.069> turned<00:04:46.310> off<00:04:46.520> when<00:04:46.879> you<00:04:47.000> do

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
sure the oven is turned off when you do

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.749 
sure the oven is turned off when you do
this<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:51.680> once<00:04:51.889> your<00:04:52.039> profiteroles<00:04:52.550> are

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
this so once your profiteroles are

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.999 
this so once your profiteroles are
completely<00:04:53.360> dried<00:04:53.629> out<00:04:53.659> in<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.050> oven<00:04:54.229> just

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
completely dried out in the oven just

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.580 
completely dried out in the oven just
transfer<00:04:55.490> them<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:55.699> a<00:04:55.879> plate<00:04:56.240> until<00:04:56.590> they're

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
transfer them to a plate until they're

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.679 
transfer them to a plate until they're
cool<00:04:57.860> enough<00:04:58.219> to<00:04:58.460> fill<00:04:58.759> and<00:04:59.060> top<00:04:59.539> the
