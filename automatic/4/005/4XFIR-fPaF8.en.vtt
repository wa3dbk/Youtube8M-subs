00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
new item that has been introduced to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.880 
new item that has been introduced to
this<00:00:23.670> release<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.529> landmark

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
this release which is the landmark

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.380 
this release which is the landmark
online<00:00:26.789> marker<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:28.199> craft<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.710> from

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
online marker can craft that from

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.280 
online marker can craft that from
redstone<00:00:30.390> torch<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:32.009> piece<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> lapis<00:00:33.290> here

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
redstone torch and a piece of lapis here

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.100 
redstone torch and a piece of lapis here
we<00:00:34.350> go<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.950> marker

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
we go one marker

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.470 
we go one marker
actually<00:00:37.110> let's<00:00:37.290> get<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:38.059> couple<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
actually let's get a couple for the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.190 
actually let's get a couple for the
purpose<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.960> demonstration<00:00:40.879> do<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:43.050> how

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
purpose of demonstration do it so how

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.000 
purpose of demonstration do it so how
does<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.530> thing<00:00:43.590> work

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
does this thing work

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.869 
does this thing work
well<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.329> place<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:46.110> marker<00:00:46.890> anywhere<00:00:47.640> in

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
well I can place a marker anywhere in

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
well I can place a marker anywhere in
the<00:00:48.000> ground<00:00:49.370> like<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.469> doesn't<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.590> anything

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the ground like so doesn't do anything

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.840 
the ground like so doesn't do anything
so<00:00:53.190> far<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.930> place<00:00:55.260> another<00:00:55.890> marker<00:00:56.520> in

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so far but if I place another marker in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.270 
so far but if I place another marker in
front<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.050> they<00:00:58.199> right-click<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
front of it and they right-click on it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.959 
front of it and they right-click on it
this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> send<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.230> laser<00:01:01.640> beam<00:01:02.640> tween

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
this is going to send a laser beam tween

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.850 
this is going to send a laser beam tween
the<00:01:03.000> two<00:01:03.180> marker<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.110> allow<00:01:04.500> me<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the two marker so this allow me to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.750 
the two marker so this allow me to
define<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.430> line<00:01:05.990> what<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
define a line what I can do then is to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.560 
define a line what I can do then is to
place<00:01:09.080> another<00:01:10.080> marker<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.909> other<00:01:12.000> axis

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
place another marker and the other axis

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.590 
place another marker and the other axis
here<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.560> instance<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:15.390> I've

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
here for instance and then here I've

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.280 
here for instance and then here I've
just<00:01:16.460> defined<00:01:17.460> square<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.890> possible<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
just defined square it's possible to

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
just defined square it's possible to
define<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> three<00:01:22.770> dimensional<00:01:23.390> area<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.509> well

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
define a three dimensional area as well

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.050 
define a three dimensional area as well
if<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.860> place<00:01:26.159> another<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:28.130> right<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.549> top<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
if I place another one right on top of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.230 
if I place another one right on top of
the<00:01:30.450> others<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.560> clicking<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:32.790> I've

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the others and then clicking now I've

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
the others and then clicking now I've
got<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> nice<00:01:34.290> 3d<00:01:35.299> area<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:37.290> been<00:01:37.530> defined

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
got a nice 3d area that has been defined

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.300 
got a nice 3d area that has been defined
by<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> markers

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
by the markers

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.499 
by the markers
let's<00:01:41.310> create<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.119> things

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
let's create one of these things

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.090 
let's create one of these things
somewhere<00:01:43.290> where<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.890> some<00:01:44.159> more<00:01:44.369> space

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
somewhere where I have some more space

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.940 
somewhere where I have some more space
right<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.579> instance

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.510 

so<00:01:50.460> again<00:01:51.259> I'm<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.650> use<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.159> define

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so again I'm going to use that to define

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.600 
so again I'm going to use that to define
the<00:01:53.820> quarry<00:01:54.180> area<00:01:54.630> actually<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> quarry

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the quarry area actually for the quarry

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.190 
the quarry area actually for the quarry
I<00:01:56.970> just<00:01:57.270> needed<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.740> two-dimensional<00:01:58.740> area<00:02:00.200> in

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
I just needed a two-dimensional area in

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.710 
I just needed a two-dimensional area in
my<00:02:01.320> quarry<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.280> place<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.759> quarry<00:02:03.149> next

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
my quarry and if I place the quarry next

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.770 
my quarry and if I place the quarry next
to<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.320> guy<00:02:04.670> there's<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.360> oh

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
to one of this guy there's going to oh

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.580 
to one of this guy there's going to oh
they<00:02:07.350> find<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.799> new<00:02:07.920> RF<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> core<00:02:08.850> which<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
they find a new RF the core which is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.100 
they find a new RF the core which is
custom<00:02:10.590> shape<00:02:13.819> as<00:02:14.819> well<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.780> don't<00:02:15.930> have

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
custom shape as well I don't have

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.330 
custom shape as well I don't have
anything<00:02:16.319> anymore<00:02:17.010> -<00:02:17.580> yes<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.660> do

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
anything anymore - yes I do

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
anything anymore - yes I do
now<00:02:20.340> from<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:20.970> thing<00:02:21.410> before<00:02:23.269> it's<00:02:24.269> possible

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
now from this thing before it's possible

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:34.160 
now from this thing before it's possible
to<00:02:25.489> provide<00:02:26.489> power<00:02:27.330> either<00:02:27.870> way<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:33.690> quarry

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
to provide power either way the quarry

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:51.470 
to provide power either way the quarry
will<00:02:34.560> know<00:02:34.769> exactly<00:02:36.500> where

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.930 

because<00:02:52.200> my<00:02:52.319> small<00:02:52.560> quarry<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.849> an

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
because my small quarry so this is an

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.390 
because my small quarry so this is an
example<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.360> something<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:55.400> defining

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
example of something that is defining

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.869 
example of something that is defining
something<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.500> smaller<00:02:58.500> than<00:02:58.879> the

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
something that is smaller than the

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.500 
something that is smaller than the
chorus<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.019> maybe<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.739> going<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.129> be<00:03:02.970> faster

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
chorus I so maybe is going to be faster

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.979 
chorus I so maybe is going to be faster
faster<00:03:04.170> or<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.530> ground<00:03:04.800> which<00:03:05.400> is

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
faster or to the ground which is

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.630 
faster or to the ground which is
something<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.260> some<00:03:07.980> people<00:03:08.010> may<00:03:08.580> be

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
something that some people may be

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.790 
something that some people may be
interested<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.630> possible<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.140> use<00:03:10.620> this

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
interested in it is possible to use this

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.370 
interested in it is possible to use this
thing<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.099> define<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.880> gigantic<00:03:12.360> area<00:03:12.989> as<00:03:13.080> well

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
thing to define a gigantic area as well

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.570 
thing to define a gigantic area as well
how<00:03:14.340> big<00:03:14.670> can<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.239> area<00:03:15.720> be<00:03:16.019> well<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.430> know

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
how big can this area be well you know

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.780 
how big can this area be well you know
that<00:03:17.910> what's<00:03:18.330> useful<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> use<00:03:19.790> second

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
that what's useful is to use second

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.500 
that what's useful is to use second
feature<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.989> marker<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.880> place<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.060> marker

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
feature of the marker I place the marker

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.100 
feature of the marker I place the marker
on<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.870> ground<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:26.269> power<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.599> then<00:03:27.989> it

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
on the ground and if I power it then it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.280 
on the ground and if I power it then it
creates<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.970> blue<00:03:29.970> laser<00:03:30.299> which<00:03:30.900> are

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
creates this blue laser which are

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.970 
creates this blue laser which are
basically<00:03:32.099> showing<00:03:32.610> how<00:03:33.060> far<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.650> place

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
basically showing how far can I place

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.069 
basically showing how far can I place
the<00:03:35.610> marker<00:03:36.060> next<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.540> on<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.780> which

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
the marker next to it on it which

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.330 
the marker next to it on it which
direction<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:39.239> here<00:03:39.599> for<00:03:39.780> example<00:03:40.130> let's<00:03:41.130> say

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
direction so here for example let's say

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.440 
direction so here for example let's say
I'm<00:03:41.430> going<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.610> place<00:03:41.849> another<00:03:42.120> marker<00:03:42.840> here

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
I'm going to place another marker here

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.960 
I'm going to place another marker here
or<00:03:45.450> maybe<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.989> little<00:03:46.230> bit<00:03:46.440> further<00:03:46.849> first<00:03:47.849> of

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
or maybe a little bit further first of

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.479 
or maybe a little bit further first of
all<00:03:48.060> as<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.540> see<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.780> goes<00:03:48.930> through

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
all as you can see it goes through

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.750 
all as you can see it goes through
blocks<00:03:53.239> there<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:54.840> came<00:03:55.110> pretty<00:03:55.380> far<00:03:55.760> if

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
blocks there so this came pretty far if

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.390 
blocks there so this came pretty far if
I<00:03:57.000> place<00:03:57.389> a<00:03:57.420> block<00:03:57.810> here<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.829> activate

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
I place a block here and if I activate

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.190 
I place a block here and if I activate
it<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.840> going<00:04:01.139> to<00:04:01.579> create<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.850> actual<00:04:03.200> red

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
it it's going to create the actual red

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.430 
it it's going to create the actual red
laser<00:04:04.680> mark<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.450> go<00:04:06.450> back<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.319> initial

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
laser mark I go back to the initial

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.270 
laser mark I go back to the initial
place<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.260> can<00:04:10.410> see<00:04:10.590> there<00:04:10.739> is<00:04:10.829> no<00:04:11.010> more

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
place and you can see there is no more

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.360 
place and you can see there is no more
laser<00:04:11.940> on<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.750> axis<00:04:13.170> because<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.799> direction

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
laser on this axis because a direction

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.699 
laser on this axis because a direction
has<00:04:14.489> been<00:04:14.639> set<00:04:14.940> if<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.900> remove<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.350> source<00:04:16.590> of

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
has been set if I remove the source of

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.909 
has been set if I remove the source of
power<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.430> blue<00:04:17.639> laser<00:04:18.169> disappears<00:04:19.169> so

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
power of the blue laser disappears so

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.000 
power of the blue laser disappears so
this<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.579> come<00:04:21.030> very<00:04:21.209> handy<00:04:21.510> when<00:04:22.169> I'm

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
this this can come very handy when I'm

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.779 
this this can come very handy when I'm
going<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.490> define<00:04:24.090> each<00:04:24.510> areas<00:04:25.789> through

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
going to define each areas through

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.870 
going to define each areas through
markers<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.350> certainly<00:04:28.830> what's<00:04:29.220> what

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
markers this is certainly what's what

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.440 
markers this is certainly what's what
has<00:04:30.000> been<00:04:30.150> used<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:31.050> define<00:04:31.410> this<00:04:32.090> big<00:04:33.090> thing

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
has been used to define this big thing

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.210 
has been used to define this big thing
over<00:04:33.539> there<00:04:33.889> anyway<00:04:34.919> Oh

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220

bridges<00:07:08.620> may<00:07:08.830> be<00:07:08.890> whatever<00:07:09.990> you<00:07:10.990> feel<00:07:11.170> like

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:18.719 

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:23.409 

and<00:07:19.319> it's<00:07:19.709> all<00:07:19.919> kind<00:07:20.219> of<00:07:20.249> systems<00:07:20.699> with<00:07:20.879> that

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:23.419 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:27.589 

for<00:07:24.419> example<00:07:24.719> here<00:07:25.399> I've<00:07:26.399> created<00:07:26.909> a<00:07:27.389> huge

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 
for example here I've created a huge

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.729 
for example here I've created a huge
area<00:07:28.399> with<00:07:29.399> the<00:07:29.639> filler<00:07:30.599> over<00:07:30.779> here<00:07:31.289> and<00:07:31.499> the

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:31.739 
area with the filler over here and the

00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:35.299 
area with the filler over here and the
purpose<00:07:32.159> is<00:07:32.309> to<00:07:32.339> create<00:07:33.029> a<00:07:33.199> large<00:07:34.199> platform<00:07:34.589> of

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:35.309 
purpose is to create a large platform of

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:38.600 
purpose is to create a large platform of
cobblestone<00:07:36.299> under<00:07:37.019> the<00:07:37.079> system<00:07:37.349> pipe<00:07:38.129> system

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610 
cobblestone under the system pipe system

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.249 
cobblestone under the system pipe system
that's<00:07:38.879> getting<00:07:39.239> things<00:07:39.539> from<00:07:39.809> the<00:07:40.079> rock

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 
that's getting things from the rock

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:43.969 
that's getting things from the rock
quarry<00:07:40.499> over<00:07:40.769> there<00:07:41.419> sending<00:07:42.979> cobblestone

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:43.979 
quarry over there sending cobblestone

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:50.059 
quarry over there sending cobblestone
here<00:07:45.259> to<00:07:46.519> create<00:07:47.519> the<00:07:47.610> system<00:07:48.199> so<00:07:49.199> you<00:07:49.619> can<00:07:49.649> see

00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:50.069 
here to create the system so you can see

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.809 
here to create the system so you can see
but<00:07:50.249> that's<00:07:50.429> the<00:07:50.579> intent<00:07:50.909> anyway<00:07:51.239> so<00:07:52.669> that<00:07:53.669> was

00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 
but that's the intent anyway so that was

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:58.879 
but that's the intent anyway so that was
it<00:07:53.969> was<00:07:54.719> the<00:07:55.610> last<00:07:56.959> enhancement<00:07:57.959> the<00:07:58.439> last<00:07:58.769> new

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:58.889 
it was the last enhancement the last new

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:02.389 
it was the last enhancement the last new
features<00:07:59.309> of<00:07:59.550> this<00:08:00.050> latest<00:08:01.050> bit<00:08:01.949> were<00:08:02.099> fleas

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:02.399 
features of this latest bit were fleas

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.489 
features of this latest bit were fleas
there's<00:08:02.909> more<00:08:03.329> to<00:08:03.479> come<00:08:03.749> there<00:08:04.199> is<00:08:04.259> more

there's more to come there is more

00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:06.379 
there's more to come there is more
advanced<00:08:04.919> building<00:08:05.159> mechanism<00:08:05.939> that<00:08:06.149> are
