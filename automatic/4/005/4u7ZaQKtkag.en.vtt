that on the menu it says that it's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.110 
that on the menu it says that it's
chilled<00:00:43.160> but<00:00:44.160> any<00:00:44.370> bet<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.700> about<00:00:44.820> any<00:00:45.000> kind

of<00:00:45.210> creamer<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.020> will<00:00:46.379> work<00:00:46.530> i

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
of creamer you can think of will work i

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.279 
of creamer you can think of will work i
use<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> italian<00:00:47.309> sweet<00:00:47.579> cream<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
use the italian sweet cream in this

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.150 
use the italian sweet cream in this
because<00:00:49.289> essentially<00:00:49.620> you're<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
because essentially you're just going to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
because essentially you're just going to
be<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> thicken<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.660> anyways

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
be it's going to thicken up anyways

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
be it's going to thicken up anyways
whenever<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> add<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> ice<00:00:53.100> cream<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.690> ice

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
whenever you add the ice cream and ice

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.090 
whenever you add the ice cream and ice
cream<00:00:55.020> i'm<00:00:55.170> probably<00:00:55.320> use<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.680> half<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
cream i'm probably use about half of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
cream i'm probably use about half of
these<00:00:56.219> since<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> smaller<00:00:57.660> bowl<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:59.520> i<00:01:00.109> won't

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
these since the smaller bowl but i won't

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.299 
these since the smaller bowl but i won't
be<00:01:01.170> supplying<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.680> tonight<00:01:03.710> are<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.159> can

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
be supplying that tonight are you can

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
be supplying that tonight are you can
use<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.729> don't<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.780> use<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> spiced

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
use I don't know you can use the spiced

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
use I don't know you can use the spiced
rum<00:01:07.619> also<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.060> good<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:09.479> we

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
rum also and that's really good now we

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.710 
rum also and that's really good now we
do<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.810> spice<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.200> them<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:11.720> certain

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
do have a spice for them but certain

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:22.890 
do have a spice for them but certain
restrictions

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.600 

and<00:01:23.500> for<00:01:23.770> this<00:01:23.830> we<00:01:24.010> will<00:01:24.040> not<00:01:24.220> be<00:01:24.280> using<00:01:24.370> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
and for this we will not be using the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.560 
and for this we will not be using the
hot<00:01:24.730> espresso<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.880> cost<00:01:28.060> for<00:01:28.240> three

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
hot espresso and that cost for three

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.390 
hot espresso and that cost for three
tablespoons

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.300 

that's<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.580> powdered<00:01:36.940> sugar<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:39.040> does

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
that's the powdered sugar on there does

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.260 
that's the powdered sugar on there does
say<00:01:39.490> just<00:01:39.910> regular<00:01:40.180> sugar<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:43.060> or<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.210> gets

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
say just regular sugar this or it gets

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.880 
say just regular sugar this or it gets
kind<00:01:43.510> of<00:01:43.570> tricky<00:01:43.870> is<00:01:43.930> trying<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.200> mix<00:01:44.470> all<00:01:44.740> this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
kind of tricky is trying to mix all this

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.860 
kind of tricky is trying to mix all this
together<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.120> need<00:01:49.300> to<00:01:49.390> be<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.540> little<00:01:49.600> bit

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
together if you need to be a little bit

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.500 
together if you need to be a little bit
thinner<00:01:50.110> which<00:01:50.440> I<00:01:50.530> probably<00:01:50.800> will<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:52.390> can

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
thinner which I probably will you can

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.930 
thinner which I probably will you can
probably<00:01:53.260> add<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.620> little<00:01:54.070> bit<00:01:54.190> of<00:01:54.250> milk<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.700> it

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.160 

let's<00:01:57.940> go<00:01:58.150> ahead<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:58.390> stir<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:58.750> up<00:01:58.930> this<00:01:59.110> is

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
let's go ahead and stir this up this is

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.500 
let's go ahead and stir this up this is
actually<00:01:59.500> probably<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.830> easiest<00:02:00.190> recipe<00:02:00.670> out

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
actually probably the easiest recipe out

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.950 
actually probably the easiest recipe out
of<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.840> three

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.950 

pour<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.620> in<00:02:09.920> there<00:02:10.300> it's<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.360> nice<00:02:11.540> serving

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
pour that in there it's a nice serving

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.060 
pour that in there it's a nice serving
dish<00:02:13.570> now<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.110> probably<00:02:15.620> needs<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.890> stay

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
dish now this it probably needs to stay

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.920 
dish now this it probably needs to stay
in<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> freezer<00:02:17.410> probably<00:02:18.410> about<00:02:18.530> 40<00:02:18.950> minutes

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
in the freezer probably about 40 minutes

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:30.220 
in the freezer probably about 40 minutes
okay<00:02:21.580> take<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.760> out

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.520 

it<00:02:30.830> was<00:02:30.980> crumpled<00:02:31.340> head<00:02:31.459> over<00:02:31.670> there<00:02:32.530> and

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
it was crumpled head over there and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.960 
it was crumpled head over there and
that'll<00:02:33.709> be<00:02:33.830> your<00:02:33.920> crust

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.730 

a<00:02:39.120> good<00:02:39.630> thing<00:02:39.780> about<00:02:39.870> having<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.200> lady<00:02:40.410> fingers

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
a good thing about having a lady fingers

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.230 
a good thing about having a lady fingers
if<00:02:40.920> they<00:02:41.010> tend<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.250> say<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.460> lot<00:02:41.580> thinner<00:02:41.850> so

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
if they tend to say a lot thinner so

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.360 
if they tend to say a lot thinner so
they're<00:02:42.360> easier<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> crumble<00:02:43.080> up<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:44.130> problem

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
they're easier to crumble up the problem

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.620 
they're easier to crumble up the problem
with<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:45.000> they<00:02:45.090> tend<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.390> stay<00:02:45.540> in

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
with this that they tend to stay in

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.780 
with this that they tend to stay in
chunks<00:02:46.080> will<00:02:46.950> come<00:02:47.070> over<00:02:47.250> here<00:02:48.500> these<00:02:49.500> are<00:02:49.790> it
