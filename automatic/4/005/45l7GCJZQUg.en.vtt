that<00:01:15.320> was<00:01:15.500> established<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:16.340> there<00:01:16.670> is

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
that was established is there is

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.510 
that was established is there is
potential<00:01:17.720> for<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.170> platform<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.860> grow<00:01:19.070> when

so what we know is the wii u must bring

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.690 
so what we know is the wii u must bring
something<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.900> table<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.380> will<00:01:27.800> invite
