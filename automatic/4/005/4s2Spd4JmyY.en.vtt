00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
to show you a couple of ways of using

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.519

our<00:00:20.000> color<00:00:20.270> sprays<00:00:20.599> it<00:00:20.869> doesn't<00:00:21.349> really

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
our color sprays it doesn't really

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.790 
our color sprays it doesn't really
involve<00:00:21.920> spraying<00:00:22.520> out<00:00:22.820> and<00:00:23.210> as<00:00:24.080> you<00:00:24.320> know<00:00:24.500> the

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
involve spraying out and as you know the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.500 
involve spraying out and as you know the
range<00:00:25.220> is<00:00:26.080> quite<00:00:27.080> wide<00:00:27.290> we<00:00:27.619> have<00:00:28.000> shiny<00:00:29.000> bottom

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
range is quite wide we have shiny bottom

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.250 
range is quite wide we have shiny bottom
drums<00:00:30.100> which<00:00:31.100> give<00:00:31.369> a<00:00:31.400> wonderful<00:00:32.239> luster<00:00:32.780> when

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
drums which give a wonderful luster when

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.680 
drums which give a wonderful luster when
they're<00:00:33.470> dry<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.370> we<00:00:34.519> also<00:00:34.670> have<00:00:34.850> solid

if you do have a shiny bottom you need

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.350 
if you do have a shiny bottom you need
to<00:00:50.600> shake<00:00:50.950> just<00:00:51.950> to<00:00:52.100> activate<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.670> mica<00:00:52.879> and

beautiful piece of artwork this method

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.929 
beautiful piece of artwork this method
gives<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.579> an<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:56.450> more<00:01:57.110> fluid<00:01:57.520> creative<00:01:58.520> and

gives you an a more fluid creative and

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.899 
gives you an a more fluid creative and
background<00:01:59.810> if<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.619> do<00:02:00.920> want<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.640> have<00:02:01.880> a

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
background if you do want to have a

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.139 
background if you do want to have a
print<00:02:02.420> that's<00:02:03.020> crisper<00:02:03.710> then<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.850> can

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
print that's crisper then you can

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.710 
print that's crisper then you can
achieve<00:02:05.509> that<00:02:06.079> by<00:02:07.750> spraying<00:02:08.750> some<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.649> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
achieve that by spraying some of the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.030 
achieve that by spraying some of the
color<00:02:11.720> sprays<00:02:12.049> onto<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.070> project<00:02:13.670> called<00:02:15.040> cut

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
color sprays onto a project called cut

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.960 
color sprays onto a project called cut
and<00:02:16.070> dry<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:17.269> is<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.660> phone<00:02:17.959> version

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
and dry this is the phone version

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.090 
and dry this is the phone version
process<00:02:19.970> doesn't<00:02:20.209> work<00:02:20.480> as<00:02:20.750> efficiently

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
process doesn't work as efficiently

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.540 
process doesn't work as efficiently
with<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.640> felt<00:02:23.480> version<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:25.070> if<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.310> need<00:02:25.430> an

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
with the felt version and if you need an

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.910 
with the felt version and if you need an
explanation<00:02:25.820> those<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.320> all<00:02:27.560> on<00:02:27.800> the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
explanation those that it's all on the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.060 
explanation those that it's all on the
website<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.700> i'm<00:02:29.420> using<00:02:29.660> aqua<00:02:30.290> cherry<00:02:30.800> licious

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
website so i'm using aqua cherry licious

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.740 
website so i'm using aqua cherry licious
and<00:02:31.490> i'm<00:02:31.640> going<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.910> put<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> little<00:02:32.180> squirt<00:02:32.720> of

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
and i'm going to put a little squirt of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.210 
and i'm going to put a little squirt of
olive<00:02:34.180> here<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:35.420> it's<00:02:35.540> quite<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.260> simple

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
olive here so it's quite a a simple

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.080 
olive here so it's quite a a simple
arrangement<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:38.030> color<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:39.610> you'll<00:02:40.610> notice

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
arrangement of color and you'll notice

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.590 
arrangement of color and you'll notice
that<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:42.130> spray<00:02:43.130> has<00:02:43.460> overshot<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.150> little<00:02:44.510> bit

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
that the spray has overshot a little bit

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.990 
that the spray has overshot a little bit
so<00:02:44.750> I'm<00:02:44.810> just<00:02:45.020> going<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.410> put<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.880> one

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
so I'm just going to put that to one

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.810 
so I'm just going to put that to one
