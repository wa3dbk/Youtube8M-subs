00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
probably not going to take you off and i

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.459 
probably not going to take you off and i
will<00:01:03.579> unless<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.030> have<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.239> prodigy<00:01:05.170> at<00:01:05.320> this

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469 
will unless you have a prodigy at this

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:08.430 
will unless you have a prodigy at this
game<00:01:05.740> but<00:01:06.340> at<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.670> same<00:01:06.939> time<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:07.869> game<00:01:08.080> could

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
game but at the same time the game could

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.530 
game but at the same time the game could
do<00:01:08.710> with<00:01:08.920> being<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.220> bit<00:01:09.340> longer<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.909> think

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
do with being a bit longer I think

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.910 
do with being a bit longer I think
that's<00:01:10.690> why<00:01:10.869> it's<00:01:11.049> priced<00:01:11.320> cheaper<00:01:11.500> than<00:01:11.860> the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
that's why it's priced cheaper than the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.430 
that's why it's priced cheaper than the
DSI<00:01:12.460> games<00:01:12.490> however<00:01:13.450> I<00:01:13.720> still<00:01:14.080> think<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.409> could

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
DSI games however I still think it could

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.050 
DSI games however I still think it could
have<00:01:14.619> been<00:01:14.680> priced<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.190> little<00:01:15.250> bit<00:01:15.820> cheaper

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
have been priced a little bit cheaper

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.480 
have been priced a little bit cheaper
than<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.450> but<00:01:17.380> either<00:01:17.740> way<00:01:18.070> it's<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.460> great

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
than that but either way it's a great

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.450 
than that but either way it's a great
game<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.420> it's<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.409> usual<00:01:20.590> way<00:01:20.979> forward

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
game and it's the usual way forward

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.160 
game and it's the usual way forward
we're<00:01:21.670> really<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.330> fact<00:01:22.540> that<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:22.780> just<00:01:23.080> a

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
we're really the fact that it is just a

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.740 
we're really the fact that it is just a
well-made<00:01:23.590> excellently<00:01:24.250> executed<00:01:24.369> game<00:01:25.119> the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
well-made excellently executed game the

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.660 
well-made excellently executed game the
whole<00:01:25.960> point<00:01:26.170> is<00:01:26.439> it's<00:01:26.799> very<00:01:27.040> similar<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.580> a

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
whole point is it's very similar to a

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.300 
whole point is it's very similar to a
megaman<00:01:28.060> game<00:01:28.330> with<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:29.320> lot<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.590> action<00:01:30.070> but

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
megaman game with a lot of action but

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.219 
megaman game with a lot of action but
it's<00:01:30.490> also<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.850> puzzle<00:01:31.360> game<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:32.110> be

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
it's also a puzzle game and it to be

don't offer tax plan then I just skipped
it<00:01:44.080> but<00:01:44.470> either<00:01:44.560> way<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:45.159> means<00:01:45.460> that<00:01:45.670> when

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
it but either way it means that when

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.950 
you're jumping around platforms on that
you<00:01:47.979> have<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.220> jump<00:01:48.460> hit<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.119> switch<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.659> then

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
you have to jump hit the switch and then

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.890 
you have to jump hit the switch and then
Lola<00:01:50.860> pea<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.310> at<00:01:52.119> least<00:01:52.299> it<00:01:52.509> would<00:01:52.630> when<00:01:52.780> it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
Lola pea and at least it would when it

Lola pea and at least it would when it
jumps<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.380> think<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:53.740> was<00:01:53.829> my<00:01:53.979> mistake<00:01:54.040> alone<00:01:54.520> all

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
jumps I think I was my mistake alone all

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.420 
jumps I think I was my mistake alone all
the<00:01:54.670> games<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.680> you've<00:01:56.680> gotta<00:01:56.860> navigate<00:01:57.070> your

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
the games and you've gotta navigate your

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.190 
the games and you've gotta navigate your
way<00:01:57.490> through<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.880> level<00:01:58.150> which<00:01:58.329> is<00:01:58.360> why<00:01:58.810> it's

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
way through the level which is why it's

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.810 
way through the level which is why it's
a<00:01:59.320> bit<00:01:59.470> more<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.799> puzzler<00:02:00.220> because<00:02:00.520> there's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
a bit more of a puzzler because there's

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.899 
a bit more of a puzzler because there's
times<00:02:01.119> when<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:02.200> won't<00:02:02.560> see<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.399> direct

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
times when you won't see the direct

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.460 
times when you won't see the direct
we're<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.450> get<00:02:04.600> there<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.049> that<00:02:05.350> was

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
we're to get there and that was

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.810 
we're to get there and that was
definitely<00:02:05.710> my<00:02:05.920> fault<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.369> can't<00:02:06.549> believe<00:02:06.670> I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
definitely my fault I can't believe I

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.690 
definitely my fault I can't believe I
made<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.000> silly<00:02:07.180> mistake<00:02:07.299> over<00:02:07.659> so<00:02:08.700> basically

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
made a silly mistake over so basically

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.269 
made a silly mistake over so basically
think<00:02:10.119> Megaman<00:02:10.599> mixed<00:02:11.019> with<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.529> don't<00:02:12.159> want

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:12.279 
think Megaman mixed with I don't want

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.339 
think Megaman mixed with I don't want
maybe<00:02:12.400> push<00:02:12.760> over<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.510> moment<00:02:13.900> something

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
maybe push over that moment something

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.229 
maybe push over that moment something
like<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.859> because<00:02:15.069> pushover<00:02:15.760> was<00:02:15.879> always<00:02:16.209> a

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
like that because pushover was always a

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:16.830 
like that because pushover was always a
care

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
care

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.809 
care
so<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.140> played<00:02:17.379> as<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> nun<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.129> looked

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
so if you played as a nun and you looked

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.400 
so if you played as a nun and you looked
at<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> leveling<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.569> how<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.720> work<00:02:19.959> out<00:02:20.110> where

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
at a leveling and how to work out where

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.080 
at a leveling and how to work out where
I<00:02:20.440> put<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.769> dominoes<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.489> when<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:21.970> that's

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
I put the dominoes and when and that's

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.140 
I put the dominoes and when and that's
odd<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.660> suppose<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.410> bit<00:02:23.890> like<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.280> either<00:02:24.819> way

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
odd I suppose a bit like that either way

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.119 
odd I suppose a bit like that either way
if<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.569> both<00:02:25.840> genres<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.860> games

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
if you like both genres of the games

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.800 
if you like both genres of the games
then<00:02:27.760> you're<00:02:28.180> going<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.360> absolutely<00:02:28.480> love

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
then you're going to absolutely love

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.690 
then you're going to absolutely love
this<00:02:29.140> because<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:30.010> think<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:30.489> an<00:02:30.580> excellent

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
this because I think it's an excellent

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.610 
this because I think it's an excellent
title<00:02:31.300> it's<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.690> shame<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.200> little

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
title it's just a shame it's a little

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.960 
title it's just a shame it's a little

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
bit short which is why I'm not really

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.210 
bit short which is why I'm not really

you can't just well switch willy-nilly
and<00:02:51.420> expect<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.450> get<00:02:52.599> good<00:02:52.780> results<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.470> a
