 Dam Dam Dam Dam Dam Dam Dam 

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:03.833
 Dam Dam Dam 

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.875
 Yeah, that was ... that was amazing. 

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:07.267
 You folded yourself, Oranges? 

00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:09.708
 Yeah, I call it "Dam" 

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.416
 - (unknown) Yeah, me too. 

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:13.118
 Hey, did you say something? 

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:14.916
 I do not. Maybe it was Little Apple. 

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.224
 Silence! I'm trying to read the book. 

00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:19.765
 The font is very small. 

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:20.890
 I know how to do it. 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.219
 It must be Times New Dwarf. 

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:24.432
 Lamo. 

00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:26.015
 Hey, it's here again. 

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:27.599
 Yeah, maybe it's someone new. 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.936
 Oh, good point. 

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:31.015
 Hey, hey Kostostal! Did you say something? 

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:33.042
 Sorry, I wasn't. 

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:36.432
 Oh, well, you didn't. 

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:37.905
 - (unknown) That's old! 

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:38.615
 Hey! 

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.518
 - (unknown) The same joke over and over again. 

00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:41.711
 - (unknown) Totally stupid. 

00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:42.701
 Who is it? 

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:44.512
 Uh-oh. Don't look, Oranges, 

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:46.137
 I think it will be trolled. 

00:00:46.137 --> 00:00:47.620
 Trolnutej? 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.481
 It looks like a fake. 

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.710
 Lamo! 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.255
 -Keep trollin ', trollin', trollin ', trollin' (What?) 

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:57.005
 Keep Trollin ', Trollin', Trollin ', Trollin' (Yeah!) 

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:58.755
 Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait, don't let me clear it up. 

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:01.046
 So these guys just hang around and say crap- 

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.063
 - But aren't they oranges? 

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.771
 No-no-no-no, oranges just annoying; 

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:07.146
 these trolls are completely different. 

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:09.896
 It's terrible. It's not as good as it used to be. 

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:11.313
 Hey! Hey, 

00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:13.744
 -want to go on my motorboat? 

00:01:20.203 --> 00:01:22.593
 Thanks. That was ten seconds of my life- 

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:23.846
 -that I'll never get back. 

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:26.123
 Lamo! 

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:27.840
 Hey, hey Kostohlavka, hey! 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.953
 Hey! I'm not Kostohlavek! Do not call me that! 

00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:33.885
 What are you? Funny bone? 

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:36.385
 Dude, I'm a dog biscuit! 

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:38.260
 No, you're not a dog biscuit. 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.802
 This is a dog biscuit. 

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.010
 Vykrádačka. That was already in Family Guy (Griffin). 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.391
 And in the Simpsons. 

00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:48.552
 Even in your mom! 

00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:49.733
 Oh, we got you. 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.483
 It makes no sense... 

00:01:52.483 --> 00:01:53.483
 Why are you hanging out- 

00:01:53.483 --> 00:01:54.775
 -and looking at something you hate? 

00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:55.983
 That's what it is, Pear. 

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:58.108
 Hatred is the only thing they enjoy. 

00:01:58.108 --> 00:02:00.816
 Vau, that was a good point, Little Apple. 

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:04.566
 Yeah, it sounded like a CVO. 

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:07.582
 Oh, I understand, it's funny because it's a double-minded thing. 

00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:09.359
 Lamo! 

00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:12.363
 This show would skip the shark. 

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:14.049
 No, not yet. 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.394
 Geronimo! 

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:20.782
 Now she jumped the shark. 

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:23.197
 Seriously, who's watching this crap? 

00:02:23.197 --> 00:02:24.637
 Forget it. 

00:02:24.637 --> 00:02:25.848
 I'll go back to my book and ... 

00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:28.015
 Hey, where's my magnifier ... 

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:30.395
 Marshall, come back! 

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:33.367
 Him! I'm the Statue of Liberty! 

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:36.618
 Hey! You look good to Marsmallounk. 

00:02:36.618 --> 00:02:38.781
 I hate Marshmallouns. 

00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:40.239
 Did you say "Ewok"? 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.448
 Lamo! 

00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:45.198
 Guys, don't you feel anything? 

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.906
 Yeah, that's an orange, it stinks. 

00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:50.436
 La ... 

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.943
 -Vhau! -You! 

00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:53.568
 Lamooo! 

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:55.890
 Oh no! It's a magnifier. 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.004
 And, Spaghetti is coming! 

00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:58.862
 -Marshmalloun, stop! 

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:00.627
 It's a fake. 

00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:02.717
 Bright Photoshop. 

00:03:02.717 --> 00:03:05.796
 ... fire, so Lamers! 

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:08.645
 That's why I never use hair spray. 

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:10.937
 Hey, what happened to the dog biscuit? 

00:03:10.937 --> 00:03:13.520
 Yeah, Kostohlavek also disappeared. 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.479
 Oh, let me explain: for everything ... "Knife!" 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.312
 Hm, so predictable. 

00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:20.545
 -Knife! -Knife! 

00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:21.562
 Knife! 

00:03:21.562 --> 00:03:23.894
 Hey, hey trolls! Hey, trolls, hey! 

00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:24.870
 Now it comes. 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.959
 Yeah, I gotta start screaming in this part. 

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:30.120
 Hey, trolls, here! Hey, trolls! 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.670
 What? What is Orange? 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.814
 What you want? 

00:03:32.814 --> 00:03:33.972
 Dog! 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:36.943
 -Uh. -Vau! 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.123
 Oops! They're really trying. 

00:03:41.123 --> 00:03:43.385
 Uh, oh. 

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:45.953
 Well, I already know what happened to the dog biscuit. 

00:03:45.953 --> 00:03:47.997
 What are you talking about? He's fine. 

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:49.176
 -What..? -Huh? 

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:52.548
 Him! Hyjé pejsku!
