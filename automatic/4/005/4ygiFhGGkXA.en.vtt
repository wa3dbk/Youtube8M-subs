it's it's actually quite quiet if you
come<00:00:56.430> around<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> back<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.510> already

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
come around to the back you can already

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.359 
come around to the back you can already
see<00:00:57.960> now<00:00:58.140> what

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.569 

and<00:01:04.879> I've<00:01:05.000> got<00:01:06.070> something<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.219> the<00:01:07.429> two

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
and I've got something to the two

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.700 
and I've got something to the two
bulkheads<00:01:08.030> they're<00:01:08.299> big<00:01:09.140> they're<00:01:09.259> backwards

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
bulkheads they're big they're backwards

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.950 
bulkheads they're big they're backwards
which<00:01:10.219> I<00:01:10.579> guess<00:01:11.000> they<00:01:11.270> are<00:01:11.299> but<00:01:11.689> that's<00:01:11.780> how

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
which I guess they are but that's how

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.779 
which I guess they are but that's how
weak<00:01:12.109> it's<00:01:12.289> meant<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.530> be<00:01:12.619> installed<00:01:13.039> it's<00:01:13.670> a

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
weak it's meant to be installed it's a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.309 
weak it's meant to be installed it's a
double<00:01:14.119> gasket<00:01:14.299> is<00:01:14.659> on<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.960> inside<00:01:15.079> and

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
double gasket is on the inside and

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.300 
double gasket is on the inside and
outside<00:01:17.319> it's<00:01:18.319> got<00:01:18.439> these<00:01:18.560> snorkel<00:01:19.100> things

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
outside it's got these snorkel things

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.120 
outside it's got these snorkel things
which<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.060> assume<00:01:20.869> er<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.170> cut<00:01:21.799> down<00:01:21.920> on<00:01:22.069> the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
which I assume er to cut down on the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.099 
which I assume er to cut down on the
gurgling<00:01:22.549> sound<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:24.069> then<00:01:25.069> you<00:01:25.100> can<00:01:25.280> see<00:01:26.109> the

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
gurgling sound and then you can see the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.590 
gurgling sound and then you can see the
drill<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.619> bulkhead<00:01:28.130> there<00:01:28.399> from<00:01:28.969> my<00:01:29.149> return

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
drill the bulkhead there from my return

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.760 
drill the bulkhead there from my return
line<00:01:29.869> I<00:01:30.819> just<00:01:32.259> come<00:01:33.259> straight<00:01:33.439> through<00:01:33.679> the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
line I just come straight through the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.870 
line I just come straight through the
back<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:36.369> I<00:01:38.649> actually<00:01:39.649> painted<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.520> back<00:01:40.670> of

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
back I I actually painted the back of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.419 
back I I actually painted the back of
the<00:01:41.030> aquarium<00:01:41.750> blue<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:42.829> I<00:01:42.860> don't<00:01:43.159> even<00:01:43.250> have

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
the aquarium blue so I don't even have

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.870 
the aquarium blue so I don't even have
to<00:01:43.579> worry<00:01:43.759> about<00:01:45.280> bring<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.340> back<00:01:46.459> round<00:01:46.670> one

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
to worry about bring it back round one

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.609 
to worry about bring it back round one
or<00:01:47.329> anything<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:50.090> that's<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:51.110> topside<00:01:51.590> for

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
or anything so that's the topside for

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.520 
or anything so that's the topside for
now<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:53.299> down<00:01:53.780> below<00:01:56.049> this<00:01:57.049> then<00:01:57.229> it'll<00:01:57.409> be<00:01:57.500> a

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
now and down below this then it'll be a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.869 
now and down below this then it'll be a
little<00:01:57.770> tighter<00:01:58.159> than<00:01:58.369> I<00:01:58.459> thought<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.789> would

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:58.879 
little tighter than I thought it would

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:00.760 
little tighter than I thought it would
with<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.090> tubing<00:02:00.079> but<00:02:00.200> I'm<00:02:00.319> using<00:02:00.500> some<00:02:00.739> of

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
with the tubing but I'm using some of

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.010 
with the tubing but I'm using some of
the<00:02:00.890> flexible<00:02:01.369> tubing<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.509> basically<00:02:02.810> going

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
the flexible tubing and basically going

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.850 
the flexible tubing and basically going
up<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.319> a<00:02:03.349> barb<00:02:03.770> fitting<00:02:04.219> um<00:02:05.079> on<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.590> street

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
up to a barb fitting um on the street

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.129 
up to a barb fitting um on the street
elbow<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.369> goes<00:02:07.549> in<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.509> bulkhead<00:02:08.780> for

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:09.139 
elbow that goes in to the bulkhead for

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.160 
elbow that goes in to the bulkhead for
the<00:02:09.229> return<00:02:09.500> line<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.660> point<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:11.989> I'm

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
the return line but the point is I'm

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.970 
the return line but the point is I'm
gonna<00:02:12.260> hook<00:02:12.410> another

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
gonna hook another

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.180 
gonna hook another
barb<00:02:13.370> fitting<00:02:13.639> and<00:02:13.760> hose<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.150> here<00:02:14.829> so<00:02:15.829> you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
barb fitting and hose to here so you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.129 
barb fitting and hose to here so you
know<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> come<00:02:16.459> down<00:02:16.609> this<00:02:16.790> back<00:02:16.940> which<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.840> think

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.139 
know I come down this back which I think

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.990 
know I come down this back which I think
right<00:02:18.319> now<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.799> I<00:02:19.130> do<00:02:19.280> need<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.579> dial<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:19.940> back

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
right now and I do need to dial it back

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.319 
right now and I do need to dial it back
a<00:02:20.120> little<00:02:20.239> bit<00:02:20.709> because<00:02:21.709> I'm<00:02:22.190> earlier<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.180> was

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
a little bit because I'm earlier I was

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.110 
a little bit because I'm earlier I was
seeing<00:02:23.599> a<00:02:23.660> lot<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.870> micro<00:02:24.170> bubbles<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
seeing a lot of micro bubbles in the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.400 
seeing a lot of micro bubbles in the
tank<00:02:26.389> before<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.780> headed<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.139> salt<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:29.410> these

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
tank before I headed the salt so these

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.819 
tank before I headed the salt so these
are<00:02:30.620> my<00:02:31.269> drain<00:02:32.269> lines<00:02:32.510> I'm<00:02:33.410> using<00:02:33.620> this

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
are my drain lines I'm using this

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.589 
are my drain lines I'm using this
flexible<00:02:34.730> hose<00:02:34.940> it's<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:37.269> like<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.359> pool

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
flexible hose it's like a like a pool

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.089 
flexible hose it's like a like a pool
drain<00:02:39.319> their<00:02:39.620> pool<00:02:39.889> vacuum<00:02:40.370> hose<00:02:40.609> it's<00:02:41.480> really

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
drain their pool vacuum hose it's really

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.610 
drain their pool vacuum hose it's really
you<00:02:43.099> know<00:02:43.160> super<00:02:43.609> super<00:02:44.090> flexible<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.870> unlike

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
you know super super flexible and unlike

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.400 
you know super super flexible and unlike
the<00:02:45.880> Flex<00:02:46.880> PVC<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.690> everyone<00:02:47.900> uses<00:02:48.079> which

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
the Flex PVC that everyone uses which

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.830 
the Flex PVC that everyone uses which
really<00:02:48.859> isn't<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.549> flexible<00:02:50.090> minutes<00:02:50.419> more

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
really isn't that flexible minutes more

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.949 
really isn't that flexible minutes more
flexible<00:02:51.349> than<00:02:51.560> regular<00:02:52.310> PVC<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.419> I<00:02:53.480> think

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
flexible than regular PVC but I think

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.650 
flexible than regular PVC but I think
these<00:02:54.620> are<00:02:54.769> nice<00:02:54.919> because<00:02:54.950> they<00:02:55.400> truly<00:02:55.660> you

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
these are nice because they truly you

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.379 
these are nice because they truly you
can<00:02:56.690> really<00:02:57.079> flex<00:02:57.410> them<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.950> ton<00:02:58.430> um<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.299> guess

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
can really flex them a ton um I guess

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.030 
can really flex them a ton um I guess
deal<00:02:59.599> the<00:02:59.959> only<00:03:00.139> disadvantage<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:00.919> do

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
deal the only disadvantage is you do

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.039 
deal the only disadvantage is you do
need<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.280> secure<00:03:01.669> it<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.120> I'm<00:03:02.480> gonna<00:03:02.690> need<00:03:02.870> to

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
need to secure it so I'm gonna need to

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.530 
need to secure it so I'm gonna need to
make<00:03:03.230> some<00:03:03.440> kind<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.709> little<00:03:04.239> bracket<00:03:05.239> or

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
make some kind of little bracket or

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.410 
make some kind of little bracket or
something<00:03:06.260> -<00:03:06.410> zip<00:03:06.590> zip<00:03:07.160> tie

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
something - zip zip tie

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.530 
something - zip zip tie
either<00:03:07.569> somehow<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.130> they<00:03:09.280> don't<00:03:09.540> sit

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
either somehow so that they don't sit

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.960 
either somehow so that they don't sit
rating<00:03:10.780> it's<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.020> baffles<00:03:11.440> there

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.010 

got<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.540> heater<00:03:14.810> here<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:16.510> forget<00:03:17.510> what<00:03:17.630> brand<00:03:17.900> it

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
got a heater here I forget what brand it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.350 
got a heater here I forget what brand it
is<00:03:18.170> but<00:03:18.950> it's<00:03:19.100> got

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.060 

around<00:03:22.360> here<00:03:22.600> yeah<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.380> don't<00:03:23.500> have<00:03:23.800> everything

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
around here yeah I don't have everything

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.000 
around here yeah I don't have everything
set<00:03:24.580> up<00:03:24.610> optimally<00:03:25.300> yet<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.590> like<00:03:26.830> it's

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
set up optimally yet so but I like it's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.800 
set up optimally yet so but I like it's
got<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.190> little<00:03:27.370> digital<00:03:27.810> temperature

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
got a little digital temperature

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.680 
got a little digital temperature
controller<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.130> can<00:03:30.310> it's<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:31.390> still<00:03:31.600> at

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
controller so you can it's it's still at

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.880 
controller so you can it's it's still at
67<00:03:32.500> right<00:03:32.650> now<00:03:32.800> looks<00:03:33.700> like<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:35.260> can<00:03:35.440> see<00:03:35.860> I

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
67 right now looks like you can see I

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.030 
67 right now looks like you can see I
said<00:03:36.790> 282<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:37.600> don't<00:03:38.440> take<00:03:38.530> quite<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:38.800> while<00:03:38.860> to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
said 282 so don't take quite a while to

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.330 
said 282 so don't take quite a while to
get<00:03:39.280> up<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.520> there<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:42.150> anyway<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:44.340> that's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
get up to there and anyway it's that's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.230 
get up to there and anyway it's that's
pretty<00:03:45.550> much<00:03:45.640> it<00:03:45.880> now

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
pretty much it now

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.660 
pretty much it now
I'm<00:03:46.360> just<00:03:46.660> waiting<00:03:47.020> for<00:03:47.050> all<00:03:47.380> this<00:03:47.560> salt<00:03:48.490> to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
I'm just waiting for all this salt to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.110 
I'm just waiting for all this salt to
dissolve<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:50.320> it's<00:03:50.500> actually<00:03:50.850> clearing<00:03:51.850> up<00:03:52.030> a

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
dissolve and it's actually clearing up a

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.670 
dissolve and it's actually clearing up a
little<00:03:52.300> bit<00:03:52.540> more<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.290> let<00:03:56.440> it<00:03:56.530> sit

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
little bit more and you just let it sit

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.200 
little bit more and you just let it sit
overnight<00:03:56.710> and<00:03:57.250> hopefully<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.880> morning

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
overnight and hopefully in the morning

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.270 
overnight and hopefully in the morning
it'll<00:03:58.360> be<00:03:58.480> quite<00:03:58.690> clear

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.610 

overall<00:04:03.660> everything's<00:04:04.660> gone<00:04:04.810> pretty<00:04:05.170> well

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
overall everything's gone pretty well

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.040 
overall everything's gone pretty well
I<00:04:05.650> also<00:04:06.370> skimmed<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.120> tank<00:04:07.360> before<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.810> filled

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
I also skimmed the tank before I filled

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.740 
I also skimmed the tank before I filled
it<00:04:08.200> up<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.640> little<00:04:09.640> bit<00:04:09.820> because<00:04:10.360> unfortunately

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
it up a little bit because unfortunately

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.340 
it up a little bit because unfortunately
my<00:04:11.560> living<00:04:12.370> room<00:04:12.430> my<00:04:12.670> apartment<00:04:13.350> he's

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
my living room my apartment he's

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.530 
my living room my apartment he's
slightly<00:04:14.800> tilted<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.760> think<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.239> because<00:04:16.420> the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
slightly tilted I think it's because the

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.660 
slightly tilted I think it's because the
concrete<00:04:16.959> floor<00:04:17.260> which<00:04:18.040> is<00:04:18.070> good<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:18.430> it's<00:04:18.640> a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
concrete floor which is good that it's a

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.370 
concrete floor which is good that it's a
concrete<00:04:18.880> floor<00:04:19.359> with<00:04:19.690> this<00:04:19.810> big<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.080> a<00:04:20.140> tank

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
concrete floor with this big of a tank

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.470 
concrete floor with this big of a tank
but<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:22.020> hope<00:04:23.020> tomorrow<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:24.090> after<00:04:25.090> all<00:04:25.330> the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
but I hope tomorrow that after all the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.590 
but I hope tomorrow that after all the
salt<00:04:25.690> dissolves<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:27.220> everything<00:04:27.600> stabilizes

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
salt dissolves and everything stabilizes

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.210 
salt dissolves and everything stabilizes
I<00:04:28.720> can<00:04:28.870> add<00:04:28.990> all<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.260> live<00:04:29.440> rock<00:04:29.680> which<00:04:29.920> I<00:04:30.070> have

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220
