lens<00:00:47.670> yep<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> challenge<00:00:48.750> though<00:00:48.930> is

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
lens yep now the challenge though is

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
lens yep now the challenge though is
that<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.739> thread<00:00:50.190> mount<00:00:50.430> doesn't<00:00:50.850> line<00:00:51.030> up

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that that thread mount doesn't line up

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
that that thread mount doesn't line up
but<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.780> an<00:00:51.840> adapter<00:00:52.430> it's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
but you just got an adapter it's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.500 
but you just got an adapter it's
actually<00:00:53.670> important<00:00:54.059> thing<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.360> these

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
actually important thing with these

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.689 
actually important thing with these
lenses<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.039> native<00:00:56.430> thread

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
lenses and you can get native thread

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.160 
lenses and you can get native thread
mount<00:00:56.940> lenses<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:58.020> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
mount lenses like you have there or you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.810 
mount lenses like you have there or you
can<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> little<00:00:58.680> step-down<00:00:59.129> ring<00:00:59.370> so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
can just get a little step-down ring so

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.790 
can just get a little step-down ring so
I'm<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.329> from<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> larger<00:01:01.260> diameter<00:01:01.410> about

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
I'm going from a larger diameter about

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.119 
I'm going from a larger diameter about
58<00:01:02.160> millimeters<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.769> 37<00:01:04.769> millimeter

one challenge you might notice with

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.510 
one challenge you might notice with
these<00:01:37.200> lenses<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.979> possible<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
these lenses is it's possible that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.249 
these lenses is it's possible that
you're<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.000> wide<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> major

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you're so wide that you get a major

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.800 
you're so wide that you get a major
vignette<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.549> okay<00:01:41.820> every<00:01:42.540> camera

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
vignette but that's okay every camera

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.450 
vignette but that's okay every camera
app<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.350> access<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.130> gonna<00:01:44.340> have
