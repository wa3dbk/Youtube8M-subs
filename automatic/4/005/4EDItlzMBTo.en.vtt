like<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.970> kind<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.660> it'll<00:02:16.200> sort<00:02:16.380> of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
like like that kind of and it'll sort of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.260

push the helmet away from my face and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.970 
push the helmet away from my face and
that<00:02:18.300> way<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> could<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.170> least<00:02:19.290> talk<00:02:19.620> clearly

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
that way I could at least talk clearly

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.620 
that way I could at least talk clearly
but<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.520> could<00:02:20.910> be<00:02:21.060> hard<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.390> hear<00:02:21.510> because

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
but it could be hard to hear because

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.590 
but it could be hard to hear because
it's<00:02:21.870> muffled<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:23.280> for<00:02:23.580> any<00:02:23.700> videos<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.270> do<00:02:24.330> I'm

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
it's muffled so for any videos I do I'm

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.860 
it's muffled so for any videos I do I'm
probably<00:02:24.870> gonna<00:02:25.290> later<00:02:25.590> dub<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> over<00:02:26.870> which

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
probably gonna later dub it over which

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.420 
probably gonna later dub it over which
is<00:02:27.990> usually<00:02:28.320> what<00:02:28.500> they<00:02:28.620> did<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> show

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
is usually what they did in the show

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.570 
is usually what they did in the show
anyway<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.959> wasn't<00:02:31.380> always<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:32.490> know

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
anyway because it wasn't always you know

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.490 
anyway because it wasn't always you know
like<00:02:32.730> Austin<00:02:33.090> st.<00:02:33.390> John<00:02:33.660> or<00:02:33.900> Steve<00:02:33.990> Cardenas

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
like Austin st. John or Steve Cardenas

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.110 
like Austin st. John or Steve Cardenas
