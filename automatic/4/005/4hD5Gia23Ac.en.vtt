00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.640 

I<00:04:05.710> think<00:04:06.710> the<00:04:06.830> San<00:04:07.070> Luis<00:04:07.250> Valley<00:04:07.430> probably

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
I think the San Luis Valley probably

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.040 
I think the San Luis Valley probably
draws<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.680> lot<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.510> supernatural<00:04:11.510> or

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
draws a lot of supernatural or

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.400 
draws a lot of supernatural or
extraterrestrial<00:04:12.910> activity<00:04:14.410> possibly

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
extraterrestrial activity possibly

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.170 
extraterrestrial activity possibly
because<00:04:15.770> of<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:15.950> geothermal<00:04:16.310> water<00:04:16.910> and

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
because of the geothermal water and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.060 
because of the geothermal water and
there's<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.720> lot<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.020> crazy<00:04:18.230> people<00:04:18.500> here<00:04:18.890> who

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
there's a lot of crazy people here who

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.920 
there's a lot of crazy people here who
probably<00:04:19.310> see<00:04:19.610> things<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:20.090> they<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.720> they

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
probably see things that they that they

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.800 
probably see things that they that they
didn't<00:04:21.200> actually<00:04:21.350> see<00:04:21.800> too<00:04:22.070> but<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.600> San

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
didn't actually see too but and the San

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.690 
didn't actually see too but and the San
Luis<00:04:23.960> Valley<00:04:24.080> draws<00:04:24.530> strange<00:04:25.040> people<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:25.640> it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
Luis Valley draws strange people so it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.120 
Luis Valley draws strange people so it
might<00:04:25.880> as<00:04:25.940> well<00:04:26.000> draw<00:04:26.570> strange<00:04:26.960> aircraft<00:04:27.560> as

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
might as well draw strange aircraft as

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:40.360 
might as well draw strange aircraft as
well

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370
