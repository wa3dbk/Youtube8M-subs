00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.950 

so<00:00:08.639> Chris<00:00:08.970> let's<00:00:09.269> start<00:00:09.540> with<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:10.219> you<00:00:11.219> are

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
so Chris let's start with you you are

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.609 
so Chris let's start with you you are
mr.<00:00:12.960> robotics<00:00:13.710> correct<00:00:14.460> yes<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.690> when<00:00:16.500> you

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
mr. robotics correct yes and when you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.640 
mr. robotics correct yes and when you
were<00:00:16.800> ten<00:00:17.460> years<00:00:17.490> old<00:00:17.970> how<00:00:18.660> predictable<00:00:18.960> was

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
were ten years old how predictable was

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.939 
were ten years old how predictable was
it<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.310> might<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:21.050> going<00:00:22.050> into<00:00:22.380> robotics

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
it that you might be going into robotics

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.800 
it that you might be going into robotics
so<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> don't<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:23.939> about<00:00:24.000> robotics<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:24.750> i

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
so I don't know about robotics but i

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.150 
so I don't know about robotics but i
think<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.199> know<00:00:25.289> engineering<00:00:25.859> was<00:00:25.980> pretty

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
think you know engineering was pretty

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.359 
think you know engineering was pretty
clear<00:00:26.400> i<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.720> i<00:00:27.779> literally<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.920> my

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
clear i think you know i literally on my

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.470 
clear i think you know i literally on my
parents<00:00:29.699> fridge<00:00:29.910> right<00:00:30.090> now<00:00:30.150> there's

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
parents fridge right now there's

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.730 
parents fridge right now there's
literally<00:00:30.810> still<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> picture<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.590> when<00:00:31.650> i

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
literally still a picture from when i

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.310 
literally still a picture from when i
was<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> sweater<00:00:33.149> vest<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
was there with the sweater vest and the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
was there with the sweater vest and the
glasses<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:35.100> tape<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> middle<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.360> i

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
glasses with tape in the middle so i

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
glasses with tape in the middle so i
think<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.230> pretty<00:00:37.410> pretty<00:00:37.860> pre-ordered

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
think it was pretty pretty pre-ordered

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
think it was pretty pretty pre-ordered
it<00:00:38.309> wasn't<00:00:38.579> Halloween<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.629> Halloween

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it wasn't Halloween it was not Halloween

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.760 
it wasn't Halloween it was not Halloween
sadly<00:00:40.500> no<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:42.809> knew<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.230> wanted<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.649> go

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
sadly no and you knew you wanted to go

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.470 
sadly no and you knew you wanted to go
into<00:00:43.980> engineering<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.850> technology<00:00:45.120> what

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
into engineering and technology what

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.330 
into engineering and technology what
first<00:00:45.780> caught<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.140> eye<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:47.039> about

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
first caught your eye then about

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
first caught your eye then about
robotics<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.969> particular<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> actually

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
robotics in particular so I actually

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
robotics in particular so I actually
didn't<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.219> think<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.460> robotics<00:00:51.059> until

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
didn't really think about robotics until

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270 
didn't really think about robotics until
I<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:52.350> finishing<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.920> undergraduate

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I was finishing up my undergraduate

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
I was finishing up my undergraduate
degree<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.989> had<00:00:55.199> an<00:00:55.260> opportunity<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.649> go

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
degree and I had an opportunity to go

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.799 
degree and I had an opportunity to go
work<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.100> telecom<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.360> walking<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
work in telecom and I was walking on the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.209 
work in telecom and I was walking on the
engineering<00:00:58.230> building<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.859> saw<00:00:59.039> this

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
engineering building and I saw this

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.729 
engineering building and I saw this
poster<00:00:59.760> with<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.570> robot<00:01:00.960> crawling<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
poster with this robot crawling into a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
poster with this robot crawling into a
volcano<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> thought<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.969> know

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
volcano and I thought you know

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.530 
volcano and I thought you know
that's<00:01:04.379> awesome<00:01:04.700> you<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> could<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that's awesome you know I could go you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
that's awesome you know I could go you
know<00:01:06.780> deal<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.049> telecom<00:01:07.530> stuff<00:01:07.860> where<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
know deal with telecom stuff where I can

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
know deal with telecom stuff where I can
go<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.490> something<00:01:08.520> cool<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.030> real<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.420> i

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
go do something cool and real and i

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.760 
go do something cool and real and i
thought<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> thing<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.650> do

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
thought you know that's the thing to do

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.940 
thought you know that's the thing to do
uh-huh<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> done<00:01:12.960> since<00:01:13.200> so

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
uh-huh and what have you done since so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.609 
uh-huh and what have you done since so
i've<00:01:14.100> been<00:01:14.310> working<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.390> robotics<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
i've been working with in robotics for I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.350 
i've been working with in robotics for I
don't<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.040> 12<00:01:17.400> 13<00:01:17.640> years<00:01:17.970> something<00:01:18.240> like

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
don't know 12 13 years something like

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.719 
don't know 12 13 years something like
that<00:01:18.770> I've<00:01:19.770> been<00:01:19.950> involved<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> lot<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that I've been involved with a lot of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
that I've been involved with a lot of
vehicles<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.240> drive<00:01:21.450> themselves<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
vehicles that drive themselves and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
vehicles that drive themselves and
recently<00:01:22.950> came<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.310> Google<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.850> lead<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
recently came to Google to lead the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.359 
recently came to Google to lead the
self-driving<00:01:24.750> car<00:01:24.990> project<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
self-driving car project here got it I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
self-driving car project here got it I
understand<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> video<00:01:27.540> uid<00:01:28.380> rate<00:01:28.770> for

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
understand you have a video uid rate for

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.890 
understand you have a video uid rate for
us<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.220> little<00:01:29.340> bit<00:01:29.520> sure<00:01:30.000> yeah<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> project

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
us a little bit sure yeah the project

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
us a little bit sure yeah the project
let's<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> video<00:01:32.280> showing<00:01:32.700> our

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
let's see so this is a video showing our

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.210 
let's see so this is a video showing our
car<00:01:33.180> driving<00:01:33.630> itself<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.799> around<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> Bay

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
car driving itself in and around the Bay

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.880 
car driving itself in and around the Bay
Area<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.610> San<00:01:35.640> Francisco<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.710> could

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
Area in San Francisco so if we could

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.300 
Area in San Francisco so if we could
start<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.430> cool<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.770> build<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.070> fleet<00:01:41.250> of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
start it cool so we build a fleet of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.719 
start it cool so we build a fleet of
seven<00:01:41.790> self-driving<00:01:42.390> Priuses<00:01:43.369> take<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> Prius

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
seven self-driving Priuses take a Prius

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.780 
seven self-driving Priuses take a Prius
put<00:01:44.909> crap<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.860> take<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
put crap on it we take it out on the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
put crap on it we take it out on the
road<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.659> drive<00:01:48.899> around<00:01:49.200> so

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
road and we have it drive around so

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.929 
road and we have it drive around so
here's<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.009> freeway<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.820> do

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
here's on the freeway so we can do

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.679 
here's on the freeway so we can do
surface<00:01:51.810> roads<00:01:52.759> we<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.880> course<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
surface roads we of course do that in

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.130 
surface roads we of course do that in
traffic<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:57.270> sensors<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
traffic the sensors we have on the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.480 
traffic the sensors we have on the
vehicle<00:01:58.380> allow<00:01:58.619> us<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.829> operate<00:01:59.009> day<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
vehicle allow us to operate day and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.889 
vehicle allow us to operate day and
night<00:02:00.799> what's<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.860> planned<00:02:02.219> no<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:03.780> an

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
night what's that planned no that was an

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.800 
night what's that planned no that was an
exciting<00:02:04.140> moment<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.270> vehicles<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.719> do

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
exciting moment and the vehicles can do

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.600 
exciting moment and the vehicles can do
basically<00:02:07.380> anything<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.979> person<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.489> do

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
basically anything that a person can do

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.800 
basically anything that a person can do
so<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.030> see<00:02:09.179> all<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.330> way<00:02:09.390> around<00:02:09.539> them

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so they can see all the way around them

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
so they can see all the way around them
they<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.080> make<00:02:10.229> lane<00:02:10.440> changes<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.280> see

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
they can make lane changes we can see

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.990 
they can make lane changes we can see
pedestrians<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.270> track<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.750> we

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
pedestrians and track them we

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.790 
pedestrians and track them we
see<00:02:13.240> traffic<00:02:13.510> lights<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.200> we<00:02:14.680> have

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
see traffic lights and we have

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.980 
see traffic lights and we have
360-degree<00:02:15.610> perception<00:02:16.330> around<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.630> vehicle

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
360-degree perception around the vehicle

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.600 
360-degree perception around the vehicle
so<00:02:17.110> we<00:02:17.200> understand<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:17.770> traffic's<00:02:18.220> doing<00:02:18.490> in

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
so we understand what traffic's doing in

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.000 
so we understand what traffic's doing in
the<00:02:18.670> neighborhood<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:20.380> vehicles<00:02:20.710> can<00:02:20.860> drive

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
the neighborhood the vehicles can drive

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.830 
the neighborhood the vehicles can drive
at<00:02:21.160> freeway<00:02:21.430> speeds<00:02:21.790> they<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:22.750> it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
at freeway speeds they can do it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.150 
at freeway speeds they can do it
precisely<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.590> here<00:02:23.740> we<00:02:23.830> go<00:02:23.860> through<00:02:24.130> a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
precisely so here we go through a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.240 
precisely so here we go through a
tollbooth<00:02:25.290> they<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.440> do<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.800> urban<00:02:27.130> areas

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
tollbooth they can do it in urban areas

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.760 
tollbooth they can do it in urban areas
so<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:27.820> is<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> little<00:02:28.090> resort<00:02:28.660> town<00:02:28.900> near<00:02:29.170> San

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
so this is a little resort town near San

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.340 
so this is a little resort town near San
Francisco<00:02:30.220> all<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.240> is<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.390> car<00:02:31.720> driving<00:02:32.080> so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
Francisco all this is the car driving so

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.720 
Francisco all this is the car driving so
it's<00:02:32.470> seeing<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.770> pedestrians<00:02:33.280> reasoning

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
it's seeing the pedestrians reasoning

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.150 
it's seeing the pedestrians reasoning
about<00:02:33.910> them<00:02:34.180> moving<00:02:34.600> around<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.680> Lombard

hour does the car have an aggressiveness
setting<00:03:00.850> doesn't<00:03:01.390> yet<00:03:01.690> know<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.980> set<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:03.850> 11

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
setting doesn't yet know it's set to 11

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.570 
setting doesn't yet know it's set to 11
and<00:03:05.380> then<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.620> course<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.040> we<00:03:06.190> do<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> lot

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
and then of course you know we do a lot

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.440 
and then of course you know we do a lot
of<00:03:06.610> testing<00:03:07.600> on<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> track<00:03:08.170> as<00:03:08.380> well<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:09.489> we

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
of testing on the track as well so we

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.880 
of testing on the track as well so we
drove<00:03:10.660> where<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> Prius<00:03:11.260> drifting<00:03:11.680> team

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
drove where the Prius drifting team

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.340 
drove where the Prius drifting team
sometimes<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:13.120> part<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.660> how<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.900> works<00:03:14.140> is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
sometimes so part of how it works is

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.630 
sometimes so part of how it works is
that<00:03:14.380> we<00:03:14.560> use<00:03:14.680> some<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:14.980> best<00:03:15.190> maps<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.610> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
that we use some of the best maps in the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.090 
that we use some of the best maps in the
world<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.090> we've<00:03:16.209> taken<00:03:16.380> google<00:03:17.380> maps<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.890> you

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
world so we've taken google maps and you

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.580 
world so we've taken google maps and you
know<00:03:18.190> taking<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.670> next<00:03:18.730> level<00:03:18.970> we<00:03:19.330> have

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
know taking it to the next level we have

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.289 
know taking it to the next level we have
15<00:03:20.590> centimeter<00:03:21.070> resolution<00:03:21.700> models<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.209> the

15 centimeter resolution models of the
world<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:23.290> have<00:03:23.470> lain<00:03:23.769> level<00:03:24.130> models<00:03:24.459> of

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
world and we have lain level models of

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.130 
world and we have lain level models of
the<00:03:24.580> world<00:03:24.760> as<00:03:24.940> well<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.299> kind<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.630> feed<00:03:25.900> into

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
the world as well that kind of feed into

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.530 
the world as well that kind of feed into
the<00:03:26.170> car<00:03:26.440> how<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.799> drives<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.580> then<00:03:28.180> in<00:03:28.299> real

the car how it drives and then in real

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.210 
the car how it drives and then in real
time<00:03:28.750> we<00:03:28.930> take<00:03:29.080> laser<00:03:29.380> data<00:03:29.590> from<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.950> vehicle

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
time we take laser data from the vehicle

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.860 
time we take laser data from the vehicle
and<00:03:30.489> we<00:03:30.549> process<00:03:30.970> about<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.209> million<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.690> half

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
and we process about a million a half

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.509 
and we process about a million a half
thousand<00:03:32.380> measurements<00:03:32.799> per<00:03:32.920> second<00:03:33.340> and

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
thousand measurements per second and

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.460 
thousand measurements per second and
from<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.239> cluster<00:03:34.540> out<00:03:34.900> where<00:03:35.110> people

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
from that we cluster out where people

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.170 
from that we cluster out where people
are<00:03:35.620> where<00:03:35.799> other<00:03:35.920> vehicles<00:03:36.400> are<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:37.090> are

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
are where other vehicles are and are

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.050 
are where other vehicles are and are
able<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.390> track<00:03:37.630> them<00:03:37.870> bicycles<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.590> whatnot

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
able to track them bicycles and whatnot

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.670 
able to track them bicycles and whatnot
we've<00:03:40.060> also<00:03:40.239> done<00:03:40.450> some<00:03:40.510> work<00:03:40.750> with<00:03:40.810> radar<00:03:41.320> so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
we've also done some work with radar so

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.009 
we've also done some work with radar so
here<00:03:41.950> this<00:03:42.070> is<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.790> radar<00:03:43.299> like<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:43.660> might<00:03:43.840> have

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
here this is a radar like you might have

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.420 
here this is a radar like you might have
in<00:03:44.170> your<00:03:44.320> expensive<00:03:44.769> luxury<00:03:45.070> car<00:03:45.250> for

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
in your expensive luxury car for

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.220 
in your expensive luxury car for
adaptive<00:03:45.790> cruise<00:03:45.940> control<00:03:46.060> we've<00:03:46.780> taken<00:03:47.019> that

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
adaptive cruise control we've taken that

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.140 
adaptive cruise control we've taken that
refine<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.739> algorithms<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.519> then<00:03:48.730> use<00:03:49.120> that

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
refine the algorithms and then use that

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.670 
refine the algorithms and then use that
to<00:03:49.329> make<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.570> thing<00:03:49.750> work<00:03:49.930> incredible

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.860 

so<00:03:57.680> from<00:03:57.920> your<00:03:58.100> point<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.520> view<00:03:58.580> is<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.690> aim

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
so from your point of view is the aim

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.650 
so from your point of view is the aim
here<00:03:59.920> just<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.040> deliver<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.640> really<00:04:02.090> cool<00:04:02.330> car

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
here just to deliver a really cool car

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.840 
here just to deliver a really cool car
that<00:04:02.900> drives<00:04:03.080> well<00:04:03.470> or<00:04:03.740> is<00:04:03.860> there<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.100> larger

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
that drives well or is there a larger

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.270 
that drives well or is there a larger
strategy<00:04:05.390> of<00:04:05.720> foot<00:04:05.900> so<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.710> you<00:04:06.800> know<00:04:06.980> our<00:04:07.100> our

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
strategy of foot so so you know our our

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.370 
strategy of foot so so you know our our
goal<00:04:07.460> at<00:04:07.580> Google<00:04:07.910> is<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.330> advance<00:04:09.200> this

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
goal at Google is to advance this

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.810 
goal at Google is to advance this
technology<00:04:09.920> we<00:04:10.010> think<00:04:10.220> in<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.430> long<00:04:10.580> term

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
technology we think in the long term

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.640 
technology we think in the long term
this<00:04:11.060> has<00:04:11.240> got<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.540> tremendous<00:04:11.960> societal

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
this has got a tremendous societal

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.860 
this has got a tremendous societal
benefit<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.550> worldwide<00:04:14.360> there's<00:04:14.630> something

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
benefit so worldwide there's something

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.600 
benefit so worldwide there's something
like<00:04:14.990> 1.2<00:04:15.590> million<00:04:15.920> people<00:04:16.040> killed<00:04:16.459> in

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
like 1.2 million people killed in

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.000 
like 1.2 million people killed in
traffic<00:04:16.820> accidents<00:04:17.090> each<00:04:17.570> year<00:04:17.680> if<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.830> look

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
traffic accidents each year if you look

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.770 
traffic accidents each year if you look
at<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.130> utilization<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.880> automobiles<00:04:20.390> to<00:04:20.630> the

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
at the utilization of automobiles to the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.120 
at the utilization of automobiles to the
day<00:04:20.930> it's<00:04:21.140> about<00:04:21.230> three<00:04:21.620> percent<00:04:21.770> in<00:04:22.100> the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
day it's about three percent in the

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.920 
day it's about three percent in the
developed<00:04:22.550> world<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.000> by<00:04:23.150> car<00:04:23.420> it<00:04:23.630> sits

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
developed world to you by car it sits

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.210 
developed world to you by car it sits
there<00:04:24.140> ninety-seven<00:04:24.680> percent<00:04:24.740> of<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.070> time

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
there ninety-seven percent of the time

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.130 
there ninety-seven percent of the time
by<00:04:25.790> developing<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.330> technology<00:04:26.390> in<00:04:27.050> the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
by developing this technology in the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.660 
by developing this technology in the
long<00:04:27.320> term<00:04:27.500> we<00:04:27.620> think<00:04:27.830> we<00:04:27.920> can<00:04:27.950> reduce<00:04:28.400> traffic

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
long term we think we can reduce traffic

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.100 
long term we think we can reduce traffic
accidents<00:04:29.240> we<00:04:29.300> can<00:04:29.420> give<00:04:29.540> people<00:04:29.570> back<00:04:29.930> their

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
accidents we can give people back their

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.270 
accidents we can give people back their
time<00:04:30.320> when<00:04:30.470> they're<00:04:30.620> driving<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.070> we<00:04:31.130> can

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
time when they're driving and we can

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.770 
time when they're driving and we can
make<00:04:31.430> better<00:04:31.580> uses<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.150> resources<00:04:32.600> we<00:04:32.750> have

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
make better uses the resources we have

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.340 
make better uses the resources we have
