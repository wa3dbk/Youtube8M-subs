 true this car is the surprise is the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 it is the surprise is the one that most agrees 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.510

 I am a hipster is the end I read as 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.079
 I'm not going to see where it is 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670
 You can buy before anything if that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.989
 you get out of the car too that there's 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.940
 problem let's see where we can 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.039
 buy this car so we can see which 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.140
 which not because many may not 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.629
 you have no idea what car it is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.980
 from this one here in lampa that and fixed 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.439

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.590
 Italian by name 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.659
 but good it costs 400 thousand dollars eyes 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.090
 It's not turkey mous , it's not turkey moo 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.740
 car that costs money so something 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.540
 have to have something something special has 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 to have in this car so for the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.520
 that you have not bought it, let's see what 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.799
 we can make this vehicle that is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 quite handsome is like that a tone a touch 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.090
 old not a touch of retro a touch 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.830
 retro but hey is that to see how you 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.229
 we left after tuning what is this 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.330
 car as I say may be the surprise I 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 no, there is not one, I do not know, 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.530
 I know what we can put on so we go 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.490
 let's give cane not the shield as 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.929
 we are always going to fuck him 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.080
 let's put the brakes also brakes 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.490
 of racing to see if he gives me to be able to 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.619
 pay all I think I think so 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.869
 it's worth the level 4 engine upgrade all 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.250
 this we make always the same tube 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.569
 of leak let's see what exhaust pipe 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.069
 it has good exhaust pipes not 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.319
 they change a lot but let's put the 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.929
 more expensive is worth it if I run out of money 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.659
 Well, at least we call it brown 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.020

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.460

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.060
 I really like carbon, I'm going to 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.620

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.960

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.700
 put the xenon lights always the 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.590
 xenon lights always paint color 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.110
 main one to put a metallic one a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.820
 mentalized metalized let's see what 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.820
 color landmarks there are here in the metallized 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.819
 the color came to touch the chumi, not because no 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.590
 let's put a bronze a bronze not 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.180
 minor is that bronze I do not like the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.280
 I do not like bronze either, I'm going to the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.389
 oranges pulled me orange orange 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.700
 orange orange where are you orange go 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.219

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.870
 dawn orange dawn that will not have 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.790

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.340
 Dawn is well very well in tomato 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.459

 I do not like garnet red garnet 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.200
 alomejor red perhaps nothing the pink fisher 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.900
 I play the game to take by ass we do not see 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.939
 orange here and orange is perfect and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.169
 then we're going to put a face on that 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.760
 is going to mix very well with the orange 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:38.319
 how can the bright orange maybe 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.349
 racing yellow let's see how 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.180
 the colors merge because you have to 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.389
 merge you do not have to merge it so that 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.489
 look like a car then double blue color 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.750
 back to take for ultra blue ass no 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.790
 has nothing to do with one color with another 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.430
 but it is that it gives me exactly the same with 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.129
 secondary secondary 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.650

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.620
 it is important a metallic we will see 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.420

 Clicking on wheels told me and scratching

 it's been interesting 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.389
 I think so, because we're ready 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.130
 to go to the cries to the cries to 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.599
 the snow because you put some equipment 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.729

 a tiger does not and the truth is to the skin there 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.479
