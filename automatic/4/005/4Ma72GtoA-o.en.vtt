what they're trying to do is they're
trying<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.169> wrap<00:04:25.350> through<00:04:25.590> be<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:27.419> do

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
trying to wrap through be and I do

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.720 
trying to wrap through be and I do
really<00:04:27.900> like<00:04:28.140> what<00:04:28.350> they<00:04:28.440> did<00:04:28.650> blush<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.550> those

really like what they did blush of those

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.159 
really like what they did blush of those
shuts<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.150> down

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
shuts it down

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.929 
shuts it down
get<00:04:31.499> some<00:04:33.469> two<00:04:34.469> kills<00:04:34.770> there<00:04:35.039> and<00:04:35.279> holds<00:04:35.879> the

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
get some two kills there and holds the

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.850 
get some two kills there and holds the
construction<00:04:36.449> does<00:04:37.229> a<00:04:37.259> lot<00:04:37.439> of<00:04:37.499> damage<00:04:37.710> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
construction does a lot of damage the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.600 
construction does a lot of damage the
happiest<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.830> point<00:04:41.009> of<00:04:41.129> the<00:04:41.219> shot<00:04:41.430> was

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
happiest so the point of the shot was

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.909 
happiest so the point of the shot was
they<00:04:41.789> got<00:04:41.939> a<00:04:41.969> smoke<00:04:42.270> here<00:04:42.620> then<00:04:43.620> they<00:04:43.740> got<00:04:43.860> a

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
they got a smoke here then they got a

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.439 
they got a smoke here then they got a
smoke<00:04:44.249> here<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.729> then<00:04:45.090> we're<00:04:45.180> going<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.360> go

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
smoke here and then we're going to go

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.300 
smoke here and then we're going to go
through<00:04:45.689> those<00:04:45.960> smokes<00:04:46.349> rap<00:04:46.919> in<00:04:47.129> through

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
through those smokes rap in through

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.980 
through those smokes rap in through
construction<00:04:47.669> while<00:04:48.060> flashing<00:04:48.389> oversight

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
construction while flashing oversight

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.260 
construction while flashing oversight
and<00:04:49.199> then<00:04:49.740> finally<00:04:50.310> go<00:04:50.520> towards<00:04:50.819> generator

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
and then finally go towards generator

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.409 
and then finally go towards generator
and<00:04:51.479> hit<00:04:51.629> site<00:04:51.840> together<00:04:52.020> through<00:04:52.979> the

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
and hit site together through the

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.869 
and hit site together through the

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
through the spindle on the back up so

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.119 
through the spindle on the back up so
it's<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.449> really<00:04:57.629> good<00:04:57.810> strat<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:59.039> they

it's a really good strat it's just they

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.989 
it's a really good strat it's just they
didn't<00:04:59.340> performing<00:04:59.789> quite<00:04:59.879> as<00:05:01.789> didn't<00:05:02.789> really

didn't performing quite as didn't really
get<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.240> flashes<00:05:03.599> been<00:05:03.749> at<00:05:03.930> Bosh<00:05:04.139> bangs<00:05:04.409> too

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
get the flashes been at Bosh bangs too

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.379 
get the flashes been at Bosh bangs too
well<00:05:04.740> because<00:05:05.009> flush<00:05:05.279> got<00:05:05.969> a<00:05:05.999> good<00:05:06.150> counter

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
well because flush got a good counter

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.360 
well because flush got a good counter
flash<00:05:06.599> as<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.289> saw<00:05:07.409> apex<00:05:07.830> was<00:05:07.979> blind<00:05:08.249> there

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370

really played it really well let's watch
the<00:05:12.060> let's<00:05:12.360> watch<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:12.659> trunk<00:05:12.930> watch<00:05:13.110> this

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
the let's watch this trunk watch this

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.239 
the let's watch this trunk watch this
point<00:05:13.409> of<00:05:13.499> view<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.710> just<00:05:13.860> see<00:05:13.979> where<00:05:14.129> they

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:14.249 
point of view and just see where they

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:16.909 
point of view and just see where they
went<00:05:14.279> wrong<00:05:14.460> here<00:05:14.849> so<00:05:15.509> flusher<00:05:15.870> right<00:05:16.020> here<00:05:16.259> he

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
went wrong here so flusher right here he

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.269 
went wrong here so flusher right here he
sees<00:05:17.189> the<00:05:17.370> flash<00:05:17.580> calm<00:05:17.879> and<00:05:18.889> you<00:05:19.889> really<00:05:20.129> just

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
sees the flash calm and you really just

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.519 
sees the flash calm and you really just
doesn't<00:05:20.610> get<00:05:20.669> mine<00:05:20.999> done<00:05:21.029> all<00:05:21.449> their<00:05:22.050> flashes

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
doesn't get mine done all their flashes

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.140 
doesn't get mine done all their flashes
went<00:05:22.740> too<00:05:22.949> deep<00:05:24.529> and<00:05:25.529> now<00:05:26.460> let's<00:05:26.639> watch<00:05:26.819> what

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
went too deep and now let's watch what

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.760 
went too deep and now let's watch what
devil<00:05:27.599> off<00:05:27.749> is<00:05:27.900> doing<00:05:28.199> here

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.550 

so<00:05:35.940> really<00:05:36.940> if<00:05:37.360> ldl-c<00:05:37.870> would<00:05:38.170> have<00:05:38.290> just<00:05:38.440> got

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
so really if ldl-c would have just got

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.890 
so really if ldl-c would have just got
their<00:05:38.710> flashbangs<00:05:39.190> better<00:05:39.430> right<00:05:39.640> there<00:05:39.900> they

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
their flashbangs better right there they

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.550 
their flashbangs better right there they
would<00:05:41.110> have<00:05:41.230> been<00:05:41.410> able<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.650> win<00:05:41.830> that<00:05:41.950> round<00:05:42.130> I

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
would have been able to win that round I

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
would have been able to win that round I
think<00:05:44.560> while<00:05:44.770> coming<00:05:45.130> through<00:05:45.280> here<00:05:45.430> they

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
think while coming through here they

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.130 
think while coming through here they
should<00:05:45.730> just<00:05:45.760> bounce<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.300> flashbang<00:05:46.780> off<00:05:46.960> this

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
should just bounce a flashbang off this

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.230 
should just bounce a flashbang off this
wall<00:05:47.410> maybe<00:05:47.650> maybe<00:05:48.610> that<00:05:48.820> would<00:05:48.970> be<00:05:49.000> better

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
wall maybe maybe that would be better

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.730 
wall maybe maybe that would be better
i'm<00:05:49.540> not<00:05:49.690> exact<00:05:50.260> time<00:05:50.410> not<00:05:50.530> one<00:05:50.620> hundred

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
i'm not exact time not one hundred

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.590 
i'm not exact time not one hundred
percent<00:05:50.920> sure<00:05:51.190> but<00:05:51.520> flashes<00:05:52.240> they<00:05:52.330> threw

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
percent sure but flashes they threw

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.420 
percent sure but flashes they threw
didn't<00:05:53.200> really<00:05:53.350> get<00:05:53.470> flush<00:05:53.710> em<00:05:53.890> and<00:05:54.130> that<00:05:54.310> was

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
didn't really get flush em and that was

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.800 
didn't really get flush em and that was
like<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:54.730> manners<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.090> they<00:05:55.240> lost<00:05:55.360> I<00:05:55.540> round
