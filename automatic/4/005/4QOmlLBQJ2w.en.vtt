00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.360
 in motorsport the topic is already longer 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.799
 known only with good tires you can 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 also be successful 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.980
 you do not need it on the street 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.270
 necessarily success only security 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.890
 and if you think about that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.720
 footprint of four tires 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 maybe as big as a din a4 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.599
 sheet then it becomes clear here you should 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.009
 do not save 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.630
 dealing with a lot of money 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.369
 earns it now, the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.950
 Manufacturers from Eastern Europe and China 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.510
 Many of these cheap brands are known 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.440
 also offer mature the sporty 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.149
 dimensions 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.080
 we have tires from six manufacturers 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.490
 in size 215 45 17 on their us 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.080
 properties tested 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.000
 for reference we have one 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.910
 European brands manufacturer used 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.720
 the test vehicles are standard vw 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.720
 golf gti 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.790
 a special hard and software of 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 latest generation ensures accurate 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.720
 Measurement results 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.940
 All data are recorded on board 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.380
 after successful preparation by 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.900
 the specialists will be the first 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.550
 Reference tires from 100 km / h one 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.550
 full braking in wet conditions 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.450
 Compare to the left of the reference tire 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:35.229
 and on the right the worst candidate 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:38.860
 the naz stunt from 100 km / h actually 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.660
 a frightening result our 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.700
 test results have shown the 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.090
 Cheap tires can be life-threatening 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.820
 his 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.880
 a mature pointed a lengthened 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.710
 braking distance of 13 meters at 100 km on man 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.320
 May I think about 180 km / h? 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.700
 easy at 40 meters 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.039
 even the best of the cheap tires has 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.420
 Compared to the references one about 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.979
 six meter longer braking distance 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.329
 how good or bad a mature is 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.969
 is also evident in aquaplaning 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.550
 Behavior of the reference tire remains 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.709
 80 km h in the track and does not float 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.709
 on for comparison a cheap tire 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.269
 immediately when driving over the nas 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.489
 The cheap tire floats on the surface 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.290
 the car understeers massive and can 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.709
 even by vehemently refusing 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.900
 more on course 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.540
 straight vehicle owner of sporty 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.150
 Vehicles should not necessarily be on 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.780
 resort to cheap products such as 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.909
 from China 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.349
 because these show even at low 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.849
 speeds from 100 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.040
 hourly kilometer devastating 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.959
 characteristics and are partly in the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.659
 aquaplaning behavior dangerous 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.370
 is the aquaplaning test result in 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.889
 Comparison of the worst tires 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.579
 makes just 58 percent of 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:02.829
 efficiency of referencing 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.780
 then it went on the approximately 16 kilometer 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.579
 long handling course already at 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.169
 start missing in the willy attack 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.510
 Traction and golf with the 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.459
 reference frame drives the cheap 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.049
 Tire has no chance there is one 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.579
 bad grip level none 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.590
 side guide violent 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.750
 load change reactions already at very 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.470
 slower speed and no 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.870
 traction 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.579
 only the masse can mature at two 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.859
 keep up to some extent here 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.349
 the worst pneu needed in the test 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.359
 for a round on the test course almost 13 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.659
 seconds more than the reference tire 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.659
 from dunlop 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.990
 Overall, the tires are cutting 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.930
 Chinese manufacturer especially 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.840
 bad from no matter whether bremsweg aquaplaning 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.910
 test or handling course they always prove 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.980
 the back places 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.570
 Some of these will be cheap 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.830
 as a summer tire even with m &amp; s 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.530
 labeling distributed 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.200
 we can only advise against it there 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.070
 the test results in wet behavior 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.810
 were devastating to the catastrophic ones 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.400
 driving characteristics of many so-called 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.160
 cheap tires but still comes 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.290
 Another shortcoming is the price of cheap 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.900
 By now, brands are so high that 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.630
 already for 25 30 euros more 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.610
 brand tires gets the essential 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.800
 but who are still better at the picture 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.090
 should want to grab the goods 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.830
 at least about test results 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.150
 inform 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.680
 100 euros more for one set 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.380
 brand tires are thus a good one 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.380
 investment for and with security
