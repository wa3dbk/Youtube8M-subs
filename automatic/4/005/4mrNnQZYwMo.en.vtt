so<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> little<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:27.930> shorter<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
so it's just a little bit shorter if it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
so it's just a little bit shorter if it
was<00:01:28.770> healthier<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> more<00:01:29.610> manageable<00:01:30.030> easier

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
was healthier and more manageable easier

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.649 
was healthier and more manageable easier
and<00:01:30.810> quicker<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.380> wash<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.770> style<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:32.659> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and quicker to wash in style now and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450 
and quicker to wash in style now and
also<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.439> feels<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.340> more

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
also it just feels like a little more

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
also it just feels like a little more
thicker<00:01:35.729> around<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.360> face<00:01:36.570> area<00:01:37.040> previously

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
thicker around the face area previously

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.130 
thicker around the face area previously
my<00:01:38.520> long<00:01:38.729> layer<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.659> too<00:01:39.900> long

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
my long layer was a little bit too long

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
my long layer was a little bit too long
and<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.710> short<00:01:40.740> earlier<00:01:41.250> they<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.670> didn't

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and the short earlier they just didn't

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
and the short earlier they just didn't
really<00:01:42.060> meet<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.720> kind<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.049> massive

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
really meet there was kind of a massive

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.260 
really meet there was kind of a massive
gap<00:01:43.710> between<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.250> two<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.939> want<00:01:45.119> them<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
gap between the two and I want them to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880 
gap between the two and I want them to
meet<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> little<00:01:45.899> middle<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> little<00:01:46.680> bit

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
meet in the little middle a little bit

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.280 
meet in the little middle a little bit
more<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.540> my<00:01:48.659> hair<00:01:48.869> cut<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> little

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
more so I can get my hair cut a little

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.080 
more so I can get my hair cut a little
bit<00:01:49.380> more<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.890> length<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.490> will<00:01:50.670> always<00:01:50.850> have

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
bit more one length I will always have

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
bit more one length I will always have
my<00:01:51.149> layers<00:01:51.509> around<00:01:51.810> my<00:01:51.930> face<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.320> because<00:01:52.380> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
my layers around my face just because I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.690 
my layers around my face just because I
feel<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.740> layers<00:01:53.100> around<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> face<00:01:53.520> when

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
feel like layers around the face when

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.120 
feel like layers around the face when
you<00:01:53.759> frame<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.299> face<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.140> long<00:01:55.710> kind<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
you frame the face and long kind of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.330 
you frame the face and long kind of
straight<00:01:56.880> hair<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.600> look<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> bit<00:01:57.960> drab

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
straight hair can just look a bit drab

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.649 
straight hair can just look a bit drab
so<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.399> always<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> layers<00:02:00.329> around<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
so I always have the layers around the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.780 
so I always have the layers around the
face<00:02:00.869> however<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:02.399> wanted<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.670> get<00:02:02.759> a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
face however I just wanted to get a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.429 
face however I just wanted to get a
little<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.060> shorter<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.420> these<00:02:03.780> these<00:02:04.170> kind

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
little bit shorter so these these kind

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.730 
little bit shorter so these these kind
of<00:02:04.500> shorter<00:02:04.920> layers<00:02:05.070> back<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:06.320> can<00:02:07.320> meet<00:02:07.530> up

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
of shorter layers back here can meet up

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
of shorter layers back here can meet up
and<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.819> get<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.030> cut<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> little<00:02:09.539> bit<00:02:09.629> more

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and I can get it cut a little bit more

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.150 
and I can get it cut a little bit more
one<00:02:10.080> length<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.619> because<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> bit<00:02:11.129> more

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
one length just because it's a bit more

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.610 
one length just because it's a bit more
of<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> grown-up<00:02:11.550> style<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.270> bit

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
of a grown-up style it's a bit

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.619 
of a grown-up style it's a bit
