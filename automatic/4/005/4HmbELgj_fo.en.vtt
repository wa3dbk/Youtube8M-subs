did was i took my cheese to end it with
I<00:00:23.519> had<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.060> part<00:00:24.359> down<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> side<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.890> just

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
I had a part down the side and I just

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.960 
I had a part down the side and I just
grated<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:28.170> tooth<00:00:28.410> spur<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:29.099> stranded<00:00:29.670> twist

all of them together on one on two sides

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.459 
all of them together on one on two sides
so<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> looked<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> had<00:00:33.630> toothpick<00:00:34.260> tail

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and let it dry like that all day so that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.880
