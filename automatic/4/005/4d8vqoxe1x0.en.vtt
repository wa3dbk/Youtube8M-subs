Nintendo<00:00:36.600> devastated<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> gaming<00:00:37.739> community

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
Nintendo devastated the gaming community

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.590 
Nintendo devastated the gaming community
with<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> announcement<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.030> Zelda<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.540> Wii

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
with the announcement that Zelda for Wii

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
with the announcement that Zelda for Wii
U<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:39.989> most<00:00:40.230> likely<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.770> delayed<00:00:41.059> perhaps

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
U will most likely be delayed perhaps

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.610 
U will most likely be delayed perhaps
this<00:00:42.270> means<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.809> need<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> few<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.440> months

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
this means they need a few more months

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.400 
this means they need a few more months
to<00:00:43.890> fix<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.340> bugs<00:00:44.489> some<00:00:45.059> glitches<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.899> add<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to fix some bugs some glitches and add a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.069 
to fix some bugs some glitches and add a
little<00:00:46.680> bit<00:00:46.860> more<00:00:46.890> content<00:00:47.550> or<00:00:48.480> perhaps<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
little bit more content or perhaps it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
little bit more content or perhaps it
means<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> development<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> take<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
means the development is going to take a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
means the development is going to take a
few<00:00:50.940> more<00:00:51.120> years<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.750> they<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.020> cut<00:00:52.260> away<00:00:52.379> some

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
few more years so they can cut away some

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
few more years so they can cut away some
of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> content<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.610> lacked<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> quality

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
of the content that lacked in quality

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
of the content that lacked in quality
and<00:00:54.780> add<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.260> some<00:00:55.500> new<00:00:55.710> unique<00:00:56.070> gameplay

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and add in some new unique gameplay

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
and add in some new unique gameplay
mechanics<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> make<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> best<00:00:57.840> Zelda<00:00:58.320> game

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
mechanics to make it the best Zelda game

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.529 
mechanics to make it the best Zelda game
possible<00:00:59.010> either<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.699> we<00:01:00.149> should<00:01:00.329> remember

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
possible either way we should remember

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.299 
possible either way we should remember
that<00:01:00.809> delays<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.289> only<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> best<00:01:02.070> in

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that delays are only for the best in

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.060 
that delays are only for the best in
this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> Nintendo's<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> ensure<00:01:04.619> us<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
this is Nintendo's way to ensure us that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.649 
this is Nintendo's way to ensure us that
we're<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.850> best<00:01:06.150> Zelda<00:01:06.630> game

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
we're going to get the best Zelda game

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.410 
we're going to get the best Zelda game
that<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.170> possibly<00:01:07.409> imagine

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
that we can possibly imagine

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.820 
that we can possibly imagine
however<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:10.049> must<00:01:10.350> take<00:01:10.590> into

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
however we also must take into

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.679 
however we also must take into
consideration<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.880> may<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> only

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
consideration that this may be the only

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
consideration that this may be the only
original<00:01:12.960> Zelda<00:01:13.500> title<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> Wii<00:01:14.280> U<00:01:14.310> so

what<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.360> Nintendo<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> fill<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> gap

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
