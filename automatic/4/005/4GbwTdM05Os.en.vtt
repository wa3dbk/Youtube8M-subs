00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:06.039 
computer the stock fan that was on the

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:09.299 
computer the stock fan that was on the
inside<00:00:06.399> here<00:00:06.729> I<00:00:06.910> removed<00:00:07.779> and<00:00:08.140> bought<00:00:09.040> an<00:00:09.160> 80

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
inside here I removed and bought an 80

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.030 
inside here I removed and bought an 80
millimeter<00:00:09.730> fan<00:00:09.969> I<00:00:10.440> didn't<00:00:11.440> know<00:00:11.530> the<00:00:11.710> fan<00:00:11.889> on

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
millimeter fan I didn't know the fan on

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.409 
millimeter fan I didn't know the fan on
the<00:00:12.099> inside<00:00:12.460> was<00:00:12.669> bigger<00:00:12.849> than<00:00:13.000> a<00:00:13.089> email<00:00:13.299> in

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.419 
the inside was bigger than a email in

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.600 
the inside was bigger than a email in
there<00:00:13.540> looks<00:00:13.750> like<00:00:13.809> a<00:00:13.900> ninety<00:00:14.320> but<00:00:14.589> I<00:00:14.980> rigged

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
there looks like a ninety but I rigged

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.830 
there looks like a ninety but I rigged
it<00:00:15.759> so<00:00:15.820> it<00:00:16.059> works<00:00:16.350> here's<00:00:17.350> the<00:00:17.500> airflow<00:00:18.630> as<00:00:19.630> you

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
it so it works here's the airflow as you

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.910 
it so it works here's the airflow as you
could<00:00:19.990> see<00:00:20.199> piece<00:00:21.189> of<00:00:21.340> paper<00:00:21.519> is<00:00:22.230> holding<00:00:23.230> by

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
could see piece of paper is holding by

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.380 
could see piece of paper is holding by
itself<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:25.900> back<00:00:26.199> here<00:00:27.119> there<00:00:28.119> is<00:00:28.240> now

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
itself and on the back here there is now

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.500 
itself and on the back here there is now
two<00:00:28.449> 80<00:00:28.960> millimeter<00:00:29.470> fan<00:00:30.929> which<00:00:31.929> you<00:00:32.110> can<00:00:32.259> see

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
two 80 millimeter fan which you can see

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.720 
two 80 millimeter fan which you can see
the<00:00:34.510> paper<00:00:34.780> is<00:00:34.960> just<00:00:35.079> crazy<00:00:35.440> there's<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.460> lot<00:00:36.640> of

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
the paper is just crazy there's a lot of

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.180 
the paper is just crazy there's a lot of
airflow<00:00:37.079> guess<00:00:38.079> it's<00:00:38.260> kind<00:00:38.469> of<00:00:38.530> hard<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.770> see

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
but if I go on the inside here take the

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.299 
but if I go on the inside here take the
case<00:00:49.840> off<00:00:51.840> there's<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:53.050> -<00:00:53.260> turn<00:00:53.949> it<00:00:54.070> sideways

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
case off there's the - turn it sideways

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.889 
case off there's the - turn it sideways
here<00:00:54.809> there's<00:00:55.809> my<00:00:55.930> 80<00:00:56.680> millimeter<00:00:57.129> fans

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
here there's my 80 millimeter fans

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.490 
here there's my 80 millimeter fans
blowing<00:00:58.899> air<00:00:59.079> out<00:00:59.230> the<00:01:00.010> backside<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.789> case

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
blowing air out the backside of the case

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.030 
blowing air out the backside of the case
and<00:01:02.890> on<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.280> front

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.870 

this<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.490> where<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:06.700> rigged<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.350> new<00:01:08.530> fan<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
this is where I rigged the new fan and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.460 
this is where I rigged the new fan and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
you can see let me get my piece of paper

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.770 
you can see let me get my piece of paper
here

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.219 

you<00:01:20.260> can<00:01:20.409> seen<00:01:20.619> it's<00:01:20.740> pretty<00:01:20.950> strong<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:22.720> fans

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
you can seen it's pretty strong all fans

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.160 
you can seen it's pretty strong all fans
the<00:01:24.070> three<00:01:24.369> fans<00:01:24.640> as<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.600> can<00:01:25.900> see<00:01:26.049> are

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
the three fans as you can see are

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.740 
the three fans as you can see are
directly<00:01:26.560> connected<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.030> molex<00:01:28.479> power

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
directly connected to a molex power
