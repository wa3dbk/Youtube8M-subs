00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.429 
planes I think it can be applied some of
the<00:03:55.150> business<00:03:55.540> jets<00:03:55.870> where<00:03:56.140> you're<00:03:56.290> talking

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
the business jets where you're talking

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.509 
the business jets where you're talking
about<00:03:56.859> 10<00:03:57.609> 12<00:03:58.000> 14<00:03:58.359> passengers<00:03:59.049> perhaps<00:03:59.590> that

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
about 10 12 14 passengers perhaps that

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.220 
about 10 12 14 passengers perhaps that
would<00:04:00.639> have<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.849> be<00:04:00.909> really<00:04:01.030> really

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
would have to be really really

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.440 
would have to be really really
investigated<00:04:02.230> closely<00:04:02.469> but<00:04:03.400> for<00:04:03.639> application

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
investigated closely but for application

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.179 
investigated closely but for application
to<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.689> transport<00:04:05.470> you're<00:04:05.680> not<00:04:05.799> going<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.010> see

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
to a transport you're not going to see

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.580 
to a transport you're not going to see
that<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.609> structural<00:04:07.150> requirements<00:04:08.109> for<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
that the structural requirements for the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.520 
that the structural requirements for the
aircraft<00:04:08.739> would<00:04:09.220> be<00:04:09.689> enormous<00:04:10.689> to<00:04:11.200> handle

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
aircraft would be enormous to handle

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.569 
aircraft would be enormous to handle
that<00:04:11.650> as<00:04:11.799> well<00:04:11.980> as<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.310> design

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
that as well as the design

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.490 
that as well as the design
characteristics<00:04:13.299> for<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.510> shoot<00:04:13.750> itself<00:04:14.169> to

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
characteristics for the shoot itself to

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.009 
characteristics for the shoot itself to
be<00:04:14.650> able<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:14.889> take<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.819> energy<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.810> large

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
be able to take the energy of a large

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.509 
be able to take the energy of a large
transport<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:17.949> you're<00:04:18.099> not<00:04:18.190> going<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.370> be<00:04:18.459> able

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
transport so you're not going to be able

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.479 
transport so you're not going to be able
to<00:04:18.759> use<00:04:19.150> this<00:04:19.419> efficiently<00:04:20.380> on<00:04:20.590> anything<00:04:21.099> of

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
to use this efficiently on anything of

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.950 
to use this efficiently on anything of
much<00:04:21.789> size<00:04:22.090> greater<00:04:22.630> than<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.840> general

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
much size greater than the general

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.300 
much size greater than the general
aviation<00:04:23.259> aircraft

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
aviation aircraft

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.670 
aviation aircraft
so<00:04:24.610> Lisa<00:04:24.820> why<00:04:25.210> is<00:04:25.270> NASA<00:04:25.660> working<00:04:26.110> on<00:04:26.380> this<00:04:26.500> type

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
so Lisa why is NASA working on this type

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.219 
so Lisa why is NASA working on this type
of<00:04:26.710> project<00:04:27.030> nASA<00:04:28.030> has<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.389> perfect<00:04:29.050> couple

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
of project nASA has a perfect couple

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.469 
of project nASA has a perfect couple
aviation<00:04:29.710> safety<00:04:29.889> programs<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:31.000> in<00:04:31.240> that

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
aviation safety programs and in that

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.150 
aviation safety programs and in that
we're<00:04:31.780> looking<00:04:31.990> at<00:04:32.349> different<00:04:32.740> types<00:04:32.949> of

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
we're looking at different types of

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.790 
we're looking at different types of
things<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.669> improve<00:04:34.030> safety<00:04:34.449> everywhere<00:04:35.110> some

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
things to improve safety everywhere some

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.170 
things to improve safety everywhere some
of<00:04:35.919> that<00:04:36.070> in<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.460> early<00:04:36.639> part<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.849> the<00:04:36.970> program

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
of that in the early part of the program

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.000 
of that in the early part of the program
is<00:04:37.240> focused<00:04:37.419> on<00:04:37.750> general<00:04:37.990> aviation<00:04:38.080> there<00:04:38.889> are

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
is focused on general aviation there are

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.950 
is focused on general aviation there are
thousand<00:04:39.400> wives<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.789> year<00:04:40.000> lost<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.720> general

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
thousand wives a year lost to general

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.899 
thousand wives a year lost to general
aviation<00:04:41.050> accidents<00:04:42.039> and<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:42.669> type<00:04:42.880> of

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
aviation accidents and this type of

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.689 
aviation accidents and this type of
system<00:04:43.900> can<00:04:44.169> really<00:04:44.620> improve<00:04:45.039> those<00:04:45.310> numbers

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
system can really improve those numbers

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.070 
system can really improve those numbers
and<00:04:45.849> hopefully<00:04:46.000> get<00:04:46.270> those<00:04:46.479> down<00:04:46.720> where<00:04:46.990> we

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
and hopefully get those down where we

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.629 
and hopefully get those down where we
see<00:04:47.409> a<00:04:47.440> lot<00:04:47.710> more<00:04:47.889> people<00:04:48.039> walking<00:04:48.430> away<00:04:48.520> from

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
see a lot more people walking away from

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.390 
see a lot more people walking away from
accidents

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.880
