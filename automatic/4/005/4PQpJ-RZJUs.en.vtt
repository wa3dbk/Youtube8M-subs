first part is actually pretty simple all

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
first part is actually pretty simple all
it<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.360> inside<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:50.690> it's<00:00:51.690> around<00:00:52.050> it's

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
approximately about four inches plastic

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.240 
approximately about four inches plastic
cover<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.320> turn<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
cover I'm going to do just turn it and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.720 
cover I'm going to do just turn it and
open<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
open it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.279 
open it
I<00:00:59.760> remember<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.660> hand<00:01:00.870> drill<00:01:01.079> right

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I remember the right hand drill right

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.840 
I remember the right hand drill right
and<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.590> using<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:01.980> left<00:01:02.190> hand<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> right

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and I'm using my left hand but the right

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
and I'm using my left hand but the right
hand<00:01:03.030> roll<00:01:03.180> means<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:03.989> whatever

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
hand roll means that you know whatever

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
hand roll means that you know whatever
the<00:01:04.739> directions<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.369> comes<00:01:05.610> whatever<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the directions if it comes whatever the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.690 
the directions if it comes whatever the
direction<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.710> fingers<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> thumb<00:01:08.189> follows

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
direction with fingers the thumb follows

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
direction with fingers the thumb follows
so<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.360> case<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.990> turn<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.350> way

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
so in this case if I turn it this way

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.550 
so in this case if I turn it this way
that<00:01:11.400> will<00:01:11.549> lock<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.360> turn<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.960> opposite

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that will lock and if I turn it opposite

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
that will lock and if I turn it opposite
day<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.189> means<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.820> coming<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.240> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
day that's what means is coming out this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.910 
day that's what means is coming out this
way<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> opens<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.830> called

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
way so it opens up way this is called

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.429 
way so it opens up way this is called
the<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.189> hand<00:01:17.400> rule<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.140> yeah<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> was

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the right hand rule so yeah and I was

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.600 
the right hand rule so yeah and I was
just<00:01:19.560> thinking<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.549> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
just thinking but now that's not what I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.320 
just thinking but now that's not what I
mean

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
mean

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
mean
so<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> right<00:01:21.840> hand<00:01:21.869> wrote<00:01:22.409> whatever<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so the right hand wrote whatever the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.640 
so the right hand wrote whatever the
fingers<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.549> been<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.900> towards<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
fingers are been going towards this is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
fingers are been going towards this is
the<00:01:25.799> directions<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> screw<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.090> going

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the directions of the screw that's going

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.580 
the directions of the screw that's going
in<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.259> case<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:29.369> open<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> just

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
in so in this case to open this you just

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.980 
in so in this case to open this you just
grab<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.159> turn<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:33.840> would

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
grab it and you just turn it this would

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.760 
grab it and you just turn it this would
be<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.140> guess<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> become<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
be I guess to become the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039 
be I guess to become the
counterclockwise<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:36.090> open<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.479> pops<00:01:36.900> up

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
counterclockwise to open it pops up

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.590 
counterclockwise to open it pops up
that's<00:01:37.650> pretty<00:01:38.070> simple<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that's pretty simple there the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.210 
that's pretty simple there the
challenging<00:01:40.079> part<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> remove

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
challenging part in here is to remove

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.969 
challenging part in here is to remove
the<00:01:41.520> bulb<00:01:42.390> itself<00:01:42.689> which<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.860> can

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the bulb itself which you see if I can

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
also is to put some lubricant that's

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.950 
also is to put some lubricant that's
designed<00:04:26.080> for<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.409> for<00:04:26.830> electric<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.900> know

designed for it for electric you know
secretary<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.800> way<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.039> does<00:04:30.190> actually

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
secretary so this way it does actually

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.710 
secretary so this way it does actually
it<00:04:31.960> helps<00:04:32.349> the<00:04:32.950> regulate<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.300> not<00:04:34.479> going<00:04:34.659> to

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
it helps the regulate it's not going to

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.420 
it helps the regulate it's not going to
burn<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.080> light<00:04:35.260> bulb<00:04:35.470> as<00:04:35.620> quickly<00:04:35.860> alright
