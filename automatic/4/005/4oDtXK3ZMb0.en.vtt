because if you only go three times a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.099 
because if you only go three times a
week<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.300> hit<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.570> body<00:01:00.750> parts

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.780 
shoulders and triceps pushing muscles
the<00:01:15.390> second<00:01:15.810> day<00:01:15.930> pulling<00:01:16.200> muscles<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:17.460> rear

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
day we're going to hit legs so cross

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.590 
day we're going to hit legs so cross
hands<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> calves<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> third<00:01:24.570> day

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
hands and calves and on the third day

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.850 
hands and calves and on the third day
we'll<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.960> abs<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.409> well

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
we'll do abs as well

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
we'll do abs as well
so<00:01:26.189> each<00:01:26.430> week<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.909> workout<00:01:27.270> days<00:01:27.509> will<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
so each week your workout days will be a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
so each week your workout days will be a
little<00:01:28.049> different<00:01:28.939> because<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
little different because if you do the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
little different because if you do the
math<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.470> three<00:01:31.740> days<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.460> day

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
math you have three days on and one day

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.060 
math you have three days on and one day
off<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.119> three<00:01:33.509> days<00:01:33.689> again<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.860> will<00:01:34.979> be

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
off and three days again so that will be

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.990 
off and three days again so that will be
eight<00:01:35.280> days<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.450> every<00:01:37.049> week<00:01:37.259> each<00:01:37.470> week<00:01:38.000> your

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
eight days so every week each week your

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.090 
eight days so every week each week your
days<00:01:39.210> will<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.869> different<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.829> can

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
days will kind of be different you can

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.460 
days will kind of be different you can
change<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:42.150> order<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> days<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> wish

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
change the order of the days if you wish

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.280 
change the order of the days if you wish
to<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.640> example<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.659> want<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
to so for example if you want to put the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.260 
to so for example if you want to put the
deadlift<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.310> bag<00:01:47.520> day<00:01:47.700> instead<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.119> your

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
deadlift or your bag day instead of your

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.600 
deadlift or your bag day instead of your
leg<00:01:48.479> day<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.470> might<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.250> legs

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
leg day you might want to do legs

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
leg day you might want to do legs
push-pull<00:01:51.240> instead<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.810> push-pull<00:01:52.259> legs

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
push-pull instead of push-pull legs

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.889 
push-pull instead of push-pull legs
because<00:01:53.340> otherwise<00:01:53.670> you're<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> need

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
because otherwise you're going to need

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.410 
because otherwise you're going to need
your<00:01:55.110> legs<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:56.189> twice<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> row

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
your legs it twice in a row

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
your legs it twice in a row
alright<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:58.049> your<00:01:58.200> bad<00:01:58.380> day<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.280> leg

alright or your bad day and then leg
data<00:01:59.969> next<00:02:00.210> day<00:02:00.450> now<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.290> actually<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
data next day now what is actually so

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.639 
data next day now what is actually so
great<00:02:02.070> about<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.340> push-pull<00:02:02.850> leg<00:02:03.060> program<00:02:03.649> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
great about a push-pull leg program the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.609 
great about a push-pull leg program the
reason<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.100> find<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.670> good<00:02:06.540> working<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
reason I find it so good working is that

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.380 
reason I find it so good working is that
all<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.220> pushing<00:02:08.550> muscles<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.239> your

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
all your pushing muscles and your

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.809 
all your pushing muscles and your
pulling<00:02:09.660> muscles<00:02:09.810> work<00:02:10.110> together<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:11.280> when

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
pulling muscles work together right when

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.860 
pulling muscles work together right when
you're<00:02:11.970> doing<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> bench<00:02:12.540> press

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you're doing the bench press

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.320 
you're doing the bench press
you're

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
you're

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.180 
you're
chess<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.840> will<00:02:13.990> work<00:02:14.140> your<00:02:14.170> chest<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:15.040> your

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
chess you will work your chest but your

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.430 
chess you will work your chest but your
shoulders<00:02:15.520> will<00:02:15.640> always<00:02:15.880> be<00:02:16.030> activated<00:02:16.690> now

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
shoulders will always be activated now

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.500 
shoulders will always be activated now
this<00:02:18.070> means<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.550> when<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.240> put<00:02:19.420> those

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
this means that when you put those

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.450 
this means that when you put those
muscles<00:02:19.930> together<00:02:20.320> they<00:02:20.890> will<00:02:21.010> have<00:02:21.190> equal

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
muscles together they will have equal

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.330 
muscles together they will have equal
rest<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.090> all<00:02:22.630> right<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.110> each<00:02:23.800> day<00:02:24.040> will<00:02:24.220> have

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
rest I all right and each day will have

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.640 
rest I all right and each day will have
equal<00:02:24.520> rest<00:02:24.910> I'm<00:02:25.180> meaning<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.350> can<00:02:26.500> hit

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
equal rest I'm meaning that you can hit

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.200 
equal rest I'm meaning that you can hit
your<00:02:26.800> muscles<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.400> often<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.270> week

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
your muscles more often in a week

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.340 
your muscles more often in a week
because<00:02:31.210> they're<00:02:31.390> put<00:02:31.570> those<00:02:31.720> body<00:02:31.990> parts

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
because they're put those body parts

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.280 
because they're put those body parts
together<00:02:32.670> now<00:02:33.670> hitting<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:34.660> muscles<00:02:35.080> more

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
together now hitting your muscles more

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.130 
together now hitting your muscles more
often<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.130> optimal<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:36.880> growth<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:38.110> has

a<00:03:37.090> video<00:03:37.300> while<00:03:37.780> back<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.050> can<00:03:38.320> check<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.560> out

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
a video while back you can check it out

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.560 
a video while back you can check it out
here<00:03:38.860> about<00:03:39.070> training<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.459> failure<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:40.390> also

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
here about training to failure it also

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.560 
here about training to failure it also
applies<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.170> program<00:03:41.709> um<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:43.390> what<00:03:43.540> i

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
applies to this program um but what i

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.030 
applies to this program um but what i
really<00:03:43.870> suggest<00:03:44.050> is<00:03:44.590> when<00:03:44.739> you're<00:03:44.830> starting

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
really suggest is when you're starting

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.740 
really suggest is when you're starting
out<00:03:45.190> with<00:03:45.340> this<00:03:45.489> program<00:03:45.970> do<00:03:46.360> not<00:03:46.540> go<00:03:46.690> to

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
out with this program do not go to

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.440 
out with this program do not go to

suggest going to failure on a couple of

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.100 
suggest going to failure on a couple of
the<00:04:03.670> last<00:04:03.850> sets<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.360> do<00:04:04.480> not<00:04:04.660> go<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.870> failure

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
the last sets and do not go to failure

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.810 
the last sets and do not go to failure
on<00:04:05.260> your<00:04:05.440> first<00:04:05.709> movement<00:04:06.220> on<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.430> compound

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
on your first movement on the compound

on your first movement on the compound
live<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.780> really<00:04:08.140> want<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.350> create<00:04:08.500> progress

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
live you really want to create progress

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.440 
live you really want to create progress
overload<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:09.670> do<00:04:09.850> not<00:04:10.000> want<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.299> go<00:04:10.390> to

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
overload so you do not want to go to

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.120 
overload so you do not want to go to
failure<00:04:10.690> because<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.320> can<00:04:11.470> hinder<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.950> I

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
failure because that can hinder it I

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.580 
failure because that can hinder it I
recommend<00:04:12.670> Dee<00:04:12.970> loading<00:04:13.390> every<00:04:13.780> six<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.230> ten

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
recommend Dee loading every six to ten

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.820 
recommend Dee loading every six to ten
to<00:04:14.860> twelve<00:04:15.130> weeks<00:04:15.250> uh<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:16.570> kind<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.140> depends<00:04:17.560> on

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
to twelve weeks uh it kind of depends on

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.820 
to twelve weeks uh it kind of depends on
how<00:04:18.609> old<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.180> are<00:04:19.209> what<00:04:20.109> your<00:04:20.260> experience

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
how old you are what your experience

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.529 
how old you are what your experience
level<00:04:20.979> is<00:04:21.250> etc<00:04:22.210> um<00:04:23.160> but<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.400> suggest<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.390> do<00:04:25.510> a

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
level is etc um but I suggest you do a

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.240 
level is etc um but I suggest you do a
deal<00:04:25.780> when<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.169> feel<00:04:26.380> like<00:04:26.590> it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
deal when you feel like it

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.270 
deal when you feel like it
and<00:04:27.340> often<00:04:28.330> that's<00:04:28.450> too<00:04:28.690> late<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.290> that's<00:04:30.100> why

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
and often that's too late so that's why

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.010 
and often that's too late so that's why
I<00:04:30.310> really<00:04:30.520> recommend<00:04:31.060> six<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.600> ten<00:04:31.810> weeks

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
I really recommend six to ten weeks

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.050 
I really recommend six to ten weeks
maximum<00:04:32.530> alright<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.430> when<00:04:33.580> doing<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.910> D

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
maximum alright and when doing the D

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.810 
maximum alright and when doing the D
load<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.780> want<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.020> use<00:04:35.170> about<00:04:35.700> 60%<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.760> the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
load you want to use about 60% of the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.880 
load you want to use about 60% of the
weights<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:37.510> normally<00:04:37.900> use<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.440> do<00:04:38.740> about

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
weights you normally use and do about

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.070 
weights you normally use and do about
60%<00:04:39.640> of<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.820> volume<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.390> got<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.720> sets<00:04:40.960> a

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
60% of the volume so got the sets a

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.450 
60% of the volume so got the sets a
little<00:04:41.230> bit<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.650> this<00:04:41.740> will<00:04:41.800> do<00:04:42.040> well<00:04:42.220> this

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
little bit and this will do well this

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.240 
little bit and this will do well this
will<00:04:42.610> keep<00:04:42.760> your<00:04:42.910> shrink<00:04:43.330> up<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:44.250> will

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
will keep your shrink up and will

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.430 
will keep your shrink up and will
recover<00:04:45.550> properly<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.840> progression<00:04:47.350> is

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
recover properly so the progression is

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.240 
recover properly so the progression is
as<00:04:47.620> follows

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
as follows

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.570 
as follows
for<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.150> compound<00:04:49.600> lives<00:04:50.110> I<00:04:50.230> always<00:04:51.040> schedule

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
for the compound lives I always schedule

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.990 
for the compound lives I always schedule
three<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.660> five<00:04:52.930> sets<00:04:53.320> of<00:04:53.590> five<00:04:53.710> reps<00:04:54.100> alright

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
three to five sets of five reps alright

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.690 
three to five sets of five reps alright
and<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.870> for<00:04:56.080> example<00:04:56.200> if<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:57.100> can<00:04:57.310> only<00:04:57.460> do

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
and a for example if you can only do

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.870 
and a for example if you can only do
three<00:04:58.180> sets<00:04:58.450> with<00:04:58.840> 225<00:04:59.350> for<00:04:59.740> five<00:04:59.950> reps<00:05:00.250> and

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
three sets with 225 for five reps and

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.240 
three sets with 225 for five reps and
that's<00:05:01.120> your<00:05:01.300> starting<00:05:01.540> point<00:05:01.870> if<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:03.010> do<00:05:03.130> not

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
that's your starting point if you do not

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.250 
that's your starting point if you do not
go<00:05:03.400> to<00:05:03.430> filler<00:05:03.730> or<00:05:03.970> right<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.360> suggest<00:05:05.170> you

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
go to filler or right I suggest you

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.160 
go to filler or right I suggest you
start<00:05:05.500> out<00:05:05.680> with<00:05:05.710> about<00:05:06.510> eighty<00:05:07.510> percent<00:05:08.080> of

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
start out with about eighty percent of

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.770 
start out with about eighty percent of
your<00:05:08.230> one<00:05:08.470> rep<00:05:08.710> max<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.310> do<00:05:10.060> three<00:05:10.390> sets<00:05:10.660> of

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
your one rep max and do three sets of

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.740 
your one rep max and do three sets of
five<00:05:10.990> with<00:05:11.230> that<00:05:11.440> now<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.910> next<00:05:13.270> week<00:05:13.420> you

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
five with that now that next week you

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.600 
five with that now that next week you
still<00:05:13.960> want<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.140> do<00:05:14.230> 225<00:05:14.740> but<00:05:15.250> you<00:05:15.310> want<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.550> do

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
still want to do 225 but you want to do

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.120 
still want to do 225 but you want to do

sets<00:05:30.040> of<00:05:30.130> five<00:05:30.310> etc<00:05:31.180> alright<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:32.460> again<00:05:33.460> this

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
sets of five etc alright and again this

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.159 
sets of five etc alright and again this
is<00:05:33.730> for<00:05:33.850> intermediate<00:05:34.330> than<00:05:34.450> it<00:05:34.540> has<00:05:34.690> lifters

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
is for intermediate than it has lifters

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.860 
is for intermediate than it has lifters
if<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.740> are<00:05:35.980> not<00:05:36.190> that<00:05:36.430> advanced<00:05:37.000> then<00:05:37.690> you

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
if you are not that advanced then you

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.290 
if you are not that advanced then you
can<00:05:38.020> probably<00:05:38.350> add<00:05:38.770> more<00:05:38.800> weight<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.250> it<00:05:39.460> but

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
can probably add more weight to it but

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.390 
can probably add more weight to it but
for<00:05:40.630> as<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.110> fence<00:05:41.410> guys<00:05:41.650> is<00:05:41.890> really<00:05:42.130> hard<00:05:42.340> to

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
for as a fence guys is really hard to

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.940 
for as a fence guys is really hard to
progress<00:05:42.760> and<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.810> may<00:05:43.960> only<00:05:43.990> seem<00:05:44.500> like<00:05:44.710> one

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
progress and it may only seem like one

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.700 
progress and it may only seem like one
rep<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.250> week<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.880> that's<00:05:46.030> nothing<00:05:46.210> but<00:05:46.690> in<00:05:47.380> a

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
rep a week and that's nothing but in a

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.790 
rep a week and that's nothing but in a
year<00:05:47.979> that<00:05:48.010> will<00:05:48.280> be<00:05:48.370> 52<00:05:48.910> reps<00:05:49.300> no<00:05:49.990> 100<00:05:50.620> reps

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
year that will be 52 reps no 100 reps

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.200 
year that will be 52 reps no 100 reps
because<00:05:50.979> you're<00:05:51.250> trading<00:05:51.520> everything<00:05:51.970> twice

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
because you're trading everything twice

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.700 
because you're trading everything twice
a<00:05:52.240> week<00:05:52.540> if<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:52.870> find<00:05:53.169> that<00:05:53.290> you<00:05:53.470> cannot

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
a week if you find that you cannot

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.640 
a week if you find that you cannot
progress<00:05:53.890> three<00:05:54.760> weeks<00:05:55.030> in<00:05:55.240> a<00:05:55.330> row<00:05:55.360> then<00:05:56.350> I

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
progress three weeks in a row then I

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.020 
progress three weeks in a row then I
suggest<00:05:56.890> you<00:05:57.100> drop<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.490> weight<00:05:57.520> by<00:05:57.790> 10

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
suggest you drop the weight by 10

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.630 
suggest you drop the weight by 10
percent<00:05:58.510> and<00:05:58.690> you<00:05:58.870> build<00:05:59.110> back<00:05:59.320> up<00:05:59.530> if<00:05:59.950> it's

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
percent and you build back up if it's

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.430 
percent and you build back up if it's
still<00:06:00.880> not<00:06:00.910> working<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.720> probably<00:06:02.169> have<00:06:02.350> to

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
still not working you probably have to

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.260 
still not working you probably have to
take<00:06:02.590> a<00:06:02.620> deal<00:06:02.890> load<00:06:03.130> alright<00:06:03.550> now<00:06:03.910> it's<00:06:04.090> really

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
take a deal load alright now it's really

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.850 
take a deal load alright now it's really
important<00:06:04.810> that<00:06:04.840> you<00:06:05.050> progress<00:06:05.290> on<00:06:05.770> the

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
important that you progress on the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.520 
important that you progress on the
compound<00:06:06.280> movements<00:06:06.900> all<00:06:07.900> the<00:06:08.169> movements

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
compound movements all the movements

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.620 
compound movements all the movements
after<00:06:08.860> that<00:06:09.040> you<00:06:09.340> want<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.610> try<00:06:09.820> to<00:06:09.880> progress<00:06:10.419> a

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
after that you want to try to progress a

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.930 
after that you want to try to progress a
little<00:06:10.990> bit<00:06:11.110> but<00:06:11.800> it's<00:06:11.950> not<00:06:12.010> as<00:06:12.250> important<00:06:12.760> as

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
little bit but it's not as important as

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.180 
little bit but it's not as important as
the<00:06:13.150> first<00:06:13.390> exercise<00:06:13.900> all<00:06:14.500> right<00:06:14.710> so<00:06:14.919> really
