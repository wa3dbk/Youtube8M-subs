00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello youtube friends this time I come 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.490
 with a top 20 of the best teams of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.380
 the wwf from 2000 to 2011 I know 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 that a long time ago I made a top like that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.969
 but I decided to make a new one because the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.890
 previous I did not like xd before 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 start with the count I want you to know 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.029
 that this is my humble opinion so 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.279
 If you did not like my top I invite you to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.070
 do yours in the comment box 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.100
 so we will share opinions without further 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.350
 rodeos let's start 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.690
 position number 20 is for the team 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.910
 conformed by the cons both come from 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.080
 a family of fighters 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.720
 Puerto Ricans where along with their 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.640
 brother in the ww they got achievements in 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.100
 couples and at the same time have had 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.020
 multiple rivals with several teams the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 most remarkable was the one they got with 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.239
 the miz and morrison which culminated in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.250
 ures lehman and 25 to win the championship 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.750
 unified in pairs it looked that the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 team colom will be a set 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.830
 promising until the writers are 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.080
 the great idea of 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.420
 separate them fighting each other what 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.250
 way to waste a computer but 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.470
 Well, we'll see how cousin is doing 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.900
 teaming up with epic apparently not 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.180
 is going so bad at least they have already achieved 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.510
 an achievement in pairs may already die in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.550
 peace there is already position 19 is for a 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.549
 team that stood out a lot in its time of 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.080
 2004 called the resistance a team 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.780
 conformed by foreigners who 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.729
 they insulted the us by beating the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.590
 way soon the public hatred what 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.350
 which made them a tough team 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.270
 very good sincerely it was a team that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 I liked his way of working very much 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990
 altogether, it consisted of three 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.479
 fight 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.970
 which are renego pre sylvain 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.549
 greiner and rock with my all come from 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.149
 a country outside the USA as I said 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.030
 previously 18th is for another 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.220
 equipment conformed by rudos called nm 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.380
 which had many rivalries 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.990
 with several company teams with the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.380
 Mexicos King Mysterio and Batista Paul 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.520
 london and brian kendrick among others 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.130
 they got multiple times the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.840
 championships in couples sincerely one 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.450
 of the best Goth teams of the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.850
 last times the one that stood out the most after 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.100
 the dissolution of the equipment without any doubt 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.230
 he was morrison although he did not get the achievements 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.030
 that he deserved for his misfortune that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.250
 He came out more miserable than ever before 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.900
 mercury you will already know that I think of him for the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.090
 third part of criticism of 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.370
 wrestlers fired from the wwf 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.680
 the 17th place is for the team more 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.019
 great of the world made up of one 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.379
 of my favorite flying fighters 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.610
 shelton benjamin and charly as 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.319
 they were initially helpers of kurt 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.110
 angle and is one of the most 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.269
 skillful that there has been in the ww after 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.790
 of 2004 did not have many appearances 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.400
 as a team because benjamin left 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.500
 around they had a very good technique in 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.930
 set and they worked very well as a team 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.830
 making excellent combinations of 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.440
 blows and movements 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.630
 this position 16 takes it to hopkins and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.640
 reiter a team that in the beginning were 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.590
 assistants of her interfering in 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.990
 several of his struggles for championships 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.660
 important to later be part of the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.970
 family it is worth mentioning that these two are 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.430
 friends for a long time since 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.170
 they were in independent companies I think 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.150
 that's why his good chemistry is 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.400
 team since they made a set of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.530
 rudos very good in my opinion besides that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.110
 your input theme is very good xd 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.720
 although nevertheless they only got the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.090
 title in pairs once after 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.730
 separate ryder seemed to have a future 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.070
 promising having a good push but 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.200
 look at it now it does not even appear in the 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.790
 raw and smackdown recordings to what 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.750
 his push ended up being very 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.850
 disappointing and the other one does not say the 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.060
 position 15 is for a conformed team 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.280
 by divas which is laycool this team 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.290
 at the election of others it is conformed 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.450
 by women of high caliber above 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.920
 ring as much as it is laila and michelle 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.620
 mccool both made his life 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.459
 impossible to live several such as bird 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.739
 phoenix 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.450
 natalia and her most important fief 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.610
 had with mickey 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.430
 Without a doubt, it was one of the best 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.800
 teams of 2010 since they stood out a lot 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.480
 for his actions as rudas giving him 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.000
 the little bit of prestige that the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.090
 division of divas 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.950
 the 14th post is for the nexus I speak 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.500
 of the nexus conformed by the first 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.930
 mx season of which was one of 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.910
 the last most dominant teams good 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.580
 they were until 100 bread that started 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.650
 command the ones I loved how they debuted 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.660
 attacking the entire cast of raw us 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.850
 it reminded a bit of the attitude attitude 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.550
 from that moment they began to attack 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.710
 several fighters of the ww fit 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.930
 mention that this served as a good push 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.180
 for the boss who commanded the nexus way 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.580
 barrett although lately he has not gone 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.890
 so well after its dissolution after 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.600
 the entrance of punk was formed a team 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.120
 called the run that was formed by 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.760
 former members of the nexus such as 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.220
 justin gabriel slater and the boss way 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.560
 barrett put them in one more position 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.419
 high but as their fiefdom they had with 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.300
 dinner only served for the pokemon 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.730
 the position will increase its popularity 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.530
 number 13 is for yesterday and show a team 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.720
 that occurred since Yericho ran out 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.460
 couple to what he decided to big show like 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.160
 your new companion from the airsoft 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.140
 champions retained the championship 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.330
 unified several times against teams 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.060
 as king mysterio and batista in bike and 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.190
 mark henry great time etcetera which 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.870
 it was a great team and more because it 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.550
 it's about fighters like big show and 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.890
 chrysler and ccoo that take a long time 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.110
 up in the ring but nevertheless 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.150
 I feel they did not have good chemistry in 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.330
 team but still his reign what 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.460
 compensates for the 12th place is for the 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.800
 warriors a team made up of the 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.080
 deceased legend the warrior and his nephew 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.330
 chavo warrior was a team that was 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.460
 highly loved by the public more by 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.380
 the latin fanaticada what made them very 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.570
 popular was his tactic of launching a 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.280
 illegal object to his opponent and when the 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.800
 referee will be fainted to 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.110
 backs throw themselves to the canvas simulating that 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.229
 they had been beaten doing that 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.669
 way his opponent was disqualified 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:08.270
 classic technique of the legendary eddy 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:11.270
 warrior rest in peace this legend 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.340
 it's time for a little extra bonus this 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.320
 once the team crate time occupies a 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.210
 team that in my opinion was too much 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.130
 Underrated but not as much as 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.380
 they had opportunities for degrees in 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.020
 couple I liked very much his simile of 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.480
 street criminals xc both knew it 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.610
 handle very well although they did not manage 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.350
 absolutely nothing I must admit that 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.690
 Several of his promos seemed to me 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.060
 funny others even caused me 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.070
 I still remember that they had a 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.140
 segment of that name I do not remember 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.180
 that appeared in smackdown where 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.220
 the poop of jesse intervened with his simile 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.080
 rapper entertained me a lot that 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.750
 segment I have to admit that for my liking 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.250
 It was good pity that both were 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.350
 with empty hands 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.210
 they had the talent to get away as 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.330
 team but you see how is our 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.490
 dear ww I liked those 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.770
 blacks because they made very bastards acts 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.440
 as when they took underwear 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.570
 lita xd in the extinct cyberspace event 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.150
 day or when they destroyed the limousine 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:12.610
 jbl together with john dinner plus the start 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.610
 of your entrance song is very sticky 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.710
 xd I would like to see you back and that 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.410
 This time achieve win championships 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.480
 couple, it's worth mentioning that jpg is still 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.370
 the company which makes me wonder 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.590
 what the hell does he do in the company if not 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.230
 does not shit if it was him I would have 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.390
 good start anyway I think I speak 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.520
 too much of crate time to what this 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.530
 video has lengthened a bit wait for the 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.580
 next part where I will say the posts 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.580
 missing goodbye
