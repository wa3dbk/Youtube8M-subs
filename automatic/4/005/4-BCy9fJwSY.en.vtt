 pollan welcome to this windows computer course my name is 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.830
 leandro and in this opportunity we will start this course of windows that xp 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.819
 as it was before and started on that computer 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.510
 what we see on the screen in this beautiful landscape is called a desk because it 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.759
 it resembles still desk normar 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.319
 On the one hand we can be the thousand pesetas icon 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.769
 is an icon that we will study in the coming days as well as my 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.870
 documents and especially to the recycling bin can see here below 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.560
 below our screen we have what we call / tasks ap 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.640
 I was re homework we have two quite different elements 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.860
 one of them is the start menu 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.980
 from here we can give access to all the programs and applications that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 we have in our system 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.820
 how to activate at the start 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.830
 clicking with the boss with the button 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.390
 left of summed 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.390
 so this does not imply this we can access 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 then it will only be pointing with the mouse pointer 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.990
 the arrows that support de gando in two different programs that one can reap 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.770
 to have 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.120
 installed on your pc 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.850
 we make a left kit again 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 to see the desk 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.840
 another element distinguish and according to move is the time 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.640
 we would like to change the time 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.320
 we must do the following press without moving the pointer of naos a double click 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 in the hour icon 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.860
 wait a few seconds 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.560
 and we can change the time you liked 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 of the date 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.250
 year 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.540
 or that the days 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 as well as the time zone 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.949
 we make accept for changes 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.059
 as it was before the etienne writer and managers elements 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.929
