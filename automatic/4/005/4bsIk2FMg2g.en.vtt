00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.650
 it is part of that package that was a 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.050
 boom of animÃ©s of the end of years 90 and 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.630
 beginning of the years 2000 that happened in tv 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.960
 open and everyone started to become a fan 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.960
 even of Japanese designs is to be the 11 is 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.910
 the last great manga and anime that has passed 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.230
 in Brazil that had not yet come and 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.450
 I think that's why you 've done so much 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.970
 successful course of history everywhere 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.220
 It's really cool to sag your character. 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.320
 super captivating is the serene sag by 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.570
 world also saw drawing as serene right 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.489
 even for me it's strange to speak the sag 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.260
 but it 's her name I think because the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.420
 catchy characters the cool story 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.489
 and a drawing passed on the open television 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.579
 This captivated a lot of people who ended up 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.860
 being fact is today in blue in note that 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.050
 very excited when jbs announced 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.300
 that to come out that they were not here 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.879
 In Brazil, volleyball first I asked how 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.320
 because I was very difficult to leave and 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.020
 send here in Brazil and any other 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.020
 another hormone-free product 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.159
 had two different parts of approval 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.380
 the front part of the writing staff 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.170
 and the part of the staff given publicity 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.940
 this part of approval was more difficult 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.159
 because at the end of it we have 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.780
 that sending a print from the graph is a 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.860
 graphic proof for japan 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.670
 so this we had never done 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.670
 no other manga 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.660
 strictly speaking we do not use those risks 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.810
 the name of the characters, for example, 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.450
 sag will leave even when the other 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.150
 people who are not even written in Japan 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.870
 site al ahli has those fixed 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.180
 we ignored we did not fight 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.040
 use the favorites then her friend who 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.220
 will call that will call the website going 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.370
 call was the one who knows all is not going to have the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.369
 site comes with a few exceptions the 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.610
 manutd to what is the character's love 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.980
 Hero and and 20 years ago 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.560
 these two were placed because otherwise 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.900
 in reading it would only be a lost vp 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.270
 marshall is an exclusive business for 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.280
 Maybe even joking could be 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.500
 other adaptations could be 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.610
 is a nickname using a dating one 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.760
 Sweetheart, sweetheart, among other things. 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.880
 could but I think we decided 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.910
 who use a motion for this case 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.720
 exclusive only for sag and mauro 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.720
 I think it would fit
