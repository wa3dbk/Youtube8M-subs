 twenty years ago we had 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.840
 the idea of ​​making a request to have 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.360
 a locomotive like that to be able to 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.440
 manage and the sncf trust us and 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.150
 so we do not find to do

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.470
 more than a hundred years 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.790

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.979
 traditions to show people what 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.360

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.320
 of driving there is the whistle that is 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.030
 bright there is the coal stock ago 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.310

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.340
 she still makes 1200 horses 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.869
 she is really suited to the line and 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.700
 as a mechanic I have fun 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.869
 driving her here because she's 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.899

 more at the controls of my tgv but I am 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.380
 found at the beginning of the century in a 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.789
 decor that has not changed and that's 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.149
 great for us because we 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.229
 does our little inner film each 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.429
 once I roll on the line I 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.020
 still discover things that I 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.660
