shake it up the proteins that's in the
egg<00:01:36.320> white<00:01:36.500> create<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.369> kind<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.580> network<00:01:37.910> that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
traps air bubbles in and so the result

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.359 
traps air bubbles in and so the result
is<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.640> nice<00:01:41.140> fizzy<00:01:42.140> kind<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:42.560> mousse<00:01:43.100> like

with<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.360> peg<00:01:47.540> Y<00:01:47.660> in<00:01:47.869> there

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.120 

now<00:01:53.130> we're<00:01:53.250> gonna<00:01:53.340> shake<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:54.650> with<00:01:55.650> ice

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.260 

and<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> purpose<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:02.940> get<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and the purpose of this is just get it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.090 
and the purpose of this is just get it
really<00:02:03.479> cold<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:04.080> little<00:02:04.500> bit<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.680> dye<00:02:04.770> Ellucian

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
really cold a little bit of dye Ellucian

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.010 
really cold a little bit of dye Ellucian
in<00:02:05.190> that<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.300> we'll<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.600> take<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
in that and then what we'll do is take a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.370 
in that and then what we'll do is take a
chilled<00:02:10.380> mixing<00:02:10.770> beaker<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.930> she<00:02:13.230> just

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
chilled mixing beaker and she just

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.400 
chilled mixing beaker and she just
strained<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.040> into<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:15.410> shaking

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
strained that out into there shaking

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.960 
strained that out into there shaking
with<00:02:16.530> ice<00:02:16.680> introduces<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.489> air<00:02:17.640> into<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
with ice introduces some air into the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.370 
with ice introduces some air into the
drink<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> ice<00:02:18.540> also<00:02:18.810> knocked<00:02:19.170> some<00:02:19.350> of

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
drink but the ice also knocked some of

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.110 
drink but the ice also knocked some of
