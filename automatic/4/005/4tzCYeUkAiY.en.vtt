control<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:40.110> one's<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
control and as you can see this one's a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.720 
control and as you can see this one's a
little<00:00:40.590> bit<00:00:40.920> different<00:00:41.340> than<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.610> we

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
little bit different than what we

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.350 
little bit different than what we
normally<00:00:41.760> done<00:00:43.460> just<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> start<00:00:44.760> out<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.210> can

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
normally done just to start out you can

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.290 
normally done just to start out you can
see<00:00:45.600> I've<00:00:46.440> got<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.710> rubber<00:00:47.309> glove<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.090> just

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
see I've got a rubber glove on here just

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.569 
see I've got a rubber glove on here just
so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> don't<00:00:48.920> fingerprint<00:00:49.920> any<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.340> up

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so I don't fingerprint any of this up

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.830 
so I don't fingerprint any of this up
because<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> absolute<00:00:52.379> most<00:00:53.370> shiny

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
because this is the absolute most shiny

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.209 
because this is the absolute most shiny
controller<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.140> personally<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:56.039> ever

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
controller that personally I have ever

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.270 
controller that personally I have ever
handled<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.879> mean<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.649> spot<00:00:59.100> on

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
handled I mean there is not one spot on

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.650 
handled I mean there is not one spot on
this<00:00:59.399> controller<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.180> can't<00:01:00.449> see

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this controller that you can't see

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
this controller that you can't see
yourself<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:02.250> that's<00:01:03.120> new<00:01:03.480> we've<00:01:04.320> never<00:01:04.470> had

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
yourself so that's new we've never had

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
yourself so that's new we've never had
any<00:01:04.860> bits<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.280> shiny<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.820> also<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:09.180> believe

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
any bits this shiny and also I believe

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.760 
any bits this shiny and also I believe
this<00:01:09.869> controller<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.830> for<00:01:11.400> clay<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.770> we
