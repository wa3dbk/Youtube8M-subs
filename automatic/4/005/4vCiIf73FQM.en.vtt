00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.400 
understand what the 50 move rule is
basically<00:02:11.180> from<00:02:11.450> their<00:02:11.570> capture<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.930> pawn<00:02:12.200> push

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410

of<00:02:12.590> 50<00:02:12.890> moves<00:02:13.100> in<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.340> game<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.940> draw<00:02:14.000> and

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
of 50 moves in the game is a draw and

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.110 
of 50 moves in the game is a draw and
the<00:02:15.709> last<00:02:15.890> one<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.340> what's<00:02:16.610> called<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.910> full

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
the last one is what's called the full

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.229 
the last one is what's called the full
move<00:02:17.360> counter<00:02:17.840> which<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.920> at<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.000> start

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
move counter which is one at the start

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.820 
move counter which is one at the start
of<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.480> game<00:02:20.660> with<00:02:20.840> white<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.230> move<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.709> is

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
of the game with white to move and is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.240 
of the game with white to move and is
incremented<00:02:22.540> after<00:02:23.540> black<00:02:23.720> has<00:02:23.930> moved<00:02:24.250> so

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
incremented after black has moved so

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.310 
incremented after black has moved so
it's<00:02:25.400> not<00:02:25.550> play<00:02:25.910> which<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.600> each<00:02:26.720> half<00:02:26.989> move

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
it's not play which is each half move

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.350 
it's not play which is each half move
it's<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.650> full<00:02:27.860> move<00:02:28.100> counter<00:02:29.350> so

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it's a full move counter so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.790 
it's a full move counter so

the<00:03:36.070> things<00:03:36.250> I've<00:03:36.400> forgotten<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.910> if<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.210> see

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
the things I've forgotten is if you see

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.570 
the things I've forgotten is if you see

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
squares are empty so in the start

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.500 
squares are empty so in the start
position<00:03:41.830> we<00:03:42.400> have<00:03:42.490> all<00:03:42.640> black<00:03:42.790> pieces<00:03:43.270> on<00:03:43.390> the

in the start position end of rank gone
to<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.480> seventh<00:03:52.780> rank<00:03:52.990> we<00:03:53.230> have<00:03:53.350> eight<00:03:53.530> black

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
to the seventh rank we have eight black

to the seventh rank we have eight black
pawns<00:03:54.090> on<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.690> sixth<00:03:55.960> rank<00:03:56.200> we<00:03:56.470> have

absolutely<00:03:57.130> nothing<00:03:57.310> as<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:57.730> can<00:03:57.880> see<00:03:58.090> here

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
absolutely nothing as you can see here

absolutely nothing as you can see here
so<00:03:59.470> we<00:03:59.620> have<00:03:59.740> an<00:03:59.830> eight<00:04:00.040> because<00:04:00.400> we<00:04:00.490> have

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
so we have an eight because we have

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.480 
so we have an eight because we have
eight<00:04:00.790> empty<00:04:00.970> squares<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:02.650> don't<00:04:02.950> think<00:04:03.250> I

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
eight empty squares and I don't think I

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.580 
eight empty squares and I don't think I
need<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.390> go<00:04:04.780> through<00:04:04.960> it<00:04:05.050> in<00:04:05.140> any<00:04:05.260> more<00:04:05.410> detail

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.160 
need to go through it in any more detail
it's<00:04:06.130> obvious<00:04:06.550> what<00:04:07.210> the<00:04:07.360> piece<00:04:07.540> layout<00:04:07.870> is

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
it's obvious what the piece layout is

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.040 
it's obvious what the piece layout is
white<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.400> move<00:04:09.580> both<00:04:10.300> sides<00:04:10.630> have<00:04:10.840> full

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
white is to move both sides have full

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.780 
white is to move both sides have full
King<00:04:11.230> castling<00:04:11.710> permission<00:04:12.160> we're<00:04:12.550> on<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
King castling permission we're on the

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.720 
King castling permission we're on the
first<00:04:13.000> full<00:04:13.270> move<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:14.140> 50<00:04:14.470> move<00:04:14.650> role<00:04:14.890> is<00:04:15.130> 0<00:04:15.430> we

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
first full move the 50 move role is 0 we

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.330 
first full move the 50 move role is 0 we
have<00:04:15.820> no<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:15.970> move<00:04:16.239> yet<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.510> half<00:04:16.750> move<00:04:17.020> and

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
have no to move yet a half move and

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.410 
have no to move yet a half move and
there's<00:04:18.340> no<00:04:18.459> um<00:04:18.640> Poisson<00:04:18.940> Square

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
there's no um Poisson Square

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.750 
there's no um Poisson Square
so<00:04:20.260> now<00:04:20.410> as<00:04:20.680> it<00:04:20.830> says<00:04:21.040> here<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.400> is<00:04:21.580> a<00:04:21.610> really

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
so now as it says here this is a really

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
so now as it says here this is a really
good<00:04:21.970> description<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.420> found<00:04:22.630> on<00:04:22.720> the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
good description I found on the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.530 
good description I found on the
Wikipedia<00:04:23.290> actually<00:04:23.410> um<00:04:24.450> here's<00:04:25.450> the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
Wikipedia actually um here's the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.400 
Wikipedia actually um here's the
position<00:04:26.320> notation<00:04:27.220> after<00:04:27.700> 1.e4<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:29.230> if<00:04:29.320> i

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
position notation after 1.e4 so if i

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.640 
position notation after 1.e4 so if i
just<00:04:29.620> copy<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.460> go<00:04:30.720> position<00:04:31.720> get<00:04:32.470> their

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
just copy that and go position get their

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.590 
just copy that and go position get their
freedom<00:04:32.830> from<00:04:33.010> clipboard<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.480> the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
freedom from clipboard and this is the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.630 
freedom from clipboard and this is the
position<00:04:34.750> we<00:04:35.140> have<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.620> now<00:04:36.160> I'll<00:04:36.280> just<00:04:36.340> move

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
position we have and now I'll just move

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.430 
position we have and now I'll just move
that<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.420> side<00:04:37.660> let's<00:04:37.930> see<00:04:38.080> if<00:04:38.170> I<00:04:38.230> can<00:04:38.350> get

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
that to the side let's see if I can get

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.590 
that to the side let's see if I can get
away<00:04:38.530> with<00:04:38.950> actually<00:04:39.580> moving<00:04:39.790> things<00:04:40.150> around

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
away with actually moving things around

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.270 
away with actually moving things around
a<00:04:40.960> little<00:04:41.020> bit<00:04:41.290> so<00:04:41.500> we<00:04:41.590> can<00:04:41.740> see<00:04:41.890> them<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.130> bit

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
a little bit so we can see them a bit

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.850 
a little bit so we can see them a bit
easier<00:04:42.640> a<00:04:44.940> little<00:04:45.940> bit<00:04:46.030> smaller<00:04:46.470> ok<00:04:47.470> good<00:04:47.680> so

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
easier a little bit smaller ok good so

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.190 
easier a little bit smaller ok good so
if<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:48.790> look<00:04:48.940> at<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.180> second<00:04:49.540> position<00:04:49.990> and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
if you look at this second position and

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.260 
if you look at this second position and
compare<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.680> with<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.920> first<00:04:51.160> you'll<00:04:52.090> see

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
compare it with the first you'll see

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.210 
compare it with the first you'll see
that<00:04:52.390> we<00:04:52.510> have<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:53.820> same<00:04:55.440> situation<00:04:56.440> or<00:04:56.980> set

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
that we have the same situation or set

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.279 
that we have the same situation or set
up<00:04:57.660> for

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
up for

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.950 
up for
these<00:05:01.009> ranks<00:05:01.399> up<00:05:01.520> until<00:05:01.969> here<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.479> first<00:05:02.689> four

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
these ranks up until here the first four

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.109 
these ranks up until here the first four
ranks<00:05:03.319> have<00:05:03.439> stayed<00:05:03.680> exactly<00:05:04.249> the<00:05:04.369> same<00:05:04.639> oops

00:05:05.109 --> 00:05:05.119 
ranks have stayed exactly the same oops

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:09.860 
ranks have stayed exactly the same oops
that's<00:05:06.050> correct<00:05:06.469> as<00:05:06.740> well

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.670 

but<00:05:10.440> now<00:05:10.620> we've<00:05:10.800> got<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:11.250> for<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:12.000> capital<00:05:12.660> P

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
but now we've got a for a capital P

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.550 
but now we've got a for a capital P
and<00:05:14.770> A<00:05:15.250> three<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.660> means<00:05:16.900> we've<00:05:17.139> got<00:05:17.169> one

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
and A three and that means we've got one

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.490 
and A three and that means we've got one
two<00:05:18.009> three<00:05:18.280> four<00:05:18.790> empty<00:05:19.360> squares<00:05:19.720> a<00:05:20.020> white

two three four empty squares a white
pawn<00:05:20.830> and<00:05:21.130> then<00:05:21.490> one<00:05:21.729> two<00:05:22.180> three<00:05:22.810> empty

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
squares and then a forward slash so on

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.610 
squares and then a forward slash so on
to<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.470> next<00:05:26.650> rank<00:05:26.889> eight<00:05:27.280> empty<00:05:27.699> squares<00:05:28.620> now

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
to the next rank eight empty squares now

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.860 
to the next rank eight empty squares now
we<00:05:29.680> have<00:05:29.889> one<00:05:30.130> two<00:05:30.490> three<00:05:30.520> four<00:05:31.060> capital<00:05:31.690> piece

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
we have one two three four capital piece

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.800 
we have one two three four capital piece
of<00:05:32.139> four<00:05:32.320> pawns<00:05:32.590> or<00:05:33.280> one<00:05:33.550> saying<00:05:34.419> an<00:05:34.539> empty

square and then three capital peas
representing<00:05:37.720> three<00:05:37.990> pawns<00:05:38.259> and<00:05:38.530> then<00:05:39.460> the

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
representing three pawns and then the

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.969 
representing three pawns and then the
first<00:05:40.419> rank<00:05:40.660> is<00:05:40.780> exactly<00:05:41.199> the<00:05:41.320> same<00:05:41.560> we<00:05:41.860> now

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
first rank is exactly the same we now

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.560 
first rank is exactly the same we now
have<00:05:42.130> a<00:05:42.160> small<00:05:42.460> B<00:05:42.669> because<00:05:43.030> it's<00:05:43.180> black<00:05:43.360> to

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
have a small B because it's black to

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.960 
have a small B because it's black to
move<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:44.800> castling<00:05:45.280> permissions<00:05:45.699> are<00:05:45.880> the

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
move the castling permissions are the

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.300 
move the castling permissions are the
same<00:05:46.150> as<00:05:46.300> they<00:05:46.419> were<00:05:46.449> before<00:05:46.979> but<00:05:47.979> now<00:05:48.160> you'll

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
same as they were before but now you'll

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.040 
same as they were before but now you'll
see<00:05:48.490> that<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:48.729> on<00:05:48.820> Besant<00:05:49.150> square<00:05:49.419> is<00:05:49.660> set<00:05:49.900> to

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
see that the on Besant square is set to

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.290 
see that the on Besant square is set to
e3<00:05:50.310> that's<00:05:51.310> because<00:05:51.580> if<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:51.699> mean<00:05:51.970> if<00:05:52.180> you're

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
e3 that's because if you mean if you're

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.520 
e3 that's because if you mean if you're
familiar<00:05:52.449> with<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:52.810> rules<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.050> chess<00:05:53.110> I<00:05:53.410> hope

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
familiar with the rules of chess I hope

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.200 
familiar with the rules of chess I hope
you<00:05:53.650> are<00:05:53.740> by<00:05:53.949> now<00:05:54.130> when<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:54.460> move<00:05:54.639> a<00:05:54.760> pawn<00:05:54.940> to

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
you are by now when you move a pawn to

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.170 
you are by now when you move a pawn to
squares<00:05:55.539> then<00:05:56.470> it<00:05:57.130> can<00:05:57.400> be<00:05:57.580> captured<00:05:58.030> if

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
squares then it can be captured if

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.120 
squares then it can be captured if
another<00:05:58.479> pawn<00:05:58.750> is<00:05:58.990> standing<00:05:59.350> adjacent<00:05:59.889> so<00:06:00.039> in

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
another pawn is standing adjacent so in

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.969 
another pawn is standing adjacent so in
this<00:06:00.280> case<00:06:00.490> on<00:06:00.669> d4<00:06:01.150> f4<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:02.350> would<00:06:02.530> be<00:06:02.680> able<00:06:02.889> to

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
this case on d4 f4 it would be able to

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.560 
this case on d4 f4 it would be able to
capture<00:06:03.220> that<00:06:03.490> pawn<00:06:03.789> on<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.180> square

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
capture that pawn on the square

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.740 
capture that pawn on the square

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
III only in the next move so at the

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.550 
III only in the next move so at the
moment<00:06:08.130> III<00:06:09.130> is<00:06:09.580> set<00:06:10.389> as<00:06:10.570> what's<00:06:10.840> known<00:06:10.900> as<00:06:11.229> the

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
moment III is set as what's known as the

and then after playing c5 let's just

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:24.629 
and then after playing c5 let's just
copy<00:06:18.339> one<00:06:18.879> more<00:06:19.149> in

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.520

and now this is played and let's have a
look<00:06:26.620> again<00:06:26.770> that's<00:06:27.099> the<00:06:27.400> position<00:06:28.030> here<00:06:29.340> and

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
look again that's the position here and

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.920 
look again that's the position here and
now<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:30.550> see<00:06:30.819> we've<00:06:31.000> got<00:06:31.120> exactly<00:06:31.389> the<00:06:31.689> same

five and so on and c6 is now set as the

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.510 
five and so on and c6 is now set as the
on<00:06:55.360> passant<00:06:55.750> square<00:06:56.080> because<00:06:56.680> this<00:06:57.129> move<00:06:57.370> has

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
on passant square because this move has

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.589 
on passant square because this move has
just<00:06:57.729> been<00:06:57.879> played<00:06:58.710> so<00:06:59.849> that's<00:07:00.849> it<00:07:01.029> really<00:07:01.389> for

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 
just been played so that's it really for

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.629 
just been played so that's it really for
this<00:07:01.810> video<00:07:02.169> because<00:07:02.500> it's<00:07:02.740> already<00:07:03.129> getting

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 
this video because it's already getting

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.029 
this video because it's already getting
over<00:07:03.849> seven<00:07:04.150> minutes<00:07:04.449> and<00:07:04.659> what<00:07:05.650> we<00:07:05.800> need<00:07:06.009> to

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 
over seven minutes and what we need to

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:09.149 
over seven minutes and what we need to
do<00:07:06.310> in<00:07:06.460> the<00:07:06.550> next<00:07:06.669> video<00:07:07.060> is<00:07:07.419> we<00:07:08.080> need<00:07:08.259> to<00:07:08.379> write

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:09.159 
do in the next video is we need to write

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:12.570 
do in the next video is we need to write
a<00:07:09.219> function<00:07:09.580> or<00:07:10.060> start<00:07:10.330> writing<00:07:10.779> a<00:07:10.840> function

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
a function or start writing a function

a function or start writing a function
that<00:07:12.880> will<00:07:13.060> take<00:07:13.330> a<00:07:13.690> string<00:07:14.500> in<00:07:14.770> this<00:07:15.280> format

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:15.790 
that will take a string in this format

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.810 
that will take a string in this format
in<00:07:16.030> the<00:07:16.180> f<00:07:16.270> en<00:07:16.540> string<00:07:17.040> are<00:07:18.040> appointed<00:07:18.550> to<00:07:18.580> this

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
in the f en string are appointed to this

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.600 
in the f en string are appointed to this
string<00:07:19.120> and<00:07:19.860> actually<00:07:20.860> walk<00:07:21.100> through<00:07:21.130> this

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.610 
string and actually walk through this

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.480 
string and actually walk through this
string<00:07:21.940> left<00:07:22.390> to<00:07:22.600> right<00:07:22.780> and<00:07:23.190> set<00:07:24.190> the<00:07:24.310> board

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
string left to right and set the board

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.830 
string left to right and set the board
up<00:07:24.640> accordingly<00:07:25.090> and<00:07:25.360> as<00:07:25.450> you<00:07:25.600> can<00:07:25.750> imagine

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
up accordingly and as you can imagine

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.680 
up accordingly and as you can imagine
probably<00:07:26.410> imagine<00:07:27.100> it's<00:07:28.060> a<00:07:28.270> little<00:07:28.540> bit

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690 
probably imagine it's a little bit

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.540 
probably imagine it's a little bit
tricky<00:07:29.020> because<00:07:29.140> you<00:07:29.350> start<00:07:29.650> at<00:07:29.890> the<00:07:30.280> back

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
tricky because you start at the back

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.430 
tricky because you start at the back
rank<00:07:30.880> and<00:07:31.150> walk<00:07:31.330> through<00:07:31.660> from<00:07:31.900> left<00:07:32.110> to<00:07:32.170> right

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 
rank and walk through from left to right

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.650 
rank and walk through from left to right
so<00:07:32.800> you<00:07:32.860> don't<00:07:33.580> do<00:07:33.730> it<00:07:33.820> in<00:07:33.940> any<00:07:34.060> convenient

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
so you don't do it in any convenient

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.450 
so you don't do it in any convenient
manner<00:07:34.870> for<00:07:35.200> the<00:07:35.470> indexing<00:07:35.980> in<00:07:36.070> the<00:07:36.190> arrays

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460 
manner for the indexing in the arrays

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.400 
manner for the indexing in the arrays
you<00:07:36.670> have<00:07:36.760> to<00:07:36.850> be<00:07:36.970> a<00:07:37.000> little<00:07:37.060> bit<00:07:37.300> careful<00:07:37.510> but

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.410 
you have to be a little bit careful but

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.930 
you have to be a little bit careful but
like<00:07:38.740> I<00:07:38.830> said<00:07:38.890> we'll<00:07:39.190> have<00:07:39.370> a<00:07:39.400> look<00:07:39.550> at<00:07:39.640> exactly

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:39.940 
like I said we'll have a look at exactly

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.180 
like I said we'll have a look at exactly
doing<00:07:40.390> that<00:07:40.600> in<00:07:40.840> the<00:07:40.930> next<00:07:41.140> video<00:07:41.380> I<00:07:41.620> hope<00:07:42.040> that

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.190 
doing that in the next video I hope that

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.300 
doing that in the next video I hope that
made<00:07:42.310> some<00:07:42.460> sense<00:07:42.670> about<00:07:42.970> FIM<00:07:43.360> notation<00:07:44.020> and

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310 
made some sense about FIM notation and

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.440
