00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
I don't know why that is could be just

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.710 
I don't know why that is could be just
another<00:02:10.590> glitch<00:02:10.890> who<00:02:11.069> cares<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.569> see

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
another glitch who cares but as you see

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
another glitch who cares but as you see
the<00:02:12.840> frontcourt<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the frontcourt and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
the frontcourt and
the<00:02:13.920> back<00:02:14.100> code<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.610> West<00:02:14.850> Indies<00:02:15.240> they're

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the back code for West Indies they're

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.300 
the back code for West Indies they're
all<00:02:15.990> pretty<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.470> what<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.130> there

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
all pretty like what you think there

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.380 
all pretty like what you think there
would<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.460> there<00:02:17.730> except<00:02:18.000> maybe<00:02:18.120> there's<00:02:18.360> like

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
would be there except maybe there's like

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.630 
would be there except maybe there's like
rudy<00:02:18.810> Gay<00:02:19.080> Kemba<00:02:19.590> Walker<00:02:19.620> even<00:02:20.490> though<00:02:20.610> I

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
rudy Gay Kemba Walker even though I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.040 
rudy Gay Kemba Walker even though I
think<00:02:20.730> Emma<00:02:21.120> Walker<00:02:21.360> actually<00:02:21.750> should<00:02:21.930> have

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
think Emma Walker actually should have

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.510 
think Emma Walker actually should have
been<00:02:22.170> an<00:02:22.260> all-star<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.890> year<00:02:22.950> that's<00:02:23.310> just

here's one hundred percent happy for us

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.500 
here's one hundred percent happy for us
that<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.610> good<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.030> we're<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.270> getting

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
that is so good so we're not getting

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.690

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
50,000 vc that sounds pretty cool like I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.030 
50,000 vc that sounds pretty cool like I
would<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.840> purchased<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> tivo<00:02:43.680> cool<00:02:43.950> would
