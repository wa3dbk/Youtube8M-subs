00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.300 

alright<00:00:00.450> so<00:00:00.810> in<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.110> tutorial<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:02.040> going<00:00:02.250> to

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
alright so in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.880 
alright so in this tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.030> can<00:00:03.330> get<00:00:03.890> several

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
show you how you can get several

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.240 
show you how you can get several
different<00:00:05.400> objects<00:00:06.560> randomly<00:00:07.560> instance<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
different objects randomly instance to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.930 
different objects randomly instance to
one<00:00:08.460> particle<00:00:08.910> shape<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:10.219> have<00:00:11.219> their<00:00:11.490> scales

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
one particle shape and have their scales

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.350 
one particle shape and have their scales
and<00:00:12.269> rotations<00:00:12.900> also<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.620> random<00:00:14.120> so<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.179> just

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
and rotations also be random so I'm just

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450 
and rotations also be random so I'm just
going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> go<00:00:15.719> ahead<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.350> create<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.740> bunch<00:00:17.070> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
going to go ahead and create a bunch of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.840 
going to go ahead and create a bunch of
objects<00:00:18.330> here<00:00:20.060> and<00:00:21.060> make<00:00:21.449> sure<00:00:21.689> their

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
objects here and make sure their

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.710 
objects here and make sure their
transforms<00:00:23.850> are<00:00:23.970> at<00:00:24.090> zero<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> origin

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
transforms are at zero at the origin

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
transforms are at zero at the origin
which<00:00:25.289> they<00:00:25.470> should<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.859> otherwise<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.430> can

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
which they should be otherwise you can

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.339 
which they should be otherwise you can
freeze<00:00:26.880> their<00:00:27.090> transformations<00:00:27.840> if<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.199> have

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
freeze their transformations if you have

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.910 
freeze their transformations if you have
something<00:00:28.849> pre-built

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
something pre-built

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:47.530 
something pre-built
so<00:00:31.920> let's<00:00:32.340> create<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.390> particle<00:00:34.130> emitter

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.680 

just<00:00:48.540> rotated<00:00:49.170> quick

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.990 

you<00:00:55.260> open<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.250> our<00:00:56.460> outliner

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240 

okay<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.900> it's<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.379> everything<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:04.980> want<00:01:05.160> an

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
okay and it's like everything we want an

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.000 
okay and it's like everything we want an
instance<00:01:06.980> in<00:01:07.980> our<00:01:08.310> particle<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:13.950> we

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
instance in our particle and so now we

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.610 
instance in our particle and so now we
selected<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.910> these<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.170> created<00:01:16.440> an

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
selected all of these and it created an

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.109 
selected all of these and it created an
instance<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.250> let's<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.850> quick<00:01:20.119> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
instance here let's go to that quick and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.490 
instance here let's go to that quick and
in<00:01:21.510> our<00:01:21.630> attribute<00:01:22.080> editor<00:01:26.930> show<00:01:27.930> us<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.260> list

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
in our attribute editor show us a list

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.400 
in our attribute editor show us a list
alone<00:01:28.800> because<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:29.910> an<00:01:30.000> index<00:01:30.420> number<00:01:30.510> this

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
alone because I'm an index number this

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.910 
alone because I'm an index number this
will<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.680> important<00:01:32.130> later<00:01:33.500> everything<00:01:34.500> else

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
will be important later everything else

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.760 
will be important later everything else
is<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> default<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:38.490> hit<00:01:38.610> play

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
is that default so when you hit play

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.150 
is that default so when you hit play
notice<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.979> first<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.560> list<00:01:43.710> only

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
notice that first one in the list only

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.300 
notice that first one in the list only
comes<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.220> get

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
comes out so what we have to do to get

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.840 
comes out so what we have to do to get
them<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.550> be<00:01:47.670> random<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.360> create<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.850> custom

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
them to be random just create a custom

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.210 
them to be random just create a custom
index<00:01:52.850> which<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.039> reading

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
index which right now it's just reading

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.440 
index which right now it's just reading
the<00:01:56.460> first<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.640> our<00:01:59.759> instance<00:02:00.240> ER

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the first one so in our instance ER

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
the first one so in our instance ER
under<00:02:00.899> our<00:02:00.930> particle<00:02:01.560> shape<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.130> all

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
under our particle shape we have all

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.630 
under our particle shape we have all
these<00:02:05.460> options<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.390> object<00:02:07.290> index<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
these options and object index is the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.680 
these options and object index is the
one<00:02:09.030> we're<00:02:09.959> gonna<00:02:10.080> use<00:02:10.380> right<00:02:10.619> now<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.690> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
one we're gonna use right now but you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.199 
one we're gonna use right now but you
know<00:02:12.750> nothing<00:02:13.380> there<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:16.700> we're<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:18.090> to

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
know nothing there so we're going to

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.750 
know nothing there so we're going to
create<00:02:18.870> an<00:02:19.440> attribute<00:02:20.100> per<00:02:20.430> particle

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
create an attribute per particle

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.520 
create an attribute per particle
attribute<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.400> floats<00:02:23.700> fine<00:02:24.530> call

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
attribute it's just a floats fine call

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.339 
attribute it's just a floats fine call
custom<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.160> mix

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.780 

okay<00:02:34.159> and<00:02:35.120> gossip<00:02:35.749> enix

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
okay and gossip enix

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.599 
okay and gossip enix
so<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.999> the<00:02:38.120> creation<00:02:38.480> expression<00:02:39.609> which

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
so in the creation expression which

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.239 
so in the creation expression which
happens<00:02:41.090> at<00:02:41.450> birth<00:02:41.749> of<00:02:42.019> each<00:02:42.170> single<00:02:42.650> particle

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:43.249 
happens at birth of each single particle

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:45.420 
happens at birth of each single particle
since<00:02:43.489> it's<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.760> per<00:02:43.969> particle<00:02:44.239> attribute

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
since it's a per particle attribute

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.050 
since it's a per particle attribute
we're<00:02:46.430> going<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:47.139> say<00:02:50.019> we<00:02:51.019> want<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.409> to<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:52.060> you

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
we're going to say we want it to be you

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.330 
we're going to say we want it to be you
know<00:02:53.180> any<00:02:53.420> one<00:02:53.629> of<00:02:53.689> those<00:02:53.930> numbers<00:02:54.319> we<00:02:55.129> saw

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
know any one of those numbers we saw

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.110 
know any one of those numbers we saw
before<00:02:55.519> so<00:02:56.000> we<00:02:56.389> use<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.840> rand<00:02:57.019> command<00:02:58.120> to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
before so we use the rand command to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.909 
before so we use the rand command to
generate<00:02:59.299> generate<00:03:00.079> a<00:03:00.319> random<00:03:00.650> number

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
generate generate a random number

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.319 
generate generate a random number
between<00:03:01.219> 0<00:03:02.150> which<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.719> first<00:03:02.959> one<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.760> I

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
between 0 which is the first one and I

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.110 
between 0 which is the first one and I
usually<00:03:05.989> go<00:03:06.230> one<00:03:06.439> above<00:03:06.739> 8<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:08.079> think<00:03:10.120> because

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
usually go one above 8 I think because

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.629 
usually go one above 8 I think because
when<00:03:11.719> the<00:03:11.870> instance<00:03:12.290> are<00:03:12.500> or<00:03:13.129> when<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.430> rand

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
when the instance are or when the rand

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.789 
when the instance are or when the rand
function<00:03:14.680> creates<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:16.189> random<00:03:17.090> number<00:03:17.239> like

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
function creates a random number like

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:24.089 
function creates a random number like
you<00:03:18.799> know<00:03:19.299> 7.3<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:21.650> know<00:03:21.769> still<00:03:22.669> it'll<00:03:23.060> use<00:03:23.180> 7

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
you know 7.3 you know still it'll use 7

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.539 
you know 7.3 you know still it'll use 7

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
so in instance here over here say we got

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.819 
so in instance here over here say we got
a<00:03:28.579> 7.3<00:03:29.859> 4<00:03:30.859> 5<00:03:31.129> or<00:03:31.879> whatever<00:03:32.469> it'll<00:03:33.469> still<00:03:33.739> be

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
a 7.3 4 5 or whatever it'll still be

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
pipe 1 if we go 8 it just increases your

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:50.210 
pipe 1 if we go 8 it just increases your
odds<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.859> getting<00:03:39.919> this<00:03:40.280> last<00:03:40.549> guy<00:03:41.919> so<00:03:42.919> anyway

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
custom index I didn't create it so now

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.970 
custom index I didn't create it so now
it's<00:03:53.700> gone<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.510> why<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:55.050> good<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.680> do

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
it's gone this is why it's good to do

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.850 
it's gone this is why it's good to do

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
between 0 &amp; 8 &amp; create alright so if you

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.080 
between 0 &amp; 8 &amp; create alright so if you
go<00:04:11.040> play<00:04:12.020> still<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.170> same<00:04:13.380> thing<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.910> that's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
go play still the same thing and that's

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.910 
go play still the same thing and that's
because<00:04:15.540> we<00:04:15.720> haven't<00:04:15.930> changed<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.500> instance

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
because we haven't changed the instance

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.070 
because we haven't changed the instance
or<00:04:17.100> settings<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.700> our<00:04:17.880> particle<00:04:18.330> so<00:04:18.660> with<00:04:18.900> your

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
or settings on our particle so with your

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.490 
or settings on our particle so with your
particle<00:04:19.470> selected<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.680> your<00:04:22.890> index<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
particle selected you to your index and

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.280 
particle selected you to your index and
now<00:04:25.740> custom<00:04:26.340> index<00:04:26.640> shows<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.390> now<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:27.930> have

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
now custom index shows and now you have

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.190 
now custom index shows and now you have
a<00:04:28.320> random<00:04:28.620> number<00:04:29.450> and<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:30.540> can<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:30.930> what<00:04:31.080> it

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
a random number and you can see what it

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.100 
a random number and you can see what it
is<00:04:31.230> if<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.010> go<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.690> numeric<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.970> say<00:04:36.420> custom

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
is if you go to numeric and say custom

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.450 
is if you go to numeric and say custom
index

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.360 

so<00:04:45.719> see<00:04:46.719> it<00:04:47.080> gets<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.379> decimal<00:04:47.889> but<00:04:48.159> when<00:04:48.279> you

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
so see it gets the decimal but when you

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.189 
so see it gets the decimal but when you
go<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.550> your<00:04:48.639> instance<00:04:48.969> here<00:04:51.599> 2.1<00:04:52.599> goes<00:04:52.900> down

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
go to your instance here 2.1 goes down

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.929 
go to your instance here 2.1 goes down
to<00:04:53.499> just<00:04:53.710> 2<00:04:53.979> doesn't<00:04:54.460> go<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.909> doesn't<00:04:55.210> round<00:04:55.360> up

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
to just 2 doesn't go it doesn't round up

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:03.510 
to just 2 doesn't go it doesn't round up
like<00:04:58.020> 6.7<00:04:59.310> still<00:05:00.310> pyramid<00:05:01.740> all<00:05:02.740> right<00:05:02.949> so<00:05:03.370> now

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
like 6.7 still pyramid all right so now

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.139 
like 6.7 still pyramid all right so now
they're<00:05:03.789> randomly<00:05:04.240> instance
