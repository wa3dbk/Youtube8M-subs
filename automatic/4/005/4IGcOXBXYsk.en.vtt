 Washington Studio I'm leading tatyana 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.869
 United States remain 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.090
 committed to resolving conflict in 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.880
 Ukraine in the framework of the Minsk agreements 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.039
 by diplomatic and other not 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.140
 military pressure on russia stated on 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.930

 psaki Kiev Ambassador of the United States in Ukraine Geoffrey 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.190
 Payette clarified that decisions are not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.220
 provide Ukraine with lethal weapons 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.769
 not final and maybe 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.470
 revised at the same time the us and their 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.269
 the allies continue to increase military 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.699
 power on borders with Russia 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.440
 NATO warships arrived in Romanian 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.089
 port of constancy to participate 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.400
 naval exercises forces fast 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.589
 responses will take part in them 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.260
 american missile cruiser lexmark and 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.600
 ships of canada germany and italy 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.540
 regular exercises are held within 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.630
 increase the military readiness of the eastern 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.729
 NATO Allies in the face of 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.920
 possible aggression by russia on 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.560
 last week the Russian defense minister 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.490
 stated that they began full-scale 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.020
 exercises in southern Russia introduced 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.760
 government restrictions on movement 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.710
 in the east of Ukraine 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.750
 seriously hampered by the rendering 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.780
 medical care in the territories 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.730
 controlled by pro-russian militants 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.410
 about this backward stated poses 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.090
 united states human rights 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.090
 human rights watch organization 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.210
 for 10 days 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.250
 the organization held telephone direct 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.440
 interviews with medical staff and 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.690
 patients in eastern Ukraine on their 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.420
 based human rights watch making 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.830
 the conclusion is that restrictions on movement 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.200
 prevents access of ukrainian citizens 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.970
 the eastern region of the country to doctors and 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.920
 pharmacies in the territory under 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.570
 government control is in 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.720
 particular concerns patients hiv 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.100
 tuberculosis and drug addicts 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.840
 restrictions also created problems for 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.430
 medication replenishment 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.720
 hospitals to the territory which 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.790
 controlled by separatists I will revive 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.010
 Putin intrigue spreads by 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.140
 the internet in the last few days in 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.120
 friday swiss back 100 black 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.130

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.890
 Putin and Alina Kabaeva 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.200
 born daughter of the kind allegedly held in 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.630
 Switzerland is what explains it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.440
 journalists the absence of Putin on the worker 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.570
 the place is also the time the press secretary 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.260
 President about the cares of a young father 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.630
 nothing is known Putin is burning at work 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.000
 Dmitri Sands approves and proven 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.550
 day to day sometimes not necessary 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.890
 he appears more in public sometimes 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.800
 less but it does not mean that he 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.140
 ceased to be a workaholic this version 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.480
 Kremlin confirms the form of photographs 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.000
 official meetings of the president each of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.050
 which cause those who believe skepticism 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.110
 to the demise of the leader 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:08.800
 versions where he disappeared and if alive than 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:11.440
 are engaged in multiplying Putin stolen 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.270
 aliens cartoon with such 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.220
 Script created students who 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.670
 engaged in pussy animation studio 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.140
 a circle 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.330
 it tells how 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.500
 Russian president stole n l and 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.510
 after which peace and tranquility came upon the earth 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.780
 the funniest thing is when Putin 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.110
 collective and low sand won 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.240
 his Ukrainian children express a relationship 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.690
 imposed on Russia by their war 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.050
 creativity, I know for sure that the Ukrainians 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.120
 were absolutely nothing to do with Russia and plans 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.810
 about the conquest of our country was worth 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.120
 already a very long time since the time of the collapse 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.940
 soviet union to back is all 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.850
 return it was unnoticed and covered 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.270
 but Putin and his associates is all 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.120
 did 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.520
 pussy studio has created a series of antiwar 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.650
 cartoons in another Russian movie 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.590
 aggression is shown in the form of an alligator 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.959
 who devours parts of Ukraine chokes 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.870
 too big a piece and dies not 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.270
 understand why should not fight because 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.470
 the fact that from the fact that each brand 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.270
 others want this war 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.220
 it is absolutely wrong and generally i 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.580
 vs 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.510
 any war and humanity the whole period 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.480
 of my existence, they constantly fight, and I 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.980
 I do not think that this is normal because 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.370
 you can solve problems somehow and 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.370
 differently 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.870
 and on this i say goodbye to you was a studio 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.060
