to<00:00:02.560> change<00:00:02.830> the<00:00:03.070> color<00:00:03.280> of<00:00:03.399> light<00:00:03.790> you<00:00:04.270> can<00:00:04.300> use

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.450 
to change the color of light you can use

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.549 
to change the color of light you can use
filters<00:00:04.960> like<00:00:05.800> this<00:00:06.010> red<00:00:06.250> one<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:08.109> filament

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
filters like this red one the filament

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.619 
filters like this red one the filament
at<00:00:08.740> the<00:00:08.889> back<00:00:09.099> of<00:00:09.129> the<00:00:09.460> lamp<00:00:09.639> emits<00:00:09.910> all<00:00:10.389> the

colors<00:00:10.959> of<00:00:11.110> the<00:00:11.230> spectrum<00:00:11.349> which<00:00:12.280> we<00:00:12.309> see<00:00:12.669> as

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
colors of the spectrum which we see as

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.279 
colors of the spectrum which we see as
white<00:00:13.240> light<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.910> only<00:00:16.090> red<00:00:16.510> light<00:00:16.539> passes

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
white light but only red light passes

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.710 
white light but only red light passes
through<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.769> filter<00:00:18.189> or<00:00:18.519> the<00:00:19.150> other<00:00:19.300> colors

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720

through the filter or the other colors
are<00:00:19.929> absorbed<00:00:20.590> so<00:00:21.160> now<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.400> lamp<00:00:21.699> only

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
are absorbed so now the lamp only

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:31.110 
are absorbed so now the lamp only
appears<00:00:22.449> to<00:00:22.630> give<00:00:22.750> out<00:00:22.869> red<00:00:23.259> light

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
red green and blue are the primary

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.280 
red green and blue are the primary
colors<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.330> light<00:00:36.900> combining<00:00:37.900> a<00:00:37.990> pair<00:00:38.260> of

colors of light combining a pair of
primary<00:00:38.950> colors<00:00:39.160> gives<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:40.090> secondary

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
primary colors gives the secondary

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.870 
primary colors gives the secondary
colors<00:00:43.080> adding<00:00:44.080> blue<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.620> green<00:00:44.980> mix<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.670> color

red<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:52.430> blue<00:00:52.699> make<00:00:53.149> magenta

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.450

add red and green together and you get

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.070 
add red and green together and you get
yellow<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:03.330> overlapping<00:01:04.330> all<00:01:04.660> three
