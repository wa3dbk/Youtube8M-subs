00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.159 
can you explain why this is applied to
English<00:04:21.290> because<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:22.010> pitch<00:04:22.220> was<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:22.640> small

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
English because the pitch was so small

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.000 
English because the pitch was so small
most<00:04:24.169> of<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.350> time<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.590> play

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
most of the time I play

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.890 
most of the time I play
against<00:04:25.250> people<00:04:25.640> who<00:04:25.820> were<00:04:26.150> five<00:04:26.420> or<00:04:26.600> six

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
against people who were five or six

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.470 
against people who were five or six
years<00:04:27.020> older<00:04:27.500> than<00:04:27.620> me<00:04:27.680> at<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.790> time<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.240> was

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
years older than me at the time I was

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.750 
years older than me at the time I was
not<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.870> tall<00:04:30.170> I<00:04:30.440> had<00:04:30.890> to<00:04:31.010> establish<00:04:31.160> myself

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
not that tall I had to establish myself

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.500 
not that tall I had to establish myself
against<00:04:32.300> older<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:32.960> stronger<00:04:33.470> people

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
against older and stronger people

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.970 
against older and stronger people
because<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.660> pitch<00:04:35.840> was<00:04:35.870> so<00:04:36.230> small<00:04:36.530> we<00:04:36.710> didn't

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
because the pitch was so small we didn't

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.850 
because the pitch was so small we didn't
have<00:04:37.160> any<00:04:37.370> corners<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.510> game<00:04:38.720> always<00:04:38.990> went<00:04:39.590> on

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
have any corners the game always went on

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.880 
have any corners the game always went on
my<00:04:40.850> bike<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.630> think<00:04:41.960> this<00:04:42.260> helped<00:04:42.590> me<00:04:42.710> to

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
my bike and I think this helped me to

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.730 
my bike and I think this helped me to
improve<00:04:43.040> my<00:04:43.760> technique<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.450> lot<00:04:44.740> that

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
improve my technique a lot that

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.560 
improve my technique a lot that
definitely<00:04:46.070> made<00:04:46.550> life<00:04:46.790> easier<00:04:47.270> for<00:04:47.330> the

definitely made life easier for the
future<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.110> think<00:04:48.950> you<00:04:49.040> can<00:04:49.190> see<00:04:49.400> on<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.910> pitch

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
future I think you can see on the pitch
