a GPU that i'm really really proud of
when<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.630> built<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.619> wanted<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> be<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
when we built this we wanted to be the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.029 
when we built this we wanted to be the
world's<00:00:17.789> fastest<00:00:18.510> GPU<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.529> accomplished

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
world's fastest GPU and we accomplished

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.279 
world's fastest GPU and we accomplished
that<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.090> also<00:00:21.240> want<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.840> extremely

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
that but we also want it to be extremely

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
up a lot of heat and that's what we've

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.920 
up a lot of heat and that's what we've
built<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.329> invented<00:00:33.719> some<00:00:33.899> new

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
built here we invented some new

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.630 
built here we invented some new
technology<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.620> goes<00:00:34.890> hand<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.250> hand<00:00:35.460> with

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
technology that goes hand in hand with

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.130 
technology that goes hand in hand with
this<00:00:35.760> graphics<00:00:36.149> card<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.510> first<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.020> call

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this graphics card the first one we call

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.010 
this graphics card the first one we call
GPU<00:00:37.620> boost<00:00:37.860> which<00:00:38.460> boosts<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.390> clock<00:00:39.690> speed

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
GPU boost which boosts your clock speed

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020 
GPU boost which boosts your clock speed
when<00:00:40.260> you're<00:00:40.350> playing<00:00:40.590> certain<00:00:40.829> games<00:00:41.160> so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
when you're playing certain games so

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
when you're playing certain games so
here's<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.390> GPU<00:00:42.780> boost<00:00:42.989> works<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.800> used<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
here's how GPU boost works we used to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.709 
here's how GPU boost works we used to
set<00:00:44.340> our<00:00:44.460> clocks<00:00:44.789> based<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> power

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
set our clocks based on the power

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.150 
set our clocks based on the power
consumed<00:00:46.200> when<00:00:46.410> you're<00:00:46.530> running<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.860> really

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
consumed when you're running a really

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.920 
consumed when you're running a really
stressful<00:00:47.430> application<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.660> found

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
stressful application but we found

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
stressful application but we found
there's<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> lot<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.500> 3d<00:00:49.770> games<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.309> actually

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
there's a lot of 3d games that actually

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
there's a lot of 3d games that actually
don't<00:00:50.850> consume<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.449> much<00:00:51.660> power<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.739> do

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
don't consume that much power so what do

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.990 
don't consume that much power so what do
you<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.250> extra<00:00:53.370> power

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you do with that extra power

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
you do with that extra power
well<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.360> GPU<00:00:54.750> boost<00:00:54.930> does<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.530> lets<00:00:55.980> us

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
well what GPU boost does it lets us

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760 
well what GPU boost does it lets us
convert<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.760> power<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.539> increased<00:00:58.500> clock

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
convert that power into increased clock

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.220 
convert that power into increased clock
speeds<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> automatically<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
speeds and we do it automatically the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.510 
speeds and we do it automatically the
result<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:01.980> you're<00:01:02.100> playing<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.489> game

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
result is when you're playing a game

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060 
result is when you're playing a game
you'll<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> boost<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.170> GPU<00:01:04.769> clock

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
you'll get a boost in your GPU clock

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.160 
you'll get a boost in your GPU clock
that<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.700> result<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.240> increased<00:01:06.540> gaming

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that will result in increased gaming

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.719 
that will result in increased gaming
performance<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.189> awesome<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
performance it's really awesome and you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.350 
performance it's really awesome and you
got<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.090> check<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:12.030> make<00:01:12.060> your

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
got to just check it out to make your

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.539 
got to just check it out to make your
gaming<00:01:12.570> experience<00:01:12.830> smoother<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.400> did

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
gaming experience smoother what we did

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
gaming experience smoother what we did
is<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.729> invented<00:01:15.210> technologies<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> AAA

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
is we invented technologies on the AAA

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.399 
is we invented technologies on the AAA
side<00:01:17.130> we're<00:01:17.460> gonna<00:01:17.520> call<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> TxAA<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
side we're gonna call it TxAA and it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.289 
side we're gonna call it TxAA and it
really<00:01:19.830> gets<00:01:20.310> rid<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> jaggies<00:01:21.180> in

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
really gets rid of all the jaggies in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.609 
really gets rid of all the jaggies in
the<00:01:21.390> game<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> doesn't<00:01:22.409> take<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the game but it doesn't take a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.990 
the game but it doesn't take a
performance<00:01:23.159> hit<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.820> great

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
performance hit so you can have great

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
performance hit so you can have great
image<00:01:24.390> quality<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.470> fast<00:01:25.740> smooth

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
image quality but really fast smooth

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.670 
image quality but really fast smooth
gaming<00:01:26.460> performance<00:01:27.170> we've<00:01:28.170> also<00:01:28.350> made<00:01:28.619> some

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
gaming performance we've also made some

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
gaming performance we've also made some
advancements<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.610> area<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> physics<00:01:30.540> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
advancements in the area of physics so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.990 
advancements in the area of physics so
previously<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.710> had<00:01:31.829> our<00:01:31.920> apex<00:01:32.369> destruction

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
previously we had our apex destruction

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.550 
previously we had our apex destruction
module<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> wanted<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
module and if you wanted to have this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
module and if you wanted to have this
type<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> destruction<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> video<00:01:35.880> game<00:01:36.150> what

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
type of destruction in a video game what

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.200 
type of destruction in a video game what
the<00:01:36.720> artist<00:01:37.200> would<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:38.189> pre<00:01:38.549> compute<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the artist would do was pre compute the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.850 
the artist would do was pre compute the
fracture<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.290> once<00:01:40.500> you're<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
fracture and then once you're in the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
fracture and then once you're in the
video<00:01:41.070> game<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.000> shot<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.450> pillar<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
video game if you shot the pillar it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.230 
video game if you shot the pillar it
would<00:01:43.049> fracture<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> specific<00:01:43.860> way<00:01:44.310> what

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
would fracture in a specific way what

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.969 
would fracture in a specific way what
we're<00:01:45.390> looking<00:01:45.659> at<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> dynamic

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
we're looking at here is dynamic

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.789 
we're looking at here is dynamic
fracture<00:01:47.610> nothing<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.509> pre<00:01:48.750> computed<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.470> all

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
fracture nothing is pre computed it all

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
fracture nothing is pre computed it all
happens<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.369> real<00:01:50.579> time<00:01:50.820> whenever<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.990> shoot

happens in real time whenever you shoot

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679 
happens in real time whenever you shoot
this<00:01:52.590> pillar<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.399> will<00:01:53.610> never<00:01:53.909> break<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.450> same

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
this pillar it will never break the same

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.090 
this pillar it will never break the same
ever

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.920 

now<00:01:57.909> let's<00:01:58.090> look<00:01:58.180> at<00:01:58.330> what<00:01:58.450> we've<00:01:58.600> done<00:01:58.630> with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
now let's look at what we've done with

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.140 
now let's look at what we've done with
fur<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.229> video<00:01:59.740> games<00:02:00.040> now<00:02:00.400> if<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.820> wanted<00:02:01.030> to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
fur and video games now if you wanted to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.000 
fur and video games now if you wanted to
build<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.600> beast<00:02:01.840> like<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:02.110> before<00:02:02.710> you'd

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
build a beast like this before you'd

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.920 
build a beast like this before you'd
have<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.190> hundred<00:02:03.460> hairs<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:04.180> interpolated

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
have a hundred hairs and interpolated

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.380 
have a hundred hairs and interpolated
between<00:02:05.080> all<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> hairs<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:07.060> guys<00:02:07.210> have

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
between all the hairs and you guys have

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.999 
between all the hairs and you guys have
seen<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.660> you've<00:02:07.870> seen<00:02:07.930> lots<00:02:08.350> of<00:02:08.560> characters

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
seen it you've seen lots of characters

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.620 
seen it you've seen lots of characters
where<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.340> just<00:02:09.490> doesn't<00:02:09.580> look<00:02:09.880> realistic<00:02:10.209> or

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
where it just doesn't look realistic or

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.780 
where it just doesn't look realistic or
you<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.290> bald<00:02:11.560> characters<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.310> video<00:02:12.520> games

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
you see bald characters and video games

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.400 
you see bald characters and video games
or<00:02:13.000> they<00:02:13.120> have<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.540> know<00:02:13.570> plastic<00:02:13.900> looking

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
or they have you know plastic looking

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.500 
or they have you know plastic looking
hair<00:02:14.650> well<00:02:15.340> here<00:02:15.670> we're<00:02:15.850> simulating<00:02:16.209> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
hair well here we're simulating a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.480 
hair well here we're simulating a
hundred<00:02:16.840> thousand<00:02:17.320> hairs<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.740> real<00:02:17.950> time<00:02:18.190> and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
hundred thousand hairs in real time and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.949 
hundred thousand hairs in real time and
you<00:02:18.520> can<00:02:19.090> see<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.330> just<00:02:19.360> looks<00:02:19.540> super

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
you can see it just looks super

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.110 
you can see it just looks super
realistic<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.310> even<00:02:21.550> do<00:02:21.700> some<00:02:21.910> really

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
realistic we can even do some really

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.790 
realistic we can even do some really
cool<00:02:22.330> effects<00:02:22.780> like<00:02:22.990> these<00:02:23.200> hair<00:02:23.500> dryer

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
cool effects like these hair dryer

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.199 
cool effects like these hair dryer
effects<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.459> we're<00:02:24.610> looking<00:02:24.730> at<00:02:25.000> right<00:02:25.150> now

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
effects that we're looking at right now

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.260 
effects that we're looking at right now
so<00:02:25.959> once<00:02:26.470> again<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:26.980> adding<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.700> realism

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
so once again just adding more realism

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.130 
so once again just adding more realism
to<00:02:28.450> video<00:02:28.870> games<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.630> then<00:02:31.630> finally<00:02:32.020> if<00:02:32.080> we

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
to video games and then finally if we

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.199 
to video games and then finally if we
wanted<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.470> have<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.590> richer<00:02:33.010> experience<00:02:33.209> so

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
wanted you have a richer experience so

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.420 
wanted you have a richer experience so
things<00:02:34.660> like<00:02:34.810> 3d<00:02:35.080> vision<00:02:35.350> surround<00:02:35.770> off<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.280> a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
things like 3d vision surround off of a

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.520 
things like 3d vision surround off of a
single<00:02:36.670> graphics<00:02:37.180> card<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.600> single<00:02:37.840> GPU<00:02:38.320> and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
single graphics card or a single GPU and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.390 
single graphics card or a single GPU and
even<00:02:39.250> support<00:02:39.610> up<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:40.000> four<00:02:40.209> displays<00:02:41.400> so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
even support up to four displays so

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.460 
even support up to four displays so
there<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.670> have<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.180> geforce<00:02:43.570> gtx<00:02:43.959> 680

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
there you have it the geforce gtx 680

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.010 
there you have it the geforce gtx 680
it's<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.040> fastest<00:02:45.610> most<00:02:46.150> efficient<00:02:46.660> GPU

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
it's the fastest most efficient GPU

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.220 
it's the fastest most efficient GPU
we've<00:02:47.260> ever<00:02:47.470> built

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
we've ever built

00:02:48.230 --> 00:03:00.660 
we've ever built
