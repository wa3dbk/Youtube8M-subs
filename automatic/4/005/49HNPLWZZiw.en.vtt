we've<00:00:05.970> always<00:00:06.150> looked<00:00:06.330> at<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.600> nurburgring

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
we've always looked at the nurburgring

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.290 
we've always looked at the nurburgring
as<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.350> ultimate<00:00:07.649> validation<00:00:08.189> for<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> park

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
as the ultimate validation for the park

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.320 
as the ultimate validation for the park
we<00:00:09.990> have<00:00:10.230> on-site<00:00:10.710> tracks<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:12.120> rent

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
we have on-site tracks and we rent

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.660 
we have on-site tracks and we rent
tracks<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.780> North<00:00:12.929> America<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:14.460> there's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
tracks in North America but there's

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:38.530 
tracks in North America but there's
nothing<00:00:14.910> quite<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.480> Nurburgring
