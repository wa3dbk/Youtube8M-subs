so as played pretty typical pretty

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.500 
so as played pretty typical pretty
standard<00:00:18.160> it's<00:00:18.430> one<00:00:18.580> of<00:00:18.670> those<00:00:18.730> spots<00:00:19.090> when<00:00:19.390> we

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
standard it's one of those spots when we

standard it's one of those spots when we
bet<00:00:19.750> here<00:00:20.289> I<00:00:20.500> don't<00:00:21.400> expect<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:21.910> one<00:00:22.090> shots

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390

going<00:00:22.840> to<00:00:23.050> like<00:00:23.560> call<00:00:23.920> with<00:00:24.279> a<00:00:24.310> tremendous

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
going to like call with a tremendous

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.269 
going to like call with a tremendous
amount<00:00:25.029> of<00:00:25.060> second-best<00:00:25.689> so<00:00:26.410> it's<00:00:26.890> one<00:00:27.189> of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
amount of second-best so it's one of

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.560 
amount of second-best so it's one of
those<00:00:27.430> where<00:00:27.640> I'm<00:00:27.699> kind<00:00:27.939> of<00:00:28.029> betting<00:00:28.240> I'm

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
those where I'm kind of betting I'm

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.779 
those where I'm kind of betting I'm
folding<00:00:28.810> out<00:00:29.109> a<00:00:29.140> lot<00:00:29.769> of<00:00:29.800> his<00:00:29.980> equity<00:00:30.310> you<00:00:30.699> know

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
folding out a lot of his equity you know

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.549 
folding out a lot of his equity you know
maybe<00:00:31.029> I<00:00:31.119> get<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.449> occasional<00:00:31.720> second-best

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
maybe I get the occasional second-best

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.009 
maybe I get the occasional second-best
call<00:00:32.830> with<00:00:33.220> like<00:00:33.430> seven<00:00:34.390> or<00:00:34.420> sixes

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
call with like seven or sixes

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.869 
call with like seven or sixes
occasionally<00:00:35.620> but<00:00:36.220> more<00:00:36.400> often<00:00:36.699> than<00:00:36.850> not

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
occasionally but more often than not

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.549 
occasionally but more often than not
it's<00:00:37.210> just<00:00:37.390> kind<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.600> folding<00:00:37.930> on<00:00:38.050> equity<00:00:38.530> and

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
it's just kind of folding on equity and

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.259 
it's just kind of folding on equity and
folding<00:00:39.220> out<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.430> chance<00:00:39.699> for<00:00:39.909> me<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.120> check

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
folding out the chance for me to check

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.509 
folding out the chance for me to check
behind<00:00:40.659> to<00:00:40.930> face<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.140> barrel<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.799> the<00:00:41.830> turn<00:00:42.190> or

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
behind to face a barrel on the turn or

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.240 
behind to face a barrel on the turn or
River<00:00:42.729> that<00:00:43.000> I<00:00:43.059> can't<00:00:43.390> really<00:00:43.510> handle<00:00:43.830> so<00:00:44.830> it's

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
River that I can't really handle so it's

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.579 
River that I can't really handle so it's
one<00:00:45.430> of<00:00:45.519> those<00:00:45.640> situations<00:00:45.909> just<00:00:46.900> understand

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
one of those situations just understand

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.649 
one of those situations just understand
it's<00:00:47.799> not<00:00:47.920> like<00:00:48.100> oh<00:00:48.280> my<00:00:48.430> god<00:00:48.610> sicko<00:00:49.089> value<00:00:49.510> when

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
it's not like oh my god sicko value when

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.649 
it's not like oh my god sicko value when
you<00:00:49.750> make<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.170> bet<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.030> in<00:00:52.150> this<00:00:52.269> bar<00:00:52.479> we<00:00:52.570> end

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
you make this bet and in this bar we end

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.210 
you make this bet and in this bar we end
up<00:00:52.750> facing<00:00:53.049> a<00:00:53.110> check<00:00:53.320> raised<00:00:53.500> so<00:00:54.040> we're

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
up facing a check raised so we're

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.979 
up facing a check raised so we're
getting<00:00:54.309> 3.1<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.030> one<00:00:55.180> on<00:00:55.299> a<00:00:55.330> call<00:00:55.570> right<00:00:55.629> this

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
getting 3.1 to one on a call right this

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.460 
getting 3.1 to one on a call right this
moment<00:00:56.409> and<00:00:56.850> hero<00:00:57.850> does<00:00:58.119> decide<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.629> make<00:00:59.260> the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
moment and hero does decide to make the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.170 
moment and hero does decide to make the
call<00:00:59.739> and<00:01:00.100> let's<00:01:00.280> talk<00:01:00.489> about<00:01:00.549> that<00:01:00.790> for<00:01:01.119> a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
call and let's talk about that for a

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.479 
call and let's talk about that for a
minute<00:01:01.330> so<00:01:01.989> if<00:01:02.379> you're<00:01:02.559> gonna<00:01:02.710> call<00:01:02.979> here<00:01:03.280> it's

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
minute so if you're gonna call here it's

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.070 
minute so if you're gonna call here it's
because<00:01:03.640> you<00:01:03.909> assume<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.449> this<00:01:04.570> range<00:01:04.869> is

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
because you assume that this range is

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.429 
because you assume that this range is
probably<00:01:05.710> pretty<00:01:06.040> Bluff<00:01:06.369> II<00:01:06.549> and<00:01:07.200> I'd<00:01:08.200> say

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
probably pretty Bluff II and I'd say

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.870 
probably pretty Bluff II and I'd say
that's<00:01:08.619> probably<00:01:08.740> pretty<00:01:09.070> fair<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.700> don't

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
that's probably pretty fair I don't

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.550 
that's probably pretty fair I don't
expect<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.329> tag<00:01:10.539> to<00:01:10.780> do<00:01:10.899> a<00:01:10.930> tremendous<00:01:11.140> amount

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
expect a tag to do a tremendous amount

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.080 
expect a tag to do a tremendous amount
of<00:01:11.619> set<00:01:11.890> mining<00:01:12.219> out<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.460> position<00:01:12.850> in<00:01:13.000> the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
of set mining out of position in the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.849 
of set mining out of position in the
steel<00:01:13.299> pot<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:13.960> I'm<00:01:14.079> not<00:01:14.229> expecting<00:01:14.740> a

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
steel pot so I'm not expecting a

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:16.289 
steel pot so I'm not expecting a
tremendous<00:01:15.250> amount<00:01:15.460> of<00:01:15.490> like<00:01:15.640> pocket<00:01:16.060> fives

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
tremendous amount of like pocket fives

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.990 
tremendous amount of like pocket fives
pocket<00:01:16.930> threes<00:01:17.200> or<00:01:17.680> like<00:01:17.829> eight<00:01:18.100> five<00:01:18.429> suited

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
pocket threes or like eight five suited

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.870 
pocket threes or like eight five suited
so<00:01:19.810> I'm<00:01:20.140> not<00:01:20.289> expecting<00:01:20.439> a<00:01:20.979> lot<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.429> hands<00:01:21.759> like

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
so I'm not expecting a lot of hands like

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.359 
so I'm not expecting a lot of hands like
that<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.509> also<00:01:22.929> if<00:01:23.289> one<00:01:23.530> shot<00:01:23.770> did<00:01:24.039> just

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
that and also if one shot did just

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.450 
that and also if one shot did just
decide<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:25.200> call<00:01:26.200> preflop<00:01:26.740> with<00:01:26.979> like<00:01:27.100> nines

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
decide to call preflop with like nines

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.580 
decide to call preflop with like nines
or<00:01:27.670> tens<00:01:27.729> are<00:01:28.299> they<00:01:28.420> really<00:01:28.780> gonna<00:01:28.960> take<00:01:29.289> this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
or tens are they really gonna take this

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.859 
or tens are they really gonna take this
checker<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.159> lined<00:01:30.399> with<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:30.729> now<00:01:30.909> maybe<00:01:31.570> maybe

checker is lined with it now maybe maybe
not<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.380> that's<00:01:32.560> obviously<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.149> an<00:01:34.149> assumption

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
not and that's obviously a an assumption

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.840 
not and that's obviously a an assumption
you<00:01:34.689> have<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:35.229> make<00:01:35.380> yourself<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.640> by<00:01:36.789> the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
you have to make yourself but by the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.609 
you have to make yourself but by the
same<00:01:37.060> token<00:01:37.119> it's<00:01:37.810> important<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.380> at<00:01:38.499> least

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
same token it's important to at least

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.440 
same token it's important to at least
consider<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.609> know<00:01:39.789> what<00:01:39.820> goes<00:01:40.090> into<00:01:40.299> this

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
consider it and know what goes into this

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.010 
consider it and know what goes into this
decision<00:01:41.249> which<00:01:42.249> means<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.820> if<00:01:43.359> there's<00:01:43.869> not

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
decision which means that if there's not

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.539 
decision which means that if there's not
a<00:01:44.049> lot<00:01:44.229> of<00:01:44.259> like<00:01:44.469> strong<00:01:44.770> stuff<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.249> the<00:01:45.340> range

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
a lot of like strong stuff in the range

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.330 
a lot of like strong stuff in the range
that<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.299> large<00:01:46.749> majority<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.799> range<00:01:48.100> is

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
that a large majority of that range is

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.370 
that a large majority of that range is
probably<00:01:48.640> gonna<00:01:48.939> be<00:01:49.149> things<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:49.810> double

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
probably gonna be things like double

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.520 
probably gonna be things like double
Broadway's<00:01:50.740> ace<00:01:51.369> queen<00:01:51.909> is<00:01:52.240> Jackie's<00:01:53.109> ten

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
Broadway's ace queen is Jackie's ten

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.389 
Broadway's ace queen is Jackie's ten
King<00:01:54.009> Jack<00:01:54.369> blah<00:01:54.700> blah<00:01:54.880> blah<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:57.219> least

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
King Jack blah blah blah and at least

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.129 
King Jack blah blah blah and at least
then<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.789> have<00:01:57.969> a<00:01:57.999> pretty<00:01:58.329> good<00:01:58.539> idea<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.899> what

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
then you have a pretty good idea of what

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.050 
then you have a pretty good idea of what
their<00:01:59.350> range<00:01:59.560> looks<00:01:59.829> like<00:01:59.999> particularly<00:02:00.999> if

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
their range looks like particularly if

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.669 
their range looks like particularly if
you<00:02:01.149> can't<00:02:01.359> really<00:02:01.479> put<00:02:01.719> any<00:02:01.869> strong<00:02:02.229> combos

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
you can't really put any strong combos

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.980 
you can't really put any strong combos
in<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.130> remember<00:02:03.850> even<00:02:03.999> if<00:02:04.270> one<00:02:04.569> shot<00:02:04.780> does

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
in it and remember even if one shot does

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.870 
in it and remember even if one shot does
call<00:02:05.200> preflop<00:02:05.560> or<00:02:05.770> pocket<00:02:06.069> eights<00:02:06.219> there's

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
call preflop or pocket eights there's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.639 
call preflop or pocket eights there's
only<00:02:06.999> one<00:02:07.270> available<00:02:07.479> combo<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.350> given

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
only one available combo of that given

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.990 
only one available combo of that given
the<00:02:08.740> fact<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.190> have<00:02:09.280> an<00:02:09.399> e<00:02:09.490> in<00:02:09.610> our<00:02:09.729> hand

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
the fact that we have an e in our hand

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.350 
the fact that we have an e in our hand
so<00:02:10.769> in<00:02:11.769> this<00:02:11.920> situation<00:02:12.159> I<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.120> fact

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
so in this situation I like the fact

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.210 
so in this situation I like the fact
that<00:02:13.480> heroes<00:02:13.840> call<00:02:14.170> him<00:02:14.409> how

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
that heroes call him how

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.730 
that heroes call him how
I<00:02:15.250> cannot<00:02:15.970> stress<00:02:16.540> enough<00:02:16.570> how<00:02:16.960> important<00:02:17.710> it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
I cannot stress enough how important it

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.370 
I cannot stress enough how important it
is<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:17.980> have<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> hand<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.570> plan<00:02:19.990> sorry

we approve to occurred like a four which

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.370 
we approve to occurred like a four which
does<00:02:33.940> brick<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.390> board<00:02:34.600> gives<00:02:34.840> us<00:02:34.990> some<00:02:35.140> extra

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
does brick the board gives us some extra

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.470 
does brick the board gives us some extra
equity<00:02:35.890> are<00:02:36.250> we<00:02:36.400> gonna<00:02:36.550> love<00:02:36.760> facing<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.300> turn

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
equity are we gonna love facing a turn

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.990 
equity are we gonna love facing a turn
bet<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.020> possibly<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.590> river<00:02:38.830> barrel<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.580> also

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
bet and possibly a river barrel and also

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.940 
bet and possibly a river barrel and also
the<00:02:40.540> other<00:02:40.720> half<00:02:40.990> of<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.200> deck<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.590> gotta<00:02:41.830> be

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
the other half of the deck is gotta be

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.670 
the other half of the deck is gotta be
over<00:02:42.340> cards<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.450> things<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.170> could<00:02:44.410> be

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
over cards so things that could be

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.950 
over cards so things that could be
improving<00:02:45.220> his<00:02:45.610> double<00:02:46.000> Broadway<00:02:46.360> stuff<00:02:46.720> when

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
improving his double Broadway stuff when

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.930 
improving his double Broadway stuff when
he<00:02:47.020> has<00:02:47.200> things<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.560> East<00:02:48.040> Jack<00:02:48.340> King<00:02:48.700> Queen

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
he has things like East Jack King Queen

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.890 
he has things like East Jack King Queen
blah<00:02:49.240> blah<00:02:49.390> blah

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
blah blah blah

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.750 
blah blah blah
now<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> good<00:02:50.709> thing<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.040> if<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.459> pinpoint

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
now the good thing is if we can pinpoint

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.610 
now the good thing is if we can pinpoint
his<00:02:52.150> check-raise<00:02:52.540> range<00:02:52.840> very<00:02:53.080> heavily<00:02:53.440> on

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
his check-raise range very heavily on

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.410 
his check-raise range very heavily on
double<00:02:53.890> Broadway<00:02:54.250> combos<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:54.940> obviously<00:02:55.090> know

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
double Broadway combos we obviously know

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.860 
double Broadway combos we obviously know
what<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.870> hate<00:02:56.560> me<00:02:57.040> Broadway<00:02:57.880> cards<00:02:58.209> but<00:02:58.810> we

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
what to hate me Broadway cards but we

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.850 
what to hate me Broadway cards but we
still<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.320> acknowledge<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.709> they're

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
still have to acknowledge that they're

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.410 
still have to acknowledge that they're
gonna<00:02:59.980> come<00:03:00.190> off<00:03:00.340> sometimes<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:01.180> there's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
gonna come off sometimes and there's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.150 
gonna come off sometimes and there's
gonna<00:03:01.540> be<00:03:01.600> times<00:03:01.990> and<00:03:02.230> say<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.470> turn<00:03:02.680> card<00:03:02.920> is

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
gonna be times and say the turn card is

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.890 
gonna be times and say the turn card is
a<00:03:03.190> jack<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.940> he<00:03:04.060> has<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.330> his<00:03:04.420> queen<00:03:04.690> and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
a jack and he has a his queen and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.330 
a jack and he has a his queen and
applies<00:03:05.110> pressure<00:03:05.350> or<00:03:05.680> king.queen<00:03:06.040> and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
applies pressure or king.queen and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.940 
applies pressure or king.queen and
applies<00:03:06.520> pressure<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.870> understand<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.770> well

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
applies pressure so understand that well

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.280 
applies pressure so understand that well
we<00:03:09.580> don't<00:03:09.790> necessarily<00:03:10.030> love<00:03:10.480> Broadway<00:03:10.780> cards

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
we don't necessarily love Broadway cards

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.230 
we don't necessarily love Broadway cards
in<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> turn<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:12.340> he<00:03:12.730> could<00:03:12.970> still<00:03:13.209> be

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
in the turn that he could still be

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.210 
in the turn that he could still be
bluffing<00:03:13.660> them<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.230> we're<00:03:14.650> not<00:03:14.770> always

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
bluffing them and we're not always

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.570 
bluffing them and we're not always
necessarily<00:03:15.790> 100%<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.570> time<00:03:16.750> behind<00:03:17.580> and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
necessarily 100% of the time behind and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.860 
necessarily 100% of the time behind and
that's<00:03:18.640> actually<00:03:18.880> exactly<00:03:19.120> what<00:03:19.330> happens<00:03:19.720> if

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
that's actually exactly what happens if

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.290 
that's actually exactly what happens if
s<00:03:20.050> facing<00:03:20.470> ace<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.700> turn

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
they think too much about the current

they think too much about the current
street<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.209> not<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:10.570> much<00:04:10.720> about<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.170> future

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320

a really expensive and the boards can

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.979 
a really expensive and the boards can
start<00:04:14.860> changing<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.970> things<00:04:16.330> can<00:04:16.479> get<00:04:16.660> really

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
start changing and things can get really

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.140
