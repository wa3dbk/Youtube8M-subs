00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 well you have star wars levels on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 seen on the disney channel on friday 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.080
 for me now are the friday 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.080
 otherwise I'm always with me 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.940
 the last weeks super talent through 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.540
 looked like her extraordinary 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.180
 skills presented 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.250
 but now it's finally star wars and that 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.500
 is at least until 14 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.140
 and yes I'll see if I'm ten 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.489
 facts videos about the main characters 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.570
 will do 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.520
 but I think so and if over 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.440
 she becomes more known in the he but 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 Now it's time for a big one 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 auftakeln wants to park yard 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.130
 so is a complete name possessed one 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.480
 woman named dallas attacks with him 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.480
 got a son 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.810
 caro strong they were probably hunt and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.810
 your home was the industry planet you 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.630
 as a great power and architect of death 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.049
 Sterns was one of the most powerful 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.210
 men in the empire often worked with 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.670
 darth vader and also videos on the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 Command bridge together and even the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.729
 was great reader of death sterns 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.490
 sometimes also called day in readers 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.000
 get the election day in a captain and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.909
 the champion fmp assumes that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.100
 both the nexus known could 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.520
 you some officers from the citadel 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.520
 with obi wan anakin and suk free 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.540
 By the accuser day in lost it 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.549
 even almost the judicial process as they 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.979
 allegedly climbing tower and with the power 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.750
 has worked but came at the last moment 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.240
 The end came with the true traitor 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.990
 Berezovsky in the courtroom and the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.990
 leaf turned 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.440
 his head was noticeably better 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.989
 a very distinctive look 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.239
 through the high cheekbones looked 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.489
 like a walking skull because 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:28.520
 also a relatively large and very thin one 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:30.530
 Human was dry was a very 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.810
 power hungry man and saw that 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.040
 people as intelligent high 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.470
 superior beings 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.819
 that also led, for example, to that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.860
 it almost powers 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.959
 I have every picture out of it 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:49.819
 ravels that was the first episode 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:52.940
 since the wukies were almost force the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.280
 basic idea was for the death star 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.709
 but he was afraid of himself 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.720
 his creation and therefore contradicted 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.060
 your days are not as you for the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.060
 ideas creator this space station issue 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.819
 he already guessed that it was in the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.220
 trader for the supposedly deceased 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.840
 Anakin Skywalker held in his he was 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.840
 but the thing absolutely not sure 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.709
 Saying would have made two contacts to us 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.100
 very well-known characters because wolf 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.940
 julia was in an agent of the tag directly into 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.920
 was subordinate 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.480
 and Captain Akbar was up to his 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.480
 escape that becomes hawkins 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.000
 The actor's day in Peter Cushing 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.090
 could not find boots for him because 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 he wore a bigger size so he squeezes himself 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.720
 in smaller boots and in scenes where you 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.030
 his legs she wears slippers like that 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.340
 I, the now time the car away because 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.240
 In any case, I can still do the intro 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.430
 insist 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.220
 but the car and certainly annoying 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.300
 a bit and it is not necessary 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.580
 he only stands in that it is her 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.680
 Subscribe and place should be well if 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.570
 you want to subscribe then you want and 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.640
 I will not show you that now 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.640
 and so see you next time
