00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.050
 the count as uneasy to 543 are 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.230
 welcome to the analysis of the preview of 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.740
 charlotte previous episode 8 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.980
 let's see it I already have some things to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.980
 nothing 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.800
 no no no 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 farewell 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.030
 because I am an older person of dance 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.840
 being the first room we are going to 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.520
 concentrate here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.410
 to see how this pencil this person and you 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.070
 I say this game I had prepared it 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.150
 others this person is not the same as in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:59.150
 episode 2 appears to us here that is the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:02.270
 singer of 7 whoever 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.280
 the room as the call would be in Japanese 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.880
 this person leaves later not what 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.880
 confirm 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.400
 here not here says translating it a bit 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.810
 that is not a rock singer is a 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.810
 post rock singer 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.219
 and here it says the same 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.720
 I left the shows his skills 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.970
 I say that he is a person of legal age 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.540
 because he is living 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.790
 you see a bullet and do not usually put 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.240
 frothy drinks 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:57.040
 nor does anyone have this reaction if 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.040
 will show only this part 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.590
 where is my function 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.010
 when he raises his head there he will show 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.260
 in this part of here 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:15.940
 I would say that it is only me of gray angel if 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.720
 it's just going to show all this 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.610
 here that go to applications up 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.250
 show this part I would tell them that I 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.900
 only by the tone of the hair and the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.410
 smile look here I leave the foam on 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.630
 moustache 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.050
 the blackboard remembers what is called no 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.290
 I understand what they say 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.290
 I do not know I do not know anything about cannes 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.780
 and I'm surprised this I think this is a 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.880
 bridge 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.630
 obviously it 's a bridge and here we have 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.630
 a person 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.700
 the same singer wielding a guitar 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.610
 if I go to the task of elvis I would tell them that 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.110
 these people and the second singer of 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.110
 monster tears 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.860
 this in case my story was 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.330
 true but I have of them theories not 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.330
 I'm just faithful to one 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.549
 and I do not see a scene where it appears and 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.549
 uses 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.730
 but well that would be all for the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:35.920
 analysis I know it's something short but good 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.920
 143 and see you next video chao
