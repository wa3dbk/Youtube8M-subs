00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
but then you know there's like an

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
but then you know there's like an
unexpected<00:01:15.030> twist<00:01:15.509> where<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.500> gets

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
unexpected twist where just gets

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
unexpected twist where just gets
hectic<00:01:16.979> right<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> bad<00:01:18.270> luck

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
hectic right it's just that bad luck

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.130 
hectic right it's just that bad luck
more<00:01:19.350> bad<00:01:19.710> luck<00:01:20.040> than<00:01:20.070> most<00:01:20.640> bands<00:01:21.030> should<00:01:21.750> at

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
more bad luck than most bands should at

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.429 
more bad luck than most bands should at
their<00:01:22.590> level<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> competence<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> talent<00:01:24.479> all

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
their level of competence and talent all

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.289 
their level of competence and talent all
sudden<00:01:25.950> there's<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> big<00:01:26.520> boulder<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
sudden there's like a big boulder and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.819 
sudden there's like a big boulder and
how<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> deal<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.710> either

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
how do you deal with that we either

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.240 
how do you deal with that we either
crash<00:01:29.189> into<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.869> we<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:31.020> around<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.220> know

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
crash into it we go around it you know

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.499 
crash into it we go around it you know
and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:32.880> took<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.270> path

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and I think that they took that path

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.110 
and I think that they took that path
where<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.869> went<00:01:34.020> around

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
where they went around

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.050 
where they went around
than<00:01:37.120> what<00:01:37.810> they<00:01:37.930> originally<00:01:38.020> set<00:01:38.530> out<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.800> do

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
than what they originally set out to do

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.050 
than what they originally set out to do
they<00:01:40.230> progressed<00:01:41.230> from<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:42.010> band<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.820> went

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
they progressed from a band and went

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.460 
they progressed from a band and went
around<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.270> country<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.720> 18<00:01:43.990> days<00:01:44.200> playing

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
around the country and 18 days playing

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.840 
around the country and 18 days playing
basements<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:45.970> band<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.540> can<00:01:47.580> overwhelm<00:01:48.580> a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
basements to a band that can overwhelm a

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.330 
basements to a band that can overwhelm a

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
were making money or not I think they'd

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.710

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
think if they can find the record in the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.130 
think if they can find the record in the
records<00:02:26.740> for<00:02:26.920> five<00:02:27.640> million<00:02:27.910> they're<00:02:28.870> great

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
records for five million they're great

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.870 
records for five million they're great
they're<00:02:29.350> putting<00:02:30.070> all<00:02:30.340> they<00:02:30.490> have<00:02:30.610> like<00:02:30.760> an
