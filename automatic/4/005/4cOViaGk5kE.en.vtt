00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.489
 a tight month deadline 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.979

 For example, so big a speaker that you do not have the mail 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 the people get past and and an ass sluggish 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.960

 The connection is never demolished today in Vienna 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.500

 broken a few weeks ago 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.129
 sad but i hope team 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.419
 the system is 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.419
 a bit more careful if that looks a bit disappointed 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.709
