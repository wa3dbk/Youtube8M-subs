00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 have you ever heard of severe use of a 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.580
 vehicle 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.220
 maybe your car falls into this 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.510
 situation and you do not even know it and if you really 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.519
 this is your case 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.410
 you may be at serious risk of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.410
 life and throwing money away 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.830
 many drivers believe that using 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.260
 little vehicle or only in the city 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.760
 the pas lasts more actually the reasoning 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.460
 it's not the car it was not made for 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.280
 to be forgotten in the garage and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.680
 just take a few turns 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.260
 just five minutes daily walk 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.720
 it's like you're sedentary when 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.820
 Contrary to what many people think use 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.010
 of the vehicle is one in which the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.989
 engine is not used as it should 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.870
 independent of the car's mileage 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.660
 try various situations 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.329
 the first of them short stretch who runs 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.340
 at most 10 kilometers per day 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.630
 the person who gets the car to work 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.940
 in the morning 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.300
 walk 45 kilometers in traffic jam 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.280
 to a workplace pick up the car 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.050
 Late in the afternoon and back home. 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.540
 frequent short distance 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.450
 do not allow the oil to reach the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.890
 ideal operating temperature 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.920
 compromising engine lubrication and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.990
 of other parts which accelerates wear and tear 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.860
 components but before you can 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.049
 to prevent 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.440
 just replace the engine oil and 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.210
 of the oil filter together with 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.799
 advance in the owner's manual at 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.170
 indication of deadlines 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.479
 the recommendation is to shorten the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.100
 next oil change in half 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.810
 substitution of these two 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.060
 components that should normally be 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.580
 made of 10 thousand and 10 thousand kilometers or 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.530
 one year, whichever occurs first, 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.600
 six in six months or five thousand 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.119
 kilometers also what happens 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.729
 first one still has doubts if it makes use 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.640
 car or do not understand what 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.979
 tell the manual go to the dealership or 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.500
 mechanic you trust and inform the 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.479
 your routine with the vehicle to know if you 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.909
 fits this profile 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.160
 another situation of severe use is when the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.799
 car faces daily that walks and 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.480
 stops during traffic jams and 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.579
 path always asks idle 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.070
 requiring more of the engine 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.750
 in this case the opposite happens the motor 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.329
 works at high temperature which 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.620
 also in the medium term compromises the 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.230
 useful oil 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.599
 driver attention passing the whole saint 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.980
 day by paths where constant dust 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.290
 earth and ore 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.099
 are other factors that characterize use 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.590
 severe 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.569
 in addition to the oil and the oil filter. 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.760
 the air filter to avoid 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.650
 any unwanted surprises 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.690
 replace it in the same space 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.090
 time we already speak every six months 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.500
 or five thousand kilometers whatever 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.870
 reached the first 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.989
 only the best is to examine it all 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.920
 week saw if it is dirty replace with 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.379
 a new 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.700
 Severe use is not synonymous with 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.980
 problem for anyone 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.620
 it's only up to you to organize and follow all 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.629
 these guidelines that are in the manual 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.549
 exchanges will be more frequent 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.650
 so with the guarantee of a car 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.650
 healthy and long-lasting
