and my sister sitting in the corner and

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.330 
and my sister sitting in the corner and
it's<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.529> packing<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.310> getting

some final shopping and I just thought

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.480 
some final shopping and I just thought
that<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.720> would<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.900> good<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.560> show<00:00:23.430> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that it would be good to show you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.519 
that it would be good to show you
because<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.539> don't<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.080> when<00:00:25.230> I'm<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
because I don't know when I'm going to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.870 
because I don't know when I'm going to
have<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> chance<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.250> video<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.730> I'll<00:00:26.849> just

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
have a chance to do video so I'll just

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580 
have a chance to do video so I'll just
do<00:00:27.180> random<00:00:27.449> videos<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.289> there<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.560> I

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
