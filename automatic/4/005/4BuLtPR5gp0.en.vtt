00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
hairdressing is amazing but it's a small

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.890 
hairdressing is amazing but it's a small
bubble<00:01:18.650> in<00:01:19.650> comparison<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.550> our<00:01:20.850> world<00:01:21.180> but

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
bubble in comparison to our world but

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.410 
bubble in comparison to our world but
