00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.790
 in our block I was asked how the game performance of the LG 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.949
 p500 Optimus has been 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.559
 that is legitimate question because current smartphones are much more 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.349
 as a pure business fair Miss or work animals 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.439
 but meanwhile there are percent amusement center in Bamberg 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.689
 Market 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.929
 I'll say almost endless games are clear but finally it's on 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.890
 really large selection available 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.560
 I have limited myself to five times for this video 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.320
 I have Albatros Doodle Total Revenue Team 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.200
 Engelbert Spohn Greetings Hammer several players from different categories 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.750
 with different 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.820
 graphic claim 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.490
 and I just want to show it for a moment 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.629
 how the pop Timos have been 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.170
 strikes with it 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.570
 Let's start with the gamepad Pathos 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.840
 The gameplay is incredibly simple you have to paper balls 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.540
 throw it with a trash can 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.560
 so 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.940
 and how to confirm that the laughs 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.200
 that makes him a bit windy and here this case shows where the wind is going 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.250
 now go 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.760
 the good news 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.650
 dpa almost completely affected 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.760
 Problems speak a bit 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.920
 to be right and left 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.020
 depending on how the wind blows 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.940
 and I told him out of the deny that does not mean it's not 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 but fun even bigger, but relatively 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.010
 most sophisticated quotes you have to do this a bit 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.150
 concentrate to meet in one 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.400
 also the tourists to Paper Toss 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.520
 the next game sap shares 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.560
 the same game principle as at 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.570
 Doodle Jump 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.990
 Man bring this as high as possible 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.920
 only that my life has a cow 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.230
 and the graphics are a bit different 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.850
 So basically it's really built up 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 Ullinger 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.930
 the same 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.650
 here too 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.600
 completely unnecessary 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080
 this could be a problem 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.030
 and next is Angry Birds 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.030
 this is the most important game of 2010 for me 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.670
 because that just makes a lot of fun for Android that it too 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.670
 still free is displayed at the beginning of the year advertising 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:20.779
 So do it 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.519
 Press day at the beginning of each year to get ads but gets it 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.519
 you really great level and incredible fun 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.229
 which really lasts several hours 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.779
 The goal is to stop with the space the manner 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:39.969
 to break this swine just because the pigs are their pigs king 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.659
 the Bavarian is loud has the offspring 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:49.459
 to the performance at the beginning, everything was somehow easy 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.879
 To see bucking 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.379
 In front of the Savannah the Foul player fights for himself and gives none 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.859
 More problems 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.859
 Dressler not economical 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.529
 and 9 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.659
 the judge did not make it 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.819
 no problems with the performance 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.819
 so fluid the arts work so well 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.389
 to see the artist himself if again 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.249
 a swamp to the phone 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.439
 to save pigs what more showed the last game is different ratings 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.189
 3d when play 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.900
 I would like to say I am incredibly bad at playing such games 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.099
 when it comes to 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.549
 against m 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.150
 To use motion sensor to steer should not say Mohamad 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.449
 Nevertheless, the ads kept 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.899
 Mary is in Seville 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.799
 even with a coma super 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.219
 also the helmsman stops by 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.219
 right and left move the Optimus 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.899
 Edition Wanderer will 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:54.079
 the Portuguese Petit wm winner the graphics are of course nothing special 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.459
 but percent 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.669
 the media entrepreneur had a smartphone 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.669
 And for that, the graphic artist is doing so deeply as never 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.029
 Fust clock / live at the Belsch 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.799
 No for many lighting effects shadow effects reflections 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.930
 So the phone has a little something to do 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.289
 but then 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.919
 I personally think that it is here 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.149
 In spite of all that relatively smoothly from going on you can play 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.340
 Pauli 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 answer 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.640
 By the way, I can not eat at the beginning of the number of games 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.099
 do not want to show five but sexy through skin 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.099
 Because I've hurt HoeneÃŸ on the game accordingly 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.990
 Steinmarder both teams then a final also a 3d game 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.180
 here in the case 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.110
 you sit in the plane 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.620
 Also controls this aircraft by moving Plus 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.779
 Optimus One 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:57.870
 and I have to 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.020
 complete enemy plane so bay of Rio itself be completed 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.949
 Why 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.249
 specifically demand 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.120
 and there the opponents have done 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.900
 yes, also here as you can see 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.629
 suggests the Optimus One 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:20.839
 very well 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.779
 no stuttering 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.400
 no dropouts 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.400
 smooth gameplay 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.169
 if I continue to gamble 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.960
 and you could have Jahn and overview over it 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.749
 how good the Optimus has become 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:39.499
 while playing
