00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.020 

and<00:04:30.270> that's<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.920> I'll<00:04:31.920> play<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.520> little<00:04:32.820> bit

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
and that's that I'll play a little bit

Christmas of 09 haven't really been able

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.950 
Christmas of 09 haven't really been able
to<00:06:19.050> play<00:06:19.260> it<00:06:19.410> at<00:06:19.530> all<00:06:19.910> due<00:06:20.910> to<00:06:20.940> me<00:06:21.540> being<00:06:21.570> it<00:06:21.870> at

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
to play it at all due to me being it at

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.620 
to play it at all due to me being it at
school<00:06:22.200> so<00:06:22.500> I<00:06:23.040> can<00:06:23.730> only<00:06:23.940> play<00:06:24.120> it<00:06:24.240> on<00:06:24.330> breaks

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
school so I can only play it on breaks

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.470 
school so I can only play it on breaks
and<00:06:25.160> that's<00:06:26.160> why<00:06:26.280> I'm<00:06:26.340> not<00:06:26.490> good<00:06:26.730> at<00:06:26.760> all<00:06:27.000> so

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
and that's why I'm not good at all so

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.970 
and that's why I'm not good at all so
very<00:06:27.950> much<00:06:28.950> just<00:06:29.280> started<00:06:30.380> that's<00:06:31.380> that<00:06:31.650> and

very much just started that's that and

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.250 
very much just started that's that and
that's<00:06:32.760> my<00:06:32.820> kid<00:06:33.030> hope<00:06:33.270> you<00:06:33.390> like<00:06:33.540> it<00:06:34.250> thanks
