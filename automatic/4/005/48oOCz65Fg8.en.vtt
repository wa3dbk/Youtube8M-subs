and get this on his hand there we go
that<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.830> big<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:24.470> had<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.650> pretty<00:02:25.980> darn<00:02:26.280> big

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
that is big I had it's pretty darn big

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.320 
that is big I had it's pretty darn big
I<00:02:27.200> mean<00:02:28.220> well<00:02:31.700> pointed<00:02:32.700> out<00:02:32.790> he<00:02:32.910> liked<00:02:33.030> using<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
I mean well pointed out he liked using a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.090 
I mean well pointed out he liked using a
shooter<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.400> see<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.750> shouldn't

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
shooter that you you can see I shouldn't

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.290 
shooter that you you can see I shouldn't
thought<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:38.520> taking<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.910> arm<00:02:39.060> down<00:02:39.270> a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
thought so I'm taking the arm down a

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.480 
thought so I'm taking the arm down a
little<00:02:39.540> bit<00:02:39.720> since<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:40.890> big<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:41.280> yeah

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
little bit since it's so big but yeah

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.570 
little bit since it's so big but yeah
that<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> big<00:02:42.330> weapon<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.370> quite<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
that is a big weapon this is quite the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.970 
that is a big weapon this is quite the
cannon<00:02:45.000> actually<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.960> look<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.380> see<00:02:46.470> bring

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
cannon actually I look can you see bring

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.860 
cannon actually I look can you see bring
this<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:48.330> oh<00:02:48.980> they<00:02:49.980> went<00:02:50.100> down<00:02:50.310> before<00:02:50.490> oh

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
this up and oh they went down before oh

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.300 
this up and oh they went down before oh
it's<00:02:51.870> better<00:02:52.080> than<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.380> doesn't<00:02:52.620> let<00:02:53.010> me<00:02:53.040> take

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's better than it doesn't let me take

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.950 
it's better than it doesn't let me take
it<00:02:53.430> off<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.330> would<00:02:54.450> probably<00:02:54.660> look

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
it off of there this would probably look

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960 
it off of there this would probably look
way<00:02:55.170> better<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.710> figured<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.520> size<00:02:56.790> of

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
way better and I figured the size of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.200 
way better and I figured the size of
like<00:02:57.120> devastated<00:02:58.020> for<00:02:58.470> example<00:02:58.970> even<00:02:59.970> though

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
like devastated for example even though

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.580 
like devastated for example even though
he<00:03:00.390> doesn't<00:03:00.630> really<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.990> anywhere<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.410> put

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
he doesn't really have anywhere to put

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.280 
he doesn't really have anywhere to put
it<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:04.290> sake<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.890> let<00:03:05.280> me<00:03:05.340> see

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
it for the sake of that let me see

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.900 
it for the sake of that let me see
God<00:03:07.320> Devastator<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.950> haven't<00:03:08.310> taken<00:03:08.580> him<00:03:08.790> out

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
God Devastator I haven't taken him out

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.460 
God Devastator I haven't taken him out
of<00:03:09.030> his<00:03:09.090> little<00:03:09.270> polls<00:03:09.570> from<00:03:09.690> before<00:03:10.080> because

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
of his little polls from before because

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:21.970 
of his little polls from before because
well<00:03:20.450> there<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:21.600> go

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
well there we go

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.110 
well there we go
so<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.040> see<00:03:23.250> there's<00:03:23.430> not<00:03:23.550> really<00:03:23.790> anywhere

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
so you see there's not really anywhere

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.699 
so you see there's not really anywhere
for<00:03:24.270> me<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.420> put<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.810> unless<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.320> for<00:03:25.560> example

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
for me to put it unless I for example

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.140 
for me to put it unless I for example
take<00:03:26.130> something<00:03:26.370> off<00:03:26.489> like<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.820> could<00:03:26.940> stick

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
take something off like I could stick

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.120 
take something off like I could stick
this<00:03:27.269> up<00:03:27.450> here<00:03:27.750> actually<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.980> would<00:03:29.100> be

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
this up here actually that would be

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.750 
this up here actually that would be
pretty<00:03:29.400> cool

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
pretty cool

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.850 
pretty cool
let<00:03:30.180> stick<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.630> up<00:03:30.840> there<00:03:31.050> devastators<00:03:31.680> all

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
let stick that up there devastators all

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.040 
let stick that up there devastators all
of<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> sudden<00:03:32.340> even<00:03:33.150> more<00:03:33.450> destructive<00:03:36.050> but

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
of a sudden even more destructive but

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.160 
of a sudden even more destructive but
yeah<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.620> mean<00:03:38.870> it's<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.959> big<00:03:41.120> big<00:03:42.120> big<00:03:42.480> big<00:03:42.780> piece

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170

I like it yeah that's a nice little way

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.110 
I like it yeah that's a nice little way
to<00:03:54.630> tie<00:03:54.959> all<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.560> sets<00:03:55.830> together<00:03:56.120> from

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
to tie all of the sets together from

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.600 
to tie all of the sets together from
this<00:03:57.300> series<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.650> I'm<00:03:58.890> definitely<00:03:59.070> gonna<00:03:59.340> have

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
this series so I'm definitely gonna have

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.540 
this series so I'm definitely gonna have
this<00:03:59.820> posed<00:04:00.330> on<00:04:00.660> somebody<00:04:01.230> not<00:04:01.860> exactly<00:04:02.280> sure

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
this posed on somebody not exactly sure

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.090 
this posed on somebody not exactly sure
who<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.840> know<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.080> seems<00:04:04.290> like<00:04:04.380> Optimus<00:04:04.800> and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
who you know it seems like Optimus and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.130 
who you know it seems like Optimus and
would<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.910> pretty<00:04:06.120> much<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.420> prime<00:04:06.630> candidate

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
would be pretty much the prime candidate

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.680 
would be pretty much the prime candidate
since<00:04:07.380> he<00:04:07.500> does<00:04:07.740> have<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.160> fists<00:04:08.640> with<00:04:08.910> little

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
since he does have the fists with little

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.120 
since he does have the fists with little
dogs<00:04:10.810> on<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.050> or<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.590> stick<00:04:11.860> them<00:04:11.980> on<00:04:12.100> here

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
dogs on it or you can stick them on here

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.520 
dogs on it or you can stick them on here
cuz<00:04:12.720> Megatron<00:04:13.720> doesn't<00:04:13.990> really<00:04:14.110> have<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.320> way

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
cuz Megatron doesn't really have a way

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.830 
cuz Megatron doesn't really have a way
of<00:04:14.650> actually<00:04:14.800> holding<00:04:15.130> it<00:04:15.540> unless<00:04:16.540> you<00:04:16.750> were

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
of actually holding it unless you were

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.740 
of actually holding it unless you were
to<00:04:16.930> stick<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.320> on<00:04:17.410> his<00:04:17.560> arm<00:04:17.590> somewhere<00:04:18.420> and<00:04:19.420> so

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
to stick it on his arm somewhere and so

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.530 
to stick it on his arm somewhere and so
you<00:04:20.500> know<00:04:20.620> similar<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.280> how<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:22.060> could<00:04:22.270> stick

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
you know similar to how you could stick

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.810 
you know similar to how you could stick
it<00:04:22.660> onto<00:04:23.310> devastators<00:04:24.310> aren't<00:04:24.520> but<00:04:24.610> yeah<00:04:24.700> this

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
it onto devastators aren't but yeah this

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.460 
it onto devastators aren't but yeah this
is<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:25.030> nice<00:04:25.240> way<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:25.510> really<00:04:25.780> tie<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.200> whole

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
is a nice way to really tie the whole

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.970 
is a nice way to really tie the whole
sake<00:04:26.770> series<00:04:27.280> together<00:04:28.200> I'm<00:04:29.200> really<00:04:29.500> pretty

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
sake series together I'm really pretty

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.680 
sake series together I'm really pretty
cool<00:04:30.190> way<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.370> get<00:04:30.700> you<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.880> buy<00:04:31.150> all<00:04:31.420> of<00:04:31.570> the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
know I wanted all the steps to begin

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.000 
know I wanted all the steps to begin
with<00:04:47.950> so<00:04:48.730> that<00:04:48.760> was<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:50.020> was<00:04:50.200> more<00:04:50.410> of<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.740> a

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
with so that was this was more of a a

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.140 
with so that was this was more of a a
byproduct<00:04:51.790> of<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.270> for<00:04:53.080> me<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:54.490> if<00:04:54.910> you're

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
byproduct of that for me so if you're

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.850 
byproduct of that for me so if you're
looking<00:04:55.540> if<00:04:55.960> you're<00:04:56.140> thinking<00:04:56.470> oh<00:04:56.590> maybe

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
looking if you're thinking oh maybe

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.190 
looking if you're thinking oh maybe
maybe<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.670> should<00:04:57.910> get<00:04:58.060> this<00:04:58.270> maybe<00:04:58.810> actually

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
maybe I should get this maybe actually

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.070 
maybe I should get this maybe actually
get<00:04:59.320> that<00:04:59.530> set<00:04:59.890> and<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:01.390> know<00:05:01.480> so<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.840> can

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
get that set and you know so that I can

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.420 
get that set and you know so that I can
finally<00:05:02.290> finish<00:05:02.560> this<00:05:02.860> we'll<00:05:03.100> just<00:05:03.130> take<00:05:03.400> a

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
finally finish this we'll just take a

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.340 
finally finish this we'll just take a
good<00:05:03.610> look<00:05:03.760> at<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.840> see<00:05:05.080> if<00:05:05.110> it's

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
good look at it and see if it's

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.860 
good look at it and see if it's
something<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.830> really<00:05:06.190> want<00:05:06.450> because<00:05:07.450> as<00:05:07.690> you

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
something you really want because as you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.110 
something you really want because as you
saw<00:05:08.080> it's<00:05:08.260> big<00:05:08.530> for<00:05:08.680> Optimus<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.940> would

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
saw it's big for Optimus it would

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.600 
saw it's big for Optimus it would
definitely<00:05:10.360> fit<00:05:10.870> in<00:05:11.110> one<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.860> series<00:05:12.370> 1

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
definitely fit in one of the series 1

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.880 
definitely fit in one of the series 1
sets<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.780> if<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:14.050> were<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.200> put<00:05:14.380> this<00:05:14.470> on<00:05:14.650> that

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
sets so if you were to put this on that

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.680 
sets so if you were to put this on that
series<00:05:15.160> 1<00:05:15.430> Optimus<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:16.030> would<00:05:16.180> definitely<00:05:16.540> fit

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
series 1 Optimus it would definitely fit

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.520 
series 1 Optimus it would definitely fit
in<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.960> cooler<00:05:17.230> on<00:05:17.350> him<00:05:17.560> same<00:05:18.460> with<00:05:18.610> Megatron

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
in the cooler on him same with Megatron

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.159 
in the cooler on him same with Megatron
so<00:05:20.530> it's<00:05:20.830> in<00:05:21.010> that<00:05:21.040> size<00:05:21.790> range<00:05:22.090> unless<00:05:22.900> you

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
so it's in that size range unless you

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.840 
so it's in that size range unless you
want<00:05:23.350> these<00:05:23.530> guys<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.800> just<00:05:24.100> have<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.280> massive
