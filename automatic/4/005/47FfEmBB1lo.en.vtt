00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the Gary's is that most of our unarmed

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.610 
the Gary's is that most of our unarmed
very<00:00:55.980> few<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:59.120> like<00:01:00.120> guns<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.809> if

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
very few of them have like guns and if

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.649 
very few of them have like guns and if
they<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.190> usually<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.899> pistol<00:01:08.600> okay<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
they do it's usually a pistol okay so

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
they do it's usually a pistol okay so
listen<00:01:09.840> nuka-cola<00:01:10.170> quantum<00:01:10.200> over<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
listen nuka-cola quantum over here in

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.510 
listen nuka-cola quantum over here in
the<00:01:11.490> corner<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:16.170> use<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> door<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the corner and use the door to the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.499 
the corner and use the door to the
cloning<00:01:17.939> labs<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> I'll<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.180> careful

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
cloning labs and I'll just be careful

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.359 
cloning labs and I'll just be careful
like<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.750> said<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.439> Gary's<00:01:22.799> themselves

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
like I said the the Gary's themselves

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.940 
like I said the the Gary's themselves
don't<00:01:23.549> pose<00:01:23.759> much<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.270> threat<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:25.770> try<00:01:25.920> not

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
don't pose much of a threat just try not

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.130 
don't pose much of a threat just try not
to<00:01:26.100> get<00:01:26.280> cornered<00:01:26.670> by<00:01:26.850> them<00:01:27.060> there's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> bunch

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to get cornered by them there's a bunch

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.740 
to get cornered by them there's a bunch
of<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:29.090> they<00:01:30.090> usually<00:01:30.390> give<00:01:30.509> away<00:01:30.630> their

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
of them they usually give away their

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.420 
of them they usually give away their
locations<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.439> saying<00:01:31.710> Gary<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.570> all<00:01:33.570> kinds<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
crazy shit that uh some clones named

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:51.950 
crazy shit that uh some clones named
Gary<00:01:37.619> would<00:01:37.920> say

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.270 

see<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.080> Gary<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:56.440> door<00:01:56.680> we're<00:01:56.830> looking<00:01:57.070> for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
see it Gary the door we're looking for

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
see it Gary the door we're looking for
is<00:01:57.550> here<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.090> right

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.809 

alright<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.950> bobblehead<00:02:31.550> is<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.730> this

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
alright so the bobblehead is in this

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.240 
alright so the bobblehead is in this
room<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.180> ended<00:02:32.390> up<00:02:32.420> getting<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:33.040> shot<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
room I ended up getting a shot in the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.960 
room I ended up getting a shot in the
back<00:02:34.520> by<00:02:34.880> one<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.720> other<00:02:35.840> Gary's<00:02:39.970> it's

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
back by one of the other Gary's it's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.270 
back by one of the other Gary's it's
right<00:02:41.390> there<00:02:41.450> on<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.170> table<00:02:44.920> all<00:02:45.920> right<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.250> I

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
right there on the table all right so I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.070 
right there on the table all right so I
enjoy<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.880> skill<00:02:47.120> booster<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.750> i'll<00:02:47.870> see<00:02:48.050> you

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
enjoy the skill booster and i'll see you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.680 
enjoy the skill booster and i'll see you
