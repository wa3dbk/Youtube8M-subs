people's<00:00:31.830> minds<00:00:32.489> about<00:00:32.669> art<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:33.960> really

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
people's minds about art and what really

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
people's minds about art and what really
intrigued<00:00:34.380> me<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:35.100> their<00:00:35.460> approach<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
intrigued me was their approach to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.760 
intrigued me was their approach to
putting<00:00:36.210> something<00:00:36.570> else<00:00:36.930> into<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> urban

putting something else into the urban

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.350 
putting something else into the urban
environment<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.850> caused<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:41.360> in

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
environment that really caused all in

environment that really caused all in
order<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> execute<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.379> one-of-a-kind

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
order to execute this one-of-a-kind

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
order to execute this one-of-a-kind
piece<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.579> actually<00:00:44.940> created<00:00:45.390> an<00:00:45.600> entirely

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
piece we actually created an entirely

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.100 
piece we actually created an entirely
different<00:00:46.320> type<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> software<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.870> in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
different type of software to see it in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.350 
different type of software to see it in
context<00:00:49.950> against<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> different<00:00:50.910> buildings

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
context against the different buildings

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
context against the different buildings
she<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.110> also<00:00:52.320> able<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.070> how<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> going

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
she was also able to see how is it going

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540 
she was also able to see how is it going
to<00:00:53.879> behave<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> wind<00:00:54.629> how<00:00:55.500> does<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> move

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
to behave in the wind how does it move

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.869 
to behave in the wind how does it move
Janet's<00:00:57.180> work<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.109> motion<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.309> that

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
Janet's work is about the motion in that

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.840 
Janet's work is about the motion in that
structure<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.870> he<00:01:01.350> took<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.850> visualization

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
structure so he took that visualization

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.119 
structure so he took that visualization
capability<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> created<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> special<00:01:04.559> package

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
capability and created a special package

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
capability and created a special package
for<00:01:05.159> Janet<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.060> she<00:01:06.479> could<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.780> bring

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
for Janet so that she could really bring

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.580 
for Janet so that she could really bring
her<00:01:07.350> sculpture<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.130> new<00:01:08.520> height<00:01:09.290> we're<00:01:10.290> able

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
her sculpture to new height we're able

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.190 
her sculpture to new height we're able
to<00:01:11.010> create<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> tool<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.150> allows<00:01:12.390> them<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> do

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
to create a tool that allows them to do

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.050 
to create a tool that allows them to do
things<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> weren't<00:01:13.770> even<00:01:13.920> possible<00:01:14.640> before

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
things that weren't even possible before

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.570 
things that weren't even possible before
the<00:01:15.720> computer<00:01:16.290> models<00:01:16.650> help<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.100> imagine<00:01:17.549> what

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the computer models help me imagine what

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.429 
the computer models help me imagine what
its<00:01:17.850> gonna<00:01:17.970> feel<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.570> walk<00:01:18.960> underneath

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
its gonna feel like to walk underneath

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.190 
its gonna feel like to walk underneath
it<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.729> need<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> understand<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it because I just need to understand the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.460 
it because I just need to understand the
relative<00:01:22.890> scale<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.460> everything<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.299> love<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
relative scale of everything I love that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
relative scale of everything I love that
I<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.729> gravity<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I can see what gravity is going to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.460 
I can see what gravity is going to
really<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.909> love<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
really do and I love that I can see it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.760 
really do and I love that I can see it
move<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.460> wind<00:01:32.820> without<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.049> software<00:01:34.560> I

move with wind without this software I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
move with wind without this software I
could<00:01:35.040> never<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.549> built<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.000> sculpture

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
