00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.620
 if you were to think that you could 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.930
 do in 360 hours every minute that you 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.050
 take decide your answer would be 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.100
 extremely valuable if the goal is to erect 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.100
 a luxury hotel 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.670
 This was precisely what happened with 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.940
 a Chinese construction company at the beginning of 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.060
 2011 that he managed to lift in just 360 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 hours the equivalent of 15 days or more nor 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.930
 less than a 30-story hotel 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.020
 yes 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020
 and 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.770
 this hotel was built next to 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.110
 known dongting lake located in the 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.100
 Yunnan province one of the lakes more 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 great china 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.790
 and a construction that besides breaking 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.979
 records was outlined as an advance 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.590
 environmental this by employment in your 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.580
 Most biodegradable materials 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.310
 besides that among its elements 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.350
 avant-garde can highlight their system 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.360
 of air purification which 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.310
 provides an air inside 20 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.310
 times cleaner than outside air 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.210
 although the building was built in a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.980
 short time span doubts about your 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.260
 stability move away immediately 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.660
 since it is five times more resistant 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.660
 to earthquakes that buildings 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.660
 conventional 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.920
 in the description of this video them 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.450
 I'll leave a link in the can see in 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.460
 fast camera the building process 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.460
 from the first to the last day 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.850
 this is the world of good capsule head 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.850
 day
