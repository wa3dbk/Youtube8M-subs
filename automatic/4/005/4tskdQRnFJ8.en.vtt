00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.240 

the<00:00:14.910> walkers<00:00:15.450> were<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> lot<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.530> fun<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.920> work<00:00:17.040> on

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the walkers were a lot of fun to work on

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.280 
the walkers were a lot of fun to work on
because<00:00:17.460> they<00:00:17.760> were<00:00:17.820> big<00:00:18.150> mechanical<00:00:18.540> beasts

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
because they were big mechanical beasts

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.710 
because they were big mechanical beasts
and<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:20.190> was<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> pleasure<00:00:20.640> sometimes<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.510> work

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and it was a pleasure sometimes to work

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.050 
and it was a pleasure sometimes to work
on<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.290> big<00:00:22.500> machinery<00:00:22.920> rather<00:00:23.670> than<00:00:23.850> just

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
on just big machinery rather than just

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.480 
on just big machinery rather than just
voices<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.500> knew<00:00:25.620> the<00:00:25.740> walkers<00:00:26.070> were<00:00:26.220> big

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
voices and we knew the walkers were big

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.560 
voices and we knew the walkers were big
and<00:00:26.520> they<00:00:26.790> were<00:00:26.880> heavy<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.330> they<00:00:27.450> were

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and they were heavy and they were

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.600 
and they were heavy and they were
lumbering<00:00:28.080> about<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:29.400> they<00:00:29.550> were

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
lumbering about and because they were

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.250 
lumbering about and because they were
animated<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.300> had<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.450> certain<00:00:30.780> rhythmic

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
animated they had a certain rhythmic

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.700 
animated they had a certain rhythmic
walk<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.980> them<00:00:32.129> and<00:00:32.339> so<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.839> objective<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.679> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
walk to them and so the objective was to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
walk to them and so the objective was to
come<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> sound<00:00:35.999> for<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> walkers<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
come up with a sound for the walkers to

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.529 
come up with a sound for the walkers to
give<00:00:37.679> them<00:00:37.859> a<00:00:37.980> real<00:00:38.339> sense<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.789> mass<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
give them a real sense of mass and

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.110 
give them a real sense of mass and
weight<00:00:39.649> after<00:00:40.649> all<00:00:40.949> there<00:00:41.159> were<00:00:41.249> many<00:00:41.999> were

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
weight after all there were many were

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.790 
weight after all there were many were
being<00:00:42.329> animated<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> things

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
being animated and one of the things

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.319 
being animated and one of the things
about<00:00:44.149> one<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> drawbacks<00:00:45.839> of<00:00:46.140> animation

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
about one of the drawbacks of animation

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.840 
about one of the drawbacks of animation
is<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.289> hard<00:00:49.589> to<00:00:49.710> produce<00:00:49.859> a<00:00:50.219> sense<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
is that it's hard to produce a sense of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.669 
is that it's hard to produce a sense of
mass<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.539> an<00:00:51.659> object<00:00:52.109> you<00:00:52.260> know<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> want

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:52.679 
mass in an object you know if you want

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:53.660 
mass in an object you know if you want
something<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.010> seemed<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> many

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
something that seemed like it's many

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.259 
something that seemed like it's many
tons<00:00:53.999> or<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.899> size<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.319> a<00:00:55.409> building<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
tons or the size of a building it's it

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.450 
tons or the size of a building it's it
takes<00:00:57.659> particularly<00:00:58.559> good<00:00:58.739> animation<00:00:59.370> in

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
takes particularly good animation in

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.790 
takes particularly good animation in
order<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> create<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.210> sense<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.719> weight<00:01:01.499> but

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
order to create that sense of weight but

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.310 
order to create that sense of weight but
we<00:01:02.729> can<00:01:02.879> help<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.269> along<00:01:03.300> great<00:01:03.809> deal<00:01:04.049> with

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
we can help that along great deal with

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.340 
we can help that along great deal with
the<00:01:04.619> proper<00:01:04.979> sound<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> walker<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:07.110> made

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the proper sound so the walker was made

when we brought the recordings

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.830 
when we brought the recordings
I<00:01:46.610> picked<00:01:47.610> parts<00:01:47.940> of<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> recordings<00:01:48.660> that<00:01:48.750> I

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
I picked parts of the recordings that I

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
I picked parts of the recordings that I
liked<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.260> made<00:01:49.500> them<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.190> rhythmic

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
liked and made them into the rhythmic

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
liked and made them into the rhythmic
walk<00:01:51.090> cycle<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.980> addition<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.550> just<00:01:53.730> the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.700 
metal shearing machine clanging wrong I
needed<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:56.940> some<00:01:57.630> big<00:01:57.870> metallic<00:01:58.380> squeaking

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
needed them some big metallic squeaking

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.080 
needed them some big metallic squeaking
sounds<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.880> knee<00:02:00.060> joint

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
sounds kind of like the knee joint

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.210 
sounds kind of like the knee joint
squeaking<00:02:00.870> all<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> time<00:02:01.320> every<00:02:01.800> time<00:02:02.070> it

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
squeaking all the time every time it

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.340 
squeaking all the time every time it
lifts<00:02:02.520> its<00:02:02.640> leg<00:02:02.970> would<00:02:03.150> be<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.330> big<00:02:03.600> sort<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.200> a

lifts its leg would be a big sort of a
moaning<00:02:04.800> sound<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:05.940> achieved<00:02:06.450> by

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
moaning sound and that I achieved by

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.920 
moaning sound and that I achieved by
playing<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.310> dumpster<00:02:08.820> door<00:02:09.149> a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
playing with the dumpster door a

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.660 
playing with the dumpster door a
dumpster<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.890> dropped<00:02:11.340> off<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.490> my

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
dumpster that was dropped off at my

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.850 
dumpster that was dropped off at my
house<00:02:11.820> when<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:12.150> fill<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> street<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.740> be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
house when they fill in the street to be

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
house when they fill in the street to be
filled<00:02:14.070> with<00:02:14.160> trash<00:02:14.520> I'd<00:02:15.210> go<00:02:15.450> out<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.660> throw

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
filled with trash I'd go out and throw

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.510 
filled with trash I'd go out and throw
the<00:02:15.900> trash<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.590> I'd<00:02:16.680> opened<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.070> lid<00:02:17.280> I

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the trash in it and I'd opened the lid I

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.950 
the trash in it and I'd opened the lid I
mean<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.820> wonderful<00:02:18.300> sound<00:02:18.570> because<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
mean it's wonderful sound because it

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.050 
mean it's wonderful sound because it
hadn't<00:02:19.200> been<00:02:19.260> oiled<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.950> its<00:02:20.100> entire<00:02:20.400> life<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
hadn't been oiled in its entire life and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.320 
hadn't been oiled in its entire life and
so<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.530> dumpster<00:02:22.950> became<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> major<00:02:23.640> part<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
so that dumpster became a major part of

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.430 
so that dumpster became a major part of
the<00:02:25.170> Walker<00:02:25.920> as<00:02:26.190> well
