00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
a moped in Bermuda a one that's right

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
a moped in Bermuda a one that's right
there<00:01:02.160> beside<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.640> cruise<00:01:02.820> ship<00:01:03.030> port<00:01:03.269> is

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
there beside the cruise ship port is

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.230 
there beside the cruise ship port is
called<00:01:03.539> oleander<00:01:04.229> cycles<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.910> may<00:01:06.030> want

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
called oleander cycles so you may want

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.400 
called oleander cycles so you may want
to<00:01:06.270> check<00:01:06.450> them<00:01:06.660> out<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.050> think<00:01:07.229> there's

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
to check them out and I think there's

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.410 
to check them out and I think there's
some<00:01:07.530> others<00:01:07.800> as<00:01:07.950> well<00:01:08.070> elbow<00:01:08.520> beach<00:01:08.759> cycles

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
some others as well elbow beach cycles

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.859 
some others as well elbow beach cycles
and<00:01:10.759> just<00:01:11.759> do<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.910> google<00:01:12.330> search<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> you'll

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and just do a google search and you'll

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.440 
and just do a google search and you'll
find<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.229> lot<00:01:13.440> but<00:01:14.429> a<00:01:14.460> moped<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> best<00:01:15.270> way

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
find a lot but a moped is the best way

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
find a lot but a moped is the best way
to<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:15.720> around<00:01:16.039> because<00:01:17.039> if<00:01:17.340> you're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to get around because if you're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.880 
to get around because if you're
importing<00:01:17.820> Bermuda<00:01:18.539> more<00:01:19.470> than<00:01:19.649> likely

importing Bermuda more than likely

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.109

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
stay at the cruise ship port because

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.510 
stay at the cruise ship port because

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.840 
the way to really get out and see the
and<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.920> lot<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.160> people<00:03:54.340> think<00:03:54.490> it's<00:03:54.610> an<00:03:54.670> island

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
and a lot of people think it's an island

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.670 
and a lot of people think it's an island
but<00:03:55.300> actually<00:03:55.690> Bermuda<00:03:56.140> is<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.260> group<00:03:56.560> of

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
but actually Bermuda is a group of

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.950 
but actually Bermuda is a group of
islands<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:57.730> if<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.940> have<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.120> moped<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:58.780> can

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
islands so if you have a moped you can

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.760 
islands so if you have a moped you can
go<00:03:59.080> out<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.970> drive<00:04:00.970> around<00:04:01.440> all<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
go out and and drive around all the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.420 
go out and and drive around all the
various<00:04:03.310> parts<00:04:03.460> of<00:04:03.640> Bermuda<00:04:04.030> it's<00:04:04.150> very<00:04:04.360> safe

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
various parts of Bermuda it's very safe

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.770 
various parts of Bermuda it's very safe
obviously<00:04:06.430> there<00:04:06.610> is<00:04:06.640> traffic<00:04:07.330> so<00:04:07.540> if<00:04:07.660> you're

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
obviously there is traffic so if you're

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.470 
obviously there is traffic so if you're
not<00:04:07.900> comfortable<00:04:08.910> driving<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:10.000> moped<00:04:10.420> or
