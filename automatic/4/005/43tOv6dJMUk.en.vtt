scene<00:00:59.100> has<00:00:59.370> been<00:00:59.399> duplicated<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
scene has been duplicated to make the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.729 
scene has been duplicated to make the
whole<00:01:00.960> thing<00:01:01.230> look<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.770> believable<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:04.589> aim

whole thing look more believable the aim

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
whole thing look more believable the aim
here<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> make<00:01:05.549> something<00:01:05.760> striking<00:01:06.450> from

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
here was to make something striking from

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080 
here was to make something striking from
a<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.960> ordinary<00:01:07.320> image<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.400> first<00:01:08.640> job<00:01:08.909> was

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
a very ordinary image the first job was

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
a very ordinary image the first job was
to<00:01:09.240> add<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.570> detail<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.530> case<00:01:10.799> tattoos

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
to add some detail in this case tattoos

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
to add some detail in this case tattoos
the<00:01:12.180> next<00:01:12.510> step<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> remove<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> color

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the next step was to remove the color

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
the next step was to remove the color
and<00:01:13.950> invert<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.909> half<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> image<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.990> add

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and invert one half of the image to add

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
and invert one half of the image to add
even<00:01:16.229> more<00:01:16.350> impact<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.850> important<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> pay

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
even more impact it's important to pay
