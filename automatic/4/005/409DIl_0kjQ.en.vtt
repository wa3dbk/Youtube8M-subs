and you know how blown a glass is just

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.319 
and you know how blown a glass is just
kind<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.630> has<00:03:32.440> this<00:03:32.680> design<00:03:33.100> on<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.150> just

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
kind of has this design on it so just

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.759 
kind of has this design on it so just
looks<00:03:34.480> like<00:03:34.600> this<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.440> good<00:03:35.620> thing<00:03:35.739> about

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
looks like this and the good thing about

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.400 
looks like this and the good thing about
this<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.250> both<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.239> these<00:03:37.329> top<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.959> bottom

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
this is both of these top and bottom

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.229 
this is both of these top and bottom
balls<00:03:38.620> come<00:03:38.950> off<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:39.430> if<00:03:39.579> I<00:03:39.760> really<00:03:40.030> didn't

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
balls come off so if I really didn't

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.849 
balls come off so if I really didn't
want<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.420> change<00:03:40.720> out<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.079> bar<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:41.620> like

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
want to change out the bar to this like

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.740 
want to change out the bar to this like
say<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.489> didn't<00:03:42.700> want<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.880> change<00:03:43.090> out<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.450> bar

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
say I didn't want to change out this bar

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.000 
say I didn't want to change out this bar
because<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.170> was<00:03:44.260> still<00:03:44.410> kind<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.680> store<00:03:44.859> like

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
because it was still kind of store like

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.170 
because it was still kind of store like
see<00:03:45.160> it's<00:03:45.250> kind<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.459> red<00:03:45.609> right<00:03:45.760> now<00:03:45.790> because<00:03:46.120> I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
see it's kind of red right now because I

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.449 
see it's kind of red right now because I
hid<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.510> before<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:47.049> could<00:03:47.769> just<00:03:47.950> take<00:03:48.100> out<00:03:48.280> this

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
hid it before I could just take out this

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.060 
hid it before I could just take out this
and<00:03:48.730> this<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.989> could<00:03:50.170> put<00:03:50.440> these<00:03:50.829> two

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
and this and I could put these two

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.920 
and this and I could put these two
little<00:03:51.280> balls<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.030> they<00:03:52.510> would<00:03:52.660> fit

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
little balls on it and they would fit

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.060 
little balls on it and they would fit
and<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.109> would<00:03:53.200> look<00:03:53.290> like<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.470> new<00:03:53.709> one<00:03:53.829> but<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
and it would look like a new one but the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.620 
and it would look like a new one but the
bar<00:03:54.280> is<00:03:54.310> still<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.820> there<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:55.510> it's

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
bar is still in there so it's

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.240 
bar is still in there so it's
technically<00:03:56.109> not<00:03:56.440> you're<00:03:56.560> not<00:03:56.590> taking<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.100> out

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
technically not you're not taking it out

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.500 
technically not you're not taking it out
but<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:59.709> have<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.859> new<00:04:00.010> piercing<00:04:00.329> new<00:04:01.329> one

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
but you just have a new piercing new one

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.780 
but you just have a new piercing new one
in<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.709> that's<00:04:02.920> what<00:04:03.130> my<00:04:03.280> peers<00:04:03.700> to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
long bar and since I am so small you can

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.909 
long bar and since I am so small you can
see<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.360> comes<00:04:37.630> out<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.870> lot<00:04:38.440> at<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.680> bottom

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
like it's a lot shorter so you're just

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.170 
like it's a lot shorter so you're just
gonna<00:04:47.650> be<00:04:47.770> able<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:47.949> see<00:04:48.130> this<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:48.729> that's<00:04:48.910> good

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
gonna be able to see this so that's good

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.640 
gonna be able to see this so that's good
because<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.510> don't<00:04:49.600> like<00:04:49.840> how<00:04:49.960> long<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.320> is<00:04:50.440> cuz

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
because I don't like how long it is cuz

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.830 
because I don't like how long it is cuz
that's<00:04:50.800> another<00:04:51.010> thing<00:04:51.280> it's<00:04:51.910> long<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:52.660> then

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
that's another thing it's long so then

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.010 
that's another thing it's long so then
when<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:52.990> sit<00:04:53.440> down<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:54.400> part<00:04:54.790> pushes<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.449> up
