00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.020 
pounds and you pull it up behind you all
the<00:01:09.649> way<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.399> top<00:01:12.430> it's<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.579> lot<00:01:13.759> like<00:01:14.000> a

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
the way to the top it's a lot like a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.569 
the way to the top it's a lot like a
spacewalk<00:01:14.780> where<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:15.889> have<00:01:16.039> to<00:01:16.189> remember<00:01:16.399> to

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
spacewalk where you have to remember to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
bring everything you're going to need

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.940 
bring everything you're going to need
because<00:01:18.799> it's<00:01:18.979> a<00:01:19.069> long<00:01:19.340> way<00:01:19.639> down<00:01:23.770> once<00:01:24.770> you

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
because it's a long way down once you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.029 
because it's a long way down once you
reach<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.189> top<00:01:25.429> of<00:01:25.639> the<00:01:25.880> tower<00:01:26.060> itself<00:01:27.039> it's

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
reach the top of the tower itself it's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:40.110 
reach the top of the tower itself it's
time<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.579> go<00:01:28.700> outside

extra<00:01:45.550> hype<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:49.990> called<00:01:50.230> free<00:01:50.590> climbing

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
extra hype this is called free climbing

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.480 
extra hype this is called free climbing
meaning<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:51.850> no<00:01:52.210> safety<00:01:52.720> lines<00:01:52.930> are<00:01:53.140> used

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
meaning that no safety lines are used

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
meaning that no safety lines are used
it's<00:01:54.490> easier<00:01:55.030> faster<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.890> most<00:01:56.890> our<00:01:57.220> workers

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it's easier faster and most our workers

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.140 
it's easier faster and most our workers
climb<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.050> way<00:02:02.160> it's<00:02:03.160> good<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.580> take<00:02:03.730> a<00:02:03.790> break

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
climb this way it's good to take a break

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.600 
climb this way it's good to take a break
and<00:02:04.750> look<00:02:05.020> around<00:02:05.380> while<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.860> rest<00:02:08.610> free

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
and look around while you rest free

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.300 
and look around while you rest free
climbing<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.270> more<00:02:10.540> dangerous<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:11.230> course<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
climbing is more dangerous of course but

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.140 
climbing is more dangerous of course but

are used to attract electrical charges
in<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.270> air<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:28.280> helps<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.670> dissipate<00:03:29.270> the

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.090 

the<00:05:51.640> top<00:05:51.910> is<00:05:52.180> in<00:05:52.330> sight<00:05:52.630> and<00:05:52.870> time<00:05:53.770> for<00:05:53.980> another

break before transitioning to the top at

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.310 
break before transitioning to the top at
this<00:06:02.170> height<00:06:02.230> you<00:06:03.100> can<00:06:03.130> see<00:06:03.520> 55<00:06:04.360> miles<00:06:04.720> to<00:06:05.200> the

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
this height you can see 55 miles to the

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:34.930 
this height you can see 55 miles to the
horizon

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:43.679 

this<00:06:35.630> is<00:06:35.840> the<00:06:35.990> tricky<00:06:36.320> part<00:06:36.590> getting<00:06:37.430> on<00:06:37.580> top

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.469 

that<00:06:44.349> object<00:06:44.830> with<00:06:44.949> the<00:06:45.069> black<00:06:45.279> top<00:06:45.580> is<00:06:45.879> the

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
that object with the black top is the

00:06:46.479 --> 00:07:14.970 
that object with the black top is the
lighting<00:06:46.869> beacon

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.850 

and<00:07:15.100> that's<00:07:15.910> how<00:07:16.120> you<00:07:16.360> climb<00:07:16.750> to<00:07:16.960> the<00:07:16.990> top<00:07:17.080> of<00:07:17.290> a

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
and that's how you climb to the top of a

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.730 
and that's how you climb to the top of a
transmission<00:07:18.220> tower
