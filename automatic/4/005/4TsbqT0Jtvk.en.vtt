00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450 

so<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.539> is<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.930> lithium<00:00:01.260> platinum<00:00:02.129> in

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
so this is the lithium platinum in

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.820 
so this is the lithium platinum in
action<00:00:03.230> and<00:00:04.230> this<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:06.290> pull-out<00:00:09.830> crevice

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
action and this is the pull-out crevice

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.350 
action and this is the pull-out crevice
tool<00:00:11.509> and<00:00:12.509> then<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.820> flip<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:15.030> brush

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
tool and then you have the flip up brush

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.689 
tool and then you have the flip up brush
but<00:00:16.049> notice<00:00:16.320> there's<00:00:16.560> kind<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.830> no<00:00:17.039> seal<00:00:17.369> here

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
but notice there's kind of no seal here

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.359 
but notice there's kind of no seal here
between<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.240> brush<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.590> vacuum<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.250> it

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
between the brush and the vacuum so it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.090 
between the brush and the vacuum so it
really<00:00:20.520> doesn't<00:00:20.730> suck<00:00:21.000> anything<00:00:21.240> up<00:00:22.070> okay

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
really doesn't suck anything up okay

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:54.740 
really doesn't suck anything up okay
flipped<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.980> vacuum<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:26.039> some<00:00:26.310> car<00:00:26.580> man

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.830 

so<00:00:55.750> some<00:00:56.379> of<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.620> things<00:00:56.770> up<00:00:57.010> but<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:58.690> really

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
so some of the things up but not really

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.229 
so some of the things up but not really
impressed<00:00:59.110> with<00:00:59.320> this<00:00:59.440> section<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.059> a

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
impressed with this section this is a

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.819 
impressed with this section this is a
section<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:01.719> I've<00:01:01.989> already<00:01:02.230> done<00:01:02.410> here<00:01:02.710> in

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
section that I've already done here in

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
the back seat and you can see there's

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.870 
the back seat and you can see there's
still<00:01:05.830> some<00:01:05.979> things<00:01:06.280> left<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.729> things

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
still some things left one of the things

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.359 
still some things left one of the things
about<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.180> crevice<00:01:10.570> tool<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.130> when<00:01:12.250> you

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
about the crevice tool is that when you

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.139 
about the crevice tool is that when you
pull<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.000> out<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:14.040> tends<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.100> push<00:01:15.520> itself<00:01:15.820> back

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
pull it out it tends to push itself back

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.170 
pull it out it tends to push itself back
in<00:01:16.360> if<00:01:16.540> you<00:01:16.659> try<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:16.930> get<00:01:17.140> into<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.350> crevice<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.790> I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
in if you try to get into a crevice so I

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.130 
in if you try to get into a crevice so I
wish<00:01:19.659> there's<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:19.990> block<00:01:20.200> on<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.869> is<00:01:22.930> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
wish there's a block on that this is the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.400 
wish there's a block on that this is the
rotating<00:01:23.680> head<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.720> give<00:01:25.960> this<00:01:26.170> to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
rotating head and give this to

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.100 
rotating head and give this to

on<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:50.530> for<00:01:50.770> battery<00:01:51.100> life<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:53.380> pick<00:01:53.619> gun

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
on that's for battery life this pick gun

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.249 
on that's for battery life this pick gun
I<00:01:54.039> even<00:01:54.520> back<00:01:55.119> in<00:01:55.300> with<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:55.630> for<00:01:55.869> about<00:01:56.020> half

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
I even back in with this for about half

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:07.529 
I even back in with this for about half
an<00:01:56.380> hour<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:57.069> this<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:57.789> about<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.209> die<00:02:06.539> that's

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
an hour and this is about to die that's

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.229 
an hour and this is about to die that's
from<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.810> full<00:02:08.020> charge<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.679> totally<00:02:09.280> good<00:02:09.459> in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
from a full charge to totally good in

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.059 
from a full charge to totally good in
about<00:02:10.840> 45<00:02:11.830> minutes<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.310> an<00:02:12.340> hour<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:14.080> that's

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
about 45 minutes to an hour so that's

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.879 
about 45 minutes to an hour so that's
the<00:02:15.430> problem
