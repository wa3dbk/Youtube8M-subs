00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.220 
completely for speed as you can see side
by<00:00:17.460> side<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.910> Giants<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:19.020> going

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
cannon first so that's just basically a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.089

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
Haysville it's kind of like a balance to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
air the first air sweeper that we got

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
air the first air sweeper that we got
wasn't<00:00:52.739> even<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.190> powerful<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:54.210> begin<00:00:54.510> with

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
wasn't even that powerful to begin with

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.869 
wasn't even that powerful to begin with
so<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> second<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.739> especially<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.760> this

so a second one especially with this
Haysville<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.539> don't<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.320> gonna<00:00:58.440> make

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
Haysville I don't think it's gonna make

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.920 
Haysville I don't think it's gonna make
a<00:00:58.649> difference<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.190> guys<00:00:59.370> but<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a difference you guys but that's the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.599 
a difference you guys but that's the
comparison<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.739> balloons<00:01:02.100> left<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
comparison with the balloons left and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.399

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

thinking that it might be a little bit
more<00:03:37.380> popular<00:03:37.650> than<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> other<00:03:38.310> spills<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.880> be

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
more popular than the other spills to be
