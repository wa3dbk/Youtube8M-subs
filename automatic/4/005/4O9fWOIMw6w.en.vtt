00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.609
 this nokia c2 02 which has arrived 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.039
 because not to power and it has already been approved 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.690
 another new flex and neither a power 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.840
 then the review that we have to 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.850
 to do is connect the charger and see if 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.740
 the cell phone charges if the cell phone charges 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.780
 means logically the time 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.310
 it's good that the problem is left 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.970
 because the power button is not 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.160
 working 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.970
 and to be able to make this solution 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.740
 then it is very easy we go to the page 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.840
 of service the arauca which is in 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.850
 Facebook 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.970
 where we are climbing the last 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 solutions and we look where the 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.230
 100% original solutions 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.230
 and we are going to look 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.320
 it turns out that the connector of the time where 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.970
 connect the flex there are two lines that are 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.470
 which make the phone turn on 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.680
 this line that we see here 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.480
 has a space 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.340
 here is a capacitor the reason 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.110
 resistance that there is a space from there to 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.480
 the fourth line is where it should be 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.580
 contact but because of the humidity 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.280
 concentrated the voltage that circulates through 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.160
 this line and it burst in this sector 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.590
 here we see that there is no continuous from here to 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.350
 pin 4 the third pin in the part 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.510
 negative of the power button but if 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.940
 what we did was complete 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.670
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.180
 give continuity to that line so that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.550
 can turn on then let's see that 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.630
 the phone only charges 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.210
 just load 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.300
 but does not understand when we cousins 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.150
 power 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.420
 there we see that it only charges but when 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.400
 we open the power has not turned on because 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.350
 has broken that line then what 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 we are going to do is give continuity and 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.570
 let's proceed with that 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.570
 condense solution 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.240
 soy 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.349
 to 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.120
 and we are going to 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.550
 we can not 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.550
 sorry 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.500
 and can damage the cable 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.759
 ready after having been cleaned 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.879
 cleaned the connector since there was 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:54.680
 a bit of flow left and in English 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:58.580
 so now if we see how 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.930
 we can give power to the phone 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.930
 and I feel 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.910
 cermi will launch another technical service 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.910
 professional mobile phone
