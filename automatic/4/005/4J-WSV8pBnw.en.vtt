like we thought it was going to fly we
made<00:01:59.830> almost<00:02:00.830> zero<00:02:01.220> changes<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.120> flight

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
made almost zero changes to the flight

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.790

flew and it just it just handles

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.810 
flew and it just it just handles
spectacularly<00:02:06.680> well<00:02:07.100> especially<00:02:07.460> in<00:02:07.729> the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
spectacularly well especially in the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.219 
spectacularly well especially in the
failure<00:02:08.000> modes<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:08.570> worry<00:02:08.840> about<00:02:09.050> so

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
failure modes that we worry about so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.620 
failure modes that we worry about so
much<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.560> flight<00:02:09.770> tests<00:02:10.120> so<00:02:11.120> they're<00:02:11.300> okay<00:02:11.600> and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
much in flight tests so they're okay and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.230 
much in flight tests so they're okay and
service<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.980> performance<00:02:13.490> we've<00:02:13.700> we're

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
service the performance we've we're

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.090 
service the performance we've we're
meeting<00:02:14.450> our<00:02:14.540> performance<00:02:15.020> goals<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.860> flight

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
meeting our performance goals the flight

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.640 
meeting our performance goals the flight
deck<00:02:16.280> actually<00:02:16.640> exceeds<00:02:17.030> its<00:02:17.210> noise<00:02:17.420> goal<00:02:17.750> so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
deck actually exceeds its noise goal so

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.230 
deck actually exceeds its noise goal so
it's<00:02:18.830> just<00:02:18.950> quiet<00:02:19.190> up<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.610> front<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.060 
extremes both the low end and the high
end<00:02:26.840> especially<00:02:27.110> when<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.560> comes<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.800> flutter

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
end especially when it comes to flutter

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.800 
end especially when it comes to flutter
analysis<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.790> things<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.090> nature<00:02:29.180> how

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
analysis and things of that nature how

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.870 
analysis and things of that nature how
the<00:02:29.870> airplane<00:02:30.170> handle<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:30.650> both<00:02:30.770> extremes<00:02:31.190> so

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
the airplane handle in both extremes so

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.720 
the airplane handle in both extremes so
I<00:02:31.910> did<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.180> flutter<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.630> airplane<00:02:33.730> just

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
I did the flutter on the airplane just

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.060 
I did the flutter on the airplane just
just<00:02:35.180> went<00:02:35.360> right<00:02:35.510> through<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:36.620> hit<00:02:36.950> all

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
just went right through it we hit all

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.160 
just went right through it we hit all
our<00:02:37.220> test<00:02:37.430> points<00:02:37.720> didn't<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.870> repeat

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
our test points didn't have to repeat

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.740 
our test points didn't have to repeat
them<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:39.350> had<00:02:39.440> no<00:02:39.590> indication<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:40.190> any

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
them we had no indication of any

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.000 
them we had no indication of any
instabilities<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.959> airplane<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.890> our

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
instabilities in the airplane so our

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.610 
instabilities in the airplane so our
flutter<00:02:43.250> analysis<00:02:43.900> maybe<00:02:44.900> purus<00:02:45.380> would<00:02:45.500> say

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
flutter analysis maybe purus would say

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.080 
flutter analysis maybe purus would say
you<00:02:45.800> over<00:02:46.070> design<00:02:46.370> because<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.790> didn't<00:02:47.000> have

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
you over design because you didn't have

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.120 
you over design because you didn't have
any<00:02:47.209> even<00:02:47.540> come<00:02:47.690> close<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.800> never<00:02:48.980> know

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
any even come close but you never know

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.400 
any even come close but you never know
that<00:02:49.310> we<00:02:50.120> make<00:02:50.330> our<00:02:50.480> performance<00:02:50.959> our<00:02:51.140> takeoff

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
that we make our performance our takeoff

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.750 
that we make our performance our takeoff
performance<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.980> our<00:02:52.010> landing<00:02:52.340> performance

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
performance and our landing performance

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.380 
performance and our landing performance
we<00:02:53.180> know<00:02:53.360> as<00:02:53.570> we<00:02:54.170> define<00:02:54.650> for<00:02:54.860> our<00:02:54.980> customers

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
we know as we define for our customers

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.900 
we know as we define for our customers
so<00:02:56.390> we're<00:02:56.540> excited<00:02:56.750> about<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:57.980> got<00:02:58.130> 120

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
so we're excited about it and we got 120

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.000 
so we're excited about it and we got 120
not<00:02:59.030> stall<00:02:59.330> speed<00:02:59.540> now<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.750> airplane<00:03:00.140> well

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
not stall speed now the airplane well

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.610 
not stall speed now the airplane well
the<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.250> head-up<00:03:01.670> display<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.390> only

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
the the head-up display that the only

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.390 
the the head-up display that the only
performance<00:03:03.620> advantage<00:03:03.920> forget<00:03:04.100> we<00:03:04.190> have<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
performance advantage forget we have a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.490 
performance advantage forget we have a
low<00:03:04.580> visibility<00:03:05.030> takeoff<00:03:05.300> system<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.410> can

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
low visibility takeoff system so you can

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.930 
low visibility takeoff system so you can
depart<00:03:06.920> when<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.220> weather<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.670> little<00:03:07.700> bit

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
depart when the weather is a little bit

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.120 
depart when the weather is a little bit
worse<00:03:08.120> than<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> normal<00:03:08.810> airplane<00:03:09.050> camp<00:03:09.530> so

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
worse than a normal airplane camp so

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.560 
worse than a normal airplane camp so
that<00:03:10.280> means<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.580> airline<00:03:10.820> starts<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.300> has<00:03:11.540> a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
that means the airline starts that has a

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.059 
that means the airline starts that has a
better<00:03:11.840> shot<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:12.230> starting<00:03:12.800> there

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
better shot of starting there

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.979 
better shot of starting there
a<00:03:13.099> on<00:03:13.310> time<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:14.150> if<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.480> start<00:03:14.719> your<00:03:14.749> day<00:03:14.959> on

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
a on time and if you start your day on

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.539 
a on time and if you start your day on
time<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:15.530> doesn't<00:03:15.709> roll<00:03:15.980> all<00:03:16.189> through<00:03:16.459> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
time it doesn't roll all through the

rest of day and all the rest of your

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.089 
rest of day and all the rest of your
flights<00:03:17.629> are<00:03:17.780> delayed<00:03:17.810> that's<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.920> only

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
flights are delayed that's the only

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.160 
flights are delayed that's the only
credit<00:03:19.819> we<00:03:19.969> take<00:03:20.180> for<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.540> head-up<00:03:20.780> display

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
credit we take for the head-up display

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.110 
credit we take for the head-up display
otherwise<00:03:21.859> it's<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.489> think<00:03:22.939> it's<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.090> great

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
otherwise it's I think it's a great

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.030 
otherwise it's I think it's a great
safety<00:03:23.810> feature<00:03:24.139> in<00:03:24.499> the<00:03:24.560> airplane<00:03:24.769> because

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
safety feature in the airplane because

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.470 
safety feature in the airplane because
it<00:03:25.249> allows<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.700> pilot<00:03:25.879> could<00:03:26.120> look<00:03:26.269> out<00:03:26.359> of

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
it allows the pilot could look out of

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.809 
it allows the pilot could look out of
the<00:03:26.540> airplane<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.049> not<00:03:27.170> look<00:03:27.349> down<00:03:27.469> inside<00:03:27.859> so

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
the airplane and not look down inside so

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.240 
the airplane and not look down inside so
