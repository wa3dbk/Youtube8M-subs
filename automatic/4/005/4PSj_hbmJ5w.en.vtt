00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 well let's start remember that 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.010
 generally what is done at the beginning 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.139
 is to boil in water of course 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.849
 directly the whole quinces a 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 gas car and everything in cascade and everything but 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 we are going to cheat, we are going to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 take to cooking in the microwave is 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.730
 if we are going to help him and we are going to put 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.609
 to cook 5 minutes if the microwave 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 when we take them out of the microwave to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.130
 maximum power will be like this 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 perfectly cooked already left a good 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.870
 so that they cool down and from that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 way we can continue working 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.350
 then once we take it out at 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 We're going to peel it, microwave 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.090
 removing the shells with a knife 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.460
 in this way and the shell and the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 seeds can be reserved to make 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.170
 a lizard jelly to the shell is not 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.480
 pull the shell do not throw in that I 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.219
 I like that they save, I have nothing 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.930
 You can take advantage of everything 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.489
 when we have it totally peeled from 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 even in this way what are we going to 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.320
 to do is to remove the pulp 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.910
 to take in this case to the tube of a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.410
 mixer should always try not 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.850
 the seeds are left so if we see that 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.740
 be a bit of seeds you have to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 take it off we take it out there we're going to leave 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.150
 one side and we will continue adding 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.820
 all the pasta can also be in a 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.340
 processor can be in a blender 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.810
 even if they need to add a 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.890
 little bit of water to liquefy it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 perfectly 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.940
 add the no problems but 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.710
 as long as they can avoid adding 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.010
 liquid better because we're going to have to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.140
 cook at least to leave 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.300
 reducing and concentrating all the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.100
 Quince and that you get them with the mixer 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.170
 clear once we have it here ready 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.030
 we go and we begin to minister 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.700
 this way is that you have to do as 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.410
 a puree a puree just like you just finished 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.720
 say lizard we are pressing on this 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.790
 way to go obtaining a puree with the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.770
 mixer or with a blender as I said 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.200
 even if we do not have any 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.300
 tool of those we can do it with 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.910
 a classic mash-making method 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.950
 it will cost us a little more but it 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.530
 you can do it's also good view already 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.520
 we have pureed the quince, look 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.220
 how it fits perfectly 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.379
 While lawful but that is already cooked 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.720
 they will alter what exactly is cooked 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.150
 keep in mind that it is already cooked in 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.560
 this case in the microwave once 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.569
 so we have our puree 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.780
 finished what we are going to do is 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.790
 Take it directly to cook with nothing 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.190
 press but let's take a pot in 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.470
 Ã¡lava takes nothing nothing initially not 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.049
 we are going to add anything because I'm going 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.780
 to go counting because if we add now 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.150
 sugar what is going to happen is that the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.190
 sugar is burning, cooking 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.709
 this sweet this quince paste is 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.780
 is going to hit us then we want to avoid 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.760
 that sticks what we do then is 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.560
 Take it first to the fire and we will 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.049
 leave here that it is cooking is going 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.540
 to go stirring a little bit until 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.700
 let's get this that color this color 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.150
 look, we have the quince that is 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.760
 yellow the vanilla color we could 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.110
 say a very interesting color and for 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.780
 another side as it goes cooking 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.940
 getting darker will never get to 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.829
 have the color of the quince that 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.870
 we buy because they have dyes 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.340
 grenadine saw coloring this is natural 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.410
 so it's going to have a color 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.080
 a little darker than this we have 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.390
 currently behind but not too dull 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.000
 once I take this color that is 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.040
 reduced much of the sweet's liquid 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.280
 of quince what we are going to do now 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.650
 if you have to add sugars and let's go 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.680
 letting it go cooking and leave 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.989
 reducing I had forgotten to comment 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.739
 that the amount of sugar that we are going to 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.599
 use is the quince pulp that 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.640
 we got after peeling the peel and 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.560
 to take out the seeds we weigh it and 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.360
 we add the same amount of salt 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.160
 would win their cases had the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.560
 amount of pulp that was being 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.170
 cooking here so how much is done 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.900
 sugar should add there this inclusive 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.610
 it needs to add a little more and it's 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.890
 fundamental around the amount 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.170
 because because if we do not add that 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.540
 amount of sugar what happens is that 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.239
 the quince after not solidify 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.310
 then we have to add that 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.980
 amount of sugar if you want to add 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.319
 less sugar they will be able to do but 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.909
 they're going to have to add some jelly 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.130
 for the great hardness that for that 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.620
 harden exactly and now what I'm going 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.850
 to do is I'm going to stay here 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.100
 stirring a good time until it 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.290
 reduce this well enough until it 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.479
 start to take off from the pot we're going 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.720
 to see together in the next step and in that 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.000
 moment we are going to add lizard to the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.310
 almonds so store the goat cheese 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.310
 see kittens very well with him is going very well
