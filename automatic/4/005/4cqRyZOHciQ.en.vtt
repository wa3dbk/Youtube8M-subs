and<00:01:38.720> then<00:01:38.840> started<00:01:39.380> shaking<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:39.890> probably

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
and then started shaking and probably

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.440 
and then started shaking and probably
one<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.400> sinker<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:40.790> can't<00:01:41.090> see<00:01:41.330> where

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
one of the sinker you can't see where

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.700 
one of the sinker you can't see where
you're<00:01:41.510> going<00:01:41.630> you're<00:01:41.930> trying<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.290> feel<00:01:42.530> it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
you're going you're trying to feel it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.680 
you're going you're trying to feel it
employ<00:01:43.070> those<00:01:43.250> things<00:01:43.520> could<00:01:43.700> turn<00:01:43.850> on<00:01:44.510> you

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
employ those things could turn on you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.120 
employ those things could turn on you
quick<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.110> punch<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.470> wall<00:01:45.500> little<00:01:45.980> bit

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
quick you punch the wall little bit

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.620 
quick you punch the wall little bit
shoots<00:01:46.430> across<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.940> other<00:01:47.030> land<00:01:47.300> thought<00:01:47.510> at

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
shoots across the other land thought at

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.910 
shoots across the other land thought at
that<00:01:47.690> point<00:01:47.810> maybe<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.290> steering<00:01:48.620> had<00:01:48.740> gone

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that point maybe the steering had gone

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.740 
that point maybe the steering had gone
off<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:49.640> obviously<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.270> bring<00:01:50.600> her

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
off of it but obviously you bring her

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.630 
off of it but obviously you bring her
back<00:01:50.900> in<00:01:51.200> had<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.620> great<00:01:51.890> conversation<00:01:52.250> with

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.120 
back in had a great conversation with
him<00:01:52.880> about<00:01:52.970> these<00:01:53.390> cars<00:01:53.600> they<00:01:54.500> look<00:01:54.740> like<00:01:54.920> they

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
him about these cars they look like they

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.670 
him about these cars they look like they
should<00:01:55.340> be<00:01:55.370> manhandled<00:01:56.260> but<00:01:57.260> no<00:01:57.440> they're

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
should be manhandled but no they're

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.960 
should be manhandled but no they're
they're<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:57.890> little<00:01:58.040> more<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.370> finesse<00:01:58.580> car

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
they're a little more of a finesse car

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.700 
they're a little more of a finesse car
now<00:01:59.270> yeah<00:01:59.630> they<00:01:59.870> don't<00:02:00.020> have<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.260> downforce

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710
