liquid<00:00:56.930> chocolate<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.739> concentrated<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.850> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
liquid chocolate very concentrated so a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.640

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
those ingredients together until it's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.920 
those ingredients together until it's
all<00:01:06.570> combined<00:01:06.990> nicely<00:01:08.240> okay<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.689> all

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
all combined nicely okay so that's all

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.500 
all combined nicely okay so that's all
beating<00:01:10.920> together<00:01:11.070> nicely<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.939> I'm<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.270> now

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
beating together nicely so I'm just now

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.990 
beating together nicely so I'm just now
going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> evenly<00:01:13.290> divide<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.920> between<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
going to evenly divide that between the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.990 
going to evenly divide that between the
muffin<00:01:15.330> cases<00:01:15.540> I've<00:01:15.840> got<00:01:15.990> six<00:01:16.229> muffin<00:01:16.619> cases

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
muffin cases I've got six muffin cases

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.469 
muffin cases I've got six muffin cases
so<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.299> about<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.840> equally<00:01:19.290> between<00:01:19.470> those

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
so just about that equally between those

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.090 
so just about that equally between those
okay<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.780> recipe<00:01:21.960> said<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:22.920> make

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
okay so the recipe said this will make

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
okay so the recipe said this will make
six<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> whether<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.299> muffin<00:01:24.630> cases<00:01:24.930> are

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
six and whether my muffin cases are

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.630 
six and whether my muffin cases are
slightly<00:01:25.320> smaller<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:25.950> I've<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.340> got

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
slightly smaller but I've actually got

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.969
