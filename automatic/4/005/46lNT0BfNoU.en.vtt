 basis we build our tops the most 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.370
 today we are talking about the biggest 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.620
 the world of airplanes is known plane this 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.940
 flying machine for the atmosphere 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.670
 which uses aerodynamic 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.960

 it is remarkable that it is wooden 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.770
 the aircraft was built in 1947, the project 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.499

 the soldiers along with their gear to this 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:03.949
 day the wingspan of the aircraft is the most 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:06.229
 the world's largest 1 place deserves the most 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.309
 the world's largest aircraft built in 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.529
 Ukraine and this is an-225 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:13.580
 the plane that uses for 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:16.939
 the great mass of cargo 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.620
 AN-225 officially recognized 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:22.699
 military transport aircraft 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:29.389
 the height of this aircraft is 24 meters at

 the length of the order 73 wingspan 89 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.800
 so we saw the top 10 largest in 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.080
 world of planes do not agree leave
