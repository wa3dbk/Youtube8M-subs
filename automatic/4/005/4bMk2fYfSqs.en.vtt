issue<00:01:22.920> I've<00:01:23.159> had<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.579> is<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.119> hands

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
issue I've had with that is if my hands

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.020 
issue I've had with that is if my hands
are<00:01:24.600> wet<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.979> starts<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> fall<00:01:26.759> because

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
are wet then it starts to fall because

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.950 
are wet then it starts to fall because
of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.539> aerodynamics<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> how<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.159> designed

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
of the aerodynamics of how it's designed

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.249 
of the aerodynamics of how it's designed
and<00:01:31.430> but<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.609> my<00:01:32.789> hands<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.180> dry<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.869> there's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and but if my hands are dry and there's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.099 
and but if my hands are dry and there's
no<00:01:34.409> food<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> bold<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> we're<00:01:35.609> good<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> go

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
no food in the bold and we're good to go

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.719 
no food in the bold and we're good to go
so<00:01:37.109> that<00:01:37.140> works<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.680> nicely<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.609> gonna

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
so that works out nicely there I'm gonna

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.300 
so that works out nicely there I'm gonna
let<00:01:38.969> him<00:01:39.149> go<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.859> we've<00:01:40.859> run<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.280> through

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
let him go and we've run them through

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.399 
let him go and we've run them through
the<00:01:41.579> dishwasher<00:01:41.700> several<00:01:42.420> times<00:01:42.630> no<00:01:42.929> problems

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the dishwasher several times no problems

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.700 
the dishwasher several times no problems
the<00:01:43.979> only<00:01:44.280> problem<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.789> I<00:01:44.969> had

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
the only problem that I had

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.700 
the only problem that I had
unfortunately<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:47.159> when<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:49.409> when

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
unfortunately was when this when

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.520 
unfortunately was when this when
this<00:01:49.859> came<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.429> was<00:01:50.549> taped<00:01:50.939> down<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.229> this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this came it was taped down so that this

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.580 
this came it was taped down so that this
bowl<00:01:52.799> wasn't<00:01:53.219> wouldn't<00:01:53.729> fall<00:01:54.359> out<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.929> so<00:01:55.500> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
bowl wasn't wouldn't fall out and so you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.459 
bowl wasn't wouldn't fall out and so you
can<00:01:55.799> see<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.310> adhesive<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.179> tape

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
can see that the adhesive on the tape

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.169 
can see that the adhesive on the tape
removed<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.710> little<00:01:59.009> bit<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.759> design

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
removed a little bit of the design

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.959 
removed a little bit of the design
they're<00:02:01.049> obviously<00:02:01.829> not<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.490> big<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.789> deal

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
they're obviously not that big of a deal

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.789 
they're obviously not that big of a deal
and<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.359> the<00:02:03.479> other<00:02:03.539> side<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.649> other

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and on the other side but on the other

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.089 
and on the other side but on the other
two<00:02:05.130> didn't<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.700> didn't<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.950> was

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
two didn't it didn't do that so that was

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.380 
two didn't it didn't do that so that was
the<00:02:08.250> only<00:02:08.340> really<00:02:08.610> problem<00:02:09.300> there

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
the only really problem there

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.260 
the only really problem there
um<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:11.650> then<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.130> course<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.580> know<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.760> when<00:02:13.240> I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
um and then of course you know I when I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.880 
um and then of course you know I when I
put<00:02:13.510> these<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> dishwasher<00:02:14.319> we've<00:02:14.709> run

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
put these in the dishwasher we've run

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.559 
put these in the dishwasher we've run
them<00:02:14.980> through<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.190> dishwasher<00:02:15.569> probably

have<00:02:40.930> not<00:02:41.110> been<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.440> best<00:02:41.470> eaters<00:02:42.040> lately<00:02:42.459> I

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
have not been the best eaters lately I

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.960 
have not been the best eaters lately I
think<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:42.940> has<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.090> do<00:02:43.360> with<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.600> heat<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.970> as

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
think it has to do with the heat and as

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.190 
think it has to do with the heat and as
a<00:02:46.030> result<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:47.640> try<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.670> offer<00:02:48.940> up<00:02:49.269> something<00:02:49.870> a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
a result I try to offer up something a

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.930 
a result I try to offer up something a
little<00:02:50.350> bit<00:02:50.530> different<00:02:50.890> each<00:02:51.010> time<00:02:52.500> all<00:02:53.500> right

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
little bit different each time all right

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.290 
little bit different each time all right
so<00:02:56.820> let's<00:02:57.820> see<00:02:58.180> if<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.810> diva<00:02:59.820> goes<00:03:00.820> for<00:03:01.209> the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
so let's see if the diva goes for the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:11.350 
so let's see if the diva goes for the
diva<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:03.130> means<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:03.519> you're<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.090> weird

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.300 

what's<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.170> going<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.410> be<00:03:12.440> what's<00:03:12.950> your<00:03:13.130> bet

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
what's it going to be what's your bet

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.860 
what's it going to be what's your bet
diva<00:03:13.940> dog<00:03:14.630> breeds<00:03:15.020> are<00:03:15.170> bad<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.710> bone<00:03:15.860> oh

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.470 

that's<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.170> one<00:03:22.750> dog<00:03:23.750> breeds<00:03:24.160> as<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:26.150> can<00:03:26.300> see

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
that's the one dog breeds as you can see

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.570 
that's the one dog breeds as you can see
I<00:03:26.510> add<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> substantial<00:03:27.590> amount<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.920> water<00:03:28.220> to

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
I add a substantial amount of water to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.050 
I add a substantial amount of water to
their<00:03:29.540> wet<00:03:29.750> food<00:03:30.040> just<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.190> get<00:03:31.490> those<00:03:31.640> kidneys

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
their wet food just to get those kidneys

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.730 
their wet food just to get those kidneys
flushed<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.690> especially<00:03:33.050> with<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> heat

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
flushed and especially with the heat

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.410 
flushed and especially with the heat
it's<00:03:34.010> important<00:03:34.490> that<00:03:34.640> they<00:03:34.760> get<00:03:34.910> hydrated

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.050 

yeah<00:03:38.420> well<00:03:38.780> maybe<00:03:39.080> I'll<00:03:39.350> go<00:03:39.500> for<00:03:39.709> this<00:03:39.860> one

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
yeah well maybe I'll go for this one

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:51.100 
yeah well maybe I'll go for this one
this<00:03:41.060> one's

gauss<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.590> such<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> strange<00:03:53.310> way<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.610> eat

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
gauss this is such a strange way to eat

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.030 
gauss this is such a strange way to eat

this<00:03:56.250> why<00:03:56.790> are<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.030> doing<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.680> Gauss<00:04:02.900> anyway

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
this why are you doing that Gauss anyway

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.290 
this why are you doing that Gauss anyway
he<00:04:04.380> usually<00:04:04.650> eats<00:04:04.890> like<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.400> normal<00:04:05.790> cat<00:04:06.000> and

was trying to show you that you know his
whiskers<00:04:20.310> aren't<00:04:21.269> bothered<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:22.140> don't<00:04:22.920> think

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
whiskers aren't bothered I don't think

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.700 
whiskers aren't bothered I don't think
him<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:24.060> maybe<00:04:24.540> they<00:04:24.810> are<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:25.290> don't<00:04:25.530> I've

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
him that maybe they are I don't I've

him that maybe they are I don't I've
never<00:04:25.890> had<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.130> cat<00:04:26.430> with<00:04:26.670> a<00:04:26.700> whisker<00:04:27.120> problem

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
never had a cat with a whisker problem

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.050 
never had a cat with a whisker problem
with<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.720> bowl<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.860> don't<00:04:29.130> really<00:04:29.190> know<00:04:29.430> what

with a bowl so I don't really know what
to<00:04:30.270> look<00:04:30.450> out<00:04:30.630> for<00:04:30.690> exactly
