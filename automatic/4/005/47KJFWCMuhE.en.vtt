00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
gotta take these guys here and cut them

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:48.819 
gotta take these guys here and cut them
down<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> basically<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> smaller<00:00:48.030> OD

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
down so basically they have a smaller OD

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.260 
down so basically they have a smaller OD
and<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.550> bit<00:00:50.640> different<00:00:50.910> Sun<00:00:51.030> heights

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and a little bit different Sun heights

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.459 
and a little bit different Sun heights
up<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.079> gonna<00:00:52.199> worry<00:00:52.410> about

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
up here which I'm not gonna worry about

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.260 
up here which I'm not gonna worry about
right<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.969> cut<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
right now and then we have to cut the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.080 
right now and then we have to cut the
collar<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.870> guide<00:00:54.989> down<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.820> lower

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
collar to guide down so that this lower

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
collar to guide down so that this lower
collar<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.109> over<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.550> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
collar here will go over to the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:14.630 
collar here will go over to the
shoulders<00:01:00.000> good<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.950> guards<00:01:14.310> without<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
shoulders good the guards without the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820 
shoulders good the guards without the
same<00:01:14.850> ideas<00:01:15.299> overly<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:15.990> no<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.530> had<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> be

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
same ideas overly but no they had to be

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
same ideas overly but no they had to be
different<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.630> now<00:01:18.630> I'm<00:01:18.720> gonna<00:01:18.810> cut<00:01:19.140> these

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
different so now I'm gonna cut these

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.160 
different so now I'm gonna cut these
down<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:20.330> don't<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.540> size<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.990> need

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
press and see what happens so that's

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.330 
press and see what happens so that's
where<00:01:44.330> they're<00:01:44.480> right<00:01:44.690> now

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
so in order to turn the guides down I'm

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.200 
so in order to turn the guides down I'm
gonna<00:01:48.380> move<00:01:48.890> my<00:01:48.920> valve<00:01:49.220> guide<00:01:49.430> poet<00:01:49.730> pilot

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
gonna move my valve guide poet pilot

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.790 
gonna move my valve guide poet pilot
Adam<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.750> little<00:01:50.900> quick<00:01:51.140> way<00:01:51.290> drowning<00:01:51.710> in

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
Adam a little quick way drowning in

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.250 
Adam a little quick way drowning in
equipment<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:53.630> really<00:01:53.900> good<00:01:54.050> for<00:01:54.200> this

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
equipment it's really good for this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.490 
equipment it's really good for this
application<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.390> tapered<00:01:56.840> pilot<00:01:57.230> you

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
application this is a tapered pilot you

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.930 
application this is a tapered pilot you
push<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.890> guide<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:58.400> here<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.820> will

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
push the guide on you here that will

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.370 
push the guide on you here that will
hold<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.450> then<00:01:59.690> you<00:01:59.750> have<00:01:59.870> centers<00:02:00.229> on

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
hold it and then you have centers on

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.410 
hold it and then you have centers on
both<00:02:00.530> end<00:02:00.740> of<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.850> can<00:02:02.000> turn<00:02:02.120> it<00:02:02.240> between

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
both end of this you can turn it between

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.270 
both end of this you can turn it between
centers<00:02:02.540> or<00:02:03.290> just<00:02:03.590> hold<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.890> side<00:02:04.130> with

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
centers or just hold this side with

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.250 
centers or just hold this side with
Chuck<00:02:04.490> jaws<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.090> turn<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.660> center<00:02:05.930> off<00:02:06.080> this

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
Chuck jaws and turn the center off this

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.940 
Chuck jaws and turn the center off this
side<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:08.360> we'll<00:02:08.479> fold<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.869> nice<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.050> true<00:02:09.440> or
