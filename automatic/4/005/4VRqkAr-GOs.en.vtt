hi<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:01.170> instead<00:00:02.010> of<00:00:02.129> spamming<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.700> forums

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi guys instead of spamming the forums

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.900 
hi guys instead of spamming the forums
with<00:00:03.300> bug<00:00:03.659> reports<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.410> decided<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.520> share<00:00:05.790> an

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
with bug reports I decided to share an

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.780 
with bug reports I decided to share an
idea<00:00:06.060> for<00:00:06.509> maka<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.109> time<00:00:07.379> it's<00:00:08.250> quite<00:00:08.550> easy

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
idea for maka this time it's quite easy

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.959 
idea for maka this time it's quite easy
to<00:00:09.179> add<00:00:09.510> backgrounds<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.650> an<00:00:10.950> element<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.610> maka

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
to add backgrounds to an element in maka

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.250 
to add backgrounds to an element in maka
but<00:00:12.200> sometimes<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.620> would<00:00:13.889> be<00:00:14.099> faster<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.260> have

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
but sometimes it would be faster to have

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.820 
but sometimes it would be faster to have
more<00:00:17.130> manual<00:00:17.820> control<00:00:18.359> instead<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.020> adding<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
more manual control instead of adding a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.120 
more manual control instead of adding a
background<00:00:20.010> through<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.359> slider<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.980> I

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
background through a slider so when I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.470 
background through a slider so when I
add<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.880> background<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.539> need<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.960> slide<00:00:25.949> this

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
add a background I need to slide this

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.780 
add a background I need to slide this
position<00:00:27.480> field<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:29.689> type<00:00:31.130> numeric<00:00:32.130> values

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
position field or type numeric values

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.139 
position field or type numeric values
and<00:00:34.160> instead<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.300> could<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:37.020> would<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
and instead what I could do would be to

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.139 
and instead what I could do would be to
just<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.750> example<00:00:40.320> take<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.340> image<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
just for example take an image out of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.889 
just for example take an image out of
the<00:00:42.300> library

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the library

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.250 
the library
and<00:00:43.219> let's<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.489> what<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> need<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> nice

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and let's see what I need here is a nice

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.189 
and let's see what I need here is a nice
image<00:00:52.399> under<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> remember<00:00:54.870> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
image under now do you remember that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.790 
image under now do you remember that
feature<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:56.629> Photoshop<00:00:57.629> or<00:00:57.809> illustrator<00:00:58.050> when

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
feature in Photoshop or illustrator when

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.540 
feature in Photoshop or illustrator when
you<00:00:59.510> click<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.690> image<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.500> click<00:01:01.829> some<00:01:02.160> shape

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you click an image and click some shape

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.230 
you click an image and click some shape
and<00:01:02.940> create<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.140> mask<00:01:04.470> while<00:01:05.400> maka<00:01:05.760> doesn't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and create a mask while maka doesn't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.429 
and create a mask while maka doesn't
need<00:01:06.510> any<00:01:06.780> masks<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.729> could<00:01:08.970> use<00:01:09.439> is

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
need any masks but what it could use is

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.420 
need any masks but what it could use is
some<00:01:10.770> kind<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> shortcut<00:01:11.659> which<00:01:12.659> would<00:01:13.430> embed

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
some kind of shortcut which would embed

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
some kind of shortcut which would embed
the<00:01:14.670> image<00:01:15.259> into<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.439> element<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.670> div<00:01:18.560> so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the image into that element that div so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
the image into that element that div so
that<00:01:20.070> image<00:01:20.460> would<00:01:20.729> stop<00:01:21.450> being<00:01:21.720> an<00:01:22.439> image<00:01:23.270> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that image would stop being an image in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.429 
that image would stop being an image in
HTML<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.350> instead<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:26.759> morph<00:01:27.570> into

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
HTML and instead it would morph into

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.370 
HTML and instead it would morph into
background<00:01:29.340> position<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.530> exactly<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:33.380> at

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
background position and exactly that at

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.770 
background position and exactly that at
exactly<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.070> position<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.000> after<00:01:36.420> clicking

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
exactly that position so after clicking

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440 
exactly that position so after clicking
that<00:01:37.170> shortcut<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:38.670> end<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.150> in

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that shortcut you would end up in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:54.700 
that shortcut you would end up in
something<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.130 

okay<00:01:55.370> so<00:01:55.430> here's<00:01:56.210> one<00:01:56.690> which<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.500> already

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
okay so here's one which is already

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.169 
okay so here's one which is already
using<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:02.440> background<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:06.260> you<00:02:06.380> know<00:02:06.560> if<00:02:07.149> now<00:02:08.149> I

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
using a background and you know if now I

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.010 
using a background and you know if now I
can<00:02:08.710> adjust<00:02:09.710> it<00:02:10.009> but<00:02:10.759> it's<00:02:10.940> for<00:02:11.690> me<00:02:11.840> it's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
can adjust it but it's for me it's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.870 
can adjust it but it's for me it's
easier<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.650> adjust<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.640> canvas

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
easier to adjust it on the canvas

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.340 
easier to adjust it on the canvas
instead<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.690> adjusting

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
instead of adjusting

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.970 
instead of adjusting
like<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.220> said<00:02:16.280> numeric<00:02:17.090> values<00:02:18.020> or<00:02:18.350> sliders

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
like I said numeric values or sliders

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.620 
like I said numeric values or sliders
and<00:02:19.910> stuff<00:02:20.540> like<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.930> or<00:02:21.200> using<00:02:21.830> repeat<00:02:22.630> so

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
and stuff like that or using repeat so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.199 
and stuff like that or using repeat so
what<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.410> could<00:02:24.650> do<00:02:24.920> because<00:02:25.550> I've<00:02:25.730> noticed

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
what it could do because I've noticed

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.100 
what it could do because I've noticed
that<00:02:26.330> now<00:02:26.690> every<00:02:27.470> image<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:27.980> create<00:02:29.110> starts

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
that now every image you create starts

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.780 
that now every image you create starts
with<00:02:31.540> repeat<00:02:33.700> talent<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.430> actually

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
with repeat talent on so you actually

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.290 
with repeat talent on so you actually
have<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.420> turn<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.989> off<00:02:39.730> well<00:02:40.730> if<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.150> would

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
have to turn it off well if you would

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.860 
have to turn it off well if you would
use<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.780> image<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.030> embed<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.239> into<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
use that image and embed it into the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.470 
use that image and embed it into the
background<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:45.770> repeat<00:02:46.160> buttons<00:02:46.940> could<00:02:47.330> be

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
background the I repeat buttons could be

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.040 
background the I repeat buttons could be
already<00:02:48.200> checked<00:02:48.890> off<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.550> we<00:02:50.360> don't<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:50.870> to

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
already checked off and we don't have to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.800 
already checked off and we don't have to
stop<00:02:51.440> at<00:02:51.680> embedding<00:02:52.280> one<00:02:52.700> image<00:02:53.120> into<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
stop at embedding one image into the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.050 
stop at embedding one image into the
background<00:02:54.260> what<00:02:54.830> we<00:02:55.070> can<00:02:55.280> do<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.670> actually

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
background what we can do is actually

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.390 
background what we can do is actually
select<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.290> couple<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.770> images<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.780> one

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
select a couple of images and one

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.580 
select a couple of images and one
element<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:03.310> we<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.610> also<00:03:05.330> hit<00:03:05.870> some<00:03:05.900> kind<00:03:06.410> of

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
element and we can also hit some kind of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.870 
element and we can also hit some kind of
a<00:03:07.000> shortcut<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:09.830> all<00:03:10.040> these<00:03:10.340> images

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
a shortcut and and that all these images

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.750 
a shortcut and and that all these images
at<00:03:11.269> their<00:03:11.630> respective<00:03:12.500> positions<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.280> then

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
at their respective positions and then

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.360 
at their respective positions and then
if<00:03:13.910> some<00:03:14.480> images<00:03:14.900> would<00:03:15.110> require<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:16.220> be

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
if some images would require to be

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.289 
if some images would require to be
repeated<00:03:17.150> we<00:03:17.420> do<00:03:17.600> just<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:20.090> could

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
repeated we do just that and it could

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.840 
repeated we do just that and it could
look<00:03:20.810> like<00:03:20.870> something<00:03:21.590> like<00:03:21.830> this<00:03:21.860> for

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
look like something like this for

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.320 
look like something like this for
example<00:03:23.330> I<00:03:23.480> want<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.870> have<00:03:24.019> an<00:03:24.799> image<00:03:25.489> on<00:03:25.790> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
example I want to have an image on the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.070 
example I want to have an image on the
background<00:03:26.780> here<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.799> want<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.370> merge<00:03:29.299> that

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
background here and I want to merge that

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.620 
background here and I want to merge that
white<00:03:30.410> background<00:03:31.010> with<00:03:31.580> with<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.269> gray

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
white background with with that gray

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.550 
white background with with that gray
area<00:03:32.900> below<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.570> course<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:35.989> could<00:03:36.350> do

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
area below and I of course I could do

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.229 
area below and I of course I could do
that<00:03:36.709> with<00:03:37.459> some<00:03:37.760> gradient<00:03:38.360> but<00:03:38.600> I<00:03:39.820> also<00:03:40.820> can

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
that with some gradient but I also can

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.850 
that with some gradient but I also can
do<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.540> in<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.530> more<00:03:42.799> interesting<00:03:43.190> way<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.590> let's

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
do it in a more interesting way so let's

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.150 
do it in a more interesting way so let's
see<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:48.140> image<00:03:48.380> would<00:03:48.709> be<00:03:48.890> nice<00:03:49.100> here<00:03:49.489> and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
see this image would be nice here and

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.520 
see this image would be nice here and
what<00:03:52.160> I'm<00:03:52.400> trying<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.880> do<00:03:53.239> here<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:54.170> like

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
what I'm trying to do here is like

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.970 
what I'm trying to do here is like
positioning<00:03:55.519> this<00:03:55.850> image<00:03:56.299> outside<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:57.680> that

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
positioning this image outside of that

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.569 
positioning this image outside of that
element<00:03:58.489> so<00:03:59.260> if<00:04:00.260> that<00:04:00.500> would<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:00.860> converted<00:04:01.459> to

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
element so if that would be converted to

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.620 
element so if that would be converted to
a<00:04:01.670> background<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:04.010> would<00:04:04.400> have<00:04:05.239> negative

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
a background it would have negative

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.449 
a background it would have negative
values

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.920 

and<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:10.209> would<00:04:10.690> also<00:04:10.900> like<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.530> roster<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.750> be

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
and I would also like that roster to be

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.599 
and I would also like that roster to be
somewhere<00:04:14.680> here<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.310> repeated<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:18.430> would

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
somewhere here and repeated and it would

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.599 
somewhere here and repeated and it would
be<00:04:18.790> nice<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.299> could<00:04:19.329> just<00:04:20.250> select<00:04:21.250> that

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
be nice if I could just select that

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.600 
be nice if I could just select that
image<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.889> one<00:04:23.889> and<00:04:24.270> select<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:27.130> element

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
image that one and select the element

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.450 
image that one and select the element
behind<00:04:27.940> them<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.479> of<00:04:29.110> course<00:04:29.139> hit<00:04:29.979> some<00:04:30.220> kind

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
behind them and of course hit some kind

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.960 
behind them and of course hit some kind
of<00:04:31.320> shortcut<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:33.540> what<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.720> could<00:04:34.990> do<00:04:35.970> would

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
of shortcut and what it could do would

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.390 
of shortcut and what it could do would
be<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:39.330> mean<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.660> end<00:04:40.840> result<00:04:41.289> would<00:04:41.650> look<00:04:42.190> like

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
be I mean the end result would look like

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:54.810 
be I mean the end result would look like
this<00:04:44.669> so<00:04:48.900> let's<00:04:49.900> see<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.789> nice<00:04:53.820> element

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
this so let's see it's a nice element

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.360 
this so let's see it's a nice element
with<00:04:55.150> two<00:04:55.389> backgrounds<00:04:56.080> one<00:04:56.320> has<00:04:56.620> negative

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
with two backgrounds one has negative

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.960 
with two backgrounds one has negative
value<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.120> is<00:04:58.990> not<00:04:59.229> repeated<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.039> of<00:05:00.639> course

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
value and is not repeated and of course

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.310 
value and is not repeated and of course
the<00:05:01.330> second<00:05:01.780> one<00:05:02.100> is<00:05:03.100> repeated<00:05:03.789> but<00:05:04.320> it's

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
the second one is repeated but it's

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.950 
the second one is repeated but it's
easier<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:06.220> just<00:05:07.620> open<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:10.740> panel<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:11.910> click

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
easier to just open that panel and click

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.260 
easier to just open that panel and click
repeat<00:05:13.960> once<00:05:14.289> instead<00:05:15.039> of<00:05:15.099> choosing<00:05:16.030> the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
repeat once instead of choosing the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.260 
repeat once instead of choosing the
image<00:05:16.479> from<00:05:16.720> library<00:05:17.400> positioning<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:20.639> X<00:05:21.639> Y

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
image from library positioning it X Y

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.620 
image from library positioning it X Y
and<00:05:22.780> stuff<00:05:23.410> like<00:05:23.590> that<00:05:23.830> so<00:05:26.880> that's<00:05:27.880> my<00:05:28.030> idea<00:05:28.419> I

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
and stuff like that so that's my idea I

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.730 
and stuff like that so that's my idea I
hope<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.289> like<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:30.120> I'm<00:05:31.260> interested<00:05:32.260> in

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
hope you like it and I'm interested in

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.950 
hope you like it and I'm interested in
what<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:33.280> guys<00:05:33.460> think<00:05:34.000> about<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.510> and<00:05:34.720> what

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
what you guys think about it and what

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.920 
what you guys think about it and what
the<00:05:35.139> community<00:05:35.349> thinks<00:05:35.820> ok<00:05:36.820> guys<00:05:37.060> thanks<00:05:37.750> for
