00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.490
 but 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.490
 Oh 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.950
 too late 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.449
 I am alexander sheepish 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.180
 I'm selling it 1987 hot sails 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.859
 absolutely it's from mans and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.509
 I am French number 45 is then 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.390
 how did you manage for your 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.730
 found by me djokovic partner of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.680
 nadal nadal and shoe that's it ben 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.150
 normally made final agreement to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.589
 huge stakes must be federer no 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.670
 this case is concerned federer 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.010
 not that it's not interesting is that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.210
 it was early in the tournament I think 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.430
 the first day we could be the same 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.220
 but I was not I arrived I 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.280
 am at wednesday and fed learned to type 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.390
 with his coach so impossible 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.489
 impossible to type with federate after 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.040
 he stays in his stuff all and no 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 I'm not so great that I could be my 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.790
 first training was with rafael 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.430
 nadal after I could type with both 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 read a djokovic and rafael judge had to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.420
 hit me I typed djoko I'm going to type 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.310
 shoe but the principle that heels 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.979
 their schedules and everything is so you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.200
 overtakes his 13 of the cases resume the cip 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.509
 this same more than pro to these watchmakers 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 it's really meticulous and here I am 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.909
 I arrived djoko took ten minutes 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.960
 more and then referred dad waiting for him I 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.050
 found and rafa it's a little bit more 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.400
 relaxed djoko it's yeah that's a little 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.840
 more stressful afterwards has failed 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.000
 love a lot of intensity in his 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.490
 strikes his shot is very very heavy 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.750
 b so in the end it's stressful to 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.430
 to say that the ball must be sent back 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.350
 must put it where he wants because 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.000
 that the guys do in any case the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.310
 two players and most of June as soon 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.930
 we put balls a little to admit 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.060
 of and where they do not necessarily go to 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.800
 look he's not playing it so may 7 a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.350
 extra stress are a few 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.560
 balls on tahiti have to play it's 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.210
 really me that dg here I did some 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.640
 little experiments I did to help 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.340
 future challengers tournaments and everything 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.080
 is and I mean it's also 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.090
 stressful or more than I do not sleep 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.500
 inevitably I go to bed late so no no 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.600
 it's really special 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.250
 and frankly it's just great because 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.470
 that I could do go I would like five 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.030
 days plus call him when I was over 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.070
 nervous that I had planned to come 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.840
 since I took them a little physical 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.180
 so I took a come here compared 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.780
 to that and actually I'm trying to see if I 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.350
 could type everything and then 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.270
 in the end I typed crisis that persists 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.130
 pro tennis makes images of manure bages 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.720
 in fact but after that it's not them dallas 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.319
 it is I who am confused Mr. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.130
 with Sophie with Sophie who takes care of 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.220
 goat 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.780
 yeah exactly yeah for the practitioner 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.860
 after me I make my requests in him 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.200
 saying against if you could do me 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.000
 typing with the tests of doing well 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.910
 in addition to these fights at there I am 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.830
 completely the daring with audacity and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.480
 then and frankly it worked 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.730
 frankly I am very very happy 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.530
 of them to have done all that but he 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.020
 pay in these cases not at all no I 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.380
 I'm not paying at all I'm trying to negotiate 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.930
 t-shirts wake and t-shirt 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.310
 of rafah right after his match that 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.620
 I had asked for the training and you 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.940
 and he was super nice but no no 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.320
 it's very hard to have will in any case it 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.150
 do not pay me at all and it's very hard 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.310
 even to have things since they are 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.510
 really in in with their team and 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.510
 everything but it's very complicated
