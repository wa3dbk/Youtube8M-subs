00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.100
 factory that just had its headquarters 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.330
 the old locomotive experts involved were unanimous in this 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.400
 a specimen exhibited in the gardens of the river is a true jewel not 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.250
 only 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.730
 if they put it on the tracks equipped with water coal it would be enough to light the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.720
 boiler and while it would have suffered a function is without the minimum intervention 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.930
 technical 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.790

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.980
 it is reduced a few years are enough and as you can see from the images attracted 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.710
 the attention not only of vandals but also of those who for fun yes 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.630
 climb on this ladder and play at being big or small machinists 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.230

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.869
 boiler door open to any kind of weather 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.160
 how can you see the possibility of anyone getting on board by operating the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.930
 iene emanuele 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.850
 It is true that materials like these are extremely robust 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.360
 once in fact the work took place much more accurately than 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 now and the results were lasting in

 immediately noticeable is the lack of any fence that prevents 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.050
 approaching the precious heirloom would be enough protection like that 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.560
 that exists along the border of the whole park to adequately protect 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.689
 the ancient locomotive from any kind of intrusion 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:28.159
 let's hope somebody pity the old and glorious 625 bar 153 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.389
 and provide to protect it 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:36.139
 absolutely true big is being treated regarding that jona they must
