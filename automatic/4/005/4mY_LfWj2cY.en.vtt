00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.320
 [Music] 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.700
 today it's actually old again 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.100
 has at saskia later blog today 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
 I make a somewhat dramatic make-up for you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 this lures you right now 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.250
 I think it's ideal for Christmas and the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.230
 holidays because i just love it myself 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.730
 scribble on it and lots of glitter too 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.220
 use that's what you do in everyday life 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.630
 actually not used and that's why 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.859
 I think it's nice to be there like that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 can let off steam a bit 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.880
 if you feel the same then i hope so 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.469
 that you like this make-up if it is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.360
 you should be too intense and here 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.860
 prefer something natural MÃ¶gt what I 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.329
 Of course, that's why it can understand 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.989
 then I have in the infobox again so 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.879
 of course a make up look for you 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.200
 my god i have thought christmas 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.480
 it has not even been made up 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.399
 otherwise I wish you 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.710
 a lot of fun with something dramatic 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.140
 her eyes make up and gaudy lips 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 if you of course say that okay 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.530
 to help with combinations then you can 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.180
 Of course, only this eye make up 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.040
 wear with nude colored lips 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.600
 for example, are also very nice 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.909
 and then it's all a bit like that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.030
 weaker but yes I just love 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.770
 red for christmas and i do not wear 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.720
 so often red lips except in the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.280
 winter time that's why I have to do that then 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.680
 always a bit out of my heart 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.650
 you have a lot of fun with the look and is 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.369
 very soon it's good, hello my 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.170
 I love you again 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.450
 I have shown you today 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.439
 a simple one is not easy 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.360
 dramatic eyes 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.710
 I already have my entire make-up 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.509
 prepared as you can see 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.810
 that's a little faster and me 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.549
 start with a reddish brown tone 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.189
 to emphasize my eyelids and afterwards 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.960
 namely this brown shadow of 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.060
 war and love in my eyes 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.860
 angle around just a little bit more 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.880
 definition and I think so 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.680
 is always a very important step 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.290
 because you blind then in the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 much easier and much easier 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.930
 that's always nice 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.060
 basis for every eye neckar offers 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.890
 then I take gold from sailors 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.079
 shimmer eyeshadow and that is 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 really very well pigmented the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.100
 I'm from Paris but you can do it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.600
 also order online as far as I know 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.640
 and perfect for the celebration and 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 festtage da I just love gold and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.540
 silver and yes everything glitters 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.830
 and that's why I have that today 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.510
 Of course you can do it already 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.190
 so leave but I'm all but 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.110
 a bit dramatic I'll take it now 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.990
 the black eyeshadow each the one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.040
 outer eye angle and with black 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.420
 Eyeshadow is the real must 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.430
 take care that he does not get down so badly 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.930
 crumbles and that he is not too far up 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.240
 orphaned in the lid fold and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.280
 looks the same a bit 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.530
 suzuki august why you really have to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.320
 but I am a little bit careful 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.070
 find if the transition then beautiful 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.460
 that they always hidden 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.590
 very pretty and a little bit 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.320
 dramatically after I get away 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.470
 pigment and that is the kobers porto and it 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.720
 is such a nice russet I would 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.600
 that sven just a nice sound and 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.100
 glitter and mica inches and yes unfortunately 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.580
 he crumbles a bit but down 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.620
 it actually works with the mac fix 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.360
 definitely to be applied to the in any case 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.710
 The brush should always be moistened 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.050
 be and never dry 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.400
 and it really keeps you bombed 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.590
 then I'll take a bright one 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.290
 Eyeshadow for my eyebrows arch 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.070
 and again the showroom of mac for one 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.080
 a little bit worse 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.570
 and somehow that's light today by my 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.460
 name for my fighting sex what 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.110
 Of course you do not have to be sorry either 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.580
 but it has the lighting conditions 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.370
 winter are just bad 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.860
 then I take a liquid from patrice 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.350
 eyeliner and paint the stick with me 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.760
 the I manage quite well for my 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.060
 I have to say that I love relationships 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.650
 you are really nice black and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.420
 every really dramatic lux join in 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.920
 but you can also do it completely 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.840
 Of course , wear on by now one 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.990
 very fine line draws I have now 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.260
 Just kind of hold the ring a bit 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.030
 pulled out bad and then I take off 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.950
 most of the miracle brush in his blood 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.360
 and give up on my waterline 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.340
 just around my eyes a bit 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.900
 make it look fresher and then 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.770
 I take to the fine brush and 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.270
 method the lower eyelash wreath it 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.730
 looks just always nice with so 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.800
 a brown the pot in connection 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.600
 namely of the still the radeon krimi 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.830
 concealer give to the under my eyes 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.900
 in a simple way a bit 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.580
 Eyeshadow always crumbles and yes 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.350
 I think that finally everyone 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.359
 very useful if you have one 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.310
 made up of traumatic eye make-up 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.910
 no matter what 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.260
 1, I always make it to the end and 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.200
 wear that always with my youtube 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.970
 countries and when I'm done with it 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.580
 already with the eyelash not use 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.680
 currently very much like the telescope mascara 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.450
 from lobberich are the very very good 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.550
 one of the best mascara she tastes 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.020
 had she does not know tried 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.230
 She definitely was out for the trend 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.550
 the eyelashes somehow so beautiful and makes 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.290
 also beautiful swinging eyelashes 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.610
 Of course, nothing so much as wrong 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.860
 eyelashes so come now to 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.820
 I use the one of patrice me 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.350
 We always have a middle 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.669
 simply cut it with one is 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.630
 looks a little more natural year 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.060
 We do not want to give up today 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.669
 of course from the files I have in the 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.550
 cut through the middle and I think so 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.910
 is always full of the glam factor for each 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.770
 party any event or so then i suppose 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.810
 only the hat mac have the blush and 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.460
 compete my face and I find 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.210
 it is here whether in the moment of so 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.169
 I have to be a bit too 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.360
 greener 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.370
 It should definitely do that by itself 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.070
 Unpack now for the holidays 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.440
 and yes my face is competing like me 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.479
 Do it the same way today and if I do 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.890
 I'll finish when I realize 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.570
 Please do not forget as first content 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.450
 just when your clothes practice teams 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.250
 worse and then we come to the blog 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.740
 I use of the nas tory he claps 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.000
 is super nice because there I have it 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.150
 a bit exaggerated as you can see 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.960
 can and yes there is pigmented what 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.610
 I should say 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.460
 I'm too deep in the glass again 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.020
 attacked but I have it all the more 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.060
 a bit blinded then I take 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.530
 the high light of mine commission one 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.690
 nice color on 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.950
 i love that and i in the highlighter 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.840
 everything in the face what I married 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.229
 want to have what is pretty much like you 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.840
 then i see i live fully with that 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.039
 perfect look eyeliner effect lipliner 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.830
 no idea 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:07.260
 in such a bertone from the edge mean 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.669
 lips and I think of red 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.770
 lipstick an absolute must 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.200
 lips fire to edge in connection 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.560
 namely then still from the real of 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.030
 Merck the review and give up the lips 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.289
 it's not that dry 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.880
 but I can easily apply that 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:25.680
 I love this dull red one time 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.000
 Lipstick and then on the edge I the 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.430
 again with the lipliner just like that 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.470
 that a little bit to clean out because yes 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.060
 red lipstick must be applied exactly 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.630
 become 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.010
 not so nice and yes that was 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.260
 actually quite the make-up 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.360
 I have beautiful nice rustic 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.669

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.919
 my dress from nelly dot com 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.840
 to order the whole a bit more festive 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.040
 make and yes I think so I will 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.030
 In any case under the Christmas tree 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.760
