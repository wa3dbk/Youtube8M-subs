routed<00:03:00.250> myself<00:03:00.880> from<00:03:03.209> Eastern<00:03:04.209> Illinois<00:03:05.700> to

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
routed myself from Eastern Illinois to

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.920 
routed myself from Eastern Illinois to
this<00:03:06.820> location<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.450> was<00:03:07.510> pretty<00:03:07.780> much<00:03:07.870> a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
this location it was pretty much a

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.470 
this location it was pretty much a
straight<00:03:08.230> line<00:03:08.440> across<00:03:08.760> interstate<00:03:09.760> 80

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
straight line across interstate 80

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.979 
straight line across interstate 80
well<00:03:11.200> actually<00:03:11.470> was<00:03:11.590> 88<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.840> 94<00:03:14.940> 90<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.750> then

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
well actually was 88 to 94 90 and then

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.710 
well actually was 88 to 94 90 and then
80<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:18.120> what<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.150> discovered<00:03:19.450> was<00:03:21.570> because<00:03:22.570> you

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
80 and what I discovered was because you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.420 
80 and what I discovered was because you
look<00:03:23.170> on<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.410> map<00:03:23.590> book<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.950> it's<00:03:24.040> like<00:03:24.160> two

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
look on the map book and it's like two

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.120 
look on the map book and it's like two
straight<00:03:24.910> across<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.709> because<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.739> didn't

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
straight across and because I didn't

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.750 
straight across and because I didn't
look<00:03:27.340> closely<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:29.250> didn't<00:03:30.250> realize<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.700> was

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
look closely I didn't realize it was

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.130 
look closely I didn't realize it was
going<00:03:31.090> through<00:03:31.269> downtown<00:03:31.650> Chicago<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.930> that

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
going through downtown Chicago so that

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.520 
going through downtown Chicago so that
ate<00:03:35.350> up<00:03:35.500> about<00:03:35.709> an<00:03:35.860> hour<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.280> my<00:03:36.430> time<00:03:37.530> and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
ate up about an hour of my time and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.560 
ate up about an hour of my time and
could<00:03:39.100> be<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.459> result<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.970> me<00:03:40.060> not<00:03:40.269> getting

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
could be the result of me not getting

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.830 
could be the result of me not getting
home<00:03:40.780> tonight<00:03:41.700> but<00:03:42.700> that's<00:03:42.880> okay<00:03:43.180> because<00:03:43.390> I

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
home tonight but that's okay because I

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.030 
home tonight but that's okay because I
use<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.380> as<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.530> learning<00:03:44.769> experience

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
use that as a learning experience

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.090 
use that as a learning experience
because<00:03:45.670> from<00:03:45.880> now<00:03:45.940> on<00:03:46.650> even<00:03:47.650> though<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.860> looks

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
because from now on even though it looks

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.160 
because from now on even though it looks
like<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.280> straight<00:03:48.610> route<00:03:48.880> because<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:49.870> tend<00:03:50.110> to

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
like a straight route because I tend to

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.640 
like a straight route because I tend to
run<00:03:50.350> north<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.750> part<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.170> country

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
run north in this part of the country

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.650 
run north in this part of the country
and<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:56.290> what<00:03:56.470> I'm<00:03:56.620> going<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.519> pay<00:03:58.360> close

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
and so what I'm going to do is pay close

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.990 
and so what I'm going to do is pay close
attention<00:03:58.870> to<00:04:00.180> what<00:04:02.640> cities<00:04:03.640> I'm<00:04:03.790> going

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
attention to what cities I'm going

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.280 
attention to what cities I'm going
through<00:04:04.180> because<00:04:04.390> it<00:04:04.630> was<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.110> shortest

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
through because it was the shortest

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.890 
through because it was the shortest
distance<00:04:05.620> which<00:04:06.040> is<00:04:06.070> good<00:04:06.430> but<00:04:07.299> it<00:04:07.450> actually

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
distance which is good but it actually

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.120 
distance which is good but it actually
took<00:04:08.080> a<00:04:08.140> little<00:04:08.320> bit<00:04:08.470> longer<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.830> could<00:04:09.040> have

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
took a little bit longer I could have

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.420 
took a little bit longer I could have
routed<00:04:09.610> myself<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.120> couple<00:04:10.330> miles<00:04:10.950> around<00:04:11.950> that

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
routed myself a couple miles around that

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.480 
routed myself a couple miles around that
city<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.910> been

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
city and been

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.800 
city and been
good<00:04:14.170> looks<00:04:15.170> like<00:04:15.290> my<00:04:15.440> forklift<00:04:15.830> drivers<00:04:16.250> here

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
good looks like my forklift drivers here

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.460 
good looks like my forklift drivers here
keep<00:04:17.810> his<00:04:17.989> face<00:04:18.260> hidden<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.940> like<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.060> keep

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
keep his face hidden I like to keep

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.220 
keep his face hidden I like to keep
everything<00:04:21.470> private<00:04:22.010> for<00:04:22.370> people<00:04:23.230> anyway

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
everything private for people anyway

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.260 
everything private for people anyway
that's<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.220> for<00:04:25.400> today<00:04:25.610> we'll<00:04:25.850> see<00:04:26.030> what<00:04:26.180> the

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
that's it for today we'll see what the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.710 
that's it for today we'll see what the
next<00:04:26.510> load<00:04:26.660> is<00:04:26.690> obviously<00:04:28.150> my<00:04:29.150> understanding

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
next load is obviously my understanding

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.850 
next load is obviously my understanding
is<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.200> load<00:04:30.410> should<00:04:30.710> take<00:04:31.040> me<00:04:31.990> either<00:04:32.990> by<00:04:33.440> or

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
is the load should take me either by or

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.230 
is the load should take me either by or
near<00:04:34.460> st.<00:04:34.880> Louis<00:04:36.460> that's<00:04:37.460> my<00:04:37.670> fingers<00:04:38.030> crossed

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
near st. Louis that's my fingers crossed

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.720 
near st. Louis that's my fingers crossed
anyway<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.940> keep<00:04:41.090> my<00:04:41.270> outer<00:04:41.420> out<00:04:41.660> low

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.090 

see<00:04:46.210> they<00:04:46.360> unload<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.810> with<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.930> forklift

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
see they unload it with a forklift

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.740 
see they unload it with a forklift
it's<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:48.970> know<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.210> reason<00:04:49.480> they<00:04:49.600> have

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
it's and you know the reason they have

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.660 
it's and you know the reason they have
it<00:04:49.900> tarped<00:04:50.170> is<00:04:50.320> for<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.650> salt<00:04:50.890> that<00:04:51.130> is<00:04:51.370> on<00:04:51.550> the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
it tarped is for the salt that is on the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.480 
it tarped is for the salt that is on the
roads<00:04:51.880> after<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.450> certain<00:04:52.720> date<00:04:53.080> they<00:04:53.980> no

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
roads after a certain date they no

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.040 
roads after a certain date they no
longer<00:04:54.520> required<00:04:55.330> tarps<00:04:55.720> during<00:04:55.960> the

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
longer required tarps during the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.170 
longer required tarps during the
summertime<00:04:56.350> because<00:04:57.250> obviously<00:04:57.610> they're<00:04:58.060> not

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
summertime because obviously they're not

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.580 
summertime because obviously they're not
concerned<00:04:58.570> about<00:04:58.720> necessarily<00:04:59.080> weather

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
concerned about necessarily weather

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.770 
concerned about necessarily weather
because<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.490> stuff<00:05:00.730> sits<00:05:00.940> out<00:05:01.090> here<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.450> gets

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
because the stuff sits out here and gets

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.140 
because the stuff sits out here and gets
rusty<00:05:02.170> it's<00:05:03.160> all<00:05:03.340> about<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.670> salt<00:05:03.880> on<00:05:04.060> the

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
rusty it's all about the salt on the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.740 
rusty it's all about the salt on the
roads<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:04.510> oh<00:05:07.110> what<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.140> day<00:05:09.030> so<00:05:10.030> I've<00:05:10.180> got<00:05:10.360> you

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
clock that they're working on so it'll

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.670 
clock that they're working on so it'll
all<00:05:22.570> boil<00:05:22.810> down<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.050> where<00:05:23.440> I'm<00:05:23.530> getting

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
all boil down to where I'm getting

driver or fleet manager and apparently I

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.860

have completed all my requirements that

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.439 
have completed all my requirements that
they<00:07:13.990> have<00:07:14.020> to<00:07:14.280> pass<00:07:15.280> me<00:07:15.520> on<00:07:15.550> to<00:07:15.879> a<00:07:16.000> regular

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:16.449 
they have to pass me on to a regular

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:18.719 
they have to pass me on to a regular
fleet<00:07:16.599> manager<00:07:17.050> so<00:07:17.830> starting<00:07:18.280> Monday<00:07:18.580> I'll<00:07:18.699> be

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729 
fleet manager so starting Monday I'll be

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.290 
fleet manager so starting Monday I'll be
under<00:07:19.150> a<00:07:19.180> regular<00:07:19.629> fleet<00:07:19.870> manager<00:07:20.319> I<00:07:21.300> guess

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
under a regular fleet manager I guess

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.180 
under a regular fleet manager I guess
all<00:07:22.449> that<00:07:22.569> really<00:07:22.780> means<00:07:22.960> is<00:07:23.229> that<00:07:23.409> he'll<00:07:24.039> be

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
all that really means is that he'll be

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.790 
all that really means is that he'll be
the<00:07:24.849> regular<00:07:25.030> fleet<00:07:25.419> managers<00:07:25.900> handle<00:07:26.560> a<00:07:26.590> lot

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
the regular fleet managers handle a lot

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.879 
the regular fleet managers handle a lot
more<00:07:26.830> drivers<00:07:27.719> they<00:07:28.719> have<00:07:28.900> these<00:07:29.139> student

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:29.889 
more drivers they have these student

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:31.800 
more drivers they have these student
fleet<00:07:30.069> managers<00:07:30.520> because<00:07:30.909> this<00:07:31.210> you<00:07:31.569> know<00:07:31.659> as

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
fleet managers because this you know as

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.270 
fleet managers because this you know as
students<00:07:32.289> we<00:07:32.440> tend<00:07:32.650> to<00:07:32.710> have<00:07:32.800> more<00:07:33.039> questions

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 
students we tend to have more questions
