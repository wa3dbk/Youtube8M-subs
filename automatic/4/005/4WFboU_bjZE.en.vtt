00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
point oh ok zactly exact so what kind of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.319 
point oh ok zactly exact so what kind of
how<00:01:30.770> can<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.009> set<00:01:31.189> up<00:01:31.280> displays<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:31.939> what

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
how can we set up displays on this what

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.760 
how can we set up displays on this what
are<00:01:32.420> their<00:01:32.600> limitations<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:33.439> you<00:01:33.530> can<00:01:33.740> either

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
are their limitations so you can either

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.940 
are their limitations so you can either
do<00:01:34.189> one<00:01:34.460> at<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.700> 4k<00:01:35.509> ok<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:36.200> can<00:01:36.259> do<00:01:36.409> 60<00:01:36.770> Hertz

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
do one at a 4k ok we can do 60 Hertz

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.709 
do one at a 4k ok we can do 60 Hertz
almost<00:01:37.250> exactly<00:01:37.670> ok<00:01:37.909> six<00:01:38.149> Hertz<00:01:38.299> or<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.600> can

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
almost exactly ok six Hertz or you can

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.649 
almost exactly ok six Hertz or you can
do<00:01:38.810> for<00:01:39.350> at<00:01:39.469> 1080p<00:01:39.770> ok<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.729> 1080p<00:01:40.939> probably<00:01:41.420> 30

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
do for at 1080p ok for 1080p probably 30

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.569 
do for at 1080p ok for 1080p probably 30
at<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:41.990> point<00:01:42.200> right<00:01:42.409> exactly<00:01:42.530> ok<00:01:43.100> ok<00:01:43.310> that

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
at that point right exactly ok ok that

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.280 
at that point right exactly ok ok that
makes<00:01:43.700> sense<00:01:43.820> probably<00:01:44.630> if<00:01:44.750> you're<00:01:44.899> running<00:01:45.079> a

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
makes sense probably if you're running a

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.840 
makes sense probably if you're running a
steam<00:01:45.500> box<00:01:45.680> you're<00:01:45.829> going<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.009> go<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.520> single

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
steam box you're going to go to a single

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.209 
steam box you're going to go to a single
display<00:01:47.030> anyways<00:01:47.539> and<00:01:47.780> probably<00:01:48.380> not<00:01:48.770> 4k<00:01:49.070> I'm

just<00:01:51.950> my<00:01:52.100> experience<00:01:52.340> with<00:01:52.789> Linux<00:01:53.060> gaming

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
just my experience with Linux gaming

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.260 
just my experience with Linux gaming
it's<00:01:53.390> not<00:01:53.539> as<00:01:53.750> good<00:01:54.020> as<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.710> pc<00:01:55.219> but<00:01:55.460> i<00:01:55.700> think<00:01:56.149> one

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
it's not as good as a pc but i think one

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.060 
it's not as good as a pc but i think one
of<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.420> benefits<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.930> steam<00:01:57.200> boxes<00:01:57.890> in

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
of the benefits of steam boxes in

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.980 
of the benefits of steam boxes in
general<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.610> steamos<00:01:58.909> in<00:01:59.210> general<00:01:59.479> as<00:01:59.630> you

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
general and steamos in general as you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.050 
general and steamos in general as you
can<00:02:00.140> basically<00:02:00.259> stream<00:02:00.829> PC<00:02:01.340> games<00:02:01.729> from<00:02:01.909> your

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
can basically stream PC games from your

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.940 
can basically stream PC games from your
main<00:02:02.240> system<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.869> this<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:03.259> think<00:02:03.799> that's

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
main system to this I think that's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.649 
main system to this I think that's
awesome<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:04.609> basically<00:02:04.909> if<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.210> guys<00:02:05.359> have<00:02:05.630> a

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
awesome so basically if you guys have a

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.120 
awesome so basically if you guys have a
TV<00:02:06.020> at<00:02:06.170> home<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.590> want<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.799> be<00:02:06.829> able<00:02:06.920> to

MVC you'll be able to stream through

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.220 
MVC you'll be able to stream through
your<00:02:14.970> network<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.050> my

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
your network to do that so my

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.870 
your network to do that so my
experimentation<00:02:16.710> with<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.100> was<00:02:17.280> awesome<00:02:17.790> i

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
experimentation with that was awesome i

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.000 
experimentation with that was awesome i
ran<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.270> much<00:02:18.750> slower<00:02:18.960> laptop<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.890> is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
ran it on a much slower laptop this is

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.100 
ran it on a much slower laptop this is
going<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> be<00:02:20.340> much<00:02:20.760> much<00:02:21.390> better<00:02:21.690> than<00:02:21.990> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
going to be much much better than the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.330 
going to be much much better than the
laptop<00:02:22.440> right<00:02:22.560> right<00:02:22.710> exactly<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.250> do

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
laptop right right exactly you can do

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.700 
laptop right right exactly you can do
swimming<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:24.060> use<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.720> dedicated<00:02:24.990> system<00:02:25.530> right

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
swimming or use a dedicated system right

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.130 
swimming or use a dedicated system right
