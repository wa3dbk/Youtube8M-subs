they have a piece that comes attaching
here<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.970> go<00:01:21.060> goes<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.750> across<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.890> top<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
here and go goes right across the top of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
here and go goes right across the top of
this<00:01:23.369> goggles<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.150> gonna<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.619> circle<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
this goggles so it's gonna be circle and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.940 
this goggles so it's gonna be circle and
then<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.939> line<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.900> comes<00:01:28.200> around<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.799> where

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
then a line that comes around here where

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.429 
then a line that comes around here where
it's<00:01:29.070> gonna<00:01:29.189> sort<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> wrap<00:01:29.729> around<00:01:29.840> his<00:01:30.840> head

it's gonna sort of wrap around his head

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.160 
it's gonna sort of wrap around his head
so<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.220> makes<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> top<00:01:33.119> edge<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.840> his

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
bolts here one on each side of this and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.969 
bolts here one on each side of this and
then<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.899> rest<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.740> sort

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
then the rest is just going to be sort

his<00:03:59.209> his<00:03:59.630> face<00:03:59.840> just<00:03:59.870> comes<00:04:00.290> straight<00:04:00.860> down

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
his his face just comes straight down

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.000 
his his face just comes straight down
the<00:04:02.269> side<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.630> open<00:04:02.780> mouth<00:04:03.080> on<00:04:03.380> both<00:04:03.650> sides

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
the side is open mouth on both sides

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.390 
the side is open mouth on both sides
stir<00:04:04.820> right<00:04:05.030> down<00:04:05.330> and<00:04:06.010> then<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.130> box

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
stir right down and then the box

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.710 
stir right down and then the box
it's<00:04:08.549> gonna<00:04:08.700> fix<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.180> line<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.360> little<00:04:09.480> bit

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
it's gonna fix that line a little bit

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.319 
it's gonna fix that line a little bit
then<00:04:10.470> we<00:04:10.709> have<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:10.950> box<00:04:11.250> coming<00:04:11.760> straight

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
then we have the box coming straight

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.929 
then we have the box coming straight
over<00:04:12.390> like<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:14.250> then<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:14.459> have<00:04:14.670> his

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
over like this and so then we have his

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.999 
over like this and so then we have his
ears<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.629> they<00:04:15.689> really<00:04:16.109> go<00:04:16.259> out<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> side

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
ears and they really go out to the side

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.340 
ears and they really go out to the side
so<00:04:17.430> right<00:04:18.209> here<00:04:18.570> we're<00:04:18.780> gonna<00:04:18.870> have<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.169> ear

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
so right here we're gonna have the ear

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.890 
so right here we're gonna have the ear
pointing<00:04:19.889> like<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.729> then<00:04:21.389> curving

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
pointing like this and then curving

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.290 
pointing like this and then curving
under<00:04:22.019> here<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:23.039> same<00:04:23.850> thing<00:04:23.880> on<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.270> other

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
under here and same thing on the other

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.379 
under here and same thing on the other
side<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:25.050> ear<00:04:25.259> kind<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:26.100> coming<00:04:26.400> out<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
side the ear kind of coming out to the

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.430 
side the ear kind of coming out to the
side<00:04:27.660> like<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.729> then<00:04:29.810> down<00:04:30.810> like<00:04:31.229> that

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
side like this and then down like that

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.580 
side like this and then down like that
so<00:04:31.979> on<00:04:32.759> this<00:04:32.970> year<00:04:33.150> we<00:04:33.300> can<00:04:33.389> see<00:04:33.449> the<00:04:33.750> top<00:04:34.050> and

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
so on this year we can see the top and

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.050 
so on this year we can see the top and
will<00:04:34.740> be<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.860> bit<00:04:35.039> of<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.220> shadow<00:04:35.520> underneath

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
will be a bit of a shadow underneath

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
will be a bit of a shadow underneath
like<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:38.520> on<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:39.120> side<00:04:39.300> same<00:04:39.630> thing<00:04:39.660> will

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
like so and on this side same thing will

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.990 
like so and on this side same thing will
draw<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.259> little<00:04:40.440> line<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.710> show<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.580> top<00:04:41.789> edge

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
draw a little line to show the top edge

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.640 
draw a little line to show the top edge
and<00:04:42.750> then<00:04:43.199> here<00:04:44.039> all<00:04:45.030> right<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.570> these<00:04:46.320> are<00:04:46.380> all

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
and then here all right so these are all

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.370 
and then here all right so these are all
of<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.160> facial<00:04:47.490> features<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:48.510> our<00:04:48.720> box<00:04:49.020> carrot

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
of the facial features of our box carrot

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.020 
of the facial features of our box carrot
roll<00:04:49.560> now<00:04:49.800> this<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.130> going<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.310> look<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.910> lot

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
roll now this is going to look a lot

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.580 
roll now this is going to look a lot
better<00:04:51.210> in<00:04:51.449> color<00:04:51.690> because<00:04:51.990> that's<00:04:52.320> what

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
better in color because that's what

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.850 
better in color because that's what
brings<00:04:52.860> this<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.880> character<00:04:54.389> more<00:04:54.660> into<00:04:55.020> into

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
brings this to character more into into

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.279 
brings this to character more into into
life<00:04:56.100> was<00:04:56.580> once<00:04:57.090> we<00:04:57.270> have<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.570> colors<00:04:57.900> added

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
life was once we have the colors added

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.800 
life was once we have the colors added

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
the back of the box is farther away

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.990 
the back of the box is farther away
which<00:05:03.449> means<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:04.020> it's<00:05:04.139> also<00:05:04.940> I'm<00:05:05.940> just

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
two there so I just drew a sketch line

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.089 
two there so I just drew a sketch line
it<00:05:14.010> wasn't<00:05:14.280> really<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:15.270> final<00:05:15.780> lines<00:05:16.099> and

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
it wasn't really the final lines and

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.800 
it wasn't really the final lines and
that<00:05:17.760> looks<00:05:18.030> pretty<00:05:18.240> good

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
that looks pretty good

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.960
