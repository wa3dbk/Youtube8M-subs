here's your bolt just here if you undo
this<00:00:11.090> bolt<00:00:12.309> move<00:00:13.309> you<00:00:13.490> push<00:00:13.700> rod<00:00:13.940> forward<00:00:14.450> out

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
this bolt move you push rod forward out

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.109 
this bolt move you push rod forward out
of<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:14.990> way<00:00:15.139> just<00:00:15.440> push<00:00:16.129> it<00:00:16.280> to<00:00:16.309> one<00:00:16.490> side<00:00:16.520> it

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
of the way just push it to one side it

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.820 
of the way just push it to one side it
up<00:00:17.270> does<00:00:17.480> have<00:00:17.660> one<00:00:18.140> side<00:00:18.470> over<00:00:18.800> here

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
up does have one side over here

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.990 
up does have one side over here
somewhere<00:00:21.010> is<00:00:22.010> you<00:00:22.310> have<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.460> part<00:00:22.760> of<00:00:22.849> your

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
somewhere is you have a part of your

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.560 
push rod put it all forwards the sticker
clamp<00:00:29.179> on<00:00:29.359> it<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:29.720> doesn't<00:00:29.779> move<00:00:30.109> back<00:00:31.570> then

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
clamp on it so it doesn't move back then

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.940 
clamp on it so it doesn't move back then
we'll<00:00:32.750> just<00:00:32.990> move<00:00:33.170> around<00:00:33.320> to<00:00:33.620> veer<00:00:33.920> the

it if it hasn't once you put a new
coupling<00:01:39.380> back<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.770> make<00:01:40.190> sure<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.490> got<00:01:40.610> their

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
coupling back on make sure you got their

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.499 
coupling back on make sure you got their
wire<00:01:41.170> slung<00:01:42.170> through<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.530> bolt<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.509> pull

wire slung through the bolt and pull

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.480 
wire slung through the bolt and pull
around<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.869> top<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.259> coupling<00:01:45.680> just<00:01:46.310> make

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
around the top of the coupling just make

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.010 
around the top of the coupling just make
sure<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.700> bolt<00:01:46.970> doesn't<00:01:47.180> come<00:01:47.479> undone<00:01:47.810> while

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
sure the bolt doesn't come undone while

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.130 
sure the bolt doesn't come undone while
you're<00:01:48.140> traveling<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:50.420> got<00:01:50.570> your<00:01:50.690> two<00:01:50.810> Gators

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
you're traveling you got your two Gators

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.410 
you're traveling you got your two Gators
here<00:01:51.619> as<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:52.130> can<00:01:52.160> see<00:01:52.280> minor<00:01:52.759> pouched

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
here as you can see minor pouched

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.330 
here as you can see minor pouched
got<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.170> buy<00:01:54.320> some<00:01:54.530> new<00:01:54.560> ones<00:01:54.830> before<00:01:55.130> I

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
got to buy some new ones before I

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.639 
got to buy some new ones before I
ordered<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.820> coupling<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.050> gonna<00:01:57.440> have<00:01:57.530> to

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
ordered the coupling so gonna have to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.649 
ordered the coupling so gonna have to
make<00:01:57.800> blue<00:01:58.009> for<00:01:58.220> now<00:01:58.310> as<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:59.300> old<00:01:59.450> one

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
make blue for now as the old one

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.710 
make blue for now as the old one
completely<00:02:00.140> disintegrated<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.390> can<00:02:02.539> see

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
completely disintegrated and you can see

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.290 
completely disintegrated and you can see
the<00:02:02.840> shaft<00:02:03.280> make<00:02:04.280> sure<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.610> crease<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.000> shaft

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
the shaft make sure you crease the shaft

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.770 
the shaft make sure you crease the shaft
up<00:02:05.479> before<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.869> put<00:02:06.020> your<00:02:06.140> new<00:02:06.340> Gators<00:02:07.340> on<00:02:07.780> is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
up before you put your new Gators on is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.070 
up before you put your new Gators on is
from<00:02:09.319> Gator<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.840> one's<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.910> intact<00:02:14.080> by

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
from Gator that one's just intact by

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.880 
from Gator that one's just intact by
Skinner<00:02:15.530> its<00:02:15.739> teeth<00:02:17.019> I'd<00:02:18.019> replace<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.739> as

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
Skinner its teeth I'd replace that as

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.590 
Skinner its teeth I'd replace that as
well<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.280> will<00:02:19.610> do<00:02:19.790> next<00:02:20.030> time

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.650 

there<00:02:24.350> we<00:02:24.470> go
