2160<00:00:12.620> we're<00:00:13.620> gonna<00:00:13.740> see<00:00:13.950> how<00:00:14.100> the<00:00:14.160> note<00:00:14.400> 3

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
2160 we're gonna see how the note 3

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.540 
2160 we're gonna see how the note 3
handles<00:00:15.090> ultra<00:00:15.960> high-definition<00:00:16.550> video

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
handles ultra high-definition video

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.109 
handles ultra high-definition video
recording<00:00:19.369> obviously<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> screen<00:00:20.759> itself

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
recording obviously the screen itself

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.069 
recording obviously the screen itself
can<00:00:21.269> only<00:00:21.390> display<00:00:21.929> at<00:00:22.230> 1080p<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.779> we'll<00:00:24.960> have

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
can only display at 1080p so we'll have

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.779 
can only display at 1080p so we'll have
to<00:00:25.199> watch<00:00:25.349> this<00:00:25.560> back<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.009> high<00:00:26.579> aspect

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
to watch this back on a high aspect

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.540 
to watch this back on a high aspect
screen<00:00:27.349> but<00:00:28.349> certainly<00:00:28.679> the<00:00:28.890> autofocus<00:00:29.339> is

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
screen but certainly the autofocus is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.630 
screen but certainly the autofocus is
doing<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.939> good<00:00:30.869> job<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.289> far<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.490> just

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
doing a good job so far and I'm just

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.730 
doing a good job so far and I'm just
gonna<00:00:32.730> tap<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.090> screen<00:00:33.290> no<00:00:34.290> real<00:00:34.470> difference

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
gonna tap the screen no real difference

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.070 
gonna tap the screen no real difference
whatsoever<00:00:35.310> there<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.240> autofocus<00:00:36.870> doing<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
whatsoever there so autofocus doing a

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.470 
whatsoever there so autofocus doing a
good<00:00:37.200> job<00:00:37.260> let's<00:00:38.130> see<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.400> can<00:00:38.550> move<00:00:39.270> over

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
good job let's see if we can move over

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.240 
good job let's see if we can move over
have<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.900> look<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.350> bed<00:00:40.680> our<00:00:40.950> flowers<00:00:43.250> again

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
have a look at a bed our flowers again

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.220 
have a look at a bed our flowers again
autofocus<00:00:44.910> seems<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.720> be<00:00:45.840> doing<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.050> good<00:00:46.170> job

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
autofocus seems to be doing a good job

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.740 
autofocus seems to be doing a good job
I'm<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.830> to<00:00:46.860> tap<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.130> screen<00:00:47.480> no<00:00:48.480> real

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
I'm just going to tap the screen no real

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.870 
I'm just going to tap the screen no real
difference<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:51.980> I'll<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.220> see<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.700> we<00:00:53.760> can

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
difference there I'll do see if we can

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.500 
difference there I'll do see if we can
walk<00:00:54.060> over<00:00:54.830> to<00:00:55.830> a<00:00:55.860> piece<00:00:56.310> of<00:00:56.550> timber<00:00:56.850> see<00:00:57.270> how

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
walk over to a piece of timber see how

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.870 
walk over to a piece of timber see how
well<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.810> autofocuses<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:59.400> see<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.700> we<00:00:59.730> can

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
well it autofocuses then see if we can

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.929 
well it autofocuses then see if we can
get<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> texture<00:01:00.510> across<00:01:00.900> there

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.820 

seems<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.780> doing<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> good<00:01:07.290> job<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.590> us

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
seems to be doing a good job with us

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
seems to be doing a good job with us
focusing<00:01:08.310> okay<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.270> gonna<00:01:09.420> top<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
focusing okay but I'm just gonna top the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.850 
focusing okay but I'm just gonna top the
screen<00:01:11.390> yeah<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.630> didn't<00:01:12.960> work<00:01:13.259> so<00:01:13.290> well<00:01:13.619> there

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
screen yeah it didn't work so well there

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.219 
screen yeah it didn't work so well there
did<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> tapping<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.729> screen<00:01:14.850> did<00:01:15.630> focus<00:01:16.080> in

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
did it tapping the screen did focus in

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.760 
did it tapping the screen did focus in
slightly<00:01:16.799> better<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:17.970> using<00:01:18.869> autofocus

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
slightly better then use using autofocus

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.149 
slightly better then use using autofocus
alone<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> give<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:22.020> idea<00:01:22.259> we've

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
alone and just to give you an idea we've

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.609 
alone and just to give you an idea we've
used<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.790> minute<00:01:24.299> 25<00:01:24.840> seconds<00:01:25.350> worth<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
used one minute 25 seconds worth of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.600 
used one minute 25 seconds worth of
video<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:26.100> we're<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.960> 487<00:01:27.960> megabytes<00:01:29.509> and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
video now we're up to 487 megabytes and

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
video now we're up to 487 megabytes and
just<00:01:32.610> getting<00:01:32.850> close<00:01:33.149> up<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.509> tree's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
just getting close up of this tree's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.230 
just getting close up of this tree's
leaves<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:37.280> they<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.340> look<00:01:38.700> good<00:01:38.759> I'm<00:01:39.060> just

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
leaves here they do look good I'm just

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
leaves here they do look good I'm just
going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.390> tap<00:01:39.569> on<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.720> screen<00:01:40.520> yeah

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
going to tap on the screen yeah

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.999 
going to tap on the screen yeah
autofocus<00:01:42.090> did<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> good<00:01:42.420> job<00:01:42.479> there<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.050> see

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
autofocus did a good job there and see

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
autofocus did a good job there and see
if<00:01:44.069> we<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.399> their<00:01:44.550> texture<00:01:44.940> across<00:01:45.210> by

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
if we can get their texture across by

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.469 
if we can get their texture across by
this<00:01:45.720> bench<00:01:46.369> that<00:01:47.369> comes<00:01:47.580> across<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.090> 4k

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
this bench that comes across in this 4k

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.200 
this bench that comes across in this 4k
video<00:01:51.860> tapping<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> screen<00:01:53.039> had<00:01:53.819> no<00:01:54.030> real

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
video tapping the screen had no real

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.430 
video tapping the screen had no real
effect<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.750> autofocus<00:01:55.619> doing<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.860> good<00:01:55.979> job

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
effect this autofocus doing a good job

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.719 
effect this autofocus doing a good job
and<00:01:58.440> let's<00:01:58.799> see<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.039> can<00:01:59.159> use<00:01:59.399> some<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and let's see if you can use some of the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.359 
and let's see if you can use some of the
zoom<00:02:00.259> capabilities<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.440> here<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.860> those

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
zoom capabilities in here on those

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.350 
zoom capabilities in here on those
flying<00:02:02.729> anvils

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.350 

so<00:02:06.360> we're<00:02:06.740> 2.5<00:02:07.740> zoom<00:02:08.039> levels<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.489> there<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so we're 2.5 zoom levels in there and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.830 
so we're 2.5 zoom levels in there and
we'll<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.289> all<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> way<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:12.600> looks

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
we'll go all the way for that looks

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.870 
we'll go all the way for that looks
pretty<00:02:13.019> good<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.500> be<00:02:13.530> fair<00:02:13.799> no<00:02:14.700> real

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
pretty good to be fair no real

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.850 
pretty good to be fair no real
pixelation<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.810> some<00:02:16.049> blurriness<00:02:16.650> but

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
pixelation that is some blurriness but

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.509 
pixelation that is some blurriness but
very<00:02:17.790> little<00:02:18.030> compared<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.930> other<00:02:19.200> cameras<00:02:19.709> so
