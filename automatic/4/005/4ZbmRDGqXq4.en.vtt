good eye folks I just figured since I'm

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.880 
good eye folks I just figured since I'm
replacing<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:03.840> busted<00:00:04.200> Mouse<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.620> might<00:00:04.770> as

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
replacing and busted Mouse I might as

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.289 
replacing and busted Mouse I might as
well<00:00:04.920> actually<00:00:05.130> pulled<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.549> computer<00:00:05.970> out<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
well actually pulled a computer out and

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.480 
well actually pulled a computer out and
give<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.600> good<00:00:06.720> clean<00:00:07.020> up<00:00:07.250> this<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.400> the

give it a good clean up this is the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.070 
give it a good clean up this is the
workshop<00:00:08.820> computer<00:00:09.210> by<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.389> way<00:00:09.630> so<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
workshop computer by the way so the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.549 
workshop computer by the way so the
dusting<00:00:10.500> side<00:00:10.769> he<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:10.980> pretty<00:00:11.309> bad<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:12.410> clean<00:00:13.410> it

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
dusting side he is pretty bad I clean it

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.090 
dusting side he is pretty bad I clean it
on<00:00:13.650> average<00:00:14.219> maybe<00:00:14.429> every<00:00:14.580> six<00:00:14.969> months<00:00:16.100> then

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
on average maybe every six months then

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.230 
on average maybe every six months then
how<00:00:17.250> long<00:00:17.279> has<00:00:17.490> been<00:00:17.609> since<00:00:17.820> I've<00:00:17.970> done<00:00:18.090> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
how long has been since I've done it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.140 
how long has been since I've done it
which<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> pretty<00:00:19.590> filthy<00:00:20.000> it's<00:00:21.000> not<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
which is a pretty filthy it's not a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.820

stringy<00:00:21.539> dust<00:00:21.869> bike<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.380> inside<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
stringy dust bike you get inside the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.140 
stringy dust bike you get inside the
house<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.519> fine

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
house it's this fine

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
modules tiny little power supply but

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.929 
modules tiny little power supply but
they're<00:01:11.790> doing<00:01:11.939> pretty<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:13.610> this<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.760> what

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
they're doing pretty well this is what

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 
they're doing pretty well this is what
one<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> about<00:01:15.390> 50<00:01:15.810> computers<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.350> got<00:01:16.530> for

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
one of about 50 computers so I got for

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.840 
one of about 50 computers so I got for
scrap<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> only<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.670> had<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
scrap but it was the only one that had a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.910 
scrap but it was the only one that had a
mainboard<00:01:18.330> still<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.750> US<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.560> had<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> pay

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
mainboard still in US and I had to pay

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.760 
mainboard still in US and I had to pay
for<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:21.020> that's<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> way<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.409> scrap

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
for this one but that's the way to scrap

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
for this one but that's the way to scrap
business<00:01:23.159> guys<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.640> good<00:01:23.820> stuff<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.270> bad

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
business guys you get good stuff and bad

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.170 
business guys you get good stuff and bad
stuff<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> definitely<00:01:26.640> needs<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.970> coin

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
stuff so that definitely needs a coin

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420 
stuff so that definitely needs a coin
I'll<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.229> low<00:01:28.710> pressure<00:01:29.009> compressed

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
I'll use like low pressure compressed

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
I'll use like low pressure compressed
air<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> quick<00:01:31.320> quiet<00:01:31.500> whack<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> back

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
air with a quick quiet whack it back

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.380 
air with a quick quiet whack it back
together<00:01:32.280> again<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.869> go<00:01:34.939> times<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.119> strain

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
together again and go times of strain

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.460 
together again and go times of strain
I'm<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.689> giving<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> bit<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> wipe<00:01:37.409> damn

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
I'm just giving it a bit of a wipe damn

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.950 
I'm just giving it a bit of a wipe damn
tiny<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.740> compact

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
tiny little compact

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.110 
tiny little compact
again<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.860> hanging<00:01:44.430> some<00:01:44.610> scrap<00:01:44.880> from<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120
