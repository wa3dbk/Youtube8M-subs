00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hi everyone how about in today's video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.210
 I made this cardboard furniture super 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.519
 practical that is a sofa desk 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.440
 we can use it for various things like 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.420
 to use our tablets or to 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.860
 use the keyboard and the mouse since the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.719
 The design is ergonomic and very 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 comfortable allows us to even cross 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.010
 legs and have the wrists of a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.210
 relaxed position and not having to be 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.160
 strength in the neck for example if 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.359
 we want to read for a while or even to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.830
 use the laptop in one position 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.330
 proper took a lot of time 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.070
 looking for a piece of furniture like that and how I have not 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
 found in the end I decided to do it 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.759
 under the video myself I will let 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.250
 all the materials that I will use 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.780
 and also the specifications with the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.460
 measures and everything that is needed to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 that you can do well the furniture these 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.120
 are all the pieces that we are going to use 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.399
 to create it is only work to measure 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.190
 cut and paste are two pieces for the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.739
 table top two diagonal legs for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.020
 the top table two pieces for the table 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.600
 lower 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.730
 and two legs under the video I leave you 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.040
 as assembled all these pieces for 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.200
 that you see it in detail here I have my 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.940
 planes as I imagined them so 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.940
 I'm going to start measuring to mark and cut 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.470
 I'm going to make marks and then I'm going to 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 join them with a rule 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:20.300
 [Music] 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.940
 then you just have to cut 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.870
 with a cutter 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.700
 [Music] 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.380
 let's prepare all the pieces that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.230
 we need 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.060
 [Music] 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.010
 the cardboard that I am using has these 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 thicknesses the stiffer the better 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.360
 I already have all the pieces cut and 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.700
 ready to glue them together I've cut 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.830
 four sheets of these four of these 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.930
 here there are five for the legs of the table 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.930
 bottom and six legs for the big one 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.850
 ah 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.720
 [Music] 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.369
 next we match the edges of 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.960
 the plates that we have attached so that 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.960
 remain the same with a sandpaper 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.650
 Now we are going to start creating the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.670
 structure let's make some slots 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.180
 so that they fit together 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.489
 [Music] 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.959
 we mark where we want the slot so much 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.959
 on the table as in the leg 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.720
 [Music] 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.310
 we make the drawing of the table following 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.600
 the shape of the leg that is wider 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.600
 because it has three sheets of cardboard 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.090
 [Music] 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.670
 and then we mark the shape of the table 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.380
 that only has two sheets on the leg 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.380
 [Music] 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.410
 we cut back and that's how it looks when 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:58.310
 we fit 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:02.110
 [Music] 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.110
 we will do the same the bottom table 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.530
 on this structure will go the covers 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.180
 so you can imagine 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.980
 put hot silicone and assemble it 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.690
 everything we put more silicone in the joints 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.459
 to make it stronger we press 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.230
 until it dries you have to be quick 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.390
 since the silicone dries very very 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.579
 we will quickly create a lattice 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.560
 to give more tightness to the tops now 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.909
 let's cut cardboard strips 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.909
 size that I indicated in the plans 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.110
 the cardboard cut has to look like this 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.120
 [Music] 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.800
 with the silicone stick the strips of that 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:53.390
 shape at the base 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:55.280
 [Music] 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.380
 for the lower table we are also going to 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.450
 stick slats on the side so 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.550
 join the leg of the small table with the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.270
 leg of the big table and so be all 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.270
 united structure 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:13.170
 [Music] 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.840
 they have to be of the same size 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.579
 but sanding to match we check 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.579
 that goes well and we stick it with silicone 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.840
 i 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.330
 we can also put silicone in 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.000
 together 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.160
 [Music] 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.060
 now we put white glue on the part 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.060
 superior of the april 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.440
 and on the sides we're going to put some 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.410
 silicone stitches to bind it this what 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.930
 we are going to do so that it stays fixed and 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.710
 tail eventually dries out is 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.160
 go joining everything well 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.780
 [Music] 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.250
 we can put more silicone in the 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.040
 side so that everything stays well 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.870
 glued 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.430
 and now with masking tape what 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.710
 we're going to do is seal all the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:11.800
 joints and all edges 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:15.659
 [Music] 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.659
 we already have the entire structure assembled 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.660
 now let's reinforce a little we are going to 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.310
 Mix water and ccoo half and half and 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.410
 we are applying on the table with a 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.000
 brush and we're going to hit 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.780
 paper cuttings putting mix 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.780
 also above 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.560
 although it seems hard the truth that 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.940
 it's done pretty quickly we let it 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.280
 dry and if we want we can give another 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.200
 layer more 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.990
 in the visible part what we are going to put 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.420
 it's kraft paper we mark the shape with the 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.950
 table and we queue all the 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.969
 surface and we are paying the paper 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.889
 smoothing what 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.260
 let's let it dry and that's how 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.060
 it has to be 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.130
 when you say the reform of my room I 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.230
 It left quite a lot of primer so I'm going to 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.240
 take advantage if you do not have directly 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:04.180
 you can use wood paint 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.610
 once dry I will give the finishes 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.340
 end I will use paint with effect 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.020
 metallic pearly for the sides and 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.330
 white paint for wood 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.130
 surface the decoration is something like that more 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.180
 I recommend that you adapt it to 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.060
 your decoration of your living room and using 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.710
 the same color ranges or details or 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.150
 what you have now I'm going to do guilt 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.620
 with napkin cutout that does not 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.630
 only with the part of the drawing of the 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.310
 napkin and I'm going to cut out respect is 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.830
 that I like more to decorate it 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.900
 I place the cutouts to my liking and with a 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.280
 mix of two parts of water for one of 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.810
 White glue 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.900
 I'll go sticking carefully to avoid 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.040
 it breaks 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.930
 [Music] 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.700
 let's let it dry completely 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.680
 and we'll end up applying varnish that I'm going to 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.680
 use it in spray 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.210
 [Music] 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.110
 Well, we have our 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.110
 sofa desk 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.740
 ah 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:03.660
 It is super practical as you see 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.940
 [Music] 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.770
 I already tell you that under this video you

 I leave all the information I hope that you 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.670
 have liked my creation and if so, not 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.590
