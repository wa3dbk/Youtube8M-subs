00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.920
 So current temperature minus 6 degrees and I go out now for the 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.130
 Car wash. 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:23.600
 So hello here is DrDuu and if the car is so icy, then you can unfortunately 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 do not wash. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.310
 It must be ice-free at best under the carport. 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.839
 Because otherwise spray the remedy on the ice and it does not thaw immediately. 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.640
 So here we have the winter detergent. 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 I'm heavily masked, because it is just cold as an ass. 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.730
 Wintertime Cleaner from the company mycleaner. which is to use for plus 5 and minus 15 degrees. 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.710
 We now have minus 6 degrees and will now test it. 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.289
 So the technique is as in my first video, that is, spray loose, 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.949
 not too much and not too little, then the dirt with a cloth will take away, 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.510
 You have two towels, one for the dirt and one for polishing. 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.390
 You see, it does not freeze and that at minus 6 degrees, even on the cold glass 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.360
 there are no problems. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.370
 Nice with the microfiber cloth to remove the dirt. 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.150
 So you can already see the difference. 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.250
 Especially at the tailgate of the Yeti is always extremely dirty. 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.450
 So and now is polished with the second cloth. 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.030
 The polishing itself is a little more tiring, because the wax is harder in the cold and 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.040
 you just need more power. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.470
 So it is not as fast leaking from the hand as in the summer or at positive temperatures. 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.730
 But you can already see the effect of how good the car looks the same. 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:02:03.570
 So it goes on down here on the tailgate. 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.140
 Spray it again. 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.730
 It takes about 200 to 250ml at warm temperatures. 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.760
 In winter, the car is dirtier, because you certainly need a little more. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.900
 I think so 400 to 450ml for a complete cleaning. 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:31.030
 So I would also clean only parts of the car, like the tailgate. 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:40.480
 I would not wash the whole car. 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.100
 Sp perfectly clean, you see how it shines and shines. 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.370
 So you can hardly achieve a better result. 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.650
 So now it goes on here. 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.360
 Here's really dirt on the side. 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.160
 I wanted to show you how quickly the dirt dissolves. 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.030
 As I said, it is minus 6 degrees, the car is driven by rain and the dirt is 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.030
 frozen here. 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:37.959
 We spray just up and take it relatively easy with the microfiber cloth again 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:51.209
 path. 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:04:08.920
 So just polish quickly, and always only the area that you cleaned 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.080
 has, is clear. 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.470
 You see the difference, how dirty the car is. 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.090
 I chose this corner extra again. 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.379
 Car washing below zero degrees, there is no car wash, you do not need fear 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:25.550
 have frozen doors, because you wash so without water, the rubber seals are even 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.550
 not affected. 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.379
 So the ideal solution in the winter to quickly clean the car. 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.659
 So now we come to Mini, here is all iced. 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.289
 I wanted to try it again anyway. 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.630
 As you can see. 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.040
 I just spray it all up. It is relatively easy, but you have to 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.620
 of course push the ice here stronger. 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.569
 Is not so ideal, better is the car is ice-free. 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.150
 But it also works, that means, if you have a dirty bumper and you say 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.400
 I just want to clean it, then you just plaster parts of the car. 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.919
 So polish fast, then you'll see how he shines again. 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.979
 As I said in the cold, I would only wash parts of the car. 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:16.389
 Since you have to be very badly motivated, the fingers start to freeze, so far 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:26.129
 My conclusion is that the remedy is perfect, but the 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:33.330
 Motivation must be right.
