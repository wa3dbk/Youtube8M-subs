here<00:00:45.500> see<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.219> I'm<00:00:47.399> gonna<00:00:47.520> cut<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820

right<00:00:47.910> there<00:00:49.910> about<00:00:50.910> 24<00:00:51.420> inches<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.260> about

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
right there about 24 inches is about

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.099 
right there about 24 inches is about
enough<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.629> a<00:00:54.629> large<00:00:55.850> room<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.750> I

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
enough to make a large room so I

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
enough to make a large room so I
actually<00:01:01.109> bought<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> medium<00:01:02.039> rounds<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.699> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
actually bought a medium rounds but I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.649 
actually bought a medium rounds but I
think<00:01:02.969> it'll<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.329> enough<00:01:04.339> 12<00:01:05.339> inches<00:01:06.299> would<00:01:06.540> be

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
think it'll be enough 12 inches would be

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.070 
think it'll be enough 12 inches would be
enough<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:06.900> small<00:01:07.260> rows<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:09.080> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
enough for small rows so what you do is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
enough for small rows so what you do is
you<00:01:10.650> roll<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.310> end<00:01:12.619> into<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> small<00:01:14.490> little

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you roll the end into a small little

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
you roll the end into a small little
stem<00:01:15.180> might<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.990> better<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.710> your

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
stem might be better if you what your

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:33.280 
stem might be better if you what your
finger<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:19.040> keep<00:01:20.040> rolling

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.710 

until<00:01:34.160> you<00:01:34.310> reach<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.940> end<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.120> that<00:01:35.270> corner

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
until you reach the end of that corner

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.850 
until you reach the end of that corner
so<00:01:36.470> now<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:36.710> flip<00:01:37.370> it<00:01:37.400> around<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:39.830> just

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
so now you flip it around and you just

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.780 
so now you flip it around and you just
fold<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.580> little<00:01:40.910> while<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.120> little<00:01:41.660> bit<00:01:41.990> back<00:01:42.380> so

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
fold a little while a little bit back so

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.870 
fold a little while a little bit back so
now<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:43.940> got<00:01:44.180> your<00:01:44.720> first<00:01:44.930> hole<00:01:45.260> now<00:01:46.130> using

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
now you got your first hole now using

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.010 
now you got your first hole now using

to put this on something flat

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.380

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
short but and put some wide tape on it

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.229 
short but and put some wide tape on it
here<00:03:39.680> I'll<00:03:39.860> show<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:42.520> it's<00:03:43.520> better<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.000> wider

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
here I'll show you it's better the wider

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.810 
here I'll show you it's better the wider
this<00:03:44.630> this<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.020> fairly<00:03:45.440> thin<00:03:45.800> tape<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:46.760> it

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
this this is fairly thin tape so it

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.350 
this this is fairly thin tape so it
won't<00:03:47.030> work<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.239> well<00:03:47.980> now<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.880> find<00:03:50.180> the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
won't work that well now just find the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:04:00.250 
won't work that well now just find the
end<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.660> my<00:03:50.780> tape<00:03:51.080> here<00:03:57.250> there<00:03:58.250> we<00:03:58.340> go<00:03:59.230> so<00:04:00.230> now

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
end of my tape here there we go so now

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.810 
end of my tape here there we go so now
that<00:04:00.500> we've<00:04:00.709> got<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:00.950> end<00:04:01.100> of<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.310> tape<00:04:01.580> I

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
that we've got the end of the tape I

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.789 
that we've got the end of the tape I
think<00:04:02.570> I'll<00:04:02.660> need<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:02.989> use<00:04:03.110> two<00:04:03.350> pieces<00:04:03.769> of

think I'll need to use two pieces of

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.979 
think I'll need to use two pieces of
this<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:05.000> cut<00:04:05.239> fairly<00:04:05.510> short<00:04:05.959> pieces<00:04:07.989> but

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989

direction that's better I don't know

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.920 
direction that's better I don't know
depends<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.460> which<00:04:50.610> way<00:04:50.910> they're<00:04:51.180> left<00:04:51.390> books

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
depends on which way they're left books

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.970 
depends on which way they're left books
if<00:04:52.740> it's<00:04:52.920> too<00:04:53.130> stiff<00:04:53.490> take<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:53.850> little<00:04:54.540> more<00:04:54.630> off

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
if it's too stiff take a little more off

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.550 
if it's too stiff take a little more off
more<00:04:55.980> you<00:04:56.070> cut<00:04:56.250> off<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.670> less<00:04:56.880> alas<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:58.380> goes

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
more you cut off the less alas it goes

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.980 
more you cut off the less alas it goes
going<00:04:59.490> everywhere<00:05:02.450> just<00:05:05.810> careful<00:05:06.810> when<00:05:06.900> you

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
going everywhere just careful when you

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.540 
going everywhere just careful when you
put<00:05:07.170> your<00:05:07.290> finger<00:05:07.620> in<00:05:07.680> your<00:05:07.710> rose<00:05:07.980> or<00:05:08.280> else<00:05:08.430> you

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
put your finger in your rose or else you

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.390 
put your finger in your rose or else you
might<00:05:08.670> blot<00:05:09.060> in<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.740> I<00:05:10.860> think<00:05:11.070> I'll<00:05:11.190> put

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
might blot in it and I think I'll put

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:22.490 
might blot in it and I think I'll put
another<00:05:11.520> piece<00:05:12.060> right<00:05:20.930> yeah<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:21.960> think<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.320> cut

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
another piece right yeah I think I cut

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.200 
another piece right yeah I think I cut
that<00:05:22.620> part<00:05:23.190> too<00:05:23.370> well<00:05:23.790> that's<00:05:24.000> why<00:05:24.120> it's

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
that part too well that's why it's

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.470 
that part too well that's why it's
popping<00:05:24.540> up<00:05:24.630> but<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.530> here's<00:05:25.890> your<00:05:26.100> Rose<00:05:26.480> if
