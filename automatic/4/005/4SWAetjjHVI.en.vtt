00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
 Welcome speaking here is anderson and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:10.290
 Today I'll show you how 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.690
 find the color rgb code in a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.580
 Image 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.189
 here we have this image of the woodpecker 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.970
 in this image have some colors have 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.220
 orange red that is the beak here right? 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.220
 and it has green that are the eyes of the woodpecker 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.370
 I'll create an HTML page too. 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.290
 with a debt 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.520
 this debt is in the background 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.780
 Brown 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.969
 So I 'll get one of those things. 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.469
 which is in the image of the woodpecker and put 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.469
 as the backdrop to this debt 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.430
 I'll open the code from the north ask for more 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 more to show you how I like 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:14.390
 who hopes that in a program like that I 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.390
 I created the page 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.159
 good here 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.420
 here is the divicom 500 needle 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.780
 pixels height of 500 pixels also flat 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.079
 brown background and tackles with a pixel 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.970
 solid and black that is exactly that 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:43.380
 that image of the html document that I 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.360
 so I created for us to get some gives a 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.500
 of the colors in the image that people 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:58.860
 want to right click 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 and click on the park after the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.430
 father opening image that people click 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.490
 here in this selection tool 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.509
 Colors 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.979
 then we click on the agreement that people 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.690
 either in the case I wanted to color according the beak 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.670
 its the orange color here 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:24.300
 after clicking there we'll come here at 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:28.350
 color editor and in these three squares 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.710
 here are the three rgb colors that I can 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.580
 use on my html page 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.070
 the colors are 248 75 and 1 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.410
 so I 'll go there in the north ask more more 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:49.890
 in my html page document in 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:52.770
 code means in the background 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:03:00.410
 I raise the issue of values ​​in the 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.410
 rgb rgb format opens and closes parentheses 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:24.810
 enter digit the three values ​​248 248 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:31.260
 195 vehicles and 1195 and these three are 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:37.380
 values ​​of Korea gb than what 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:40.580
 corresponds to what corresponds to bi 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.580
 Nozzle fitting woodpecker 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.459
 so we save it here 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:59.780
 and reopen the html page and cut 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.490
 exactly the same as the color of the beak 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.490
 stick I selected that hour 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:12.080
 Well, that was the tip today. 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.820
 if you like who I like if you want to see 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.540
 more videos about computer science 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.620
 subscribe to the channel and until the 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.330

 Thank you so much for watching.
