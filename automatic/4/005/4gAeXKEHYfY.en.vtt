00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.180
 and 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.779
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.510
 for a video on a mobile phone 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.420
 the one plus one that I love to receive and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.890
 that I propose to unpack together 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.080
 so packaging very sober as you 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.680
 see but who's hiding inside 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.090
 something much more classy 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.250
 so far the most one for them for you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.780
 summarize it is to remind you of this 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 a phone that is found only on 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.590
 Internet 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.820
 for the moment on sale always moment 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.820
 where we speak on invitation 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.530
 so after packing in kraft carton 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.940
 classic we come across something 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.800
 much more fun a lot more 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:59.590
 classy very fine and right now 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.470
 we are from croatia and one more one 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.800
 exists in two versions currently of 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.780
 color so black sand and white sand 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.290
 so sand not that because of the back so we 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.990
 just seen 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.690
 it's time 16 giga and in 64 giga for 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.570
 the moment knowing that version 64 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.580
 gigas and a version at 299 euros 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.570
 so here we discover in his box the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.800
 phone the little extractor for 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.030
 enter the micro sim we'll see it all at 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.030
 the time the charging cable there 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.060
 and then and then and then and then and then 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.550
 then that's all so the phone is 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.390
 well the aesthetics is still pretty 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.170
 nice enough pretty well well done very well 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.720
 qualitative I find the surprising side 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.150
 that's what we said from the beginning it's 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.650
 this this grainy dock so there was a 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.140
 little bit of battery so it allows me 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.960
 to turn it on right away 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.320
 so as I said the granular back 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.030
 it is a finish that allows for will 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.740
 not hide it from the chip materials all 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.650
 while still relatively nice 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.840
 relatively well well finished the phone 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.120
 and end we are still on a 5 inches 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.660
 5 and he is very strong the screen is fine 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.660
 luminous 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.840
 that's the first impression that's when 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.670
 even a quality impression a see 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.740
 the granular surface 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.720
 so homogeneous because it turns 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.650
 obviously on cyanogen see the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:41.470
 buttons on the side 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:43.110
 the headphone connector and here we are at 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.780
 volume button 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.600
 and here then absolutely not see 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.200
 slot in which we introduce the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:57.200
 micro sim connecting Lille to the park 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.580
 big here for this veil more what 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.310
 so to get an idea anyway 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.180
 a 5.5 phone game will take our 3 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.440
 which is a 5 inches so is 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.209
 immediately we realize we are 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.390
 still on relatively details 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.760
 similar the note appears as being 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.080
 a bigger normal hair is a five 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.580
 sets as I just said ours 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.660
 clearly makes more cheap to he must 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.130
 must we say things like them 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.349
 so are as you saw I have 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.299
 synchronized my calendar very easily 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.120
 obviously also to our genes it works 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.510
 very very well see the thickness the 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.260
 difference in thickness has the advantage of 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.849
 one plus one the note is slightly more 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.480
 wide so again a screen 5 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.640
 inches is 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.120
 and then that's mostly the side 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.120
 cheap du no 3 which spring 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.430
 good question performance use on 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.930
 will see that a little bit later since 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.840
 I will play a little bit live with 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.310
 I'll put this on the website 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.680
 first contact we still remember one 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.769
 times for a phone at 299 euros 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.630
 in 64 giga the first contact is very 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.330
 very good me I'm a user a 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.040
 note for a very long time and I find 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.160
 already that first contact in terms 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.000
 of appearance is much more satisfactory 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.739
 much more rewarding 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.130
 it's much more rewarding as 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.130
 phone
