00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 ouch it all and this is reflected in 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.770
 a new shoe club indulge 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.120
 do this and in this video I you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.770
 showed a new class of arsenal 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.990
 who arrived so that's the class 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.219
 retired but in fact you will see 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.480
 it's a little weird because 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.679
 it's not really a real category 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.839
 you will see that right away 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.890
 so I showed it right away in 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.199
 the arsenal so fucking exchangeable 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.180
 it's a little long sorting not scarcity 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.890
 and that's how you can see 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.359
 these two new categories interac 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.470
 have arrived these retirees it's cool 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.610
 ranked well what you want 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.579
 but in fact the concern is that how 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 you explain that it's not it does not break 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.700
 not it's not a new fact 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 category actually they moved some 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.450
 weapons and put them in a category 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.789
 for example a weapon body being recruits 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.100
 and well not catch him put it in 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.149
 retired instead of creating weapons of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.190
 stage equipment directly 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.680
 retired and precisely that I find 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.090
 quite well I do not understand at all 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.160
 had there are several purposes ah yes we're going 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.329
 say maybe ten days ago or a 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.579
 week I do not know I did not blunder 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.550
 and suddenly I wanted to do a ten 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.110
 options actually I do not understand I 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.290
 really no idea I wanted to know 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.610
 precisely that someone had the answer 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.350
 if you ever know if anyone knows 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 why they created pensioners have these 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.720
 deals 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.420
 it's not nice to see no but it's 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.860
 pretty weird look for example I 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.700
 remember that the strip band at the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.640
 mercenary I think it's a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.650
 professional 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.340
 yes besides I have double 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.040
 the exos this was visited this exo elite 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 now ben no they yielded exhorts to 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.300
 tapas why have I do not know 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.520
 why retirees and in red I know 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.710
 not the date are not so powerful that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.870
 salah me a bit the case for example the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 cup 45 to 3 he has less than one bench damage 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.150
 is no longer a shuffle between the damage the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.900
 handling me the choice is quickly done 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.350
 what do I take to show you 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.800
 other times very far from the fields 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.390
 all that was not retired and 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.250
 frankly there for once the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.500
 profession I have no answer I know 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.310
 not what to say and I know what I 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.090
 find it weird and I absolutely want 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.250
 know 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.890
 I try to find I do not have them 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.940
 easily if I hide to find 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.350
 I try to move forward but sometimes 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.420
 they have some pretty weird choices I have 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.130
 not read must be created two categories 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.940
 actually what bothers me what they like 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.740
 I say is that they created a 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.450
 new category but they took 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.680
 weapons that existed at least I would have 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.670
 preferred that there be a category with 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.459
 new weapons are was too much 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.720
 class and all that has given new 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.680
 from fees to games etc. of renewal and 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.200
 unfortunately now for example 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.630
 this gun if you see - inaccuracies 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.980
 more to take away 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.709
 yeah but I'm getting a little bit 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.750
 what and then good guy bah voila you 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.400
 look at shin guards moving units 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.459
 sentinel it was professional 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.350
 if it's the same mercer equipment from the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.700
 cover it was the professional of a 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.470
 long and so I really understand 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.970
 really not and then that's pretty good 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.800
 therefore as I could see my 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.450
 small elite weapons 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.970
 I'll make you play for those 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.890
 who saw my national elite classes 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.390
 I intend to make a video of it here 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.980
 that I told you I will do that all 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.670
 three four months so that would make a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.680
 video we're going to say three videos in 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.290
 the year that I started doing that in 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.580
 may or shocking so from may to september 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.190
 is the two videos to do and then and 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.520
 So here then these stories actually 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.690
 story of good harvest we will say 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.890
 armies debate simply reads on 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.620
 I really have a hard time having 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.810
 and finally on it's especially when I have 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.940
 so I have the chance that I have 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.500
 when I 'm really frankly it's 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.090
 shit 2 and I was really army devils 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.090
 the best that will say I'm 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.820
 prestige pose some prestige games 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:48.720
 to throws there the ball 27 inferno and we'll 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:53.370
 say the the liberation this idea that of 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.810
 well except that yes in addition to the case it is 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.910
 a little boring without problem his debut 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.830
 in selection I can assure you that the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.800

 man what do you think about it and 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.000
 do especially why they created 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.430
 this new category of one because 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.720
