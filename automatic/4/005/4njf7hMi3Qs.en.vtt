batteries staged a lot longer and

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.130 
batteries staged a lot longer and
they're<00:04:58.850> more<00:04:59.090> efficient<00:04:59.570> in<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.720> winter<00:04:59.960> and

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
they're more efficient in the winter and

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
put the top down and yet it's a hard

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.820 
put the top down and yet it's a hard
wall<00:06:07.410> shower<00:06:08.300> all<00:06:09.300> of<00:06:09.540> our<00:06:09.690> apex<00:06:10.110> is<00:06:10.290> now<00:06:10.470> all

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
wall shower all of our apex is now all

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.810 
wall shower all of our apex is now all
have<00:06:11.750> electric<00:06:12.750> control<00:06:13.620> tops<00:06:14.130> and<00:06:14.580> they're

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
have electric control tops and they're

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.860 
have electric control tops and they're
done<00:06:15.690> with<00:06:16.700> this<00:06:17.700> is<00:06:17.910> your<00:06:18.090> Jack<00:06:18.360> controller

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
done with this is your Jack controller

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.590 
done with this is your Jack controller
so<00:06:19.260> all<00:06:19.710> your<00:06:20.130> jacks<00:06:20.430> would<00:06:20.700> be<00:06:20.850> up<00:06:21.150> and<00:06:21.419> down

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
so all your jacks would be up and down

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.530 
so all your jacks would be up and down
here<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.290> this<00:06:22.440> is<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.860> controller<00:06:23.250> for<00:06:23.640> your

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
here and this is the controller for your

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.770 
here and this is the controller for your
top<00:06:24.810> so<00:06:25.169> if<00:06:25.320> you<00:06:25.440> want<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.680> let<00:06:25.770> your<00:06:25.950> top<00:06:26.160> down

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
top so if you want to let your top down

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.960 
top so if you want to let your top down
we<00:06:27.780> hit<00:06:27.990> those<00:06:28.430> well<00:06:29.430> that<00:06:29.669> means<00:06:29.880> you<00:06:30.120> can<00:06:30.270> see

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
we hit those well that means you can see

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.090 
we hit those well that means you can see
coming<00:06:32.540> down<00:06:32.660> it's<00:06:32.930> all<00:06:33.080> electrons<00:06:33.680> so<00:06:34.040> you

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
coming down it's all electrons so you

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.360 
coming down it's all electrons so you
just<00:06:34.490> do<00:06:34.700> it<00:06:34.760> remote-control<00:06:35.890> really<00:06:36.890> easy<00:06:37.130> to

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
just do it remote-control really easy to

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.200 
just do it remote-control really easy to
do<00:06:37.600> anybody<00:06:38.600> can<00:06:38.840> do<00:06:39.020> it<00:06:39.490> once<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.670> tops<00:06:40.910> down

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
do anybody can do it once the tops down

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.450 
do anybody can do it once the tops down
you<00:06:41.420> can<00:06:41.600> go<00:06:41.750> out<00:06:41.870> and<00:06:42.110> latch<00:06:42.380> four<00:06:43.010> latches

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
you can go out and latch four latches

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.010 
you can go out and latch four latches
and<00:06:43.490> you're<00:06:43.820> pretty<00:06:44.060> much<00:06:44.210> done<00:06:44.510> and<00:06:44.750> ready<00:06:44.900> to
