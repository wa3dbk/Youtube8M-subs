00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.479 
phone only comes with one thousand one
hundred<00:02:13.750> milliamps<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.739> we're<00:02:15.340> gonna

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
hundred milliamps and we're gonna

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.220 
hundred milliamps and we're gonna
replace<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.180> with<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.450> battery<00:02:16.870> which

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
replace it with this battery which

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.839 
replace it with this battery which
actually<00:02:17.920> has<00:02:20.280> 1420<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.370> let<00:02:21.459> me<00:02:21.550> see<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.760> I

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
actually has 1420 and let me see if I

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.410 
actually has 1420 and let me see if I
can<00:02:22.030> focus<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.569> there<00:02:22.749> you<00:02:22.840> go<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.680> has<00:02:24.239> 1420<00:02:25.239> so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
can focus is there you go so has 1420 so

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.940 
can focus is there you go so has 1420 so
definitely

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
definitely

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.410 
definitely
this<00:02:27.129> battery<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.580> going<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:27.879> be<00:02:27.970> much<00:02:28.180> better

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
this battery is going to be much better

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.420 
this battery is going to be much better
now<00:02:29.140> another<00:02:29.349> thing<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.890> was<00:02:30.069> concerned

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
now another thing that I was concerned

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.180 
now another thing that I was concerned
about<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:31.000> his<00:02:31.209> pacing<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:32.560> don't<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:32.980> if<00:02:33.099> you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
about is his pacing I don't know if you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.670 
about is his pacing I don't know if you
can<00:02:33.370> see<00:02:33.519> this<00:02:33.670> guys<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.300> between<00:02:35.050> here<00:02:35.560> and

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
can see this guys but between here and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.300 
can see this guys but between here and
here<00:02:36.280> we<00:02:36.670> still<00:02:36.910> have<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.480> almost<00:02:38.310> four

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
here we still have like almost four

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.089 
here we still have like almost four
millimeters<00:02:39.879> wide<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.560> definitely

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
millimeters wide so we can definitely

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.000 
millimeters wide so we can definitely
fit<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:42.610> battery<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:43.180> here<00:02:43.480> okay<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.349> next
