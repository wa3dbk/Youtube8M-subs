on<00:00:19.669> youtube<00:00:20.119> today<00:00:20.930> I'm<00:00:21.200> going<00:00:21.380> to<00:00:21.439> talk<00:00:21.650> a<00:00:21.680> bit

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
on youtube today I'm going to talk a bit

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.310 
on youtube today I'm going to talk a bit
about<00:00:21.950> the<00:00:22.550> noise<00:00:23.060> reduction<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:24.050> how<00:00:24.260> to

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
about the noise reduction and how to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.679 
about the noise reduction and how to
remove<00:00:25.269> unwanted<00:00:26.269> noise<00:00:26.840> from<00:00:27.470> your<00:00:27.710> trains

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
remove unwanted noise from your trains

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.409 
remove unwanted noise from your trains
as<00:00:29.689> many<00:00:30.080> people<00:00:30.500> asked<00:00:31.130> I'm<00:00:31.519> using<00:00:31.849> a<00:00:32.150> type<00:00:32.390> of

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
as many people asked I'm using a type of

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.710 
as many people asked I'm using a type of
felt<00:00:32.900> on<00:00:33.199> the<00:00:33.410> tracks<00:00:34.129> and<00:00:34.489> I'm<00:00:35.300> going<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.570> show

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
felt on the tracks and I'm going to show

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.009 
felt on the tracks and I'm going to show
you<00:00:35.960> why<00:00:39.040> most<00:00:40.040> people<00:00:40.280> build<00:00:40.699> a<00:00:41.019> model

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
you why most people build a model

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.030 
you why most people build a model
railroad<00:00:42.260> either<00:00:42.979> on<00:00:43.280> flat<00:00:43.879> table<00:00:44.420> or<00:00:45.170> on<00:00:45.979> a

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
railroad either on flat table or on a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.270 
railroad either on flat table or on a
wooden<00:00:46.640> structure<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.930> then<00:00:48.199> you<00:00:48.470> make<00:00:49.100> the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
wooden structure and then you make the

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.500 
wooden structure and then you make the
track<00:00:49.549> bed<00:00:49.820> out<00:00:50.059> of<00:00:50.119> plywood<00:00:51.100> both<00:00:52.100> these

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
track bed out of plywood both these

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.789 
track bed out of plywood both these
approaches<00:00:53.510> has<00:00:54.080> a<00:00:54.110> double<00:00:54.530> disadvantage

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
approaches has a double disadvantage

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.939 
approaches has a double disadvantage
that<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:55.610> amplifying<00:00:56.330> the<00:00:56.540> noise<00:00:56.949> coming

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
that it's amplifying the noise coming

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.270 
that it's amplifying the noise coming
from<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.869> train<00:00:59.869> passing<00:01:00.589> on<00:01:00.799> the<00:01:00.979> steel

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
from the train passing on the steel

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.960 
from the train passing on the steel
tracks<00:01:01.760> metal<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.960> metal<00:01:03.640> there<00:01:04.640> are<00:01:04.729> several

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
tracks metal to metal there are several

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.050 
tracks metal to metal there are several
ways<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.420> reduce<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.260> noise<00:01:06.439> one<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.640> them<00:01:07.820> is

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
ways to reduce the noise one of them is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.380 
ways to reduce the noise one of them is
to<00:01:08.299> reduce<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.950> transferred<00:01:10.549> amount<00:01:11.030> of

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
to reduce the transferred amount of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.590 
to reduce the transferred amount of
noise<00:01:11.630> from<00:01:12.289> the<00:01:12.649> rail<00:01:12.859> down<00:01:13.579> into<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.270> wooden

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
noise from the rail down into the wooden

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.580 
noise from the rail down into the wooden
plate<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.979> other<00:01:16.070> way<00:01:16.399> is<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:17.179> remove<00:01:17.899> reduce

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
plate the other way is to remove reduce

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.550 
plate the other way is to remove reduce
the<00:01:18.920> area<00:01:19.429> of<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.880> vibrating<00:01:20.689> plate<00:01:21.079> so

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
the area of the vibrating plate so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.760 
the area of the vibrating plate so
instead<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.579> having<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:23.149> complete<00:01:23.450> tabletop<00:01:24.409> we

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
instead of having a complete tabletop we

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.219 
instead of having a complete tabletop we
have<00:01:24.979> only<00:01:25.280> wood<00:01:26.149> under<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.710> rain<00:01:29.049> we<00:01:30.049> can

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
have only wood under the rain we can

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.039 
have only wood under the rain we can
also<00:01:30.409> of<00:01:30.829> course<00:01:30.909> absorb<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.210> sound<00:01:32.509> as<00:01:32.869> it

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
also of course absorb the sound as it

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.029 
also of course absorb the sound as it
comes<00:01:33.320> out<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.890> air<00:01:34.100> by<00:01:34.880> having<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:36.039> sound

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
comes out in the air by having a sound

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.940 
comes out in the air by having a sound
absorbing<00:01:37.759> felts<00:01:38.450> inside<00:01:38.899> tunnels<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.679> such

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
absorbing felts inside tunnels and such

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.800 
absorbing felts inside tunnels and such
things<00:01:40.369> or<00:01:40.579> beneath<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.979> wordplay<00:01:43.810> I've

things or beneath the wordplay I've

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.440 
things or beneath the wordplay I've
tested<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.590> basically<00:01:46.009> three<00:01:46.490> materials<00:01:47.210> I

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
tested the basically three materials I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.469 
tested the basically three materials I
tested<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.590> traditional<00:01:49.310> cork<00:01:49.639> which<00:01:50.179> is

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
tested the traditional cork which is

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.249 
tested the traditional cork which is
available<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:51.259> ma<00:01:51.740> shop<00:01:52.389> I've<00:01:53.389> tested<00:01:53.990> there

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
available in ma shop I've tested there

an<00:02:06.100> Ikea<00:02:07.100> product<00:02:07.929> it's<00:02:08.929> really<00:02:09.160> anti-slip

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
an Ikea product it's really anti-slip

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.649 
an Ikea product it's really anti-slip
to<00:02:11.260> use<00:02:12.330> under<00:02:13.330> normal<00:02:14.129> carpets<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:16.269> the

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
to use under normal carpets so the

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.360 
to use under normal carpets so the
corpus<00:02:17.049> won't<00:02:18.120> slip<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:20.319> has<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> kind<00:02:21.250> of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
corpus won't slip and it has a kind of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.649 
corpus won't slip and it has a kind of
high<00:02:22.150> friction<00:02:22.810> rubber<00:02:23.640> cover<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:25.030> both<00:02:25.269> sides

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
high friction rubber cover on both sides

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:32.009 
high friction rubber cover on both sides
of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> felt<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:29.010> Emery<00:02:30.450> does<00:02:31.450> not<00:02:31.690> come

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
of the felt so the Emery does not come

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.589 
of the felt so the Emery does not come
apart<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:33.010> does<00:02:33.340> not<00:02:33.579> move<00:02:33.879> and<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.329> don't

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
apart it does not move and you don't

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.699 
apart it does not move and you don't
have<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.959> screw<00:02:35.290> it

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
have to screw it

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.399 
have to screw it
it<00:02:35.860> stands<00:02:36.340> firmly<00:02:37.329> where<00:02:37.659> you<00:02:37.750> place<00:02:38.079> it

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
it stands firmly where you place it

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.610 
it stands firmly where you place it
that's<00:02:39.129> one<00:02:39.489> thing<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.879> like<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.569> made<00:02:41.379> some

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
that's one thing I like I made some

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.530 
that's one thing I like I made some
measurements<00:02:41.799> on<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.519> sound<00:02:42.790> pressure<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
measurements on the sound pressure and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.539 
measurements on the sound pressure and
as<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:44.079> see<00:02:44.319> to<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.890> right<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.519> the

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
as you can see to the right with the

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.440 
as you can see to the right with the
felt<00:02:45.879> it's<00:02:46.390> one-third<00:02:47.170> compared<00:02:47.859> without<00:02:48.450> one

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
felt it's one-third compared without one

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.899 
felt it's one-third compared without one
other<00:02:49.720> advantage<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.889> the<00:02:51.040> song<00:02:51.310> gets<00:02:51.609> a

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
other advantage is that the song gets a

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.149 
other advantage is that the song gets a
more<00:02:52.150> comfortable<00:02:52.629> tone<00:02:53.230> not<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:53.950> high

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
more comfortable tone not so high

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.110 
more comfortable tone not so high
pitched<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:55.510> material<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.079> quite<00:02:56.260> easy<00:02:56.680> to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
pitched the material is quite easy to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.379 
pitched the material is quite easy to
work<00:02:58.120> with<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.690> cut<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.709> with<00:02:59.739> a<00:02:59.920> scissor<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.639> then
