00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
schedules so that it'll automatically

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
manual and punch those into here and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.010 
manual and punch those into here and
then<00:01:07.799> once<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.369> those<00:01:08.520> punched<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
then once you have those punched in you

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
then once you have those punched in you
can<00:01:10.200> look<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> maintenance<00:01:11.130> schedule<00:01:11.280> and

can look at a maintenance schedule and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
can look at a maintenance schedule and
it'll<00:01:12.540> tell<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.020> services<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.680> coming

it'll tell you what services are coming

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.789 
it'll tell you what services are coming
up<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.720> color<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.259> weird<00:01:16.560> maybe

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
up so that color is a little weird maybe

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
up so that color is a little weird maybe
that's<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> light<00:01:18.240> theme

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that's because I'm on the light theme

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.469 
that's because I'm on the light theme
but<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.799> shows<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.549> which<00:01:20.759> service<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.330> coming

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
but it shows you which service is coming
up<00:01:21.750> next<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.470> running<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> rotate<00:01:23.490> my<00:01:23.610> tires

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
up next like running a rotate my tires

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.219 
up next like running a rotate my tires
at<00:01:24.350> 65,000<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.759> then<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.330> shows<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:27.990> your

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
at 65,000 and then it shows you all your

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.679 
at 65,000 and then it shows you all your
future<00:01:28.439> services<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> those<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.570> all

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
future services and those are all

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.630 
future services and those are all
calculated<00:01:31.229> based<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.040> last<00:01:32.280> did

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
calculated based on when you last did

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.870 
calculated based on when you last did
the<00:01:32.790> service<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.810> changed<00:01:34.259> my<00:01:34.380> oil

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
the service so I changed my oil

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.539 
the service so I changed my oil
previously<00:01:35.880> at<00:01:36.500> 62<00:01:37.500> thousand<00:01:38.130> six<00:01:38.430> hundred

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
previously at 62 thousand six hundred

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.870 
previously at 62 thousand six hundred
fifty<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.259> I<00:01:40.259> set<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.950> every<00:01:41.280> five

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
fifty and I set it to be every five

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.389 
fifty and I set it to be every five
thousand<00:01:42.450> miles<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:43.200> every<00:01:43.890> four<00:01:44.220> months

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
thousand miles or every four months

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.420 
thousand miles or every four months
there<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.990> calculates<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.220> would

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
there so it calculates what that would

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
there so it calculates what that would
be<00:01:47.640> according<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.479> your<00:01:48.570> last<00:01:48.840> service<00:01:49.259> or

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
be according to your last service or

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.950 
be according to your last service or
just<00:01:49.979> according<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.759> zero<00:01:51.149> miles<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> zero

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
just according to zero miles and zero

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.899 
just according to zero miles and zero
months<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> plans<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.640> if

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
months and plans it all out like that if

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.740 
months and plans it all out like that if
you<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.909> been<00:01:57.119> following<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
you just have been following the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.910 
you just have been following the
schedule<00:01:57.930> perfectly<00:01:58.729> so<00:02:00.079> it's<00:02:01.079> really<00:02:01.290> pretty

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
schedule perfectly so it's really pretty

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.760 
schedule perfectly so it's really pretty
easy<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.490> use<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.140> once<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> hang<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
easy to use and once you get the hang of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.270 
easy to use and once you get the hang of
entering<00:02:05.310> things<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.119> gets<00:02:06.570> easier<00:02:07.140> and

which is nice but I wish they had an
option<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.850> switch<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.630> could<00:03:42.780> put

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
option to switch that so you could put

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.380 
option to switch that so you could put
in<00:03:43.140> what<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:43.980> price<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.430> per<00:03:44.670> gallon<00:03:45.120> then<00:03:45.299> you

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
in what the price is per gallon then you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.720 
in what the price is per gallon then you

want to have to wait for it to read out

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.110

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.929 
actually lets you export and import data
oh<00:05:57.629> and<00:05:58.289> you<00:05:58.349> can<00:05:58.500> actually<00:05:58.620> manage<00:05:59.310> multiple

00:05:59.929 --> 00:05:59.939 
oh and you can actually manage multiple

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.510 
oh and you can actually manage multiple
cars<00:06:00.180> too<00:06:00.689> so<00:06:01.650> if<00:06:01.740> you<00:06:01.770> have<00:06:01.919> multiple<00:06:02.310> cars

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
cars too so if you have multiple cars

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.089 
cars too so if you have multiple cars
that's<00:06:02.759> really<00:06:03.270> great<00:06:03.509> I<00:06:03.810> only<00:06:04.529> have<00:06:04.710> one<00:06:04.860> car

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
that's really great I only have one car

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.119 
that's really great I only have one car
though<00:06:05.279> but<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:06.029> can<00:06:06.389> export<00:06:06.930> there<00:06:07.229> and<00:06:07.409> send

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
though but you can export there and send

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.550 
though but you can export there and send
it<00:06:08.189> to<00:06:08.339> an<00:06:08.430> email<00:06:08.550> address<00:06:08.759> and<00:06:09.210> then<00:06:10.080> you<00:06:10.379> can

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
it to an email address and then you can

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.429 
it to an email address and then you can
import<00:06:10.800> it<00:06:11.279> so<00:06:12.120> that's<00:06:12.360> really<00:06:12.449> useful<00:06:13.020> if

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
import it so that's really useful if

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.499
