a condor or whatever he is transformed
into<00:03:19.380> tape<00:03:19.710> mode<00:03:19.980> very<00:03:20.310> easily<00:03:20.630> there's<00:03:21.630> a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
into tape mode very easily there's a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.800 
into tape mode very easily there's a
bang<00:03:21.900> bang<00:03:22.140> bang<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:23.160> fold<00:03:23.460> up<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.760> feet<00:03:23.970> so

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
bang bang bang and fold up the feet so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.500 
bang bang bang and fold up the feet so
there<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.170> go<00:03:25.350> just<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:26.370> mode<00:03:26.610> okay<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.240> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
there you go just that mode okay so the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.110 
there you go just that mode okay so the
next<00:03:27.630> thing<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:27.960> have<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.230> do<00:03:28.350> though<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:29.120> build

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
next thing we have to do though is build

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.760 
it
this<00:04:23.720> way<00:04:24.729> so<00:04:25.729> that's<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:27.050> will<00:04:27.470> build<00:04:27.680> the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
this way so that's that will build the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.960 
this way so that's that will build the
other<00:04:27.860> one<00:04:28.010> really<00:04:28.190> fast<00:04:28.430> I'm<00:04:28.639> not<00:04:28.699> going<00:04:28.910> to

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
other one really fast I'm not going to

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.030 
other one really fast I'm not going to
go<00:04:29.060> through<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.360> full<00:04:29.570> description<00:04:29.870> here<00:04:30.260> so

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
go through the full description here so

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.800 
go through the full description here so
we<00:04:31.370> build<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.729> just<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.090> mirror<00:04:32.300> image<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.660> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
we build it just a mirror image of the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.760 
we build it just a mirror image of the
other<00:04:32.840> one<00:04:35.560> okay

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
other one okay

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:52.379 
other one okay
antenna<00:04:40.750> pin

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.300 

okay<00:04:53.229> so<00:04:55.020> basically<00:04:56.020> have<00:04:56.349> no<00:04:56.590> our<00:04:56.919> rocket

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
okay so basically have no our rocket

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.379 
okay so basically have no our rocket
packs<00:04:57.750> we<00:04:58.750> have<00:04:58.900> our<00:04:59.430> transforming<00:05:00.430> Laserbeak

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
packs we have our transforming Laserbeak

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.529
