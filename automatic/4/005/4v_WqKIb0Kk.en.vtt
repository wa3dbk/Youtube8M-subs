00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 little everyone is 8 vip for 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.759
 a new video is today we are 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.480
 found for a new video where I 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.890
 will teach you how 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.290
 completely customize your 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.849
 phone under android 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.190
 so this video I think is not bad 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.509
 then help you this video an attraction 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.279
 particular is that I teach you to 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.930
 customize it without roads were 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.000
 identified this operation which allows 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.970
 release your phone to install little 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.170
 almost everything without control there I'm going 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.359
 you install them using 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.250
 upline store applications so more 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.480
 of security obviously what you know 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.020
 the road unfortunately that can bring 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.809
 a lot of viruses and ben that's so 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.600
 so I'll teach you already 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.190
 first of all so I'm going to give you 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 already a very simple little trick for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.840
 have beautiful wallpapers so bah 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.590
 have downloaded the application fo 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.470
 is waiting for wallpapers and it's a bit 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.680
 this not very original wallpaper here 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.329
 tac ok you type on search that's it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.379
 this application is here 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.320
 that's over 10 million 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.200
 downloads installed here accept 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.070
 so you're going to have some few 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.570
 wallpapers frankly pretty enough and 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.320
 you will be able to see in fact on everything 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.100
 what is talking is that you are going 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.689
 to be able to see the the funds see the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.810
 wallpapers that were chosen to make 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.409
 who were most loved talking about them 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.689
 users see for example here tac 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.399
 and the most popular yes it was 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.869
 sometimes it's nice but I think so 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.970
 good it's not it's not really very 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.690
 complicated properly but we will 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.580
 give you a source sooner 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.750
 inspiration 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.610
 so now I wanted to address a 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.569
 rather important passage of the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.280
 personalization 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:46.780
 these lands that I will teach you to 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.720
 install a launcher ea finally has to 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.539
 use it well so for the tutorial I 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.340
 used a best known lucho outlaw at 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.850
 world since these smart the top two 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.510
 sailboats this is this one 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.340
 marthe 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.429
 smart lunch here 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.500
 this is this walker 2 you see tac he 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.319
 must his load see so this is a 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.030
 wide to ocha pretty well go on we exist 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.200
 full that allow to offer more 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.360
 possibilities so that I invite you to 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.590
 discover and judge according to 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.989
 notes that were given I you 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.190
 advise me I want to show the most 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.440
 known what I found he was 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.959
 very ergonomic is really really 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.940
 well done so here I am going to press 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.560
 on open so as you see 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.629
 the interface is completely different 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.430
 so if I am you see I have everything 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.780
 like that you see here with his five 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.069
 stuff that's actually when you 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.110
 install the launcher you're going to have to 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.579
 define what are what is your 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.260
 application that defines every thing 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.310
 is that here you see you at 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.319
 the phone application 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.879
 so I had to choose between b contact 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.890
 is good of phone apps 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.209
 since in fact it's defining music 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.310
 so I had the choice between google pay 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.620
 music 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.890
 between brockman between spotify deezer so 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.930
 I took walkman photo go I chose 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.970
 internet photo album i chose google 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.550
 chrome messaging low I chose my 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.130
 sms and photos and photos before 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.060
 of cameras so you see 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.310
 waited that's tac 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.500

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.830
 have the game that's attack but everything is 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.420
 very well organized here frankly 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.380
 it's all my multimedia stuff 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.790

 so me for example I'm going to edit 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.080
 these are the global terms the dicod packs 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.699
 the clock the bubbles sail to define and 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.720
 that's it and then the norm in that it's going 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.970
 to happen is that you see your 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.409
 applications now the icons are 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.229
 round as you have it 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.780
 noticed tac and everything is customized 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.729
 frankly so it's really good 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.490

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.800
 personalized so thank you for having followed 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.400
 this opinion adri manages last elements of 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.319
 personalization 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.520
 so that's it if you want that it's a 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:34.199
 little personalization trick 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.449
 quiet is downloading a keyboard 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.310
 again keyboard so here I go by 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.050
 the touch palix here is exactly that 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.639
 see more than 10 million 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.330
 downloads so that's another 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.860
 keyboard so fruit lo 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.379
 this is going to allow here I am you 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.610
 the install lugs installed in paphos have 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.840
 act act ac here so that's it you 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.750
 allow to install a new keyboard 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.159
 and it can be useful at kazoo a good 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.750
 I tested it right after 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.469
 because hey he's not me he 's not going 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.840
 to serve me a lot 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:06.240
 but frankly it can be very 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.930
 useful if if you have that if you 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.979
 like that so I think the jav 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.379
 would have gone around the possibilities if 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.690
