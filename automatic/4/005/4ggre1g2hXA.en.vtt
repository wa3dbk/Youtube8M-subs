00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.820
 recently ran in the live broadcast 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.800
 with the developer storm 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.590
 there the storm also answers well- known 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.660
 on michael joke on many at the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.300
 Players like to answer popular questions 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470
 when does it come and what is it realistic 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.810
 armored movement 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.240
 We have the most important questions for you 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.250
 you selected and summarized here 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.640
 So what is it and when does it come to that? 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.590
 game 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.750
 Mr. Bock is a physical one 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 Engine engine for a correct 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.410
 calculation of physical properties 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.879
 the objects in the game where it first 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.110
 line for the beautiful representation of the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.269
 destruction is used 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.220
 Buildings are in many items 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.839
 they disintegrate in different directions 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.260
 corresponding physics laws fly 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.000
 become 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.070
 for the calculations who terror no 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.320
 use separate data stream what the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.089
 owner of a multi-core processor 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.250
 This presentation will be in the 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.500
 Settings can be switched off and also 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.180
 everything with the old remains with which 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.140
 renovation harburg comes into play 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 hard to say 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 the technology is ready but 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.729
 the restrained object he still has to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.710
 to be written 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.270
 that's a great deal of work and it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.760
 will take a certain amount of time 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 it will take a multi-core processors 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.690
 give support and when will this 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580
 a significant increase in performance 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.620
 bring 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.870
 We are currently working on the division 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.940
 the data streams for the calculations of 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.830
 graphics and small data for it 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.250
 big pieces of the clan modified 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.080
 become 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 It's a lot of work already 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.040
 takes a long time and not in next 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.630
 future is hampered Remember 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.070
 Support will not be all 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.350
 fix power problems 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 but in some cases it can be ten 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.730
 lead to thirty performance increase 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.100
 especially when the system is through 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.950
 is processor performance is poured 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.660
 the fv 42 02 10 premium banzer transferred 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 yes that is armor for premium web 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.350
 own lead appointment is not yet 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.090
 whether the players know this tank 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.550
 already have this as a premium 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.650
 banzer is obtained for free 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.300
 not known when will be a new one 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.770
 movement music introduced because we the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.690
 different to the old lie 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.459
 the main difference will be the physics 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.409
 realistic the banzer move 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.810
 now how right armor it will be 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.269
 maneuverable strings slide 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.280
 will be able to weigh gently as it is now or 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.389
 lay down a drift while doing a 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.819
 lose speed 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.620
 the rocking up of the tank at 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.890
 start and brake is now on the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.780
 lake 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 one calculates that one can use for 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.790
 shoot higher or lower than that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.190
 allow vertical dish angle 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.590
 For that you have to give gas or brake 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.600
 the suspension does not swallow a small one 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.850
 bumps much like small machines 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.920
 Stones are much better off you stay a lot 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.480
 hang less info currently running the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.220
 to work the whole game over 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.980
 so that it behaves more realistically 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.750
 game disturbed but supports appointment 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.670
 as soon as possible the main work is 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.200
 but already done run currently 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.090
 and the test before the elimination and 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.459
 fine adjustments it was also 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.090
 About this parade us the clans 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.270
 spoken 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.489
 first the textures are in resolution 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.790
 reduced hd textures play version 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.830
 9.3 these are by default in sd 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.900
 texts installed the difference 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.300
 between hd and sd is only next 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.250
 near visible 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.230
 players who want the higher quality 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.860
 you can download these separately and 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.410
 to install 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.120
 the distribution is only for the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.850
 armored already in hand of the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.880
 quality is planned in the future too 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.000
 the environment objects in HD quality 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.860
 introduce 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.140
 the team skills become 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.250
 Revised these become stronger 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.140
 the choices compete with each other 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.650
 Exploring first becomes more difficult 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.220
 become 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.140
 the sixth sense is eliminated as 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.170
 craft the standard for all 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.940
 Be available at the point of it 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.130
 the possibility is introduced the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.730
 Specialization of the teams too 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.040
 to change 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.230
 the suffering of the trained 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.650
 unemployed radio operator in the barracks 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.360
 further topics reduce the storm 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.079
 has addressed the were at night 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.090
 battled the improvement mute tiger 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.590
 weather change and want to remember 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.900
 They all first-hand with 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.000
 Translation from Brazil you see the 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.470
 recording the live broadcast that was 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.829
 that we wish good luck on the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.829
 battlefields
