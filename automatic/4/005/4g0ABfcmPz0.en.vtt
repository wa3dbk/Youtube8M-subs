putting another tie line up in front of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.520 
putting another tie line up in front of
his<00:01:48.270> base<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.780> he<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.170> things<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
his base just so he can see things a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.289 
his base just so he can see things a
little<00:01:49.649> faster<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.280> come<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.640> he<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.060> also

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
little faster as we come in he is also

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
little faster as we come in he is also
getting<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.720> first<00:01:52.140> gas<00:01:52.439> relatively<00:01:53.159> quickly

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
getting a first gas relatively quickly

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.760

so<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.970> expect<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> cyber<00:01:54.840> Corps<00:01:55.170> I

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
so we can expect to see a cyber Corps I

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.969

bit but he finds as Ella and decide
maybe<00:03:05.109> it's<00:03:05.319> not<00:03:05.409> a<00:03:05.470> good<00:03:05.530> idea<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:06.069> yet<00:03:06.190> it

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
maybe it's not a good idea just yet it

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.420 
maybe it's not a good idea just yet it
is<00:03:07.180> also<00:03:07.359> building<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.230> factory<00:03:08.500> very<00:03:08.950> near<00:03:09.190> his

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
time with this and it looks like these

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.000 
time with this and it looks like these
rains<00:04:14.379> are<00:04:14.500> actually<00:04:14.709> going<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.889> play

they<00:04:16.510> do<00:04:16.570> have<00:04:16.810> about<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.229> same<00:04:17.260> run<00:04:17.650> speed<00:04:17.889> so

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
they do have about the same run speed so

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.650 
they do have about the same run speed so
if<00:04:18.250> he<00:04:18.340> can<00:04:18.459> keep<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:18.849> up<00:04:19.030> long<00:04:19.239> enough<00:04:19.389> and

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
if he can keep this up long enough and

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.479 
if he can keep this up long enough and
it<00:04:20.320> looks<00:04:20.470> like<00:04:20.590> he<00:04:20.709> has<00:04:20.829> great<00:04:21.010> timing<00:04:21.160> there

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
it looks like he has great timing there

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.920 
it looks like he has great timing there
as<00:04:21.609> these<00:04:21.760> two<00:04:21.940> zealots<00:04:22.240> are<00:04:22.360> not<00:04:22.479> able<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.810> get

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
as these two zealots are not able to get

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.779 
as these two zealots are not able to get
around<00:04:23.140> him<00:04:23.349> he's<00:04:23.919> just<00:04:23.979> going<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.310> keep<00:04:24.370> that

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
around him he's just going to keep that

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.860 
around him he's just going to keep that
going<00:04:25.060> as<00:04:25.300> long<00:04:25.419> as<00:04:25.570> possible<00:04:25.750> prob

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
going as long as possible prob

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.230 
going as long as possible prob
now<00:04:27.320> he<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.680> building<00:04:27.919> more<00:04:28.190> Marines<00:04:28.430> so<00:04:28.729> maybe

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
now he is building more Marines so maybe

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.610 
now he is building more Marines so maybe
just<00:04:29.540> trying<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.960> hold<00:04:30.110> off<00:04:30.229> those<00:04:30.410> zealots

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
but um he just wants to buy time because

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.620 
but um he just wants to buy time because
now<00:04:33.229> he's<00:04:33.620> built<00:04:33.889> an<00:04:34.070> armory<00:04:34.550> very<00:04:35.180> close<00:04:35.419> to

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
now he's built an armory very close to

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.390 
now he's built an armory very close to
his<00:04:35.750> proxy<00:04:36.110> factory<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.620> proxy<00:04:36.979> barracks<00:04:37.280> and

his proxy factory and proxy barracks and

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.890 
his proxy factory and proxy barracks and
this<00:04:37.760> will<00:04:37.910> allow<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.150> building<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.570> Thor's

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
floating in out towards the base is

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.620 
floating in out towards the base is
going<00:05:16.669> to<00:05:16.760> get<00:05:16.850> a<00:05:16.910> little<00:05:17.060> additional

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
going to get a little additional

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.029 
going to get a little additional
scouting<00:05:18.020> information<00:05:18.470> if<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:18.680> does<00:05:18.830> actually

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
scouting information if it does actually

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.460 
scouting information if it does actually
reach<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.580> but<00:05:19.729> it<00:05:19.850> looks<00:05:20.030> like<00:05:20.260> this<00:05:21.260> rate

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
reach it but it looks like this rate

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.860 
reach it but it looks like this rate
he'll<00:05:21.620> be<00:05:21.770> lucky<00:05:22.010> if<00:05:22.280> that<00:05:22.460> happens<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.240> was
