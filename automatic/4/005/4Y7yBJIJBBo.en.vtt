00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.250
 Hello everyone 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.600
 always working outing toulon 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.170
 will make a gradient of purple pink so 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.380
 who looks like that looks like that 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.829
 same is always super simple then 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.809
 there by cons it can be how I 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.540
 I'm going to do that so that this 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.940
 be practical I put my tasks of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.850
 polish next to me so but four and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.860
 so I'm going to zoom in and so I'm going 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:59.160
 order start with the big end and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.420
 so make big points actually I 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.280
 so I have a doubt into the eve 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.549
 I do not have if they will see well with a 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.430
 big butt and so beautiful and so I 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.450
 work with both of them on that side I 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.450
 do one of the smallest points 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.720
 so every color change I 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.720
 cleans my nothing to the obviously 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:54.240
 I go to fuchsia so we tried to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.280
 do that pretty quickly of course because 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.759
 than suddenly the varnish while waiting for corn 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.759
 h him 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.430
 why am I going to finish with the 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.430
 purple 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.210
 zooms and that's what it gives 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.210
 a little decoration 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.500
 so a deco very simple device 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.000
 always accessible all the time because 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.950
 that here is learning to make points that 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.180
 takes a little longer so for 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.080
 do this deco I used in base 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.850
 I used the 305 from home 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.220
 fashion kohler collection i used 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.560
 to make the lightest color 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:17.390
 so this base there the 536 of chebel 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:22.830
 then the little rose is the 433 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:27.959
 then the future the fuchsia is 436 and 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:31.170
 purple is the 435 of course the 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.650
 of outouls with the big butt 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.650
 snippet 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.910
 my base according to varnish of course my plan 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:45.780
 working for for my masters but 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.500
 varnish but varnish on it and for everything 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.380
 clean audi alone voice close and then we 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.820
 ends with a layer of flat top coat 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.260
 and after the top coat layer is a 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:05.120
 oil is something to hydrate a 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.120
 cream what you have on hand 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.489
 so that's for this little deco 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:21.489
 simple so see you soon for a new 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.489
