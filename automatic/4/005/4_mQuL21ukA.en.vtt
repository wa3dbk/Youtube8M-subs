00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
although I think it does do a lot of the

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.020 
although I think it does do a lot of the
good<00:02:42.420> stuff<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.049> claims<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:44.459> does<00:02:44.640> smooth

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
the hair it's gentle on hair since it's

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.880 
the hair it's gentle on hair since it's
sulfate<00:02:48.720> free<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.319> it's<00:02:49.410> also<00:02:49.560> good<00:02:49.860> for

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
sulfate free and it's also good for

sulfate free and it's also good for
color-treated<00:02:50.370> hair<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.989> wouldn't<00:02:52.680> say<00:02:52.860> that

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
color-treated hair I wouldn't say that

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.020 
color-treated hair I wouldn't say that
it<00:02:53.099> adds<00:02:53.250> volume<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.390> wouldn't<00:02:54.900> say<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:56.030> think

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
it adds volume I wouldn't say I think

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.190 
it adds volume I wouldn't say I think
that's<00:02:57.269> probably<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.720> only<00:02:57.870> thing<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.170> I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
that's probably the only thing that I

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.870 
that's probably the only thing that I
would<00:02:58.290> say<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.650> doesn't<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.579> it

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
would say that doesn't do it that it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.289 
would say that doesn't do it that it
adds<00:03:00.060> volume<00:03:00.780> although<00:03:01.170> clearly<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.760> already

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
adds volume although clearly I already

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.630 
adds volume although clearly I already
have<00:03:03.540> volume<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.170> my<00:03:04.440> hair<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.370> see

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
have volume in my hair as you can see

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.380 
have volume in my hair as you can see
like<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:05.880> have<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> lot<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.900> hair<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.209> only

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
like I have a lot of hair and it only

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.819 
like I have a lot of hair and it only
looks<00:03:09.660> less<00:03:09.900> because<00:03:10.200> obviously<00:03:10.380> because<00:03:10.739> I

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
looks less because obviously because I

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:11.870 
looks less because obviously because I
straightened<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.579> not<00:03:11.670> how

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880

naturally my hair looks like but it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.699 
naturally my hair looks like but it
didn't<00:03:14.700> provide<00:03:15.120> me<00:03:15.480> any<00:03:15.660> extra<00:03:16.019> volume<00:03:16.590> my

hair is the exact same volume now that I

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.650

was<00:03:19.290> looking<00:03:19.620> for<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:19.890> anyway<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.819> it

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
was looking for that anyway but it

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.110 
was looking for that anyway but it
didn't<00:03:21.989> provide<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.609> wouldn't<00:03:23.940> say

compared to this the only problem with

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.440 
compared to this the only problem with
that<00:04:11.489> line

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
that line

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.360 
that line
is<00:04:12.569> that<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.440> only<00:04:13.620> purchase<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:14.190> in

at Sephora store accom so that's the
only<00:04:24.270> problem<00:04:24.450> with<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:25.620> overall<00:04:26.190> I

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
only problem with that but overall I

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.830 
only problem with that but overall I
would<00:04:26.730> still<00:04:27.060> give<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> four<00:04:27.480> out<00:04:27.540> of<00:04:27.630> five

would still give a four out of five
stars<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.560> think<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.889> does<00:04:29.100> make<00:04:29.400> my<00:04:29.610> hair<00:04:29.820> feel

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.629 
stars I think it does make my hair feel
smoother<00:04:31.250> especially<00:04:32.250> using<00:04:32.430> the

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
smoother especially using the

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.750 
smoother especially using the
conditioner<00:04:33.270> but<00:04:34.080> doesn't<00:04:34.620> give<00:04:34.770> volume<00:04:35.370> and

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
conditioner but doesn't give volume and

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.000 
conditioner but doesn't give volume and
I<00:04:36.090> feel<00:04:36.300> like<00:04:36.419> my<00:04:36.570> hair<00:04:36.780> could<00:04:36.990> feel<00:04:37.260> smoother

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
I feel like my hair could feel smoother

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.210 
I feel like my hair could feel smoother
even<00:04:38.430> if<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:39.300> used<00:04:39.510> a<00:04:39.690> different<00:04:39.900> product<00:04:40.380> like

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
even if I used a different product like

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.780 
even if I used a different product like
the<00:04:41.370> our<00:04:41.520> pooi<00:04:41.880> line<00:04:42.770> so<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.830> like<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.400> but<00:04:44.760> I

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
the our pooi line so I like it but I

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.210 
the our pooi line so I like it but I
don't<00:04:45.150> think<00:04:45.450> it's<00:04:45.630> like<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.139> claim<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:47.100> the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
don't think it's like the claim of the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.060 
don't think it's like the claim of the
perfect<00:04:47.700> hair<00:04:48.000> day<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:49.110> think<00:04:49.350> my<00:04:49.620> hair<00:04:49.830> looks

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
especially the part where it's the most

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.950 
especially the part where it's the most
bleach<00:06:24.980> like<00:06:25.370> it's<00:06:25.520> just<00:06:25.820> you<00:06:26.330> know<00:06:26.450> it's<00:06:26.840> just

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
bleach like it's just you know it's just

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.160 
bleach like it's just you know it's just

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.080 
hasn't done as much as I would like so
that's<00:06:30.770> my<00:06:30.980> review<00:06:31.280> on<00:06:31.430> these<00:06:31.520> products<00:06:31.940> and

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
that's my review on these products and

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.390 
that's my review on these products and
obviously<00:06:32.620> you<00:06:33.620> have<00:06:33.650> to<00:06:33.950> take<00:06:34.100> it<00:06:34.220> off<00:06:34.310> a

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
obviously you have to take it off a

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.220 
obviously you have to take it off a
grain<00:06:34.580> of<00:06:34.610> salt<00:06:34.880> because<00:06:35.090> my<00:06:35.360> hair<00:06:35.660> it's

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
grain of salt because my hair it's

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.590 
grain of salt because my hair it's
different<00:06:36.530> than<00:06:36.770> your<00:06:36.950> hair<00:06:37.250> my<00:06:38.240> hair<00:06:38.480> is<00:06:38.570> very

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
different than your hair my hair is very

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.100 
different than your hair my hair is very
thick<00:06:38.960> and<00:06:39.470> wavy<00:06:40.180> you<00:06:41.180> know<00:06:41.300> the<00:06:41.570> kind<00:06:41.780> of<00:06:41.840> wavy

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
thick and wavy you know the kind of wavy

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.110 
thick and wavy you know the kind of wavy
that<00:06:42.380> doesn't<00:06:42.740> look<00:06:42.830> good<00:06:42.890> by<00:06:43.340> itself<00:06:43.700> like<00:06:44.000> I

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
that doesn't look good by itself like I

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.030 
that doesn't look good by itself like I
have<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:44.480> do<00:06:44.630> something<00:06:45.050> to<00:06:45.410> my<00:06:45.530> hair<00:06:45.770> so

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
have to do something to my hair so

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.890 
have to do something to my hair so
constantly<00:06:46.580> I'm<00:06:46.880> flat<00:06:47.150> ironing<00:06:47.510> it<00:06:47.720> or

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
constantly I'm flat ironing it or

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.130 
constantly I'm flat ironing it or
curling<00:06:48.800> it<00:06:48.950> so<00:06:49.400> obviously<00:06:50.390> my<00:06:50.570> hair<00:06:50.990> is

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
curling it so obviously my hair is

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.070 
curling it so obviously my hair is
pretty<00:06:51.410> damaged<00:06:51.920> with<00:06:52.490> all<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:53.000> process<00:06:53.900> I'm

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
pretty damaged with all the process I'm

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.900 
pretty damaged with all the process I'm
putting<00:06:54.410> it<00:06:54.500> through<00:06:54.740> and<00:06:55.010> all<00:06:55.490> the<00:06:55.520> bleaching

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
putting it through and all the bleaching

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.650 
putting it through and all the bleaching
I've<00:06:56.210> done<00:06:56.450> to<00:06:56.690> it<00:06:57.070> so<00:06:58.070> my<00:06:59.030> hair<00:06:59.210> is<00:06:59.240> gonna<00:06:59.450> be
