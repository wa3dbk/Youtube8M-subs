00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.259 

now<00:00:02.810> let's<00:00:03.020> go<00:00:03.169> down<00:00:03.350> into<00:00:03.589> the<00:00:03.770> sub-object

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:04.269 
now let's go down into the sub-object

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:07.030 
now let's go down into the sub-object
rollouts<00:00:05.269> and<00:00:05.600> see<00:00:05.990> what<00:00:06.109> we<00:00:06.259> can<00:00:06.379> find<00:00:06.649> there

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
rollouts and see what we can find there

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.930 
rollouts and see what we can find there
I'll<00:00:07.790> go<00:00:07.970> to<00:00:08.029> the<00:00:08.330> polygon<00:00:08.930> level

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.929 

here's<00:00:14.570> an<00:00:14.809> extrude<00:00:15.440> and<00:00:15.709> bevel<00:00:15.769> I<00:00:16.550> can<00:00:16.789> use

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
here's an extrude and bevel I can use

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.590 
here's an extrude and bevel I can use
that<00:00:17.090> to<00:00:17.150> make<00:00:17.359> a<00:00:17.420> switch<00:00:17.810> for<00:00:18.020> my<00:00:18.170> flashlight

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
that to make a switch for my flashlight

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.330 
that to make a switch for my flashlight
first<00:00:19.840> I<00:00:19.960> need<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:20.170> go<00:00:20.380> select<00:00:20.710> ignore<00:00:21.130> back

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
first I need to go select ignore back

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.610 
first I need to go select ignore back
facing<00:00:21.940> so<00:00:22.570> that<00:00:22.780> I'm<00:00:22.870> only<00:00:22.990> selecting

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
facing so that I'm only selecting

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.550 
facing so that I'm only selecting
polygons<00:00:24.220> on<00:00:24.490> one<00:00:24.790> side<00:00:25.120> not<00:00:25.660> both<00:00:25.930> sides<00:00:26.290> now

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
polygons on one side not both sides now

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.190 
polygons on one side not both sides now
I'll<00:00:27.370> maximize<00:00:28.180> this

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.800 

my<00:00:31.320> select<00:00:31.710> tool<00:00:31.950> and<00:00:32.250> I'll<00:00:33.240> select

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
my select tool and I'll select

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.810 
my select tool and I'll select
or<00:00:35.410> polygons<00:00:36.160> right<00:00:36.490> there

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.330 

down<00:00:38.970> here<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.980> I'll<00:00:40.980> extrude<00:00:41.610> those<00:00:41.970> two<00:00:43.340> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
down here and I'll extrude those two you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.670 
down here and I'll extrude those two you
notice<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.790> zeroes<00:00:45.120> back<00:00:45.329> out<00:00:45.540> again<00:00:45.720> this<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
notice it zeroes back out again this is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.180 
notice it zeroes back out again this is
a<00:00:46.710> relative<00:00:47.250> extrusion

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
a relative extrusion

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.310 
a relative extrusion
it<00:00:49.820> says<00:00:50.149> how<00:00:50.329> far<00:00:50.570> do<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:50.690> want<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.960> extrude

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
it says how far do you want to extrude

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.220 
it says how far do you want to extrude
from<00:00:51.559> where<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:51.890> are<00:00:52.070> right<00:00:52.280> now<00:00:53.019> so<00:00:54.019> let's

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
from where you are right now so let's

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.900 
from where you are right now so let's
look<00:00:54.289> at<00:00:54.500> that<00:00:54.680> in<00:00:54.860> some<00:00:55.070> other<00:00:55.190> windows<00:00:55.640> here

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
look at that in some other windows here

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.759 
look at that in some other windows here
go<00:00:56.510> down<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:56.930> lower<00:00:57.079> right<00:00:57.350> here<00:00:57.620> and

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
go down to the lower right here and

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.869 
go down to the lower right here and
click<00:00:57.980> on<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.370> minimize<00:00:59.000> maximize<00:00:59.269> toggle

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
click on the minimize maximize toggle

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.270 
click on the minimize maximize toggle
right<00:01:01.879> click<00:01:02.149> in<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.360> perspective<00:01:02.930> viewport

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
right click in the perspective viewport

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.610 
right click in the perspective viewport
arc<00:01:04.280> rotate<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.150> there's<00:01:05.750> my<00:01:05.930> switch

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
arc rotate and there's my switch

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.840 
arc rotate and there's my switch
let's<00:01:08.370> just<00:01:08.900> maximize<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.230> and<00:01:10.640> zoom<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
let's just maximize that and zoom in a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
let's just maximize that and zoom in a
bit<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.870> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.290> could<00:01:13.470> be<00:01:13.530> extruded

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
bit so I think that could be extruded

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.340 
bit so I think that could be extruded
some<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.640> I'll<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.690> type<00:01:16.170> in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
some more I'll just go here and type in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.130 
some more I'll just go here and type in
another<00:01:16.620> two<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:18.210> think<00:01:18.420> another<00:01:18.630> two<00:01:18.960> as

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
another two and I think another two as

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.700 
another two and I think another two as
well<00:01:20.090> now<00:01:21.090> let's<00:01:21.360> bevel<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.960> switch<00:01:22.260> a<00:01:22.470> bit

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
well now let's bevel that switch a bit

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
well now let's bevel that switch a bit
let's<00:01:22.950> make<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> top<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:24.030> little<00:01:24.210> smaller<00:01:24.720> than

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
let's make the top a little smaller than

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.070 
let's make the top a little smaller than
the<00:01:25.530> polygons<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> flashlight<00:01:26.930> just<00:01:27.930> go

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the polygons on the flashlight just go

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080 
the polygons on the flashlight just go
right<00:01:28.260> here<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.650> I'll<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.950> drag<00:01:29.760> that<00:01:29.820> down

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
right here and I'll just drag that down

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.540 
right here and I'll just drag that down
a<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.590> bevel

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.560 

and<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.840> last<00:01:38.050> thing<00:01:38.230> I'd<00:01:38.380> like<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.770> do<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
and the last thing I'd like to do is to

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.140 
and the last thing I'd like to do is to
inset<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.290> top<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.680> little<00:01:41.980> bit<00:01:42.250> here<00:01:42.550> so<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.940> do

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
inset the top a little bit here so to do

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.260 
inset the top a little bit here so to do
that<00:01:43.180> I'm<00:01:43.600> going<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.810> minimize<00:01:44.620> here<00:01:45.270> right

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
that I'm going to minimize here right

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.719 
that I'm going to minimize here right
click<00:01:46.510> in<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.810> top<00:01:46.990> viewport

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.470 

maximize<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
maximize the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.420 
maximize the
I'll<00:01:51.780> change<00:01:52.050> my<00:01:52.110> selection<00:01:52.830> region<00:01:53.250> two

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
I'll change my selection region two

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.270 
I'll change my selection region two
circular<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.500> make<00:01:55.500> sure<00:01:55.530> i<00:01:55.710> still<00:01:56.070> have

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
circular here make sure i still have

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.190 
circular here make sure i still have
ignore<00:01:56.640> back<00:01:56.850> facing<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.570> i<00:01:57.870> do<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.530> just<00:02:00.200> drag

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
ignore back facing on i do and just drag

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.899 
ignore back facing on i do and just drag
out<00:02:01.530> starting<00:02:01.980> from<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.310> very<00:02:02.340> middle

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
out starting from the very middle

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.669 
out starting from the very middle
so<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.060> selected<00:02:04.570> some<00:02:04.780> polygons<00:02:05.259> I<00:02:05.409> didn't

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
so I selected some polygons I didn't

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.679 
so I selected some polygons I didn't
want<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.130> I'll<00:02:06.429> just<00:02:06.819> hold<00:02:07.030> down<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.390> alt<00:02:07.569> key

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
want to I'll just hold down the alt key

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.190 
want to I'll just hold down the alt key
and<00:02:08.250> click<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.429> those<00:02:09.580> one<00:02:09.879> by<00:02:09.910> one<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.989> those

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
and click on those one by one so those

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.140 
and click on those one by one so those
are<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.410> polygons<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.280> want<00:02:12.610> let's<00:02:12.940> go<00:02:13.090> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
are the polygons that I want let's go to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.490 
are the polygons that I want let's go to
the<00:02:13.269> other<00:02:13.360> windows<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.989> see<00:02:14.140> if<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.349> have

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
the other windows and see if I have

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.259 
the other windows and see if I have
anything<00:02:14.739> else<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.310> don't<00:02:15.489> want<00:02:15.730> yes<00:02:16.150> I

anything else that I don't want yes I

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.990 
anything else that I don't want yes I
have<00:02:16.420> quite<00:02:16.599> a<00:02:16.660> lot<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.650> just<00:02:18.160> click<00:02:18.700> over

here and maximize that so that's an
