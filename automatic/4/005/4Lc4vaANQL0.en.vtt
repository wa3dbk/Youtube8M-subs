00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
gonna take a quick look at how to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.499 
gonna take a quick look at how to
eliminate<00:00:11.330> Mouse<00:00:12.330> lag<00:00:13.130> while<00:00:14.130> using<00:00:14.519> vsync

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
eliminate Mouse lag while using vsync

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.830 
eliminate Mouse lag while using vsync
let's<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:22.400> alright<00:00:23.400> first<00:00:23.670> off<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:24.480> know

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
let's do this alright first off we know

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.980 
let's do this alright first off we know
what<00:00:25.170> vsync<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:26.750> vsync<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
what vsync is and if you don't vsync is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.679 
what vsync is and if you don't vsync is
vertical<00:00:28.949> singing<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:30.090> keep<00:00:30.300> your

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
vertical singing it's to keep your

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.540 
vertical singing it's to keep your
images<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:31.920> video<00:00:32.820> games<00:00:33.230> from

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
images on your video games from

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.090 
images on your video games from
splitting<00:00:35.550> basically<00:00:36.800> when<00:00:37.800> you're<00:00:37.950> going

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
splitting basically when you're going

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.740 
splitting basically when you're going
across<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.550> screen<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> smooth<00:00:39.510> like

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
across the screen it's a smooth like

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.959 
across the screen it's a smooth like
this<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:41.540> screen<00:00:42.540> rate<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> higher<00:00:43.200> than

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
this if your screen rate is higher than

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
this if your screen rate is higher than
or<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.510> frame<00:00:45.780> rate<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.260> higher<00:00:46.440> than

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
or if your frame rate is higher than

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.869 
or if your frame rate is higher than
your<00:00:46.739> refresh<00:00:47.039> rate<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> end<00:00:47.789> up

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
your refresh rate you're going to end up

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.720 
your refresh rate you're going to end up
getting<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:49.070> little<00:00:50.070> caring<00:00:50.579> actions

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
getting a little caring actions

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.959 
getting a little caring actions
basically<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:53.539> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:55.379> this

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
basically like that you can you do this

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.010 
basically like that you can you do this
one<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.090> two<00:00:57.210> different<00:00:57.329> programs<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.899> can

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
one or two different programs you can

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.049 
one or two different programs you can
use<00:00:58.079> both<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> same<00:00:59.340> thing<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.879> if

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
use both to do the same thing you can if

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.260 
use both to do the same thing you can if
you've<00:01:00.239> got<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.530> video<00:01:01.530> card<00:01:01.800> by<00:01:02.039> EVGA<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.059> can

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you've got a video card by EVGA you can

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
you've got a video card by EVGA you can
use<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.019> EVGA<00:01:04.500> precision<00:01:05.280> X<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.820> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
use the EVGA precision X to do it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.060 
use the EVGA precision X to do it
otherwise<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.260> download<00:01:07.439> an<00:01:07.680> MSI

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
otherwise you can download an MSI

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
otherwise you can download an MSI
Afterburner<00:01:08.939> from<00:01:09.840> MSI<00:01:10.500> column<00:01:11.689> what<00:01:12.689> you're

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
Afterburner from MSI column what you're

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.499 
Afterburner from MSI column what you're
going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> end<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.140> actually<00:01:13.350> doing<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:14.509> you're

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
going to end up actually doing is you're

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.100 
going to end up actually doing is you're
going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.049> set<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:18.180> framerate<00:01:18.509> limiter

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
going to set the framerate limiter

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.570 
going to set the framerate limiter
you're<00:01:19.380> gonna<00:01:19.470> set<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> framerate<00:01:20.040> limiter

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you're gonna set the framerate limiter

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
you're gonna set the framerate limiter
to<00:01:21.409> 58<00:01:22.409> frames<00:01:22.799> per<00:01:23.070> second<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:25.070> what<00:01:26.070> that's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
to 58 frames per second and what that's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
to 58 frames per second and what that's
gonna<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:26.880> gonna<00:01:27.090> lock<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.810> frame

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
gonna do is that's gonna lock your frame

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.140 
gonna do is that's gonna lock your frame

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
rate from going over 60 this is only

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.649 
rate from going over 60 this is only
effective<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.140> monitor<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.159> 60<00:01:35.700> Hertz<00:01:35.729> it

was 120 Hertz you don't worry about this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.160 
was 120 Hertz you don't worry about this
going<00:01:39.170> sorry<00:01:40.170> though<00:01:41.630> otherwise<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.020> go

going sorry though otherwise you go
ahead<00:01:43.320> first<00:01:43.649> set<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.390> frame<00:01:45.390> rate<00:01:45.450> limiter

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
ahead first set your frame rate limiter

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.580 
ahead first set your frame rate limiter
or<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.470> max<00:01:46.680> frames<00:01:47.009> per<00:01:47.430> second<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.960> 58<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
or your max frames per second to 58 you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.280 
or your max frames per second to 58 you
could<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.100> 60<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.170> not
