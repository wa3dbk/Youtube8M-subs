00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.380
 Hello dear viewers with you 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.110
 hardar and welcome to 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.820
 construction of a summer house yes this 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.220
 the house will be located on a tree and 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.320
 the first thing I wanted to show you is how 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.210
 grow huge trees and they 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.500
 will be very beautiful and so us 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:27.779
 will need any semi block unit also 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.460
 sprout tree and this oak and bone meal 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.160
 for starters probably choose strong 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.109
 a place that is more where you want 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.929
 build this house well this is your way 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.859
 taste and so for a start we build more truly 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.429
 make blanks 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:44.219
 frame can be said for these trees 1 1 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:48.760
 2 3 raise for that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.949
 now go two three three 5 5 6 and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.309
 the seventh unit we put the same thing too 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.839
 3 height and here we 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.359
 asymmetrically possible either here either 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.659
 start counting here two times 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:06.970
 three 4 5 and 6 blocks set 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:10.570
 such a thing 3 height and now we do 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.300
 digging put the germ here again 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.100
 do the digging and make the germ digging 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.540
 sprout and deed now such curls 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.070
 look here should stay 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.040
 one block that is here fits 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.580
 any block set here here and here 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.010
 go up here 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.310
 upstairs and here we have left the floor 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:35.260
 block 5 we close we close we close 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.620
 here we repeat the operation from this side 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.600
 do the same thing but why I decided 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.520
 make on big trees not on 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.580
 little ones just for little friends 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.560
 nothing fits my man's 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.480
 the judges say yes you can 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.010
 small place your mobile home I 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.130
 I will say I want to make a big beautiful 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.159
 summer house I think you will also like it 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.560
 more that he will be the majority 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.450
 almost the whole house will be made of boards but also a couple 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.350
 decorative items in general beauty 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 and only 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.179
 and how to get out of here 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.250
 here, too, we remove and that's what she 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.230
 held friends is the most important thing 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.739
 now you can close the aisles 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.069
 because they will get in our way and 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.599
 let's take bone dust or flour and 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.940
 click on the trees it will take some 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:30.470
 let's wait in time for those who play 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.840
 ordinary survival is also not supposed to be you 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.560
 should n't make it harder here 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.819
 the tree is not really the one that was expected 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.890
 so if you don't like her you can 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.180
 in principle, and remove it 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.599
 so here is not well, well, let's not like it 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.269
 also cut down a chance that will appear here 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.329
 tree but what is it like to us 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.680
 need much more than that chance and if 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.840
 we 'll just sprout and 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.099
 push push push infinity 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.340
 until blue in the face that's just here he seems to be 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:04.280
 generated is generated randomly and well 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.590
 well again this is a tree well let's 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.989
 try your luck here just this yet 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.850
 depends on the territory at a certain 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.630
 territory grows a certain tree 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:20.170
 and most often so let's 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:23.389
 let's try here I accelerate with both hands 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.819
 so everything about yes is exactly what we need 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:30.200
 look at these trees with us 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:35.569
 should 3 3 pieces work out here 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.660
 also accelerate so much 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.010
 so so to say fine no stop she 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.790
 It turned out to be small in general 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.819
 tiny 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.200
 this what is this this baby 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.349
 it's not even a tree so let's again 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.349
 try 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.730
 again there is no stop this here this to us 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.180
 what you need she gets great too 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.490
 and all this is just three trees of us 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.190
 it only happened for some reason 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.080
 very small but in principle 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.600
 account of one tree it closes so 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.560
 that reserve as there it looks 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.090
 all very cool friends if you 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.470
 somehow this tutorial was useful even 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.239
 can be called like that for growing 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.680
 big trees then like 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.830
 be sure to tell your friends and 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.970
 keep watching the next issue 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:34.010
 all while swami was a holder 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.010
