breathe<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:01.030> single<00:02:01.420> panel<00:02:01.780> they<00:02:01.899> end<00:02:02.079> up<00:02:02.200> about

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
breathe a single panel they end up about

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.469 
breathe a single panel they end up about
a<00:02:02.469> half<00:02:02.679> inch<00:02:02.979> from<00:02:03.130> each<00:02:03.369> end<00:02:03.729> they'll<00:02:04.390> go

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
a half inch from each end they'll go

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.569 
a half inch from each end they'll go
ahead<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:04.810> stab<00:02:05.079> that<00:02:05.319> down<00:02:05.590> pull<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.159> over

I'm<00:02:46.240> going<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.540> trim<00:02:46.840> away<00:02:47.220> leaving<00:02:48.220> enough

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
I'm going to trim away leaving enough

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.750 
I'm going to trim away leaving enough
excess<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.170> pull<00:02:50.560> out<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.800> cord

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
excess so that I can pull out a cord

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.860 
excess so that I can pull out a cord
that's<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.270> good<00:02:52.480> size<00:02:52.720> cord<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:55.420> cord<00:02:55.450> is

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
that's a good size cord and the cord is

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.540

within<00:02:56.050> these<00:02:56.440> shearing<00:02:56.800> strips<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.430> it's

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
within these shearing strips and it's

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.120 
within these shearing strips and it's
gonna<00:02:57.700> be<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.850> little<00:02:57.940> tricky<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.740> can<00:02:59.890> see

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
gonna be a little tricky but you can see

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.710 
gonna be a little tricky but you can see
and<00:03:00.340> you'll<00:03:00.520> fish<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.820> out<00:03:00.910> with<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.120> pin<00:03:01.450> like

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
and you'll fish it out with a pin like

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.770 
and you'll fish it out with a pin like
that<00:03:01.990> pull<00:03:02.320> out<00:03:02.350> both<00:03:02.709> cords<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.580> then<00:03:04.360> trim

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
that pull out both cords and then trim

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.470 
that pull out both cords and then trim
away<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.080> about<00:03:05.410> an<00:03:05.590> inch<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.270> tuck<00:03:07.270> this

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
away to about an inch and tuck this

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
away to about an inch and tuck this
under<00:03:07.990> and<00:03:08.260> tie<00:03:08.860> off<00:03:09.070> your<00:03:09.400> cords<00:03:10.300> so<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.350> have

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500

ahead and pull up this tape to show you
what<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.540> tape<00:03:19.720> looks<00:03:20.019> like<00:03:20.290> when<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.590> pull

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
what the tape looks like when you pull

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.020 
what the tape looks like when you pull
up<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.160> gathering<00:03:21.640> cords<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.640> can<00:03:24.760> get<00:03:24.880> an

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
up the gathering cords so you can get an

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.290 
up the gathering cords so you can get an
idea<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:26.250> how<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.400> works<00:03:27.610> I've<00:03:27.880> pulled<00:03:28.090> these

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
idea of how it works I've pulled these

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.600 
idea of how it works I've pulled these
cords<00:03:28.690> out<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.590> when<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.800> pull<00:03:30.100> this<00:03:30.340> up

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
cords out so when you pull this up

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.070 
cords out so when you pull this up
you're<00:03:31.360> creating<00:03:31.989> this<00:03:32.459> wavy<00:03:33.570> look<00:03:34.570> it's<00:03:34.840> sort

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
you're creating this wavy look it's sort

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.680 
you're creating this wavy look it's sort
of<00:03:35.140> like<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.320> ripple<00:03:35.800> fold<00:03:36.070> panel<00:03:36.610> so<00:03:37.510> you're

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
of like a ripple fold panel so you're

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.050 
of like a ripple fold panel so you're
creating<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.410> look<00:03:38.590> of<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.280> very<00:03:39.580> modern

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
creating the look of a very modern

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.310 
creating the look of a very modern
ripple<00:03:40.660> fold<00:03:40.870> panel<00:03:42.299> but<00:03:43.299> you're<00:03:43.900> not<00:03:44.049> having

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
ripple fold panel but you're not having

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.949 
ripple fold panel but you're not having
to<00:03:44.560> use<00:03:44.709> ripple<00:03:45.070> fold<00:03:45.280> track<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.630> ripple

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
to use ripple fold track and the ripple

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.229 
to use ripple fold track and the ripple
fold<00:03:47.170> tape<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.070> get<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.340> really<00:03:48.640> pretty

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
fold tape so you get this really pretty

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.590 
fold tape so you get this really pretty
serpentine<00:03:50.140> look<00:03:50.830> and<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:52.209> will<00:03:52.360> be<00:03:52.450> the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
serpentine look and this will be the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.920 
serpentine look and this will be the
front<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:54.370> sharing<00:03:54.730> cords<00:03:55.090> allow<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.510> to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
front and the sharing cords allow you to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.640 
front and the sharing cords allow you to
arrange<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:57.340> ripple<00:03:57.880> appearance<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
arrange the ripple appearance and the

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.199 
arrange the ripple appearance and the
fullness<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.070> you<00:04:00.370> want<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:00.820> you<00:04:00.910> can<00:04:00.940> have

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
fullness that you want so you can have

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.690
