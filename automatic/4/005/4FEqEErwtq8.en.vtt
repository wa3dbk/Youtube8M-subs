the<00:00:02.700> macbook<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.650> our<00:00:04.650> most<00:00:04.799> popular<00:00:05.160> Mac<00:00:06.200> but

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
the macbook is our most popular Mac but

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.070 
the macbook is our most popular Mac but
what<00:00:07.379> we've<00:00:07.589> what<00:00:08.160> we've<00:00:08.220> done<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.870> we've

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
what we've what we've done and and we've

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.980 
what we've what we've done and and we've
made<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> habit<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.830> doing<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.309> Apple<00:00:11.670> is

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
made a habit of doing this it Apple is

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.430 
made a habit of doing this it Apple is
is<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.380> decided<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> start<00:00:14.969> over

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.400 

the<00:00:19.010> new<00:00:19.160> macbook<00:00:19.430> is<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.910> quite<00:00:20.300> remarkable

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.100 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable
engineering<00:00:21.430> achievement<00:00:22.780> it<00:00:23.780> really

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
engineering achievement it really

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.820 
engineering achievement it really
represents<00:00:25.070> just<00:00:26.030> a<00:00:26.180> complete<00:00:26.630> revolution<00:00:27.619> in

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
represents just a complete revolution in

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:40.360 
represents just a complete revolution in
the<00:00:28.400> way<00:00:28.430> that<00:00:28.700> notebooks<00:00:29.090> are<00:00:29.210> made

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.920 

and<00:00:41.370> traditionally<00:00:41.640> notebooks<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.690> made

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and traditionally notebooks are made

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.030 
and traditionally notebooks are made
from<00:00:43.670> multiple<00:00:44.670> parts<00:00:45.500> but<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> problem<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
from multiple parts but the problem is

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.580 
from multiple parts but the problem is
when<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.970> multiple<00:00:48.420> parts<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.440> add

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
when you have multiple parts you you add

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.000 
when you have multiple parts you you add
size<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.430> weight<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.230> increase<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
size and weight and and you increase the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.370 
size and weight and and you increase the
opportunity<00:00:53.580> for<00:00:53.610> failure<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.330> that<00:00:55.200> the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
opportunity for failure and that the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.950 
opportunity for failure and that the
huge<00:00:56.070> breakthrough<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.420> heard<00:00:57.690> with

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
huge breakthrough that we heard with

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.950 
huge breakthrough that we heard with
with<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.170> macbook<00:00:58.820> was<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.000> replace<00:01:00.360> all<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
with the macbook was to replace all of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.250 
with the macbook was to replace all of
those<00:01:01.110> parts<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.760> part<00:01:03.060> and<00:01:03.480> at

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
those parts with just one part and at

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.520 
those parts with just one part and at
one<00:01:04.440> part<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.860> called<00:01:05.130> the<00:01:05.220> unibody<00:01:06.530> we

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
one part we called the unibody we

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.430 
one part we called the unibody we
figured<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.160> way<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.869> being<00:01:09.869> able<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.260> make

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
figured out a way of being able to make

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.920 
figured out a way of being able to make
make<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.369> notebook<00:01:11.930> fundamentally

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
make make the notebook fundamentally

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.850 
make make the notebook fundamentally
thinner<00:01:13.310> lighter<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:15.240> robust<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.020> with

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
thinner lighter more robust and with

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.010 
thinner lighter more robust and with
sort<00:01:17.190> of<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> degree<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.090> fit<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> finish

sort of a degree of a fit and finish

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.810 
sort of a degree of a fit and finish
that<00:01:19.170> we've<00:01:19.590> we've<00:01:19.860> never<00:01:20.160> even<00:01:20.340> dreamed<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that we've we've never even dreamed of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.160 
that we've we've never even dreamed of
before<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:23.040> only<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.330> make<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.930> one

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
before and the only way to make that one

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.500 
before and the only way to make that one
part<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.250> machine<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> single

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
part was to machine it from a single

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.680 
part was to machine it from a single
piece<00:01:27.690> of<00:01:27.750> aluminium<00:01:32.330> aluminium<00:01:33.330> was<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
piece of aluminium aluminium was the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.359 
piece of aluminium aluminium was the
ideal<00:01:34.020> choice<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.410> this<00:01:34.619> product<00:01:35.009> because<00:01:35.190> it

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
entirely from glass we've even managed

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.590 
entirely from glass we've even managed
to<00:04:59.250> get<00:04:59.340> rid<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.700> separate<00:05:00.000> button<00:05:00.330> that

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
to get rid of the separate button that

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.180 
to get rid of the separate button that
stole<00:05:00.870> space<00:05:01.110> from<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.380> tracking<00:05:01.800> surface

stole space from the tracking surface

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.250 
stole space from the tracking surface
and<00:05:02.370> we<00:05:02.970> did<00:05:03.150> that<00:05:03.360> by<00:05:03.570> making<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.140> entire

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
and we did that by making the entire

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.120 
and we did that by making the entire
glass<00:05:04.770> trackpad<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.670> button<00:05:06.950> we<00:05:07.950> were

glass trackpad the button we were
working<00:05:08.370> for<00:05:08.760> months<00:05:09.030> developing<00:05:09.690> just<00:05:09.900> the

working for months developing just the

working for months developing just the
right<00:05:10.200> texture<00:05:11.360> just<00:05:12.360> so<00:05:12.480> that<00:05:12.660> the

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
right texture just so that the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.720 
right texture just so that the
