00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
they're called mana block mixer taps

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.680 
they're called mana block mixer taps
they<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.230> see<00:00:16.440> them<00:00:16.650> there<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.600> there's<00:00:18.600> a

not<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.809> easy<00:00:57.930> job<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.410> showing<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.739> by<00:00:59.039> some

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
not an easy job I'm showing you by some

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.510 
not an easy job I'm showing you by some
taps<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.750> quite<00:01:01.020> easily<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.620> your

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
taps but it can quite easily be your

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.789 
taps but it can quite easily be your
bath<00:01:02.730> taps<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.809> you've<00:01:03.989> got<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> mixer<00:01:04.650> type

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
bath taps if you've got this mixer type

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
bath taps if you've got this mixer type
or<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.760> sink<00:01:06.270> tap<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
or it can be the sink tap but this

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.810 
or it can be the sink tap but this
covers<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.439> three<00:01:07.680> ruining<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.310> just

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
covers all three ruining I've just

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.350 
covers all three ruining I've just
decided<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.439> sink<00:01:10.710> taps<00:01:11.010> okay<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
decided to do the sink taps okay in the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.840 
decided to do the sink taps okay in the
basin<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:14.310> we're<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.760> about

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
basin so what we're going to do about

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.140 
basin so what we're going to do about
this<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.960> couple<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.290> options<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
this now there's a couple of options and

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
this now there's a couple of options and
you<00:01:18.150> may<00:01:18.570> find<00:01:18.960> when<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> look<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.369> underneath

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you may find when you look up underneath

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.770 
you may find when you look up underneath
the<00:01:20.909> basin<00:01:21.390> apart<00:01:22.380> LeMay<00:01:22.740> finds<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> big<00:01:23.610> nut<00:01:23.909> if

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the basin apart LeMay finds a big nut if

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
the basin apart LeMay finds a big nut if
you've<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> big<00:01:25.200> nut<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> answer<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you've got a big nut then the answer is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:27.710 
you've got a big nut then the answer is
very<00:01:26.970> simple

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
very simple

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
one of these to tidy up with and this is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.249 
one of these to tidy up with and this is
what<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> also<00:01:33.210> need<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> called<00:01:33.990> bison

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
what you also need is of called bison

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.950 
what you also need is of called bison
spanner<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.009> you've<00:01:35.610> got<00:01:35.850> single<00:01:36.329> hole<00:01:36.600> taps

spanner if you've got single hole taps

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
spanner if you've got single hole taps
that<00:01:37.200> go<00:01:37.320> through<00:01:37.650> because<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.280> enough

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that go through because they have enough

this is this one okay now we're going to

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.970 
this is this one okay now we're going to
stick<00:04:01.190> aside<00:04:01.489> these<00:04:01.640> awkward<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.299> do<00:04:02.650> show<00:04:03.650> how

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980

stick aside these awkward to do show how
it<00:04:04.190> goes<00:04:04.780> get<00:04:05.780> myself<00:04:06.049> up<00:04:06.260> there<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.549> it's

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
it goes get myself up there and it's

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.920 
it goes get myself up there and it's
been<00:04:07.940> up

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
been up

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.440 
been up
yeah<00:04:12.120> okay<00:04:13.319> this<00:04:14.319> panel<00:04:14.740> on<00:04:14.970> round<00:04:15.970> fit<00:04:16.209> goes

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
yeah okay this panel on round fit goes

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.509 
yeah okay this panel on round fit goes
on<00:04:16.720> only<00:04:17.440> goes<00:04:17.590> on<00:04:17.769> in<00:04:17.920> that<00:04:18.040> position<00:04:18.220> it's

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
on only goes on in that position it's

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.039 
on only goes on in that position it's
probably<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.790> little<00:04:18.880> bit<00:04:19.060> awkward<00:04:19.209> -<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.840> do

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
probably a little bit awkward - you do

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.160 
probably a little bit awkward - you do
it<00:04:20.230> one<00:04:20.890> time<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.160> get<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.400> other<00:04:21.549> spot<00:04:22.170> and

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
it one time to get the other spot and

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.800 
it one time to get the other spot and
walk<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.530> on<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:23.950> one<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:25.360> then<00:04:25.570> we've<00:04:25.690> got

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
walk it on to that one so then we've got

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.680 
walk it on to that one so then we've got
to<00:04:27.840> expand<00:04:28.840> on<00:04:29.370> we<00:04:30.370> can<00:04:30.550> now<00:04:30.700> turn<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:31.180> me<00:04:31.480> down

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
to expand on we can now turn it me down

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.950 
to expand on we can now turn it me down
here<00:04:32.020> it's<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.320> lot<00:04:32.440> easier<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.980> do<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.840> very

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
here it's a lot easier to do it's very

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.790 
here it's a lot easier to do it's very
open<00:04:35.470> up<00:04:35.650> now<00:04:35.890> and<00:04:36.820> we<00:04:37.090> can<00:04:37.300> now<00:04:37.480> get<00:04:37.750> only<00:04:38.560> one

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
open up now and we can now get only one

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.100 
open up now and we can now get only one
hand<00:04:39.040> so<00:04:39.490> I'm<00:04:39.669> doing<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.570> tighten<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.050> with

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
hand so I'm doing and tighten it with

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.530 
hand so I'm doing and tighten it with
his<00:04:41.320> other<00:04:41.470> hand<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:42.730> we'll<00:04:42.970> just<00:04:43.360> tighten

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
his other hand and we'll just tighten
