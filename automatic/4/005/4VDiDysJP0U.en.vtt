 description 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.100
 girls all big hello today 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.200
 I decided to write this well as we say in 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.190
 forehead small as I paint my hair and 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.220
 I have 2 basmas here 1 henna 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:51.340
 further we need to add approximately 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:59.059
 a tablespoon of coffee on the eye 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:02.480
 add and then we fill it all 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.780
 boiling water pour in principle more or less 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.390
 first by eye and then by as 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.759
 it's all with us 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.060
 stirred we will add more 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.720
 I will stir the water 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.940
 so here 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.790
 brush of course substance i would say 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.050
 and not very nice i will drive but you know 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.170
 I can tell what staining is she 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.780
 very useful meaning it channels 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.820
 accelerates hair growth protects against dandruff 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.429
 Basma is the same that is all this 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.119
 natural ingredients and coffee we 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:45.920
 add more color 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:49.039
 chocolate stir here and I see here 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.560
 what else do I need well just a little to 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.479
 the substance itself was still a little bit more 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.050
 liquid to make it easier for the carrier to 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.099
 the hair is like this 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.640
 we stir cover with a plate 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.700
 any or 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.920
 the lid just better is not important and 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.230
 leave for about 15-20 minutes to 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.940
 let's say our paint is worn out 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.130
 camera over some kind of green tint 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.290
 attack on more paint itself more 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.060
 marsh smells nice way that is 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.150
 the smell is not nasty so there is no 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.160
 such on those he fashion smell like from 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.500
 many colors so on this one 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.650
 smell say so few who may be 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.560
 allergy here but in principle it's all we 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.350
 right now we leave steaming and when 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:51.950
 it's all for the police you 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:55.370
 we basically made this potion 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.000
 she looks certainly very nice 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.220
 but no matter the color will be very 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.720
 beautiful and so now i will be all 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.890
 apply the same brush 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.100
 of course it is advisable to work in gloves 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.560
 because it doesnâ€™t leave them on and 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.990
 Basma puts of course your small 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.730
 palm shade will be slightly different 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.090
 the color is the problem itself what is under 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.430
 nails will remain the temple well it's me 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.820
 I think anything bad can be by yourself 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.530
 packages so not very serious further all 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.580
 this is where you want 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:38.050
 under the mastic under the cap and I dress 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:41.720
 top of an old hat on a young man 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.550
 wear a hat and so go out for two hours if 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.130
 we want so saturated beautiful 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.510
 shade if we want a little 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.510
 you can sit for an hour 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.990
 but
