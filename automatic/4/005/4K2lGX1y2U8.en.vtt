point<00:02:14.550> seven<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:16.250> defense<00:02:18.470> 0.7<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:22.890> is

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
point seven and defense 0.7 so here is

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.400 
point seven and defense 0.7 so here is
the<00:02:23.100> bay<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.520> won't<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.630> battling<00:02:25.050> with<00:02:25.260> this

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
the bay I won't be battling with this

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.509 
the bay I won't be battling with this
because<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.390> spray-painted<00:02:28.260> wheel<00:02:28.519> may

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
because it is a spray-painted wheel may

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.280 
because it is a spray-painted wheel may
be<00:02:29.580> hard<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.910> see<00:02:30.000> but<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.690> nightmare<00:02:30.930> wheel

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
be hard to see but the nightmare wheel

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.460 
be hard to see but the nightmare wheel
is<00:02:31.910> spray-painted<00:02:32.910> it's<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.019> light<00:02:34.230> brown

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
is spray-painted it's like a light brown

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.120 
is spray-painted it's like a light brown
color<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:36.600> spin<00:02:36.840> track<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.320> change<00:02:37.800> I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
color and the spin track can change I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.250 
color and the spin track can change I
think<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.269> defense<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:41.400> attack<00:02:42.260> not

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
think this is defense and the attack not

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.250 
think this is defense and the attack not
sure<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:43.860> called<00:02:44.100> down<00:02:44.930> yeah<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.959> tack

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
sure what it's called down yeah a tack

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.850 
sure what it's called down yeah a tack
in<00:02:46.290> defense

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.460 

so<00:02:49.860> here's<00:02:50.160> attack<00:02:50.550> mode<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:53.569> here's<00:02:54.569> defense

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
so here's attack mode and here's defense

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.680 
so here's attack mode and here's defense
mode
