called<00:01:33.420> celebrities<00:01:34.280> it's<00:01:35.280> exciting<00:01:35.790> it's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
called celebrities it's exciting it's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
called celebrities it's exciting it's
really<00:01:36.119> cool<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> something<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.619> said

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
really cool and something like you said

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.410
