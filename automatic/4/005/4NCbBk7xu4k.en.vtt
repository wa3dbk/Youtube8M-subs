so<00:05:50.790> what<00:05:51.419> I'd<00:05:51.570> like<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:51.870> do<00:05:52.230> is<00:05:52.470> go<00:05:52.680> around<00:05:52.830> and

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
so what I'd like to do is go around and

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.240 
so what I'd like to do is go around and
demonstrate<00:05:53.970> on<00:05:54.720> everyone<00:05:55.260> come<00:05:55.890> on<00:05:56.070> John

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
demonstrate on everyone come on John

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.040 
demonstrate on everyone come on John
this<00:05:56.370> is<00:05:56.550> not<00:05:56.790> going<00:05:57.000> away<00:05:57.300> when<00:05:57.660> you<00:05:57.720> sound

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
this is not going away when you sound

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.420 
this is not going away when you sound
instead<00:05:58.500> projects<00:05:59.040> units<00:05:59.490> you<00:05:59.640> need<00:05:59.910> to<00:06:01.430> sit

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
instead projects units you need to sit

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.460
