videos<00:00:09.150> with<00:00:10.110> middle<00:00:10.590> kind<00:00:10.740> positions<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.780> I

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
videos with middle kind positions and I

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.470 
videos with middle kind positions and I
decided<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.460> do<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> few<00:00:14.820> more<00:00:15.000> now<00:00:15.179> so

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
minutes to have a good look at the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.040 
minutes to have a good look at the
position<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:47.120> when<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> decision

you how this game continued alright so

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.119 
you how this game continued alright so
you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.579> pause<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> video<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.129> we'll

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you can pause the video now and we'll

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.920 
you can pause the video now and we'll
continue<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.239> moment

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.600 

all<00:01:06.930> right<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.590> what's<00:01:07.920> happening<00:01:08.220> here

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
all right so what's happening here

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.120 
all right so what's happening here
Black<00:01:09.180> has<00:01:09.510> clearly<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.200> better<00:01:10.409> position<00:01:10.650> here

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
Black has clearly a better position here

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.280 
Black has clearly a better position here
because<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> control<00:01:12.270> over<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.780> C<00:01:12.990> file

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
because of the control over the C file

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.030 
because of the control over the C file
this<00:01:14.220> C<00:01:14.490> file<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.500> absolutely<00:01:16.500> controlled<00:01:16.920> by

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this C file is absolutely controlled by

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.210 
this C file is absolutely controlled by
black<00:01:17.310> there<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.820> nothing<00:01:18.360> why<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
black there is nothing why it can do to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
black there is nothing why it can do to
gain<00:01:20.430> control<00:01:20.970> over<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.450> open<00:01:21.810> file<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
gain control over this open file now the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.760 
gain control over this open file now the
question<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.280> how<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.049> exploit<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:27.770> probably

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
question is how to exploit this probably

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
question is how to exploit this probably
you<00:01:30.110> thought<00:01:31.110> about<00:01:31.579> two<00:01:32.579> different<00:01:32.759> moves<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you thought about two different moves I

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.550 
you thought about two different moves I
think<00:01:34.619> those<00:01:34.829> two<00:01:35.159> moves<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> two<00:01:37.290> most

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
think those two moves are the two most

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.640 
think those two moves are the two most
important<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.750> position<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> them

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
important in this position one of them

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.050 
important in this position one of them
is<00:01:40.890> Queen<00:01:41.250> 2x<00:01:41.549> t3<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.610> other<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
is Queen 2x t3 and the other one is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.960 
is Queen 2x t3 and the other one is
before<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:47.210> perhaps<00:01:48.619> remove<00:01:49.619> more<00:01:50.460> passive

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
before and perhaps remove more passive

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
before and perhaps remove more passive
move<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.360> Bishop<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> d6<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.530> improve<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
move like Bishop to d6 would improve the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.300 
move like Bishop to d6 would improve the
position<00:01:53.610> also<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.939> bit<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.320> very

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
position also a bit but not really very

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.560 
position also a bit but not really very
very<00:01:57.180> actively<00:01:57.860> let's<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> look<00:01:59.250> at<00:01:59.570> b4

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
very actively let's have a look at b4

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.380 
very actively let's have a look at b4
first<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.829> game<00:02:02.009> by<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.490> way<00:02:02.640> Queen<00:02:03.180> takes

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
first in the game by the way Queen takes

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.780 
first in the game by the way Queen takes
d3<00:02:03.899> was<00:02:04.079> played<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.860> let's<00:02:05.100> first<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
d3 was played but let's first have a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.479 
d3 was played but let's first have a
look<00:02:05.880> at<00:02:06.180> what<00:02:06.479> happens<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.140> play<00:02:07.259> d4<00:02:08.160> here

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
look at what happens if you play d4 here

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.229 
look at what happens if you play d4 here
with<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> idea<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.750> sort<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.200> capturing<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:11.239> a3

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
with the idea of sort of capturing on a3

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.100 
with the idea of sort of capturing on a3
and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.780> have

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
and then have

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.990 
and then have
this<00:02:13.290> week<00:02:13.710> born<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.280> three<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:14.880> can

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
this week born on a three that we can

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.760 
this week born on a three that we can
attack<00:02:15.300> later<00:02:16.730> here<00:02:17.730> why<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.060> could<00:02:18.810> take<00:02:19.380> on

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
attack later here why to could take on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.430 
attack later here why to could take on
c4<00:02:20.610> with<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> Queen<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.750> after<00:02:22.080> rook<00:02:22.230> takes

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
c4 with the Queen and after rook takes

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.590 
c4 with the Queen and after rook takes
Queen<00:02:22.590> then<00:02:23.040> taken<00:02:23.460> before<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:25.490> if<00:02:26.490> we<00:02:26.670> take

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
Queen then taken before and if we take

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.740 
Queen then taken before and if we take
back<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> bishop<00:02:29.510> attacking<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> rook

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
back with the bishop attacking the rook

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.640 
back with the bishop attacking the rook
on<00:02:30.900> T<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.470> work<00:02:32.250> simply<00:02:32.640> moves<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.060> e2

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
on T to work simply moves to e2

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.070 
on T to work simply moves to e2
now<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.710> problem<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.550> position<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.300> that

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
now the problem in this position is that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.650 
now the problem in this position is that
it's<00:02:37.710> very<00:02:37.800> difficult<00:02:38.310> for<00:02:38.850> black<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.120> attack

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
it's very difficult for black to attack

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.440 
it's very difficult for black to attack
this<00:02:39.870> B<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.230> pawn<00:02:40.470> because<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.610> white<00:02:41.850> rook<00:02:42.180> is

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
this B to pawn because the white rook is

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.370 
this B to pawn because the white rook is
on<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.170> second<00:02:43.800> rank<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:44.700> he<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.540> controlling

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
on this second rank so he is controlling

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.540 
on this second rank so he is controlling
this<00:02:46.560> e2<00:02:46.950> square<00:02:48.560> now<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:49.770> we<00:02:49.920> compare<00:02:50.310> this

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
this e2 square now if we compare this

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.640 
this e2 square now if we compare this
position<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.750> happens<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> game

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
position with what happens in the game

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.690 
position with what happens in the game
you<00:02:53.340> will<00:02:53.489> understand<00:02:54.030> why<00:02:54.709> Queen<00:02:55.709> takes<00:02:55.980> d3

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
you will understand why Queen takes d3

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.240 
you will understand why Queen takes d3
is<00:02:57.209> such<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.600> much<00:02:58.410> better<00:02:58.709> move<00:02:59.060> Quint<00:03:00.060> xt3

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
is such a much better move Quint xt3

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.380 
is such a much better move Quint xt3
rook<00:03:02.250> takes<00:03:02.459> t3<00:03:02.910> now<00:03:03.630> we<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.820> white<00:03:06.060> rook

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
rook takes t3 now we have the white rook

moving this King for example to f1 or PG

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.390 
moving this King for example to f1 or PG
one<00:03:57.150> then<00:03:57.930> we<00:03:58.110> simply<00:03:58.470> win<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.709> home<00:03:58.890> only<00:03:59.100> for

one then we simply win a home only for

right F takes e4 take only for in the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.289 
right F takes e4 take only for in the
table<00:04:03.390> form<00:04:03.780> we<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.019> own<00:04:04.320> a<00:04:04.350> pawn<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.519> that

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
table form we have own a pawn so that

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.500 
table form we have own a pawn so that
means<00:04:06.510> that

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.390 

after<00:04:10.510> rook<00:04:10.689> to<00:04:10.840> c2<00:04:10.870> before<00:04:11.829> it's<00:04:12.069> not<00:04:12.280> the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
after rook to c2 before it's not the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.940 
after rook to c2 before it's not the
best<00:04:12.609> move<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:13.120> it's<00:04:14.049> better<00:04:14.230> for<00:04:14.409> Y<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.620> take

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
best move and it's better for Y to take

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.599 
best move and it's better for Y to take
actually<00:04:15.400> here<00:04:15.609> on<00:04:15.730> d5<00:04:16.560> take<00:04:17.560> only<00:04:17.739> five<00:04:18.039> and

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
actually here on d5 take only five and

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.400 
actually here on d5 take only five and
after<00:04:18.850> retaking<00:04:19.269> on<00:04:19.720> d5<00:04:20.139> then<00:04:20.979> play<00:04:21.340> before

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
after retaking on d5 then play before

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.310 
after retaking on d5 then play before
because<00:04:23.410> now<00:04:23.440> if<00:04:23.889> five<00:04:24.960> doesn't<00:04:25.960> win<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.110> pawn

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
because now if five doesn't win a pawn

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.760 
because now if five doesn't win a pawn
later<00:04:26.620> on<00:04:26.919> money<00:04:27.580> for<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.330> still<00:04:28.690> still<00:04:29.349> Black

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
later on money for but still still Black

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.010 
later on money for but still still Black
has<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.099> better<00:04:30.400> position<00:04:30.610> after<00:04:31.030> Bishop<00:04:31.509> to<00:04:31.630> d6

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
has a better position after Bishop to d6

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.890 
has a better position after Bishop to d6
for<00:04:32.770> example<00:04:33.280> followed<00:04:33.669> by<00:04:33.789> Bishop<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.210> f4<00:04:34.599> and

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
for example followed by Bishop to f4 and

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.670 
for example followed by Bishop to f4 and
perhaps<00:04:35.349> Bishop<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.090> c1<00:04:37.289> combining<00:04:38.289> an<00:04:38.380> attack

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
perhaps Bishop to c1 combining an attack

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.779 
perhaps Bishop to c1 combining an attack
against<00:04:39.099> a<00:04:39.900> three<00:04:40.900> but<00:04:41.620> let's<00:04:42.220> return<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.610> the

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
against a three but let's return to the

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.540 
against a three but let's return to the
game<00:04:42.970> because<00:04:43.180> that's<00:04:43.660> actually<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:44.020> most

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
game because that's actually the most

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.060 
game because that's actually the most
instructive<00:04:46.050> thing<00:04:47.050> here<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.860> do<00:04:48.039> is<00:04:50.009> this<00:04:51.009> is

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
instructive thing here to do is this is

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.310 
instructive thing here to do is this is
the<00:04:51.220> position<00:04:51.370> after<00:04:51.820> rook<00:04:52.000> takes<00:04:52.240> T<00:04:52.509> 3<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:53.020> we

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
the position after rook takes T 3 so we

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.140 
the position after rook takes T 3 so we

trade now here b4 was played by black
and<00:04:58.479> after<00:04:59.289> a<00:04:59.590> takes<00:04:59.889> before<00:05:00.419> Bishop<00:05:01.419> takes

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
and after a takes before Bishop takes

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:11.700 
and after a takes before Bishop takes
before<00:05:04.289> white<00:05:05.289> took<00:05:05.919> on<00:05:06.690> d5<00:05:10.050> notice<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.380> this

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
before white took on d5 notice that this

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.230 
before white took on d5 notice that this
bishop<00:05:12.160> of<00:05:12.250> before<00:05:12.820> is<00:05:13.539> controlling<00:05:14.229> d2<00:05:15.240> so

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
bishop of before is controlling d2 so

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.930 
bishop of before is controlling d2 so
it's<00:05:16.419> impossible<00:05:17.110> for<00:05:17.139> white<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:18.280> return<00:05:18.669> to

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
it's impossible for white to return to

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.820 
it's impossible for white to return to
the<00:05:19.030> second<00:05:19.330> rank<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:20.139> defend<00:05:20.560> c2<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:21.639> V<00:05:21.820> 2<00:05:22.830> so

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
the second rank to defend c2 and V 2 so

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.320 
the second rank to defend c2 and V 2 so
here<00:05:24.159> white<00:05:24.550> took<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.599> takes<00:05:25.960> d5<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:27.400> takes<00:05:27.759> d5

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
here white took it takes d5 it takes d5

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.100 
here white took it takes d5 it takes d5
and<00:05:28.720> now<00:05:29.289> we<00:05:29.710> move<00:05:30.400> this<00:05:30.639> rook<00:05:30.909> to<00:05:31.120> e3<00:05:31.330> with<00:05:31.960> the

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
and now we move this rook to e3 with the

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.670 
and now we move this rook to e3 with the
idea<00:05:32.409> of<00:05:32.610> still<00:05:33.870> defending<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.110> second<00:05:35.470> rank

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
idea of still defending the second rank

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.360 
idea of still defending the second rank
but<00:05:36.520> it's<00:05:36.699> actually<00:05:37.090> too<00:05:37.300> late<00:05:37.530> because<00:05:38.530> black

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
but it's actually too late because black

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.570 
but it's actually too late because black
plays<00:05:39.810> rook<00:05:40.810> to<00:05:40.990> c2<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.620> here<00:05:42.340> in<00:05:42.490> this

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
plays rook to c2 and here in this

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.580 
plays rook to c2 and here in this
position<00:05:42.789> white<00:05:43.539> resigned

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
position white resigned

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.330 
position white resigned
it's<00:05:45.060> impossible<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.449> save<00:05:46.780> this<00:05:47.169> B<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:48.039> pawn

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
it's impossible to save this B to pawn

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.659 
it's impossible to save this B to pawn
and<00:05:48.610> without<00:05:49.479> the<00:05:49.599> b2<00:05:49.900> pawn<00:05:50.169> after<00:05:51.009> it<00:05:51.430> falls

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
and without the b2 pawn after it falls

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.180 
and without the b2 pawn after it falls
then<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.150> a<00:05:52.180> porn<00:05:52.599> becomes<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.320> very<00:05:53.860> dangerous

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
then the a porn becomes a very dangerous

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.159 
then the a porn becomes a very dangerous
weapon<00:05:54.580> there<00:05:55.060> is<00:05:55.120> no<00:05:55.270> way<00:05:55.419> to<00:05:55.479> stop<00:05:55.780> this<00:05:55.900> bone
