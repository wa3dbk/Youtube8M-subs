00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.240
 we knew what would happen but we did not expect it to be so soon 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.420
 Since its launch JuliÃ¡ has been a resounding success for Nintendo and the 1 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.450
 eat eight million units that are manufactured every month 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.499
 disappear from the shelves 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.329
 the case is that the last review of the sales figures of the new generation 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.240
 rice sales to a cumulative of 25 million wii according to the data of 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:24.199
 said 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.560
 If sales continue at the current rate and at the moment it does not seem that this is going to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400
 to be otherwise flees and exceeded in sales had incubated little more than one 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.420
 month 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.750
 throughout his six years of life of incube he has sold a total 21 comma 72 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.350
 millions of units 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.350
 just a million more than the sales that wii has accumulated in their little more than 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.000
 first year of life 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.480
 no doubt it's good news for nintendo but to all of us who have a 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.320
 incubus area I refuse to say we had since it has not yet been used and not 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.730
 we are saddened to think of the bitter life cycle of this console that contrasts 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.490
 with the success of running away 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.040
 and it is that it was concealed and it is an excellent console with many small jewels in 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.740
 its catalog a compact size a control with perfect ergonomics and a 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.870
 power more than solvent for the previous generation 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.960
 unfortunately we did not appreciate much and the machine went unnoticed 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.790
 definitely good for nintendo but bad for letting die glen cove so 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.110
 miserable canceling almost all his latest releases to take them 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.180
 of the wii as super 'paper mario' 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.580
 and almost burying of legend of zelda twilight princess a game that was almost 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.200
 impossible to get in its version for gamecube and that from the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.350
 principle was intended for this console since the conversion to wii was 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.570
 a last minute maneuver 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.909
 of injuve will go down in the history of the company 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.369
 nor to kioto as the least sold desktop console in its history 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.679
 without considering the virtual boy or experiments like that being one of 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.430
 the biggest failures of the company 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.620
 few bet on nintendo a few years ago 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.430
 in fact before satoru iwata will take the direction of the company and the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.420
 will revitalize completely the most doomsayers who said for nintendo a 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.930
 final similar to the one of sega abandoning the market of the jaguar and dedicating itself so 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.909
 only to produce videogames 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.359
 Luckily it was not so 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.749
 poor ben cooper 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.339
 I had everything I needed to succeed 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.389
 I correct a lot of the mistakes that were attributed to Nintendo in the past 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.809
 such as the use of cartridges instead of optical discs or the small amount of 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.689
 Third party titles 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.829
 also continued with the good ideas of nintendo 64 as the option of 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.869
 connect four series controls 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:41.559
 but despite all the market is capricious and the console of nintendo 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.040
 even though it was a more than competent machine it hardly caught the attention of 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.849
 a few faithful 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.620
 many blamed the fact of not having DVD 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.279
 all his toy look 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:56.260
 but in reality this loss of sales was no more than the result of the 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:01.089
 disappointment of nintendo users in the last years of Nintendo 64 with 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:05.329
 the console dying slowly with hardly any third-party titles held 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.329
 only thanks to the eternal production studios 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.700
 a lot of these resentful users 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.069
 they went to the competition in the next generation 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.129
 this was the singer capten tried with who cube had to recover the 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.269
 lost trust of its most loyal users and at the same time attract new 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.459
 public towards sujarulidze 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.389
 he did not succeed and the machine subsisted as juice eclipsed by the 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.339
 resounding success of playstation 2 that had done their homework much better 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.709
 However, not everything was lost 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.649
 in the next generation he tried he knew he had to attract new 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.339
 public if I wanted to survive but as 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.729
 how to make people who had never been interested in video games 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.639
 will begin to look at them in another way 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.620
 the answer 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.099
 we all know her 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.149
 and has already sold 20 million units
