00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.030
 already so to start with part a little word speed me I took my 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.309
 guitar and the fact that today 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:11.790
 but it's just because I wanted 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.830
 work work is military assistance as well as on 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.609
 classic gypsy rock so 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.760
 so to do it 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.259
 we will start by choosing a note 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.449
 the one you want me I'll take 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.749
 the aca 5 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.819
 Cordery 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.069
 well fourth body 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.069
 I need both super and I will start by playing seven games 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.670
 I was a little complicated 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.870
 we must break 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 I'm going to use my middle finger for that at six of the same string 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.770
 then it is the turn of the most exposed avenue hawkins 7 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.000
 and I finish with the little finger as you'll guess who's going to play 15 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.330
 x always on the tightrope 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.190
 that's so far nothing very very difficult 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.760
 this is the basic concept of chromaticism exercises today four 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.140
 consecutive on the same body 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.420
 and the goal of the game is to repeat this exercise 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.440
 on all points of the world then for those in barcelona 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.090
 shifted little by little so we go for those who change the strings 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.510
 after playing will grant for example 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.810
 to be able to play the string alone at the third string and do the same 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.439
 movement 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.689
 with his ca 5 he told me we had to stop 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.420
 air cassette 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.180
 the little ones will supervise 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.750
 very often when we are going to shift after his second wax record 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.170
 rope 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.750
 is a dog shoemaker 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.070
 but I can say which box in case so for example 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.650
 after playing the box except that at 5 5 in 2008 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.200
 I could shift to blackcurrant 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.410
 shoemaker of time I'm not starting to break this index 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.670
 this major attack 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.510
 it's with the greens 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.610
 because he writes 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.090
 so we are small we help technique to shift ropes roped 41 3 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.110
 can cover a good part of Sunday with his exercises 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.000
 then it's free for you to do a little pan job 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.369
 not too long or too short or too much juice 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.890
 urem too easy 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.319
 it's up to you to see if we want photovoltaic capabilities etc. 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.030
 something that this Sunday that I advise to beginners generally 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.450
 this from the cage 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.150
 426 because there 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.630
 because the guys are not deceived because your comments one that it's a 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.949
 little bit hard 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.480
 and we do not have any rain are strangely the cases in the school 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.229
 the job locker for all and all pointed not very well positioned 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.739
 so the cascades 5 if I find that this is a very good starting point for 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:29.859
 to start 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.459
 I advise to start this serious connection 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.459
 and do all the strings one by one like this site 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.729
 little bit of the year 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.209
 of course to start you will do it - part time in these countries 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.919
 once we've done the story we're shifting 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:45.829
 one box 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.099
 so we take four to six for example and we go up all the strings 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.749
 accordion and cias bass strings 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.689
 as of left 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:54.619
 here 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.979
 and after that we can totally redécale again and race and that's saying 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:58.520
 if it 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.249
 until we have and we cash away something like that 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:03.070
 good meal of the rope 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.250
 half of work three cases what we want we do all the strings we get 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.550
 shifting does how the senses do that several times in a row felt all 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.209
 right now 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.059
 except for a few minutes and if you do it every day believe me you 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.289
 will see progress very quickly 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.169
 so obviously it's not always that simple if you have 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.169
 some little worries with stuttgart 6 and chances are that these same 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.019
 little finger 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 because he is weak because of the long and difficult to master 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.319
 be careful not to consume because this program because there the gap of 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.120
 fingers with difficult really 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.719
 it's difficult when you take goals 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.679
 so do not hesitate to start in the most acute breaks for really 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.739
 use helmets are rather close together 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.869
 and make life a little easier for you at that level 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.909
 and if really your little player can not do it but then not at all 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.159
 because you have a tiny culver more recently 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.840
 and add quite work on that according to this close parker 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.810
 the coast to do that at 5 and 6 September it will be the rink we will just 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.469
 to do Saturday 6 hours 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.699
 beijing 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.329
 worthy-les-Bains 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.809
 come win 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.739
 it's because she obviously him but it's better to do it like that than 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.269
 miss the title 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.379
 still try very small steps regularly to force to use 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.529
 it will be very convenient 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:18.659
 for the bravest ones who have a lot of time to kill that do you 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.659
 prevents from leaving the human box gives you serious 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.849
 soon dune cords 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.849
 the wrinkles I do not luxury spent 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.789
 until when Sunday 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.020
 it takes a while 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.490
 without understanding too much time given the profit 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.240
 but hey if you with his land 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.759
 why not 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.819
 so some small important points to finish this first part 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.879
 at the level of the right hand you scratch the ropes as you want us 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.320
 find thinking on the left hand 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.990
 it's up to you to finger or cake rolled English if that 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.719
 amused 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.669
 I am you have a level a little bit before without guitar and koné simple 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.699
 roundtrip ettore 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.349
 use the term of his exercise 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.159
 then at the level of the left hand the Palestinians so if will have to make 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.430
 attention to several plans 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.570
 already it's an exercise not repeat repeat and repeat and repeat 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.979
 you have to do every day 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.039
 if you are twice a month willingly in the rer 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.409
 It's that simple 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.239
 so it takes a few minutes do it every day and progress 

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:18.110
 are really fast 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.620
 then when doing exercises to get the most out of progress 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.139
 do it near the transfer at the level of the notes I speak it is necessary that each 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.129
 note and the same duration listens and you change your body which we do not want 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.830
 not too much 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.830
 it has to look like that 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.919
 yes it's not easy 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.830
 that's not good at all 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.690
 help yourself in the apples if you are maybe a little bit 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.550
 very good way 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.219
 to progress this exercise 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.219
 a very last very important point and the traumas 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.040
 it's afp level 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.199
 cleanliness 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.639
 it is necessary that each note according to m 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.869
 correctly the first time 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:59.869
 so it looks like that 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.699
 not sure we will stop 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:10.059
 I get along too often who do that who are satisfied no it's missed 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.530
 just as much to make each note ring, it does not matter if you have 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.449
 finally we have to do it 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.749
 in support twenty-two right members 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.079
 winograd of the stick now placed five arias aerial work platforms 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.410
 work the launch but cleanly it is essential 

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:32.259
 and finally last point and probably the most important is my good prayer 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.520
 position of the left hand 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.020
 and that's so important 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.290
 we're going to do a second expert part to talk about this has everything 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:38.349
 after
