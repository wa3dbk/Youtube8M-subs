00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.770
 because water is the universal solvent 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.330
 let's analyze a little the molecule of 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.330
 water to answer this question 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.410
 the water is composed of an atom 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.580
 oxygen 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.580
 and the hydrogen atoms 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:33.320
 the hydrogens are separated from each other by 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.320
 an angle of one hundred and 45 degrees 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.489
 as you can see the molecule presents a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.239
 it is an asymmetry that is very particular and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.059
 that gives you a difference in the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.730
 distribution of electrons over 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.090
 all the oxygen 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.850
 this being the most negative part of the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.329
 molecule and the part where are the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.429
 hydrogen positive 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.949
 it happens that thanks to the water 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:09.350
 presents this asymmetry the distribution 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.960
 of cargo without being charged is to say being 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.880
 a neutral molecule can interact 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.789
 with other similar molecules 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.509
 characteristics for example with other 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.509
 water molecules 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.610
 what we see here 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.810
 I'm marking is called bridge 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.400
 hydrogen and is the interaction 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:39.780
 between hydrogen 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.780
 and oxygen or nitrogen or phosphorus 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.680
 this interaction is quite strong that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.460
 if we compare it with interactions between 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.870
 hydrogen and for example sulfur which is a 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.240
 equally elected atom 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.680
 now 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.299
 the vast majority of molecules have 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.159
 characteristics of asymmetry in the 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.570
 distribution of electrons and that's why 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.300
 Water 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.030
 interacts so easily with the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.090
 most molecules I'm going to put two 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.090
 examples 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.470
 we have sodium hypochlorite which is 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.090
 what makes up the commercial chlorine 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.060
 chlorine used to disinfect the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.410
 kitchen 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.410
 this is a salt 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.319
 what does it mean that it is made up of a 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:40.260
 metal and for a non-metal 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.560
 the metal in this case would be sodium 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.379
 and the ne metal the chlorine and oxygen that 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.069
 they both form a union called 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:53.540
 hypochlorite and how this sodium bond the 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.540
 molecule is called sodium hypochlorite 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.650
 the process by which a salt is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.850
 dissolves in water is called the sun 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.180
 dating 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.090
 This consists of the salt separating into 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.930
 his song and dream the respective one and the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.260
 water interacts on its part that is more 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.110
 related to the year I do not search for example 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.330
 oxygen will always interact with 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.310
 the castellÃ³n of the salt whereas the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.360
 water hydrogens are going to interact 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.710
 with the year in this way they are established 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.170
 electrostatic interactions people the 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.530
 water and the salt planes and their 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.420
 trucks 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.630
 let's look at this compound now 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.360
 has this formula 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.610
 and it turns out to be sucrose or sugar from 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.860
 table 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.710
 if we put a spoonful of sucrose 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.120
 in a glass with water and shake it out 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.020
 some time we will see that I do not know 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.440
 distinguishes sucrose from water 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.860
 this happens because water forms a bridge 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.260
 of hydrogen as we saw earlier 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.240
 with all these ramifications called 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:09.970
 hydroxyl of sucrose 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:13.440
 this helps the sucrose dissolve 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.440
 in the environment to things 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.850
 watch now this photograph and the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.760
 Earth from the satellite 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.040
 it is known that the surface 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.620
 of three quarters of the earth is 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.960
 totally covered by water you think that 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.120
 it could be possible 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.940
 if it were not because water is the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.880
 universal solvent that is able to 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.979
 dissolve a large part of the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.979
 molecules that exist on the planet
