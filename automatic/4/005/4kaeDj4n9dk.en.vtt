00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.449
 Seventeenth June 15h 3 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.119
 Today they came back involuntarily meeting them with the old sailors in the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.199
 Meaning that has shaped my life in such an impressive way 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.569
 I am ashamed in every word that means it happened yesterday 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.490
 I wanted him abstract 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.980
 1 our ship left the harbor right in the face of Pakistan 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.010
 Tension in the air 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.810
 in the following months I saw already allocated Gestade inquiries and 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.810
 against the breathtaking beauty of the customers 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.350
 a loud cry I one day stands out of my dreams «Rise 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.310
 Leuer 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.310
 the armed forces declared the organizers 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.130
 and the blood of the woman in our hands have one hundred times as one 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.780
 pulled my men down with them 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 as a sign of this misfortune not yet found 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840
 Search teams days later 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.500
 simply it was Volcker one 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 on the 4th at the latest on the motorcycle emergency 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.530
 had killed only for hours and nights 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.460
 About Kate, we think again 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 Minute changed 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.680
 this time the sheath did not hurry it out of coke 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.550
 finally the Hans w 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.210
 and we should believe you 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 Pölten and convince yourself 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.640
 I made an exact map of the area we were against 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.490
 We reward the wagons from there with our entire hab and good 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.490
 into the state budget sixth 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.780
 when we finally discovered a tract of usable statements 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.360
 they started here how are you 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.930
 our cities grew rapidly and gained in size and dance 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.469
 The trade started to flourish 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.169
 At that time the story ended here 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:32.040
 internally one manages to shape Manz with you looking like a sweetheart i 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.859
 tell them to do the same 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.239
 us to discover distant countries 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.630
 many years had to go to the country 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.420
 after all, Captain My is a small ship commanded 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:50.829
 ca 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.819
 in January they would not have mentioned 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.089
 We have been on loan for months now 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:57.909
 and hope Balz Land to himself
