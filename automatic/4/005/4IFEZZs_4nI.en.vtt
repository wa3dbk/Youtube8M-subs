00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello how about I'm the chef fire on ice and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.580
 we are going to prepare the dishes with a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.040
 only ingredient is going to be a garnish 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.840
 and a dessert this time we will make a 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.840
 sweet potato puree and sweet potato 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.360
 this time two recipes are very 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.100
 small short therefore a two in 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.930
 a single video with the same ingredient 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.240
 the first one serves you very well as 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.460
 garnish for some kind of turkey for 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.800
 some or even some chicken is a 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.570
 sweet potato puree with a light sweet touch 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.400
 and above all, something different is something that 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.920
 we do not eat such friends and the second 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.300
 recipe is going to be a sweet potato sweet this 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.000
 it becomes a little more common simply 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.949
 I'm going to put my recipe for how to do 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.840
 a sweet potato and you already know the style 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.610
 What a roll this can be with you 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.500
 okay with a little cream at the end or 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.120
 some vanilla sauce and left 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.549
 spectacular good without more for the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.170
 I leave you with the recipe not without 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.449
 before reminding you to give them a little hand 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.280
 up subscribe comment and share 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.809
 and at the bottom I leave my link 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.580
 to visit me on facebook 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.769
 we start with our recipes with 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.330
 sweet potato for my sweet potato puree first 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.060
 what I'm going to do is wash my 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.640
 I'm going to cook them, I'm going to 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.890
 add a little sugar about 3 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.590
 spoonfuls we put to the light and leave 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.150
 cook well because it is cooked us 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.550
 let's peel 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.220
 We can put it in cold water to 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.960
 to be able to manipulate it more easily and 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.840
 we will remove a little the edges that 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.420
 they contain many fibers 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.340
 I'm going to cut my sweet potato a bit and I'm going 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.080
 to go through a strainer with that I'm going to 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.000
 get a very thin puree 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.950
 in this step we should do it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.380
 preference when it is not hot yet 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.200
 our sweet potato so that we do not leave 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.500
 be taffy with our support as 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.500
 remains 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.210
 if we continue like this we will do our 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.250
 sweet potato puree if we remove the fibers 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.330
 that come contain we are going to remove 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.330
 all parties 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.420
 and that we spent all our sweet potato 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.609
 we have our purity and now for 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.890
 season I'll add a little bit of 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.140
 cinnamon powder this will give you a very good 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.870
 flavor and we can not sweeten it with a little 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.940
 of honey to a little more sugar is a 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.780
 minimum simply to highlight your 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.430
 taste and now if we mix well 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.680
 I want to be and here we have our 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.680
 sweet potato puree with a turkey with a marinade 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 etc 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.550
 with that is all we are to the next 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.530
 for my candy of sweet potato rolls to 700 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.240
 grams of sweet potato I'm going to peel 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.540
 if you want, you can do it without 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.540
 hair 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.140
 here we have our sweet potato clean and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.730
 Now I will not cut into slices 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.730
 very thick as half a centimeter 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.280
 now we reserve it and we will prepare 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.650
 our sweet I will use 350 grams of 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.930
 piloncillo I'm going to put three quarters of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.570
 liter of water in a pot a branch of 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.570
 cinnamon I'm going to accommodate my sweet potato 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.020
 and now I 'm going to add my piloncillo 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.640
 in other places it is called panela this 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.280
 I'm going to put it that way since anyway 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.960
 when it is hot it will melt and 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.850
 is going to be a honey then now what 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.620
 The only thing we will do is put to boil and 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.620
 let's keep our sweet potato 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.680
 I'm also going to add two nails 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.380
 smell and a pepper as we see already 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.120
 melted our piloncillo and started to 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.580
 boil our water now what we will do 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.320
 will lower our fire to the minimum and 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.080
 We will let you know our sweet potatoes 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.570
 about 20 minutes meanwhile we were 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.000
 go expressing our water and we're going 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.780
 to be lying we'll leave it like that and not what 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.780
 let's cover 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.690
 after 20 minutes of cooking our 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.180
 sweet potato and it is well cooked and our water 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.549
 already made a honey with the price 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.440
 now if you are ready to serve it and 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.930
 enjoy it we serve it as well as few 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.650
 we can accompany with a little cream or 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.009
 of English sauce and it will be ready 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.559
 seems to enjoy our sweet potato 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.360
 but the amount of your fill you 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:41.360
