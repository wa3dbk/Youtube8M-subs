00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
anyways so that's kind of what's gone on

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.199 
anyways so that's kind of what's gone on
with<00:02:45.600> me<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.959> did<00:02:46.320> I've<00:02:47.250> gotten<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.640> all<00:02:47.880> three

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
with me I did I've gotten on all three

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.120 
with me I did I've gotten on all three
of<00:02:48.239> my<00:02:48.420> races<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.050> year<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.500> far<00:02:49.709> for<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
of my races this year so far for the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.550 
of my races this year so far for the
three<00:02:50.310> months<00:02:50.340> I've<00:02:50.730> gone<00:02:50.910> by<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.420> do<00:02:51.959> not<00:02:52.230> have

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
three months I've gone by I do not have

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.290 
three months I've gone by I do not have
aprils<00:02:53.220> race<00:02:53.489> set<00:02:53.820> up<00:02:53.940> yet<00:02:54.300> but<00:02:54.540> i<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.300> i

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
aprils race set up yet but i do think i

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.750 
aprils race set up yet but i do think i
got<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.320> texas<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.800> time<00:02:59.040> i<00:02:59.070> actually<00:02:59.340> thought

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
got to texas in time i actually thought

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.020 
got to texas in time i actually thought
i<00:02:59.820> missed<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.300> for<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.690> warrior<00:03:01.260> dash<00:03:01.290> race

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
i missed it for the warrior dash race

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.810 
i missed it for the warrior dash race
and<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.810> 16th<00:03:04.380> or<00:03:04.800> 17th<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.550> month

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
and it is the 16th or 17th of this month

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.240 
and it is the 16th or 17th of this month
so<00:03:06.150> i<00:03:06.360> think<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.260> may<00:03:07.470> be<00:03:07.500> what<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.860> sign<00:03:08.220> up

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
so i think that may be what I sign up

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.170 
so i think that may be what I sign up
for<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.610> month<00:03:08.940> it's<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.390> true<00:03:10.820> 5k<00:03:11.820> it's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
for this month it's not a true 5k it's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.020 
for this month it's not a true 5k it's
actually<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.080> believe<00:03:13.440> 3.24<00:03:14.280> miles<00:03:14.550> but<00:03:14.910> it's

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
actually I believe 3.24 miles but it's

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.440 
actually I believe 3.24 miles but it's
an<00:03:15.360> obstacle<00:03:15.840> course<00:03:16.459> as<00:03:17.459> opposed<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.420> a

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
an obstacle course as opposed to a

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.410 
an obstacle course as opposed to a
normal<00:03:18.690> 5k<00:03:19.260> race<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.820> should<00:03:21.390> be

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
normal 5k race so it should be

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.449 
normal 5k race so it should be
interesting<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.320> any<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.980> guys<00:03:23.160> that

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
interesting so any of you guys that

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.090 
interesting so any of you guys that
haven't<00:03:23.989> looked<00:03:24.989> into<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.440> or<00:03:25.860> heard<00:03:26.010> about

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
haven't looked into that or heard about

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.130 
haven't looked into that or heard about
that<00:03:26.459> if<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.300> go<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.480> warrior<00:03:27.840> dash<00:03:28.080> com

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
that if you go to warrior dash com

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.270 
that if you go to warrior dash com
they're<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> lot<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> different<00:03:31.800> states

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
they're in a lot of the different states

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.980 
they're in a lot of the different states
as<00:03:32.580> far<00:03:32.970> as

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
as far as

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.720 
as far as
they're<00:03:34.200> having<00:03:34.560> their<00:03:34.740> event<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:35.400> check<00:03:35.670> it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
they're having their event so check it

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.950 
they're having their event so check it
out<00:03:35.910> because<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.270> certainly<00:03:36.450> looks<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:36.870> a

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
out because it certainly looks like a

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.200 
out because it certainly looks like a
lot<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.200> fun<00:03:37.440> anything<00:03:38.370> from<00:03:38.640> crawling

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
lot of fun anything from crawling

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.460 
lot of fun anything from crawling
through<00:03:39.510> mud<00:03:39.540> jumping<00:03:40.200> over<00:03:40.440> fire<00:03:42.470> climbing

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
through mud jumping over fire climbing

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.660 
through mud jumping over fire climbing
over<00:03:43.740> cars<00:03:44.310> walls<00:03:45.350> logs<00:03:46.350> just<00:03:47.010> kind<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.340> crazy

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
over cars walls logs just kind of crazy

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.600 
over cars walls logs just kind of crazy
obstacle<00:03:48.300> course<00:03:49.080> type<00:03:49.350> stuff<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:49.890> figured

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
obstacle course type stuff so figured

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.980 
obstacle course type stuff so figured
that<00:03:50.760> would<00:03:50.850> be<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.030> cool<00:03:51.330> way<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.510> kind<00:03:51.900> of

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
that would be a cool way to kind of

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.230 
that would be a cool way to kind of
change<00:03:52.560> exercise<00:03:53.370> up<00:03:53.520> a<00:03:53.640> little<00:03:53.850> bit<00:03:53.970> so

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
change exercise up a little bit so

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.200 
change exercise up a little bit so
that's<00:03:54.900> what<00:03:55.410> I'm<00:03:55.560> planning<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.820> doing<00:03:56.880> for

exercise lifestyle you kind of know what
I<00:05:30.560> mean<00:05:30.800> hits<00:05:31.250> like<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.670> stop<00:05:31.970> for<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.330> while

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
I mean hits like you stop for a while

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.270 
I mean hits like you stop for a while
and<00:05:32.810> you<00:05:33.110> get<00:05:33.290> back<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.710> you<00:05:34.010> think<00:05:34.190> you

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
and you get back to it you think you

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.950 
and you get back to it you think you
should<00:05:34.520> have<00:05:34.670> that<00:05:34.850> same<00:05:35.120> stamina<00:05:35.720> endurance

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
should have that same stamina endurance

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.930 
should have that same stamina endurance
and<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.560> just<00:05:36.770> generally<00:05:37.340> doesn't<00:05:37.520> work<00:05:37.760> like

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
and it just generally doesn't work like

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.360 
and it just generally doesn't work like
that<00:05:38.000> so<00:05:38.510> I've<00:05:39.380> got<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.590> build<00:05:39.770> myself<00:05:39.950> back<00:05:40.220> up

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
that so I've got to build myself back up

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.180 
that so I've got to build myself back up
and<00:05:40.760> get<00:05:40.880> back<00:05:41.030> into<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.750> normal<00:05:42.410> routine<00:05:42.950> of

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
and get back into the normal routine of

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.830 
and get back into the normal routine of
taking<00:05:43.520> care<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.730> myself<00:05:43.880> and<00:05:44.420> making<00:05:44.690> sure

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
taking care of myself and making sure

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.450 
taking care of myself and making sure
that<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.080> get<00:05:45.140> that<00:05:45.410> exercising<00:05:46.100> because<00:05:46.220> I

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
that I get that exercising because I

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.300 
that I get that exercising because I
know<00:05:46.520> that's<00:05:46.880> going<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:47.150> be<00:05:47.270> key<00:05:47.540> in<00:05:48.310> getting

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
know that's going to be key in getting

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:56.680

my<00:06:05.000> weight<00:06:05.150> loss<00:06:05.390> surgery<00:06:05.600> just<00:06:06.110> live<00:06:06.410> in<00:06:06.530> life

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
my weight loss surgery just live in life

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.400 
my weight loss surgery just live in life
and<00:06:10.390> you<00:06:11.390> know<00:06:11.510> a<00:06:11.540> few<00:06:11.600> people<00:06:12.020> have<00:06:12.110> sent<00:06:12.320> me

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.070 
and you know a few people have sent me

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
messages asking how I am or where I'm at

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.320 
messages asking how I am or where I'm at
so<00:06:15.500> I<00:06:15.530> figured<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:16.040> better<00:06:16.070> get<00:06:16.430> on<00:06:16.580> here<00:06:16.880> and<00:06:16.910> do

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
so I figured I better get on here and do

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.020 
so I figured I better get on here and do
an<00:06:17.570> update<00:06:18.200> so<00:06:18.740> um<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:21.460> guess<00:06:22.460> that's<00:06:22.910> that

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
an update so um I guess that's that

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.640 
an update so um I guess that's that
maybe<00:06:23.390> next<00:06:23.600> time<00:06:23.870> I'll<00:06:24.050> be<00:06:24.200> a<00:06:24.230> little<00:06:24.440> more

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
maybe next time I'll be a little more

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.130
