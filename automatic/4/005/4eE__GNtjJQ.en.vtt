00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.779
 hello friends we met 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.490

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.980

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.559

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.299
 from latin america to mexico to have 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.660
 some variations but they actually go 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.380
 to be able to see the diverse range that we are going to 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.940
 launch with the starter kit on the table 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.710
 also in some other products that 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.410
 I wanted to decorate and know that 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.030
 we have also with Maurice but the kit 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.490
 I'm going to show you what to put 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.230
 A lot of attention that they make up can be 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.359
 for personal use or it can be for 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.370
 start a business for in fact already 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.100
 have it sold for professionals 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.760
 because we handle a pigmentation of 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.280
 high quality good we have 22 kinds of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.719
 powder that arrive with the kit this is 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.149
 the miami close that is a powder 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.829
 because it is stunningly beautiful bronzer that is 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.890
 will leave a tanned feeling and with 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.290
 some very nice flashes of light 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.020
 this is a neutral dust a powder 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.489
 Neutral compact for all skin types 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.110
 in fact it would have to be a skin 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.800
 very brunette who could not use it but 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.250
 it really gives a very nice tone 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.030
 very visual mate 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.550
 shadow between hands did not choose the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.050
 brush to see that it is a very pretty shadow 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.650
 of a very natural ending very 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.650
 warm 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.990
 gel eyeliner a delineated 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.780
 fantastic actually we are already 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.880
 using and we have enough 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.159
 happy to women is used 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.500
 Remember with brochita without moistening 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.369
 ok in the cafe but this time we're going to 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.069
 market the one that sells the most that is 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.679
 the black the base for eyes that is a 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.090
 base that matches the eyelid before 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.569
 place any shadow or make 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.179
 any work on the eyelid 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.770
 first that is super essential before the 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.990
 base and from the rest of the makeup 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.600
 to match the skin and leave it as 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.880
 a manzanita skin 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.520
 the rumors give sides we give the two 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.979
 options one or pink and one a little more 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.680
 Coral depends on makeup or depends 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.750
 of the skin type we are going to use them for 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.000
 that's why we go out to the market 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.090
 initially with these but remember 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.270
 that there are more colors and more varieties with 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.590
 four shades here I'm going to show you 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.959
 this is the steel 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.269
 this is the cappuccino that is also a 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.940
 color that is used a lot for makeup 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.940
 of day for street makeup the cream 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.540
 3 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.520
 and the vedruna ice that is like you of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 I dream like dreamy eyes all with the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.940
 which is that we already achieved a makeup 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.650
 fantastic two lipsticks of rich formula 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.930
 colors that are also very fashionable and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.520
 which can be offered in different 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.380
 skin types we are not doing 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.570
 extreme colors precisely so that 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.260
 Let's go out once and sell or do 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.819
 business and the horrible blink mask 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.760
 then a black 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.620
 a blog that is very fashionable lips 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.459
 bulky lips with a lot of shine 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.790
 be alone or accompanying the labial we have 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.230
 the elf live for you that is a product 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.939
 quite interesting that is for 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.219
 restore the collagen of the lips 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.819
 to recover the volume with the use 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.829
 frequent 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.319
 let's recover the volume and the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.069
 tonicity of the lips 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.870
 a precision eyeliner that in this 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.400
 case they send us the black because it is the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.079
 which is more used but they believe that it is 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.319
 the best-selling product because it's a 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.170
 Water proof product does not run and 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.150
 from an easy to easy to use then 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.980
 they will like it very much and obviously 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.959
 we can not miss an eyeliner for 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.579
 the creamy lips that can be 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.639
 blur inside the lip so that the 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.230
 lip look very natural another product 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.079
 that accompanies is that it is the teen years 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.599
 younger who is 10 years younger is used 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.730
 both to look 10 years better as to 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.859
 fix the makeup and refresh what 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.739
 during the day then this for the 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.939
 that we have to be on the street for here 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.919
 there and we want to always be 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.829
 makeup can not be missing in the bag and 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.290
 for makeup artists and professionals 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.930
 another other element that makes up kits 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.060
 obviously the brush kit is a kit 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.799
 what I say is the perfect imitation 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.620
 of the professionals are those who come 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.079
 smaller but in both the hair 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.440
 The texture of the broach is very soft 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.300
 very natural and very professional 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.270
 leave makeup without any problem 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.400
 with which 10 catalogs also come 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.830
 to start our business 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.330
 then either we're going to have never 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.770
 all the products because it's going to be a 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.050
 little complicated before we have our 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.900
 Support catalog also comes with 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.670
 our dotcom roof kit 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.880
 all the products that the company has 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:49.630
 of America brand a divided divide of 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.550
 guide training for the business what 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.840
 unfortunately, not everything 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.600
 we have in this year but we're going to 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.970
 also have an mp3 to listen 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.280
 the trainings to receive advice 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.570
 to guide us in the business that also 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.330
 soon we will have it in Spanish 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.360
 Well, I hope you have stayed that way 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.280
 with all the expectations already for 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.900
 start making our order and we 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.620

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.620
 another surprise
