that<00:00:25.619> when<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:25.920> somewhere<00:00:26.070> else<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> play

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
that when you go somewhere else to play

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670 
that when you go somewhere else to play
inside<00:00:26.849> your<00:00:27.029> house<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> things<00:00:28.470> don't
