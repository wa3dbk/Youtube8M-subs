 if you want you will play your trumpets we will play our bells said for 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.629
 capons 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:09.649
 in 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.629
 Middle Ages in the Italian Renaissance 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:20.300
 if you have the octopus paul 'we have maurizio costanzo we can say today to 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.429
 About South Africa Soccer World Cup Predictions We're at 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.579
 third last game the games are semi-finished 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.579
 and holland is already in the final is the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.850
 let's face it the thing 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.540
 which struck most was the fact that the Uruguay concert. deserves if the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 game 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.170
 in the second half a surprise if you want the theme anyway if you deserve it you are like 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.890
 physical tactical conditions 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.800
 spirit and so on 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.320
 certainly holland his card and then in the end is stronger but in short, center of Uruguay 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.789
 and went close 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.199
 how close a few centimeters ie an offside goal if or 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.990
 red minimum offside that nn indians and italian league 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.060
 often we do not see return they were given with in that game entirely in March 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.560
 but 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.750
 % offside it was 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.350
 for improved 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.150
 by the referee 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.450
 and from the assistants linesmen dd facebook 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 and the referee was nothing less than the usb here he had 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.210
 arbitrated the first game the opening match and was considered up to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.780
 yesterday 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.850
 the best referee in circulation, both to improve my table and one 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.560
 open question from the world 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.659
 to demonstrate that then in the end to win a world championship for 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.370
 lose it 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.560
 many times those centimeters are enough just a dress that has not seen it 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.280
 is the real underlying question that is good for the world cup but that's okay 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.330
 for the Italian championship is also good for non-football stuff in the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.890
 relations with justice 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.650
 could be the following 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.850
 but if it had happened to the Uruguay that offside goal 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.219
 albeit I repeat very little mini and mini movie via 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.300
 it would have been granted or not it would be enough for one to be certain of the 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.600
 yes they would have been granted what 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.299
 as many times to the whole 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.330
 to Milan recently in recent years 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.629
 to the juventus for years in short shepherd clothes 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.539
 in the measuring meter maybe the same 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.939
 retirement error because that is an error of the referee then 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.499
 if you are mistaken for both an account if you make a mistake 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.440
 unfair of forms then it becomes something else 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.390
 and therefore 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.739
 we return to the discourse of slow motion technologies 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.499
 of the whole series of things I say I would gladly do without seeing the beam 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.730
 of football is to be more or less the same as always even if yes 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.999
 much worse game than in the past 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.979
 the problem is, however, that the suspicion is too strong, they have grown 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:50.620
 too much 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.350
 the interest in football and soccer played a pretext for everything else 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.980
 policy 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.080
 if you eat it literally when you need the economy as well, it all depends on 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.900
 did that then 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.439
 the referee is wrong no mistake the assistances are wrong of 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.760
 eeee 5 centimeters of offside loads well 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.590
 that the curious thing I repeat is enough for me that good faith 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.789
 were guaranteed in the error not to do good nancy in the error 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.809
 and tonight they play germany in spain 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.650
 the octopus paul 'as I said the cousin of our maurizio costanzo 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.129
 for the first time it seems gabia that's favored in his strange ones 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.129
 ruminations with and coli 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.670
 with the tentacles the date given was favored spain this is how to say eh already a 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.270
 sign 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.159
 then octopus approved reason to favor spain 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.639
 why would he 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.639
 if now I am not there to explain what was happening in this garden 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.340
 in the children's marine garden of oberhauser where this octopus operates 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.879
 for German 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.409
 holaa found some reason of particular interest in the pool of 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.070
 Spain 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.980
 or 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.000
 more probably the octopus knows about football if it intends at least 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.799
 as the category that usually deals with soccer fifth the octopus 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.450
 maurizio costanzo the category is practically in the same garden 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.899
 marine then what happens tonight seen then interest forecasts 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.900
 it happens that fatigued 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.030
 spain wins in my opinion 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.390
 with difficulty because the Germany will contain the la well 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.459
 marsala 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.090
 she will be good at making her print the quality of the players 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.210
 of spain feel in the field with 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.020
 the right head should eventually master the liveliness somehow 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.750
 the youth of germany 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.050
 is managing to hold and the match in 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.990
 in balance maybe solving at the end 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.440
 I wouldn't be surprised at additional snow 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.330
 net of penalties the only thing he was not living in this situation 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.350
 it is a net result in favor of one and of the other here this just does not exist 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.440
 the
