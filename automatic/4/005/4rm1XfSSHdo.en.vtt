so it was a great time there's a kind of

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.740 
so it was a great time there's a kind of
a<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.610> having<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.390> intricate

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
a you know having a more intricate

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.910 
a you know having a more intricate
production<00:01:40.290> because<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.770> had<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
production because we really had to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
production because we really had to
figure<00:01:41.159> out<00:01:41.310> where<00:01:41.549> those<00:01:41.790> were<00:01:42.420> those

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
figure out where those were those

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.120 
figure out where those were those
tie-ins<00:01:43.110> were<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> make<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> gimmicks<00:01:43.950> work

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
tie-ins were to make the gimmicks work
and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.299> pulled<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.570> off<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.720> that's
