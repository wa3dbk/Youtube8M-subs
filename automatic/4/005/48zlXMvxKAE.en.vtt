00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
79 for 16 inches and like 60 something

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.200 
79 for 16 inches and like 60 something
for<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> 14<00:02:18.760> inches<00:02:19.090> um<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.640> yeah<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.060> was

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
for the 14 inches um so yeah it was

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.710 
for the 14 inches um so yeah it was
really<00:02:22.920> reasonable<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.910> invisible

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
really reasonable and for the invisible

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.870 
really reasonable and for the invisible
part<00:02:26.020> it's<00:02:26.380> really<00:02:26.950> good<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:27.430> like<00:02:27.700> it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
part it's really good I really like it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
part it's really good I really like it
because<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.150> looks<00:02:28.300> really<00:02:28.780> natural<00:02:29.790> I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
because it looks really natural I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.870 
because it looks really natural I
replace<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.410> twice<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.070> month<00:02:33.310> because

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
replace it like twice a month because

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.690 
replace it like twice a month because
sometimes<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.540> starts<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.990> spread<00:02:35.350> out<00:02:35.700> but

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
sometimes it starts to spread out but

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.550 
sometimes it starts to spread out but
well<00:02:37.150> actually<00:02:37.300> now<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.600> replaced<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.110> every

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
well actually now I replaced it every

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.780 
well actually now I replaced it every
month<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:38.920> get<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.370> tightened<00:02:39.730> up<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.790> it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
month I just get it tightened up so it's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.370 
month I just get it tightened up so it's
really<00:02:42.940> good<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.570> invisible<00:02:43.930> part<00:02:44.110> looks

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
really good the invisible part looks

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.630 
really good the invisible part looks
really<00:02:44.650> nice<00:02:44.770> I<00:02:44.980> think<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.250> looks<00:02:45.400> kind<00:02:45.580> of
