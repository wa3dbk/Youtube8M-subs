00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.770 
you can do that so inside the zipper as
well<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.250> thermal<00:01:11.729> block<00:01:11.970> which<00:01:12.420> blocks

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
well is the thermal block which blocks

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
well is the thermal block which blocks
this<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.530> prevents<00:01:14.100> any<00:01:14.280> heat<00:01:14.670> from

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this which prevents any heat from

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
this which prevents any heat from
escaping<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> zipper<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:16.799> even

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
escaping out of the zipper or even

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.700 
escaping out of the zipper or even
letting<00:01:17.700> air<00:01:17.909> come<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> that's<00:01:19.409> right

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
letting air come in and that's right

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.160 
letting air come in and that's right
here<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.130> lot<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.490> sleep<00:01:20.640> meds<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.479> this

good bag I've used it and they give 20
degree<00:03:25.480> weather<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.350> worked<00:03:26.530> just<00:03:26.650> fine

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
degree weather and it worked just fine

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.190 
degree weather and it worked just fine
but<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.370> also<00:03:27.549> use<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:28.500> additional<00:03:29.500> 10<00:03:29.829> degree

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
but I also use a additional 10 degree

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.390 
but I also use a additional 10 degree
increase<00:03:32.200> or<00:03:32.380> for<00:03:32.620> making<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.130> even<00:03:33.190> colder

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
increase or for making it even colder

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.220 
increase or for making it even colder
for<00:03:33.579> it<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.150> it's<00:03:34.299> an<00:03:34.390> Inc<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.600> 30<00:03:34.780> degree<00:03:35.049> bag

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
for it so it's an Inc of 30 degree bag

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.949 
for it so it's an Inc of 30 degree bag
it's<00:03:35.470> just<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.680> liner<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:37.090> didn't<00:03:37.690> even<00:03:37.750> need

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
it's just a liner and I didn't even need

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.610 
it's just a liner and I didn't even need
it<00:03:38.109> but<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:38.650> have<00:03:38.859> used<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.870> correlation

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
it but I have used it and in correlation

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.870 
it but I have used it and in correlation
with<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.950> bag<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.519> was<00:03:42.609> able<00:03:42.760> to
