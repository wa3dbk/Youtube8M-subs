00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
little bit above the eyebrows right here

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:36.459 
little bit above the eyebrows right here
that<00:00:28.829> will<00:00:29.009> be<00:00:29.189> around<00:00:32.000> another<00:00:33.000> circle

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:44.380 

another<00:00:37.469> slightly<00:00:38.070> bigger<00:00:38.309> circle

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.560 

for<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.170> ants<00:00:45.670> body<00:00:48.790> now<00:00:49.790> on<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.180> head<00:00:50.360> you

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
for the ants body now on the head you

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.920 
for the ants body now on the head you

would make to the lies and lettuce and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.190 
would make to the lies and lettuce and
then<00:00:57.320> very<00:00:57.830> simply<00:00:58.310> you<00:00:58.970> would<00:00:59.240> make<00:00:59.540> two<00:00:59.930> legs

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
then very simply you would make two legs

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:27.490 
then very simply you would make two legs
one<00:01:04.120> two<00:01:09.640> three<00:01:11.530> four<00:01:13.810> five<00:01:17.470> six<00:01:19.600> seven<00:01:20.600> eight

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.040 

make<00:01:27.830> sure<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:28.220> they're<00:01:28.430> all<00:01:28.550> touching<00:01:29.050> each

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
make sure that they're all touching each

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.990 
make sure that they're all touching each
other<00:01:30.290> correctly<00:01:30.740> then<00:01:31.399> we<00:01:31.580> would<00:01:31.759> use<00:01:31.970> a

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
other correctly then we would use a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.249 
other correctly then we would use a
little<00:01:32.420> bit<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:32.630> red<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:36.619> make<00:01:36.800> stripes<00:01:37.869> on<00:01:38.869> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
little bit of red to make stripes on the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.730 
little bit of red to make stripes on the
exact

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.260 

you<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:47.980> touch<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.340> up<00:01:48.550> with<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.820> little<00:01:49.090> bit<00:01:49.240> of

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
you can touch it up with a little bit of

00:01:49.270 --> 00:02:02.100 
you can touch it up with a little bit of
colored<00:01:49.870> glitter<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:59.650> that's<00:01:59.830> yet
