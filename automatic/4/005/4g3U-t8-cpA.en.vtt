Halo 3 or a halo reach I don't remember
which<00:02:26.810> one<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.020> was<00:02:27.110> they<00:02:27.410> finished<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:28.760> second

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
which one it was they finished in second

which one it was they finished in second
place<00:02:29.420> at<00:02:29.690> MLG<00:02:29.960> dallas<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.590> then<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.070> rest<00:02:31.190> is

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
place at MLG dallas and then the rest is

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.500 
place at MLG dallas and then the rest is
history<00:02:31.400> they<00:02:31.790> started<00:02:32.090> getting<00:02:32.270> first

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
history they started getting first

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.530 
history they started getting first
places<00:02:32.990> they<00:02:33.830> started<00:02:34.160> getting<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:35.120> making

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
places they started getting and making

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.150 
places they started getting and making
more<00:02:35.720> money<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.080> winning<00:02:36.650> tournaments<00:02:36.770> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
more money and winning tournaments and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.220 
more money and winning tournaments and
he's<00:02:37.400> even<00:02:37.580> he's<00:02:38.150> won<00:02:38.420> some<00:02:38.630> little<00:02:38.900> lands

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
he's even he's won some little lands

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.630 
he's even he's won some little lands
this<00:02:39.350> year<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.710> he's<00:02:39.800> traveled<00:02:40.160> around<00:02:40.280> to

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
this year that he's traveled around to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.540 
this year that he's traveled around to
the<00:02:41.450> reason<00:02:41.780> why<00:02:41.960> I<00:02:41.990> think<00:02:42.350> he's<00:02:42.770> perfect<00:02:43.100> for

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
the reason why I think he's perfect for

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.690 
the reason why I think he's perfect for
optic<00:02:44.270> gaming<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.800> he's<00:02:46.070> really<00:02:46.430> he's<00:02:46.670> a

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
optic gaming is that he's really he's a

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.940 
optic gaming is that he's really he's a
respectable<00:02:47.330> guy<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.900> he's<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.050> consistent

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
respectable guy and he's a consistent

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.280 
respectable guy and he's a consistent
competitor<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.700> he's<00:02:50.270> just<00:02:50.570> he's<00:02:50.840> got<00:02:51.050> he's

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
competitor like he's just he's got he's

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.960 
competitor like he's just he's got he's
consistent<00:02:51.860> like<00:02:51.980> optic<00:02:52.310> was<00:02:52.460> last<00:02:52.730> year

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
consistent like optic was last year

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.790 
consistent like optic was last year
unfortunately<00:02:53.930> they<00:02:54.050> only<00:02:54.080> got<00:02:54.440> one

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
unfortunately they only got one

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.830 
unfortunately they only got one
first-place<00:02:55.580> finish<00:02:56.060> last<00:02:56.240> year<00:02:56.420> at<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.600> very

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
first-place finish last year at the very

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.660 
first-place finish last year at the very
beginning<00:02:56.990> in<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.440> first<00:02:57.710> tournament<00:02:58.010> but

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
beginning in the first tournament but

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.130 
beginning in the first tournament but
they<00:02:58.820> were<00:02:58.880> very<00:02:58.970> consistent<00:02:59.810> they<00:02:59.870> finish

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
they were very consistent they finish

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.780 
they were very consistent they finish
top<00:03:00.320> five<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.830> all<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.100> one<00:03:01.280> tournament<00:03:01.550> and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
top five and all but one tournament and

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.880 
top five and all but one tournament and
that<00:03:02.600> seems<00:03:02.990> like<00:03:03.170> that's<00:03:03.410> been<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.740> history

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
that seems like that's been the history

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.580 
that seems like that's been the history
of<00:03:04.190> status<00:03:04.670> quo<00:03:04.910> ever<00:03:05.480> at<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.230> whole<00:03:06.380> time

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
of status quo ever at the whole time

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.920 
of status quo ever at the whole time
that<00:03:06.650> flame<00:03:07.250> sword<00:03:07.550> was<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.820> captain<00:03:08.210> and<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
that flame sword was the captain and the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.810 
that flame sword was the captain and the
other<00:03:09.170> reason<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.740> a<00:03:09.920> few<00:03:10.250> years<00:03:10.310> ago<00:03:10.550> he

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
other reason is that a few years ago he

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.690 
other reason is that a few years ago he
was<00:03:10.940> actually<00:03:11.120> asked<00:03:11.840> how<00:03:12.320> come<00:03:12.680> status<00:03:13.550> quo

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
was actually asked how come status quo

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.449 
was actually asked how come status quo
was<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.090> only<00:03:14.300> top<00:03:14.750> tier<00:03:15.080> team<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.950> keep<00:03:16.220> the

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
was the only top tier team to keep the

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.990 
was the only top tier team to keep the
same<00:03:16.760> roster<00:03:17.090> for<00:03:17.480> all<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.900> 2010<00:03:19.000> MLG

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
same roster for all of the 2010 MLG

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.449 
same roster for all of the 2010 MLG
season<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.720> status<00:03:21.440> quo<00:03:21.620> came<00:03:21.890> back<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.280> said

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
season and status quo came back and said

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.630 
season and status quo came back and said
well<00:03:23.080> we<00:03:24.080> get<00:03:24.260> along<00:03:24.290> outside<00:03:25.130> of<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.430> game

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
well we get along outside of the game

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.780 
well we get along outside of the game

after<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:31.910> we're<00:03:32.209> gonna<00:03:32.270> be<00:03:32.450> laughing<00:03:32.750> about

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
after that we're gonna be laughing about

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.500 
after that we're gonna be laughing about
the<00:03:33.560> argument<00:03:33.770> because<00:03:34.700> we<00:03:34.820> get<00:03:34.940> along<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.420> we

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
the argument because we get along and we

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.390 
the argument because we get along and we
really<00:03:35.720> like<00:03:35.930> each<00:03:35.959> other<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.590> we<00:03:36.650> don't

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
really like each other and we don't

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.870 
really like each other and we don't
analyze<00:03:37.940> each<00:03:38.180> other<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:39.110> much<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.980> where<00:03:40.220> we

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
analyze each other that much to where we

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.699 
analyze each other that much to where we
can't<00:03:41.209> get<00:03:41.360> along<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.810> play<00:03:41.959> together<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.530> I

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
can't get along and play together and I

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.430 
can't get along and play together and I
think<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.790> definition<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.570> optic

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
think that is the definition of optic

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.220 
think that is the definition of optic
gaming<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.980> fits<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.489> brand<00:03:47.050> perfectly<00:03:48.050> and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
gaming that fits the brand perfectly and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.509 
gaming that fits the brand perfectly and
so<00:03:48.410> I'm<00:03:48.530> really<00:03:48.769> looking<00:03:49.040> forward<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.400> what

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
so I'm really looking forward to what

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.280 
so I'm really looking forward to what
they're<00:03:49.670> gonna<00:03:49.760> do<00:03:50.000> together<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.570> am<00:03:50.989> sad<00:03:51.260> that

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
the game well enough yet to actually be

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.259 
the game well enough yet to actually be
like<00:04:18.049> mr.<00:04:18.890> X<00:04:19.100> from<00:04:19.340> complexity<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.120> know<00:04:20.209> to

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
like mr. X from complexity you know to

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.180 
like mr. X from complexity you know to
have<00:04:20.510> that<00:04:20.780> level<00:04:21.109> or<00:04:21.229> Triple<00:04:21.500> H<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.859> have<00:04:22.010> that

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
have that level or Triple H to have that

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.220 
have that level or Triple H to have that
level<00:04:22.400> of

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
level of

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.320 
level of
and<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:23.710> we'll<00:04:23.890> see<00:04:24.100> but<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:24.880> think<00:04:25.090> this<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.270> a

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
and so we'll see but I think this is a

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.060 
and so we'll see but I think this is a
great<00:04:25.420> decision<00:04:25.720> for<00:04:25.960> optic<00:04:26.230> gaming<00:04:26.380> this<00:04:26.950> is

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
great decision for optic gaming this is

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.560 
great decision for optic gaming this is
your<00:04:27.160> boy<00:04:27.250> Kingdom<00:04:27.580> soldier<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.060> I'll<00:04:28.330> see<00:04:28.480> in

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
your boy Kingdom soldier and I'll see in

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.680 
your boy Kingdom soldier and I'll see in
the<00:04:28.630> next<00:04:28.660> video<00:04:28.990> peace
