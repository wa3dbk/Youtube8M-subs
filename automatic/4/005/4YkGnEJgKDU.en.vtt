book i completely skipped all the
graveyard<00:04:16.470> stuff<00:04:16.799> because<00:04:17.070> i<00:04:17.190> didn't<00:04:17.489> really

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940

I<00:04:18.259> don't<00:04:19.259> know<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.349> guess<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.709> was<00:04:19.859> just<00:04:19.889> like<00:04:20.130> oh

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
I don't know I guess I was just like oh

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.469 
I don't know I guess I was just like oh
this<00:04:20.400> book<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.669> too<00:04:20.789> long<00:04:20.940> let's<00:04:21.180> get<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.389> the

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
this book is too long let's get to the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.740 
this book is too long let's get to the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
end so I I skipped all that and then I

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.000 
end so I I skipped all that and then I
started<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.110> 5th<00:04:25.260> book<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.710> was

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
confused because Voldemort like he's

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.570 
confused because Voldemort like he's
back<00:04:28.920> what<00:04:29.990> what<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:31.890> over<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.220> years<00:04:32.250> of

though middle school I kind of dwindled
away<00:05:18.720> from<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:19.710> reading<00:05:20.280> section<00:05:20.640> of<00:05:20.850> our

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
away from the reading section of our

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.150 
away from the reading section of our
noble<00:05:21.330> that's<00:05:21.510> very<00:05:21.780> kiddush<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.560> I<00:05:22.860> started

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
noble that's very kiddush and I started

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.490 
noble that's very kiddush and I started
going<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.670> thing<00:05:24.300> called<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.960> why<00:05:25.470> a

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
going to the thing called the why a

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.920 
going to the thing called the why a
section<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:26.700> back<00:05:26.940> then<00:05:27.150> it<00:05:27.300> was<00:05:27.420> like<00:05:27.450> one

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
section and it back then it was like one

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.840 
section and it back then it was like one
shelf<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.740> think<00:05:29.460> like<00:05:29.640> one<00:05:29.850> side<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.690> shelf

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
shelf I think like one side of a shelf

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.230 
shelf I think like one side of a shelf
unit<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:33.000> would<00:05:33.450> get<00:05:34.170> the<00:05:34.440> books<00:05:34.650> um<00:05:35.040> and<00:05:35.640> I<00:05:36.000> read

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
unit I would get the books um and I read

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.980 
unit I would get the books um and I read
them<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:37.160> it's<00:05:38.160> slow<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.090> didn't<00:05:39.810> really

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
them and it's slow and I I didn't really

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.780 
them and it's slow and I I didn't really
go<00:05:40.110> into<00:05:40.140> a<00:05:40.350> too<00:05:40.620> fast<00:05:40.950> but<00:05:41.310> I<00:05:41.340> remember

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
go into a too fast but I remember

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.730 
go into a too fast but I remember
reading<00:05:41.940> some<00:05:42.270> several<00:05:42.600> books<00:05:42.750> that<00:05:43.140> that

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
reading some several books that that

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.310 
reading some several books that that
really<00:05:43.980> helped<00:05:44.580> me<00:05:44.640> pick<00:05:44.790> up<00:05:45.030> why<00:05:45.660> a<00:05:45.690> reading<00:05:46.230> a

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
really helped me pick up why a reading a

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.110 
really helped me pick up why a reading a
lot<00:05:46.470> like<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:47.100> mortal<00:05:47.490> instruments<00:05:47.520> series

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
lot like the mortal instruments series

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.890 
lot like the mortal instruments series
and<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.960> hunger<00:05:49.350> games<00:05:49.640> and<00:05:50.690> that's<00:05:51.690> all<00:05:51.870> I

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
and the hunger games and that's all I

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.780 
and the hunger games and that's all I
can<00:05:52.020> remember<00:05:52.230> honestly<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:53.550> I<00:05:53.580> would

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
can remember honestly and so I would

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.660 
can remember honestly and so I would
spend<00:05:54.090> my<00:05:54.780> mornings<00:05:55.470> reading<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.100> library

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
spend my mornings reading the library

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.130 
spend my mornings reading the library
for<00:05:56.730> the<00:05:56.910> bell<00:05:57.180> rang<00:05:57.450> like<00:05:57.690> a<00:05:57.930> dork<00:05:58.620> and<00:05:58.920> um

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
for the bell rang like a dork and um

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.440 
for the bell rang like a dork and um
even<00:06:01.140> in<00:06:01.500> high<00:06:01.710> school<00:06:01.850> sometimes<00:06:02.850> not<00:06:03.240> really

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
even in high school sometimes not really

even in high school sometimes not really
much<00:06:03.570> anymore<00:06:03.840> but<00:06:04.650> my<00:06:04.830> first<00:06:05.070> years<00:06:05.430> of<00:06:05.520> high

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
much anymore but my first years of high

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.010 
much anymore but my first years of high
school<00:06:05.700> I<00:06:06.030> would<00:06:06.240> sometimes<00:06:06.720> go<00:06:06.870> in<00:06:06.960> the

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
school I would sometimes go in the

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.140 
school I would sometimes go in the
mornings<00:06:07.380> on<00:06:07.650> an<00:06:07.800> early<00:06:08.070> morning<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.610> read

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
mornings on an early morning and read

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.130 
mornings on an early morning and read
instead<00:06:09.600> of<00:06:10.340> sleeping<00:06:11.340> longer<00:06:11.730> which<00:06:12.450> was<00:06:12.780> a

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
instead of sleeping longer which was a

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.870 
instead of sleeping longer which was a
really<00:06:13.890> weird<00:06:14.040> decision<00:06:14.340> now<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.760> i<00:06:14.790> think

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
really weird decision now that i think

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.640 
really weird decision now that i think
about<00:06:15.120> it<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:15.540> so<00:06:15.780> that's<00:06:15.960> basically<00:06:16.230> where<00:06:16.590> I

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
about it and so that's basically where I

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.260 
about it and so that's basically where I
came<00:06:16.740> from<00:06:16.980> from<00:06:17.400> reading<00:06:17.730> i<00:06:17.820> came<00:06:18.060> i
