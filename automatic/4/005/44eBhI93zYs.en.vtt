00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 honorable Members of Parliament 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.050
 Catalan a very special greeting from 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.610
 colombia my name is Ã¡lvaro mÃºnera 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.630
 in a time of wrong decisions 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.730
 I was a bullfighter 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.410
 next to the velvet man in the square 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.020
 of bulls from munera albacete took me by 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.430
 the left leg broke my fifth 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.740
 cervical vertebra spinal injury 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.910
 complete and a blunt diagnosis 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.310
 I could not walk again 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.650
 and moved to the united states there and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.410
 four years in my process of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.050
 rehabilitation four years that I lived as 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.030
 a fruit offenders in the environment of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.180
 hospital of my college friends 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.800
 They did not understand how someone could 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 devote his life to torture and kill 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.030
 animals 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.340
 were many lessons learned 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.190
 but the most important one that the wrong one 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.010
 it was me that it is not ethical that still in the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.280
 21st century countries with practices 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.930
 as cruel as this 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.870
 I became an animal defender 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.180
 so far and I think I will work 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.949
 until the last day of my life by 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.860
 defend the right that everything has to be 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.380
 I live not to be tortured stop seeing the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.960
 bull as a raw material the bull is 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.509
 a living being who feels that he suffers 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.470
 It has a central nervous system 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.100
 demonstrated by physiology and 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.869
 neurology equal to ours that responds 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.780
 to the pain stimuli in it 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.700
 way that feels scared that came out 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.060
 terrified to the square that does not want to be 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.790
 there and it shows it many times 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 I think you have in your hand 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.970
 a historical decision 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 bullfighting accuse us of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.220
 defenders of animals inside by way 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.360
 of wanting to place behaviors 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.630
 humans in animals 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.870
 is on the contrary anthropos for same is 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.240
 say that the bull dies with the plea the 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.850
 animals do not depend on honor 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.829
 a horse when he wins a race he 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.540
 behaves in the same way to how it 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.060
 it involves the second the third and the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.850
 fourth none leaves celebrating they do not 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.700
 they depend on no honor when when 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.709
 they do not behave instinctively what 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.560
 least want to suffer because the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.900
 suffering if you join us all that was 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.540
 what I understood a long time ago and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.280
 that is why I consider that the vote 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.480
 you have to give this project 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.120
 it is a civilist vote is a vote 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.290
 humanitarian is a vote so that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.989
 let's accept that we are not alone in this 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.120
 world that all animals suffer that 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.920
 all animals feel and that the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.380
 man takes a step forward in his 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.480
 cruelty when not only the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.090
 mistreat and structure for his 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 benefit but also have fun with 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.480
 your pain 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.939
 my heartfelt invitation as a being 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.370
 repentant human and who understood very 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.870
 Of course I had to bring him back to life 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.959
 and to the world all that burden of cruelty 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.909
 who had infringed the animals 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.340
 vote thinking that if you 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.439
 I would like them to do what 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.530
 we make them to God tor 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.530
 bless
