00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.740 
I used to dye my hair all the time dying
my<00:00:06.690> hair<00:00:06.779> was<00:00:07.200> like<00:00:07.379> my<00:00:07.680> thing<00:00:08.150> as<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.360> can<00:00:09.480> see

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750

don't<00:00:13.650> know<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:13.889> they're<00:00:14.009> called<00:00:14.190> lowlights

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
don't know if they're called lowlights

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.070 
don't know if they're called lowlights
or<00:00:14.759> highlights<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.330> always<00:00:15.599> thought<00:00:15.690> they<00:00:15.960> were

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
or highlights I always thought they were

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.500 
or highlights I always thought they were
low<00:00:16.289> lights<00:00:16.529> if<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.859> had<00:00:17.060> light<00:00:18.060> hair<00:00:18.090> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
low lights if you had light hair and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.660 
low lights if you had light hair and
then<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.720> got<00:00:18.900> darker<00:00:19.230> color<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.890> even

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
then you got darker color and even

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.720 
then you got darker color and even
though<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.270> mean<00:00:21.539> they<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:21.990> lighter<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.800> have

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
though I mean they are lighter I have

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.609 
though I mean they are lighter I have
black<00:00:24.000> hair<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.170> idea<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.439> them<00:00:25.590> being

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
black hair I like the idea of them being

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.410 
black hair I like the idea of them being
low<00:00:25.949> lights<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:26.640> they're<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.910> down

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
low lights and because they're like down

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.389 
low lights and because they're like down

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
here I feel like I just made up my own

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.889 
here I feel like I just made up my own
interpretation<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.640> anyways<00:00:33.000> um<00:00:33.360> these<00:00:33.840> are

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
interpretation but anyways um these are

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.170 
interpretation but anyways um these are
some<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> ones<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.680> died<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:36.030> you

magenta I think that's where I made my

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.830 
magenta I think that's where I made my
mistake<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:27.000> dying<00:01:27.210> my<00:01:27.330> hair<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
know I mean I think it's just cuz they

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.280 
know I mean I think it's just cuz they
just<00:01:49.530> got<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.829> stripped<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.659> i<00:01:51.689> did<00:01:51.780> was

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
just got so stripped but what i did was

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.800 
just got so stripped but what i did was
i<00:01:52.350> bleached<00:01:52.770> my<00:01:52.920> hair<00:01:53.009> first<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.299> i

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
i bleached my hair first and then i

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.709 
i bleached my hair first and then i
would<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> color<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.310> top<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.939> i<00:01:57.390> did<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
would do the color on top and i did a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.830 
would do the color on top and i did a
lot<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.930> different<00:01:58.049> brands<00:01:58.500> i<00:01:58.860> did<00:01:59.840> mostly

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
lot of different brands i did mostly

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020 
lot of different brands i did mostly
manic<00:02:01.229> panic<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.979> trick<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.610> learned<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.000> if

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
manic panic but trick I learned is if

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.480 
manic panic but trick I learned is if
you<00:02:03.240> mix<00:02:03.479> two<00:02:03.750> colors<00:02:03.930> together<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.799> makes<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you mix two colors together it makes the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.980 
you mix two colors together it makes the
colors<00:02:05.670> last<00:02:06.030> longer<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> makes<00:02:06.899> them

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
colors last longer and it makes them

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
colors last longer and it makes them
brighter<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> used<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.789> magenta

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
brighter so I used to do like a magenta

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.550 
brighter so I used to do like a magenta
pink<00:02:10.080> purple<00:02:10.410> mix<00:02:10.950> them<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.160> together

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
pink purple mix them all together

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.740 
pink purple mix them all together
