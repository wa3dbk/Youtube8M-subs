yeah<00:01:52.740> anyway<00:01:53.340> let's<00:01:53.670> fire<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.909> up

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.350 

very<00:02:03.270> very<00:02:03.600> smooth<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.500> don't<00:02:05.310> know<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> PG<00:02:06.000> VG

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
very very smooth I don't know the PG VG

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300 
very very smooth I don't know the PG VG
ratio<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.200> figure<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.650> out<00:02:07.680> i<00:02:07.800> will<00:02:08.070> post

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
ratio if I figure that out i will post

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.520 
ratio if I figure that out i will post
it<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.990> producing<00:02:10.350> great

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it but you know it's producing great

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.730 
it but you know it's producing great
clouds<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:10.979> I'm<00:02:11.070> assuming<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.610> high<00:02:11.820> VG

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
clouds so I'm assuming it's high VG
