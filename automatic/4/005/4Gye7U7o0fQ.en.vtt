00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.210
I think I've been playing for 18 years in First Division. 
I'm a fan of Boca.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.950
As a kid I dreamed playing a game with that shirt.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.410
I dreamed to enter the Bombonera someday.
Being champion seemed so far away.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.389
I know people love me.
I love the Boca fans.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.950
Then I feel a lucky man, right?
I have had the fortune of living incredible moments,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.770
playing wi th partners who did it
great.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.600
Playing in teams that made me things very easy  
and that have made me win a lot.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.980
of things.   

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.400
I was lucky to debut against Union.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.780
that day the people ended truly happy, 
treated me with great affection

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.720
But I feel a lucky person after 
18 years from the debut against Union, to finish 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.390
against LanÃºs, and that people end just 
as happy than then, and that I have had made 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.390
a good match.
That was wonderful for me.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.530
It means that from the beginning to the end 
I defended the shirt of Boca 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.470
in the best way, I have played in the best way.
Nobody has gifted me anything.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.020
I think ... I must be one of the players 
who have been given less.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.070
It has helped me to be demanded to the maximum 
and today I can say that I am very, very happy 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.300
with how I was wearing the shirt that 
I love so much
