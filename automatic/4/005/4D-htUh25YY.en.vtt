00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 we will tell you more about this video 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.400
 serious damage 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.740
 By this we mean a flat tire 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.110
 perforations but on deformations of the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
 band as you may know exists 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.070
 a belt made of several layers of material 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 So it is crucial that this leaves you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.550
 stay on top of each other 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.350
 damage can lead to a flat tire 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.150
 unfortunately not all can 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.890
 Damages are repaired and in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.060
 In some cases, your tire needs to be 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.010
 to replace 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 always be very alert for perforations 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.519
 even if you think you can work with the band 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.660
 drive on 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 have your tire checked by a 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.890
 specialist and this will if necessary be the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 tire and on the inside and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 check the outside 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.590
 during the inspection of the inside 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.450
 of the tire can be determined or the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.770
 tire is damaged because you are using a 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.750
 flat tire or too low 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
 tire pressure has driven 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.070
 also have this inspection carried out if there is 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.870
 cracks in the tire are that use 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.629
 of an anti leak spray is just one 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.640
 temporary solution also repair with 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.170
 a plug through the outside of the tire 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.670
 is not recommended 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.100
 the band does n't get out of it 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 wheel dismantles and requires inspection 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.880
 from the inside of the tire is not 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.580
 performed in different places 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.200
 Cracks can occur in most 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.180
 they are evenly distributed 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 all over the band 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.479
 these cracks are a sign that it is 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.040
 rubber is outdated 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.049
 by exposure to ozone and UV 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
 radiation is the raw there after a period of 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.729
 time hard and can shake 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.710
 We recommend that you use tires with cracks 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 to be replaced even if the profile is true 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.509
 thickness can last a few years 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.970
 la bande regularly five years after assembly 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.100
 review by our specialist men who 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.119
 be over 10 years old and always have to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.829
 to be replaced 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.960
 even if they have no visible defects 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.640
 or if they are legal 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.100
 have not yet reached the wear limit 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 to pay the age of a tire 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.780
 You can watch our video about tire markings 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.939
 view for the training and how small 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 also serious damage to you 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.170
 should not ignore the most common 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.340
 Distortion is great on the side wall 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.079
 of the band 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 This is usually the result of it 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.259
 bumps into curbs or driving 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.180
 by pits 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.210
 we sidewall is squeezed as a result 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.420
 or pressed and this is a type of civilization 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.830
 irreparable 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.110
 a tire should be in this case 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.150
 replaced distortions can also 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.010
 arise when the rubber comes into contact 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.780
 with a chemical product 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 a well-known example of this is one 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.380
 spare tire in the trunk 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.450
 on which oil has been spilled from a bottle 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.130
 some cleaning agents that do not 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.989
 Your rubber may be suitable 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.430
 adjusted tires 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.290
 we hope we will in this video 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.300
 have sufficiently informed 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.280
 accurate and reliable diagnosis 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.420
 However, it is always a tire specialist
