anytime<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> situation<00:00:49.289> where

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
anytime you have a situation where

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
anytime you have a situation where
there's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> mandate<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.879> place<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.390> there's

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
there's a mandate in place and there's

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.479 
there's a mandate in place and there's
the<00:00:51.780> law<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.440> place<00:00:52.680> that's<00:00:53.010> absolutely

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the law in place that's absolutely

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.920 
the law in place that's absolutely
unbending<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.149> doesn't<00:00:54.510> take<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.780> by<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
unbending and doesn't take it by a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.430 
unbending and doesn't take it by a
case-by-case<00:00:55.640> in<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.760> case-by-case<00:00:57.140> way<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
case-by-case in a case-by-case way I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.400 
case-by-case in a case-by-case way I
think<00:00:59.239> it<00:01:00.239> presents<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.750> situation<00:01:01.320> that's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
think it presents a situation that's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.869 
think it presents a situation that's
right<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.949> something<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.730> happen

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
right for something like this to happen

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
right for something like this to happen
I<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.660> snitching<00:01:04.290> works

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
I think the way that snitching works

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.770 
I think the way that snitching works
that<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.129> rat<00:01:05.939> somebody<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.540> whether

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that you can rat somebody out whether

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.250 
that you can rat somebody out whether
they<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.340> yourself<00:01:08.729> off<00:01:09.260> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
they you know to get yourself off and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
they you know to get yourself off and
then<00:01:10.439> they're<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.430> position<00:01:11.640> where

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
then they're put in this position where

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.640 
then they're put in this position where
there's<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.330> mandatory<00:01:12.720> minimum<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.409> place

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
there's this mandatory minimum in place

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.590 
there's this mandatory minimum in place
I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.840> again<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:17.479> for<00:01:18.479> all

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
I think that you know again it for all

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.149 
I think that you know again it for all
the<00:01:18.780> times<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> works<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.979> going

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the times that it works there is going

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.469 
the times that it works there is going
to<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.670> time<00:01:20.970> where<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.299> just

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
to be that one time where it just

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.170 
to be that one time where it just
totally<00:01:21.950> crumbles<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> destroyed<00:01:23.909> these

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
totally crumbles and and destroyed these

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.789 
totally crumbles and and destroyed these
families<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> brings<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.290> these<00:01:25.409> people

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
families and brings all these people

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.550 
families and brings all these people
into<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.100> web<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.520> danger<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.060> lies<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.560> and
