00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
see where the WWE is actually slowly

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.020 
see where the WWE is actually slowly
building<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.620> thing<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.640> said<00:03:29.910> if

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
building this thing and like I said if

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.120 
building this thing and like I said if
you<00:03:30.090> pay<00:03:30.269> attention<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.780> last<00:03:30.989> day<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.350> Raw<00:03:31.590> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
you pay attention to last day on Raw you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.250 
you pay attention to last day on Raw you
could<00:03:32.340> definitely<00:03:32.549> see<00:03:33.030> John<00:03:33.390> Cena<00:03:33.780> starting

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
could definitely see John Cena starting

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.870 
could definitely see John Cena starting
to<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:37.230> heel<00:03:37.470> turn<00:03:37.709> it's<00:03:37.950> it's<00:03:38.100> emotion<00:03:38.640> III

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
to the heel turn it's it's emotion III

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.509 
to the heel turn it's it's emotion III
think<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.510> been<00:03:39.720> set<00:03:39.989> in<00:03:40.110> motion<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.430> I

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
think it's been set in motion and I

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.210
