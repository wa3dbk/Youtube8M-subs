here<00:00:01.140> at<00:00:01.230> majestic<00:00:01.680> Rome's<00:00:01.979> at<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.190> moment

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
here at majestic Rome's at the moment

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.360 
here at majestic Rome's at the moment
we're<00:00:02.669> currently<00:00:03.000> trying<00:00:03.540> out<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.020> max<00:00:04.440> max

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
we're currently trying out the max max

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.629 
we're currently trying out the max max
spec<00:00:06.000> lights<00:00:06.770> so<00:00:07.770> they're<00:00:08.010> 5<00:00:08.280> watt<00:00:08.519> LEDs

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
spec lights so they're 5 watt LEDs

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.830 
spec lights so they're 5 watt LEDs
pretty<00:00:11.639> good<00:00:11.849> they<00:00:12.210> can<00:00:12.360> come<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> nice

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
pretty good they can come on a nice

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560 
pretty good they can come on a nice
bracket<00:00:13.639> for<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.759> brackets<00:00:15.150> obviously

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
bracket for that brackets obviously

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.260 
bracket for that brackets obviously
upside<00:00:15.900> down<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.699> attached<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
upside down so it can be attached to the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.910 
upside down so it can be attached to the
top<00:00:18.480> whereas<00:00:18.840> normally<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.380> bracket<00:00:19.650> will

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
top whereas normally that bracket will

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.720 
top whereas normally that bracket will
come<00:00:20.130> off<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.910> top<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.270> aquarium<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:23.580> are

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
come off the top of the aquarium and are

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.700 
come off the top of the aquarium and are
usually<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.180> elevated<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:24.990> high<00:00:25.199> above<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
usually not elevated so high above the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
usually not elevated so high above the
aquarium<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.330> case<00:00:27.570> it's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
aquarium it's just in this case it's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.109 
aquarium it's just in this case it's
convenient<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.560> us<00:00:28.619> because<00:00:29.609> we're<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:29.910> an

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
convenient for us because we're in an

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.650 
convenient for us because we're in an
hour<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.449> tank<00:00:30.689> all<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> time<00:00:31.430> it's<00:00:32.430> got

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
hour at the tank all the time it's got

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.530 
hour at the tank all the time it's got
computer<00:00:33.660> controller<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:38.540> different

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
computer controller on it different

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.650 
computer controller on it different
cycles<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.230> things<00:00:40.730> sunup<00:00:41.730> sundown<00:00:41.790> Moon's

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
cycles and things sunup sundown Moon's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650 
cycles and things sunup sundown Moon's
clouds<00:00:43.170> everything<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.340> can<00:00:44.489> think<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
clouds everything you can think of and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.569 
clouds everything you can think of and
one<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> great<00:00:46.890> things<00:00:47.160> about<00:00:47.219> these

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
one of the great things about these

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.010 
one of the great things about these
particular<00:00:47.910> ones<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.510> many<00:00:48.840> different

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
particular ones is how many different

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.600 
particular ones is how many different
colors<00:00:49.440> are<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> there's<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.579> different

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
colors are in it there's all different

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.630 
colors are in it there's all different
LED<00:00:51.390> modules<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.920> see<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.309> 5

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
LED modules so I can see about 5

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.080 
LED modules so I can see about 5
different<00:00:53.910> color<00:00:54.480> spectrums<00:00:55.340> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.699> actual

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
different color spectrums in the actual

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.610 
different color spectrums in the actual
light<00:00:57.329> which<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> obviously<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> big<00:00:58.739> benefit

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
light which is obviously a big benefit

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.579 
light which is obviously a big benefit
so<00:01:01.620> they're<00:01:01.829> nice<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.399> bright<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:04.409> they're

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so they're nice and bright and they're

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
so they're nice and bright and they're
relatively<00:01:05.100> good<00:01:05.400> value<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> quality<00:01:06.390> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
relatively good value for the quality of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.620 
relatively good value for the quality of
them<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.650> very<00:01:07.710> skeptical<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.820> most<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
them I'm very skeptical of most of the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.359 
them I'm very skeptical of most of the
LED<00:01:10.020> lights<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> market<00:01:10.970> like<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.000> one

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
LED lights on the market like that one

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.890 
LED lights on the market like that one
I've<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.909> reservation<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.720> them

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
I've got a lot of reservation on them

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.530 
I've got a lot of reservation on them
and<00:01:16.580> one<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> main<00:01:17.909> problem<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and one of the main problem is with the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.429 
and one of the main problem is with the
cheaper<00:01:18.900> units<00:01:20.330> they<00:01:21.330> might<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.720> three<00:01:22.229> what

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
cheaper units they might be three what

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
cheaper units they might be three what
globes<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.330> actually

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
globes but then there's not actually

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.510 
globes but then there's not actually
three<00:01:24.780> what's<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> lot

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
three what's going to them because a lot

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.710 
three what's going to them because a lot
of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> time<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.119> actually<00:01:27.540> putting

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
of the time if you are actually putting

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.280 
of the time if you are actually putting
3<00:01:28.049> watts<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> globe<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> parallel<00:01:29.549> circuit

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
3 watts to a globe in parallel circuit

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.630 
3 watts to a globe in parallel circuit
it<00:01:31.290> either<00:01:31.409> heats<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.890> too<00:01:32.070> much<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> make

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it either heats up too much and make

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640 
it either heats up too much and make
some<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.970> globe's<00:01:33.210> pop<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
some of the globe's pop so what the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.440 
some of the globe's pop so what the
Chinese<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.610> reduce<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> amount<00:01:36.360> of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
Chinese do is just reduce the amount of

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.899 
Chinese do is just reduce the amount of
energy<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:37.369> electricity<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
energy going electricity going to it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
energy going electricity going to it
then<00:01:39.479> what<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:40.170> does<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.650> means

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
then what that actually does is means

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.260 
then what that actually does is means
that<00:01:41.610> you're<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:41.790> getting<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> right

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
that you're not getting the right

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
that you're not getting the right
intensity<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.960> spectrum<00:01:43.439> out<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> globe

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
intensity all spectrum out of the globe

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.870 
intensity all spectrum out of the globe
because<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.460> getting<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> right

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
because you're not getting the right

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
because you're not getting the right
amount<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> light<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.780> whereas<00:01:46.409> these<00:01:46.560> ones

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
amount of light to it whereas these ones

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.370 
amount of light to it whereas these ones
here<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.640> parallel<00:01:48.149> circuits<00:01:48.630> these

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
here are not on parallel circuits these

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.340 
here are not on parallel circuits these
are<00:01:49.560> individually<00:01:50.479> powered<00:01:51.479> each<00:01:51.689> sing<00:01:52.079> inch

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
are individually powered each sing inch

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.530 
are individually powered each sing inch
each<00:01:52.680> globe<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.850> making<00:01:54.000> sure<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
each globe so you're making sure that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.300 
each globe so you're making sure that
you<00:01:54.630> are<00:01:54.750> getting<00:01:54.960> exactly<00:01:55.409> 5<00:01:55.740> watts<00:01:56.040> per

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you are getting exactly 5 watts per

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.190 
you are getting exactly 5 watts per
globe<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:58.950> dem<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.700> fade<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.840> all

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
globe so they dem up and fade and all

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.069 
globe so they dem up and fade and all
the<00:02:01.290> rest<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:02.640> very<00:02:02.820> easy<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.930> add

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the rest of it it's very easy to add

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.859 
the rest of it it's very easy to add
extra<00:02:04.710> units<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> basically<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.630> need<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
extra units so you basically just need a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.600 
extra units so you basically just need a
power<00:02:07.140> supply

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
power supply

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.200 
power supply
and<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:09.360> couple<00:02:09.570> of<00:02:09.690> units<00:02:09.960> to<00:02:10.110> run<00:02:10.259> off<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
and a couple of units to run off it and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.790 
and a couple of units to run off it and
you<00:02:12.210> can<00:02:12.360> add<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.600> computer<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.380> do<00:02:13.530> all<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you can add the computer to do all the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.030 
you can add the computer to do all the
the<00:02:14.160> tricky<00:02:14.520> stuff<00:02:14.760> with<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> light<00:02:16.040> but

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the tricky stuff with the light but

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.740 
the tricky stuff with the light but
value<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:17.640> money

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
value for money

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.320 
value for money
I<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:19.680> these<00:02:19.800> Mac<00:02:20.520> specs<00:02:20.850> are<00:02:20.970> probably<00:02:21.210> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
I think these Mac specs are probably the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.510 
I think these Mac specs are probably the
go<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:22.530> other<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.980> I've<00:02:23.100> been<00:02:23.280> quite

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
go the other one I've been quite

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.230 
go the other one I've been quite
impressed<00:02:23.940> with<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.420> radians<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:27.060> lot

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
impressed with is the radians and a lot

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.820 
impressed with is the radians and a lot
of<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> others<00:02:27.660> I've<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:28.050> been<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.500> impress

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
so I don't have a lot of corals in here

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.570 
so I don't have a lot of corals in here
at<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.380> moment<00:02:40.530> because<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.010> weather's<00:02:41.400> been

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
at the moment because the weather's been

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.320 
at the moment because the weather's been
pretty<00:02:41.820> bad<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.180> get<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> idea

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
pretty bad but you get the idea

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.760 
pretty bad but you get the idea
they're<00:02:48.330> definitely<00:02:48.560> definitely<00:02:49.560> pretty

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
they're definitely definitely pretty

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.750 
they're definitely definitely pretty
modern<00:02:50.459> looking<00:02:50.790> pretty<00:02:51.060> smart<00:02:51.360> looking<00:02:51.540> line
