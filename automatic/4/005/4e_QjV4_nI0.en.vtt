00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
guys those right now so first we're

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
guys those right now so first we're
going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> start<00:01:02.699> off<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.719> scientist

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
going to start off with the scientist

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.899 
going to start off with the scientist
class<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:06.049> go<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.880> sharp<00:01:09.240> shot<00:01:09.479> look<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
class and go here to sharp shot look and

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.600 
class and go here to sharp shot look and
this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.210> him<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.970> ahead<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.060> transform

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
this is him here go ahead and transform

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.679 
this is him here go ahead and transform
and<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.240> pretty<00:01:18.450> cool

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and I think it's going to be pretty cool

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
and I think it's going to be pretty cool
to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:19.049> able<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> fly<00:01:19.500> around<00:01:19.650> his<00:01:19.979> giant<00:01:20.460> bugs

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
to be able to fly around his giant bugs

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.880 
to be able to fly around his giant bugs
I<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> insecticons<00:01:22.619> are

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
I think I think the insecticons are

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
I think I think the insecticons are
gonna<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.159> quite<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> disadvantage

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
gonna have quite a bit of a disadvantage

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.929 
gonna have quite a bit of a disadvantage
just<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.320> they're<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.650> big<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
just because they're so big the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
just because they're so big the
insecticons<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.780> Dinobots<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.350> both<00:01:28.530> like

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
insecticons and Dinobots are both like

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.270 
insecticons and Dinobots are both like
that<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.659> here<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.049> kickback<00:01:33.950> he<00:01:34.950> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that so here we go with kickback he is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.770 
that so here we go with kickback he is
um<00:01:35.850> he's<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:37.020> he's<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> lot<00:01:37.470> cooler<00:01:37.680> looking

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
um he's a lot he's a lot cooler looking

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
um he's a lot he's a lot cooler looking
in<00:01:39.780> my<00:01:39.960> opinion<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.650> he<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> pretty<00:01:41.520> sweet

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
in my opinion and he has a pretty sweet

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.170 
in my opinion and he has a pretty sweet
transformation<00:01:43.100> again<00:01:44.100> another<00:01:44.579> huge

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
transformation again another huge

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.670 
transformation again another huge
character<00:01:45.659> model<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> be

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
character model so it's going to be

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.090 
character model so it's going to be
super<00:01:46.950> easy<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.030> shoot<00:01:48.270> move<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.350> over<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:49.829> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
super easy to shoot move on over here to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.969 
super easy to shoot move on over here to
the<00:01:50.369> Titan<00:01:50.970> where<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> hard<00:01:52.470> shell<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
the Titan where we have a hard shell and

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.050 
the Titan where we have a hard shell and
we'll<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.430> his<00:01:56.579> transformation

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
we'll go and see his transformation

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.130 
we'll go and see his transformation
which<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.509> huge<00:01:57.990> again<00:01:58.799> put<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> heat<00:02:00.140> watch

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
which is huge again put it heat watch

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
which is huge again put it heat watch
out<00:02:01.350> past<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> transformation<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.640> from

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
out past the transformation is from

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.780 
out past the transformation is from
robot<00:02:03.210> mode<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.600> vehicle<00:02:03.930> mode<00:02:04.280> boom<00:02:05.280> done
