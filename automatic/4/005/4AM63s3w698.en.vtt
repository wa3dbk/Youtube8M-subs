00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.350
 I don `t believe 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello youtube friends that such as 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.990

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.290
 montse this is a variety channel 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.599
 where you are going to learn from everything a little and 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.390
 Well, as it approaches Easter 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.419
 today I decided to do a tutorial 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.020
 to teach them how to make a basket with 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.899
 candy is very common here in the USA 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.270
 these baskets for these dates is a 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.360
 super cute detail even if you do not live 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.269
 here in the USA it does not matter it's a detail 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.879
 that anyone will love 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.179
 so pay close attention because the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.060
 List of materials is as follows 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:50.460
 let's use a basket 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.520
 floral foam also known as 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.940
 dry ice 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.880
 synthetic grass to decorate paper 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.800
 cellophane a glue gun 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.370
 hot 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.490
 wooden sticks and a variety of 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.350
 sweet my theme is easter but you 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.690
 you can do it what you like most 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.280
 The first thing we are going to do is paste 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.100
 the wooden sticks to our sweets 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.740
 You choose what you want and paste 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.690
 others prefer that they go loose using 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.150
 the pistolita let's put some 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.790
 I resist on the stick very carefully 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.800
 so they will not burn too 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.890
 you can tape them with your expert or 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.930
 of the very resistant to me the personal I 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.050
 like to use hot resistol because it 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.229
 It dries very fast and hits very well 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.360
 we will continue to stick the sticks of 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.750
 wood on the back of our 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.090
 sweet if you stick these sticks are not 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.220
 so thin they have to be a little 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.830
 thick so that they resist the weight of 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.640
 sweet you can find them in any 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.640
 craft shop 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.920
 but no 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 the mountain 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.670
 already having all our sweets ready 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.470
 we continue with the next part using 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.930
 again the pistolite I'm going to put 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.000
 resistol on the entire base of the foam 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.700
 floral and I'm going to paste it in the basket 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.920
 this is going to prevent the sweets from being 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.980
 moving from one side to another or that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.520
 we are going to press them very well 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.010
 so that they are well stuck after I go 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.460
 to place the cellophane around 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.520
 the basket I cut 4 frames for 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.970
 put it on each side as well as they are 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.970
 seeing 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.870
 but not 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.800
 and now if the fun part comes 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.690
 let's accommodate our candy what 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.820
 good of floral foam is that you 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.310
 allows you to put them on different levels 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.220
 you can adapt them to your liking 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.200
 so that you think they look good to me 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.780
 I like to put the biggest one in between 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.370
 because I'm going there based to go 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.370
 placing the other sweets 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.150
 but no 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.890
 but 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.080
 and now yes already having the sweets well 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.960
 placed we are going to put our grass 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.300
 synthetic around the basket and go 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.750
 hiding the floral foam so it does not 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.750
 be seen 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.799
 finally I will use these eggs 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.290
 of Easter that are very popular I'm going 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.950
 to open and I'm going to put chocolatitos 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.709
 inside to make it like a surprise 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.660
 extra plus additional decoration in 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.660
 our basket 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.660
 Y 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.489
 do not 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.489
 to 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.540
 good and that's how our 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.310
 easter basket as is very good to 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.310
 I really love it looks super 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.980
 pretty plus it's a super detail 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.870
 very economical and I'm sure that 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.320

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.360
