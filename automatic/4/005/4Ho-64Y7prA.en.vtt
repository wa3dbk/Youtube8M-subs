move<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> ball<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:46.309> so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.590 

and<00:00:50.080> I<00:00:50.170> want<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.410> stick<00:00:50.680> it<00:00:50.800> may<00:00:50.950> be<00:00:51.540> right<00:00:52.540> here

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
and I want to stick it may be right here

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.390 
and I want to stick it may be right here
this<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:52.930> an<00:00:53.200> example<00:00:53.440> that's<00:00:53.950> the<00:00:54.190> example

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
this is an example that's the example

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.860 
this is an example that's the example
they<00:00:54.610> given<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:54.970> help<00:00:55.150> file<00:00:57.510> okay<00:00:58.510> so<00:00:58.570> now<00:00:58.810> we

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
they given the help file okay so now we

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.150 
they given the help file okay so now we
have<00:00:59.050> these<00:00:59.230> two<00:01:01.080> objects<00:01:02.080> so<00:01:02.710> how<00:01:02.860> do<00:01:02.920> we<00:01:03.040> give

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
have these two objects so how do we give

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.890 
have these two objects so how do we give
them<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.340> boolean<00:01:03.910> with<00:01:04.120> each<00:01:04.239> other<00:01:04.449> okay

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
them the boolean with each other okay

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.020 
them the boolean with each other okay
well<00:01:05.170> if<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.410> go<00:01:05.560> up<00:01:05.740> here<00:01:06.220> you'll<00:01:06.730> see<00:01:06.820> you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
well if you go up here you'll see you

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.719 
well if you go up here you'll see you
have<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.180> boolean<00:01:07.630> commander<00:01:08.080> so<00:01:09.010> I'll<00:01:09.220> hit<00:01:09.580> the

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
have a boolean commander so I'll hit the

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.760 
have a boolean commander so I'll hit the
boolean<00:01:10.090> command<00:01:10.420> you'll<00:01:11.110> see<00:01:11.260> it<00:01:11.380> those<00:01:11.560> in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
boolean command you'll see it those in

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.610 
boolean command you'll see it those in
over<00:01:12.070> here<00:01:12.220> my<00:01:12.460> object<00:01:12.790> browser<00:01:13.440> well<00:01:14.440> what<00:01:14.560> do

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
over here my object browser well what do

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.330 
over here my object browser well what do
I<00:01:14.710> do<00:01:14.770> with<00:01:15.040> it<00:01:15.120> if<00:01:16.120> I<00:01:16.210> take<00:01:16.390> my<00:01:16.570> ball<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.340> drop

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
I do with it if I take my ball and drop

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.080 
I do with it if I take my ball and drop
it<00:01:18.460> on<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.580> boolean<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.960> ball<00:01:20.170> disappears<00:01:20.770> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it on the boolean the ball disappears I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.580 
it on the boolean the ball disappears I
take<00:01:22.090> my<00:01:22.300> box<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.780> drop<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.110> on<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> blue<00:01:23.440> line

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
take my box and drop it on the blue line

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.950 
take my box and drop it on the blue line
the<00:01:23.770> Box<00:01:24.009> disappears<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.820> take<00:01:25.420> my<00:01:25.450> bullying

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
the Box disappears I take my bullying

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.440 
the Box disappears I take my bullying
and<00:01:26.170> drop<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:26.470> on<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.710> ball<00:01:27.030> nothing<00:01:28.030> happens

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
and drop it on the ball nothing happens

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.660 
and drop it on the ball nothing happens
same<00:01:29.020> thing<00:01:29.200> with<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.380> box<00:01:29.680> you'll<00:01:30.400> notice

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
same thing with the box you'll notice

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.210 
same thing with the box you'll notice
this<00:01:30.759> works<00:01:31.030> like<00:01:31.210> cinema<00:01:31.600> 4d<00:01:32.080> so<00:01:32.979> what<00:01:33.130> we

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
this works like cinema 4d so what we

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.920 
this works like cinema 4d so what we
need<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.430> do<00:01:33.550> to<00:01:33.670> get<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:33.940> boolean<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:34.750> work

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
need to do to get this boolean to work

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.200 
need to do to get this boolean to work
is<00:01:35.140> we<00:01:35.259> need<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.500> take<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:36.009> one<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:36.820> we<00:01:36.970> want

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
is we need to take the one that we want

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.730 
is we need to take the one that we want
to<00:01:37.390> intersect<00:01:37.780> with<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.900> other<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.500> drop

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
to intersect with the other and drop

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.830 
to intersect with the other and drop
them<00:01:38.860> in<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.250> right<00:01:39.340> order<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.420> I'm<00:01:40.660> going<00:01:40.810> to

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
them in the right order so I'm going to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.570 
them in the right order so I'm going to
take<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.080> box<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.830> put<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.100> on<00:01:42.190> top<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.520> the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
take the box and put it on top of the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.700 
take the box and put it on top of the
boolean<00:01:42.940> take<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.600> ball<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.259> put<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.619> on<00:01:44.680> top

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
boolean take the ball and put it on top

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.560 
boolean take the ball and put it on top
of<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.040> boolean<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.520> now<00:01:46.090> you'll<00:01:46.270> see<00:01:46.330> what

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
of the boolean and now you'll see what

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.980 
of the boolean and now you'll see what
we<00:01:46.660> got<00:01:47.160> let<00:01:48.160> me<00:01:48.250> back<00:01:48.490> up<00:01:48.520> let's<00:01:49.479> put<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.780> ball

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
we got let me back up let's put the ball

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.850 
we got let me back up let's put the ball
on<00:01:50.020> top<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.710> boolean<00:01:51.040> then<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.000> box<00:01:52.860> yeah

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
on top of the boolean then the box yeah

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.640 
on top of the boolean then the box yeah
you'll<00:01:54.070> see<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.520> box<00:01:54.760> is<00:01:54.909> cutting<00:01:55.210> out<00:01:55.300> then

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
you'll see the box is cutting out then

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.200 
you'll see the box is cutting out then
sphere<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:56.920> depends<00:01:57.190> on<00:01:57.310> what<00:01:57.760> order<00:01:58.060> you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
sphere so it depends on what order you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.850 
sphere so it depends on what order you
throw<00:01:58.390> them<00:01:58.510> in<00:01:58.630> there<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.530> let's<00:01:59.740> go<00:01:59.830> ahead

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
throw them in there so let's go ahead

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.590 
throw them in there so let's go ahead
and<00:02:00.070> boolean<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.670> box<00:02:00.880> with<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.090> ball<00:02:01.360> like

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
and boolean the box with the ball like

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.830 
and boolean the box with the ball like
this<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.490> now<00:02:03.670> we<00:02:03.729> have<00:02:04.000> these<00:02:04.150> options<00:02:04.690> up

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
this so now we have these options up

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.140 
this so now we have these options up
here<00:02:04.900> if<00:02:05.290> we<00:02:05.409> select<00:02:05.620> our<00:02:05.920> boolean<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.909> can<00:02:07.030> go

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
here if we select our boolean you can go

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.070 
here if we select our boolean you can go
up<00:02:07.180> here<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.810> we<00:02:08.260> can<00:02:08.410> make<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.649> subtract<00:02:09.100> V<00:02:09.340> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
up here and we can make a subtract V a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.539 
up here and we can make a subtract V a
union<00:02:11.080> B<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.880> make<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.420> intersect<00:02:14.410> get<00:02:15.310> this

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
union B we can make a intersect get this

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.699 
union B we can make a intersect get this
result<00:02:15.989> we<00:02:16.989> can<00:02:17.170> have<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.769> outside<00:02:18.760> be<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.709> inside

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
result we can have a outside be a inside

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.400 
result we can have a outside be a inside
be<00:02:22.500> okay<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.100> we'll<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.310> stick<00:02:24.640> with<00:02:24.850> this

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.140 

then<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.010> got<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:28.340> if<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.640> want<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.060> can

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
then we got this if you want to you can

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.690 
then we got this if you want to you can
go<00:02:29.270> in<00:02:29.390> there<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.600> double-click<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.700> make

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
go in there and double-click it to make

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.340 
go in there and double-click it to make
it<00:02:31.730> editable<00:02:32.180> if<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.630> need<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.870> edit<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.230> for

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
it editable if you need to edit it for

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.200 
it editable if you need to edit it for
any<00:02:33.500> reason<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.070> throws<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.430> all<00:02:34.520> kinds<00:02:35.150> of

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
any reason and it throws in all kinds of

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.110 
any reason and it throws in all kinds of
polygons<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:38.000> basically

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
polygons like that so this is basically

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.030 
polygons like that so this is basically
how<00:02:38.420> our<00:02:38.890> boolean<00:02:39.890> work<00:02:40.460> inside<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.910> cheetah<00:02:41.210> I

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
how our boolean work inside of cheetah I

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.460 
how our boolean work inside of cheetah I
hope<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.220> helps<00:02:43.640> not<00:02:44.450> quite<00:02:44.810> as<00:02:45.050> elaborate

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
hope this helps not quite as elaborate
