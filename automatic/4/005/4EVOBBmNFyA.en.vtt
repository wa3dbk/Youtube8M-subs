00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
to be showing you how to make a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.350 
to be showing you how to make a
cobblestone<00:00:13.129> regenerator<00:00:14.129> or<00:00:14.400> generator<00:00:15.269> I

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
cobblestone regenerator or generator I

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.640 
cobblestone regenerator or generator I
guess<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:16.130> minecraft<00:00:17.130> xbox<00:00:17.790> 360<00:00:18.599> edition<00:00:18.869> like

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
guess in minecraft xbox 360 edition like

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.759 
guess in minecraft xbox 360 edition like
always<00:00:20.450> so<00:00:21.450> this<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.779> pretty<00:00:22.020> much<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.410> used

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
always so this is pretty much just used

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.130 
always so this is pretty much just used
for<00:00:23.060> generating<00:00:24.060> cobblestone<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:24.990> why

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
for generating cobblestone that's why

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.570 
for generating cobblestone that's why
it's<00:00:25.289> called<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.590> jit<00:00:25.830> cobblestone

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it's called a jit cobblestone

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.029 
it's called a jit cobblestone
regenerator<00:00:27.710> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
regenerator this is going to be a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.849 
regenerator this is going to be a
two-sided<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.170> if<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.410> guys<00:00:31.590> played

even<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.860> didn't<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.250> even<00:01:11.429> have<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.759> do<00:01:11.849> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
even I didn't really even have to do a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.570 
even I didn't really even have to do a
commentary<00:01:12.509> on<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.959> but<00:01:13.500> i<00:01:13.740> figured<00:01:14.220> i<00:01:14.340> just

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
commentary on it but i figured i just

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.809 
commentary on it but i figured i just
talked<00:01:14.910> through<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.160> make<00:01:17.160> it<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.520> little

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
talked through it and make it a little

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.529 
talked through it and make it a little
more<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.800> try<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.830> make<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.069> fun<00:01:20.429> I'm<00:01:21.270> probably

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
more I try to make it fun I'm probably

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.699 
more I try to make it fun I'm probably
not<00:01:21.780> doing<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.110> good<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.590> job<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:23.099> it<00:01:23.330> but

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
not doing that good of a job at it but

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:29.960

on my channel I guess I'll just kind of
talk<00:01:32.099> about<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.640> since<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:33.149> isn't<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
talk about that since there isn't that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
sometimes do you have to jump in the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.090 
sometimes do you have to jump in the
water<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.270> it<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:20.050> keeps<00:03:20.260> making<00:03:20.650> out<00:03:20.800> it's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
water and it just keeps making out it's

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.320 
water and it just keeps making out it's
really<00:03:21.670> compact<00:03:22.270> simple<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.170> build<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:24.330> you

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
really compact simple to build and you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.420 
really compact simple to build and you
can<00:03:25.510> change<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:26.020> design<00:03:26.200> once<00:03:26.770> you<00:03:26.890> do<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.220> I

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
can change the design once you do it I

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.580 
can change the design once you do it I
only<00:03:28.000> get<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.240> make<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.570> whole<00:03:28.750> outside<00:03:29.050> of

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
only get to make the whole outside of

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.890 
only get to make the whole outside of
cobblestone<00:03:30.250> maybe<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:30.910> inside<00:03:31.390> has<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.810> be

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
cobblestone maybe just inside has to be

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.390 
cobblestone maybe just inside has to be
cobblestone<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.709> can<00:03:32.980> get<00:03:33.280> all

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
cobblestone so you can get all

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.550 
cobblestone so you can get all
decorative<00:03:33.820> with<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.360> whatever<00:03:35.020> you<00:03:35.230> want<00:03:35.410> to
