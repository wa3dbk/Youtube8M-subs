 I agree it was a good 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.500
 interpretation but I'm going to make one 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.670

 remember to throw your insteps and your 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.170
 knees because there would be a moment of 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.110
 indecision came out because it's been rehearsed 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.230
 because they are professionals and they came to 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.180
 win you noticed that enthusiasm that they have 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.310
 from you but there are those 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.140
