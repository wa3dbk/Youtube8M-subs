00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
feel like it has product on it that it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.510 
feel like it has product on it that it
would<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.600> cool<00:02:15.840> but<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.070> didn't<00:02:17.400> do

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
would be cool but it really didn't do

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.830 
would be cool but it really didn't do
much<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:17.880> my<00:02:18.000> hair<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.040> decided<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.180> use<00:02:21.660> it
