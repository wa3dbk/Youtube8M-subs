00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.040
 today is the first day we start 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.560
 city building 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.720
 the weather has got a little worse in the morning but 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.279
 it will not prevent us from scoring today 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.250
 cams withdraw 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 after check our diagonals first 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:48.120
 the peg that we hammer the helpers 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:52.170
 here we have the next assistant so today 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.030
 we continue to build the garage yesterday as you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.949
 saw we touched the first pegs with our 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 assistants 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.670
 made all the necessary measurements you can 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.710
 there was a garage to be determined 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.519
 distance from home and that it be 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.250
 exactly so we using roulette with 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.570
 using the level checked all sizes 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.450
 brought the line 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.670
 the main thing brought the corner in a straight line and today 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.540
 already started digging trenches 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.020
 scolded so we have an old garage 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.509
 size 8 on 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.490
 three and a half meters so as not to tear it down 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.890
 on manas finger tools us on 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.780
 fingers amber help on we come in handy 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.909
 decided to build a new garage around it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.210
 dimensions of length. 6 that in principle 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.770
 lets us here and old 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.819
 we get enough distance 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.789
 on foundations 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:52.450
 and the foundation of our garage will be 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.459
 solid reinforced concrete and recess 80 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:03.640
 90 centimeters who is potassium part of us 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:05.200
 there will be a level from the total part of the house 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.360
 what to say the second day is not very 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.630
 such an interesting day as for 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.190
 workers such for the audience but not 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.170
 less I would like to remind you that 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.510
 earthworks is also very important 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.549
 stage in construction from which in general 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.440
 that much depends but what depends on it 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:30.010
 he will now tell the digger with 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:33.010
 five years experience Vladislav hello 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.790
 Hello to you today place 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.010
 Vasilevich 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.720
 I have the experience of a shovel for more than 5 years and I 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.239
 I work on different 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.359
 building I will tell you about how 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.489
 correctly dig a shovel by hand cap1 not 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.190
 so just needed a hem 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.940
 first pounding at right angles for 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.130
 order to create that stiffness and 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.620
 so that the load goes all the way 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.590
 glass on the easier course of course to place la 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.870
 banda immediately under 45 degrees and dig but 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.170
 it will be a very long time it was necessary to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.269
 hold upright first 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.400
 clicking on the shovel you didn't go deep on 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:14.760
 the earth has to do several 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:18.010
 love turning a shovel 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.310
 twisted side to the walls and clean 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.079
 because if you don't do that channel 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.079
 will be rather narrow and uneven 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.269
 had to face handling 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.200
 trench 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:41.319
 back there is every accounted for this if 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.569
 the soil is not fixed that is if 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.470
 pretty loose soil treading 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.420
 you have been this happened and event need 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.510
 apply in order not to be on 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.730
 it melted the soil first we need 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.470
 be careful not to approach 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.959
 close he doesn't step on the edges of it 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.269
 first of all vladislav thank you for 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.269
 see your open secrets yet 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.100
 today we spent our second day 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.630
 garage construction works 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.570
 met a hard life 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.460
 excavator and how to dig a trench squeezed in 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.470
 that you need to carry out protective 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.240
 activity 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.540
 trench mapping first of all it 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.190
 concerns wide and deep trenches and 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.800
 weak ground special attention needs 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.080
 pay attention to protect release 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.340
 trenches from children so they don't fall 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.410
 fail because it may result 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.120
 to injuries well and generally to unpleasant 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.460
 situations especially in the dark 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.770
 for today we will end with you 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.450
 was morrow building groups see you in 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.930
 our new videos are coming up soon 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.930
 new meetings
