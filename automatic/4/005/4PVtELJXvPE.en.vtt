00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.620
 hello to everyone and fabien I 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.390
 the honor to present you today 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.370
 a brand new lozenge knife on the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.530
 map of her laugh so this is a new 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.300
 naive the discovered by zelko 55 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.380
 I guess the presentations are only 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.809
 not to do it's the fifth he 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.670
 find a big bravo to him so the 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.020
 iphone I find near the current of which 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.309
 you simply have to open this 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.960
 portal group once it's done 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.180
 you crawling and his buddy al 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.379
 wanted to locked you place it in 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.000
 the corner and you just have everything 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.290
 just to see that you are so I 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.600
 wanted to slow down the story 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.670
 that you see exactly where 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.590
 so there are no places 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.570
 we will say it's not super super accurate 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.329
 at any rate you can 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.950
 take off on almost the entire 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.780
 the surface of the small wall which is on the ground 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.940
 and if everything went well so you 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.950
 decorate you will reach the little help 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.850
 above this lamp so once 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.080
 that you are above this lamp 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.550
 I want to say that when you do 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.960
 the iphone i know a lot more to me 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.060
 made when you squat 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.860
 once in the air that if ever you 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.479
 want it standing what if you have 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.810
 more likely to fall by staying 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.280
 standing 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.810
 so I advise you to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.160
 squat personally this is it 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.240
 what I did 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.280
 so once you're here it's a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.280
 little barrier of invincibility I'm going 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.080
 you introduce it so I show it to you 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.119
 from my corner view you see that the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.530
 zombies gets behind so when 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.179
 you pull on the board rest assured 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.350
 can touch them but that's when 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.240
 even a very beautiful barrier is 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.080
 when your teammates are at 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.670
 same place that I find myself 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.429
 currently on the video when this gic 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.590
 to 55 realizes it himself and I you 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.940
 present and naturally how is the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.440
 barrier when it's not you who 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.660
 is in glitch that can frankly you 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.979
 to be very useful since I you 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.990
 present a sequence what I had 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.459
 the crossbow all the zombies are stacked 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.660
 and you just have to strafe them from 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.920
 arrow and that's a massage so 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.450
 here are the friends I hope that this 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.190
 video will have pleased you do not hesitate go 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.929

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.399
 which will be in annotations and in 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.209
 descriptions in order to congratulate him for 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.410

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.849
