00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 delicate decoration with light colors 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 in contrast to many investments in 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.509
 dark wood 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.700
 these are just some features 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 the architect fernanda's residence 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:33.170
 that opened the doors of his house 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:33.170
 for the new law 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.160
 Hello, I 'm fernanda moura bora, architect 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.540
 and I came here today to show you a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.969
 little of my house 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 It's what I'm going to show you today. 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.170
 the social area of my house where I 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.370
 my friends or my children gets the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.379
 their friends 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.809
 finally is life happens inside my 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.050
 This social area is composed of 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.270
 dining room for free on the way to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.270
 I would take and the barbecue with cellar 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.850
 in the dining room you have a 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.939
 table for 10 people on double foot 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 is one where two vessels were placed 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.210
 large panels on a wooden panel with two 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.959
 works of josé gonçalves who is an artist 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.959
 which I really like 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.149
 is in the living room we have a table 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.130
 pool 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.740
 strategically placed in the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.009
 space where we really want to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.219
 stay close to the environment where it has 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.130
 conversation where there are people then she 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:53.039
 really the soul of this room is then the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.619
 pool table along with a TV and 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.619
 with a sofa easy to book children 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.369
 the design of the house was conceived here 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:13.260
 in the social area all spaces 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.080
 integrate then s leaving with rum that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.319
 I was going to have the barbecue. It's all done. 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.260
 on the same floor and with doors that 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.660
 open this space are all together or 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.700
 do not want privacy has like closing 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.579
 but the idea was that we could 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.560
 get a lot of people to party 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.930
 finally have a space that could be 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.880
 integrated I have a space that could 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.750
 be integrated to receive enough 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.430
 people are not going to have people. 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.260
 worked the sofa very well well 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.650
 comfortable with home feature 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.750
 theater a retractable sofa is more the same 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.700
 time the chairs were placed next to 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.470
 so there really is an environment of 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.019
 a free environment in which the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.480
 people call so I have a screen I 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.959
 I also have the TV behind the screen that 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.880
 it can be used also says that 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.880
 is not being used as a routine 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.780
 do not know 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.480
 in the space of the barbecue was created 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:30.519
 a large bench next to aa 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:35.200
 barbecue and the wood oven two 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:38.590
 tables for four people and already close to 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.599
 this has a ladder leading to the cellar 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.790
 The cellar is designed to be a 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.639
 where we can also 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.079
 have a pleasant environment to be 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.079
 enjoyed along with friends 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.350
 the colors used in the project were 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:13.340
 shades of beige cream and brown in a way 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:16.070
 and neutral is the color of the house are 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.320
 on behalf of the works of art 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.690
 of the greens that were used that I 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.190
 I find very important that they bring a 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.990
 really feel that the environment 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.460
 stay nice with the greens is 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.480
 predominantly wood was used 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.030
 wood noticed the gay era is and the lacquer 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.550
 bright cream tone 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.650
 the wood used in the furniture it came 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.290
 contrast with the light tones of the 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.830
 house because the whole house is clear with floor 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.530
 clear light walls then is the wood 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.510
 It came to and create a more environment 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.490
 also create this contrast 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.490
 with the rest of the furniture used 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.060
 in ambient lighting were used 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.570
 Tears in plaster with lighting are tapes 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.700
 led by the next the curtains and tapes 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.920
 led in the own cabinet that I think 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.300
 that gives a refinement in the furniture or real estate 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.300
 stay a little longer, work 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.020
 so I came here today to present 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.999
