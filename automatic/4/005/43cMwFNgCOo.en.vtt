different<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.750> think<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.739> texture<00:00:50.340> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
different I think is that the texture is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.840 
different I think is that the texture is
really<00:00:50.910> juicy<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.860> shiny<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
really juicy and not shiny but just that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
really juicy and not shiny but just that
beautiful<00:00:54.920> moisturized<00:00:56.750> healthy<00:00:57.750> lips<00:00:58.020> look

beautiful moisturized healthy lips look

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.580 
beautiful moisturized healthy lips look

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and it's a two-fold product so often

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.160 
and it's a two-fold product so often
when<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.520> about<00:01:02.579> stains<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.960> long

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
when you think about stains and long

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
when you think about stains and long
last<00:01:04.409> tents<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.890> your<00:01:05.010> lips<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.909> used<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you've got the stain and then you've got

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.899 
you've got the stain and then you've got
a<00:01:09.869> second<00:01:10.170> product<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.770> add<00:01:10.979> moisture<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
gloss throughout the day because stains

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499

and<00:01:13.860> tins<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.310> quite<00:01:14.610> often<00:01:14.850> start<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> look<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and tins can quite often start to look a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.890 
and tins can quite often start to look a
bit<00:01:15.659> dry<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.560> harsh<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:18.180> band<00:01:18.659> Staind

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
bit dry in a bit harsh this band Staind

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
bit dry in a bit harsh this band Staind
does<00:01:19.110> not<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.680> all<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.280> why

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
does not do that at all and this is why

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.190 
does not do that at all and this is why
I<00:01:20.460> love<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.180> when<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> apply<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.750> and
