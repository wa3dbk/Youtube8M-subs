g'day<00:00:00.390> my<00:00:00.599> name's<00:00:00.810> Frederic<00:00:01.079> and<00:00:01.580> welcome<00:00:02.580> to

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
g'day my name's Frederic and welcome to

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.910 
g'day my name's Frederic and welcome to
our<00:00:02.760> little<00:00:02.970> video<00:00:03.120> now<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.959> problem<00:00:04.410> was<00:00:04.620> I

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
our little video now the problem was I

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.270 
our little video now the problem was I
bought<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.580> Motorhome<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.919> it's<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.010> fairly

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
bought a Motorhome and it's a fairly

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.459 
bought a Motorhome and it's a fairly
high<00:00:08.429> Motorhome<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.510> object<00:00:09.960> was<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.170> get<00:00:10.410> a

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
high Motorhome the object was to get a

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.560 
high Motorhome the object was to get a
kayak<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.160> roof<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.639> there<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.269> only<00:00:12.420> me

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
kayak on the roof and there is only me

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.780 
kayak on the roof and there is only me
so<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.049> had<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.320> single-handed<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.219> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
so it had to be single-handed and I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.490 
so it had to be single-handed and I
didn't<00:00:15.330> want<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.540> climb<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> ladder<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.230> drag

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
didn't want to climb a ladder and drag

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.680 
didn't want to climb a ladder and drag
it<00:00:16.650> up<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.980> after<00:00:17.460> much<00:00:17.609> research<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.390> came

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it up this after much research I came

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.330 
it up this after much research I came
across<00:00:18.750> coloured<00:00:19.410> engineering<00:00:19.980> over<00:00:20.250> in

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
across coloured engineering over in

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.700 
across coloured engineering over in
Tierra<00:00:20.609> her<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.199> this<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.560> they

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
Tierra her and this is what they

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.670 
Tierra her and this is what they
produced<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.490> me<00:00:23.900> so<00:00:24.900> basically<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.500> really

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
produced for me so basically it's really

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.460 
produced for me so basically it's really
quite<00:00:26.010> simple<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:27.050> essentially<00:00:28.050> we've<00:00:28.260> got<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
quite simple and essentially we've got a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.170 
quite simple and essentially we've got a
locking<00:00:28.769> pin<00:00:29.210> up<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.579> unlock<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
locking pin up here and we unlock it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.889 
locking pin up here and we unlock it
latch<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.020> into<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> open<00:00:34.680> position<00:00:35.000> our<00:00:36.000> Pole

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
latch it into the open position our Pole

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.580 
latch it into the open position our Pole
and<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.800> guide<00:00:38.010> hole<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
and the guide hole up here and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.090 
and the guide hole up here and
everything<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:40.770> comes<00:00:41.250> forward<00:00:43.010> until<00:00:44.010> we

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
everything now comes forward until we

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.389 
everything now comes forward until we
hit<00:00:44.309> our<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.640> stop<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.920> again<00:00:46.920> everything's

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
hit our in stop and again everything's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.029 
hit our in stop and again everything's
under<00:00:47.579> control<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.840> lower<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.079> down<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
under control as we lower it down and

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.229 
under control as we lower it down and
ready<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> take<00:00:53.460> off<00:00:55.820> we've<00:00:56.820> only<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.210> one

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
ready to take off we've only got one

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
ready to take off we've only got one
strap<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.859> everything<00:00:59.340> else<00:00:59.460> is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
strap on here because everything else is

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.000 
strap on here because everything else is
locked<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> top<00:01:01.879> we<00:01:02.879> remove<00:01:03.270> our<00:01:03.510> strap

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
locked in at the top we remove our strap

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.700 
locked in at the top we remove our strap
that<00:01:05.010> now<00:01:05.250> allows<00:01:05.670> our<00:01:05.939> kayak<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:07.320> sit<00:01:07.560> there

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that now allows our kayak to sit there

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.580 
that now allows our kayak to sit there
all<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> its<00:01:08.070> own<00:01:08.189> accord<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.030> our

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
all of its own accord because of our

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.149 
all of its own accord because of our
little<00:01:10.590> guide<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> off<00:01:13.159> down

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
little guide here so we take it off down

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.050 
little guide here so we take it off down
the<00:01:14.340> center<00:01:14.640> channel<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.450> onto<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> ground

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
the center channel and onto the ground

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.010 
the center channel and onto the ground
while<00:01:21.060> she's<00:01:21.299> still<00:01:21.540> there

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
while she's still there

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.350 
while she's still there
then<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.560> come<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.159> front<00:01:23.400> control

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
then we can come up to the front control

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.749 
then we can come up to the front control
our<00:01:24.600> kayak<00:01:25.020> quite<00:01:25.290> easily<00:01:25.500> off<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.790> front<00:01:27.350> and

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
our kayak quite easily off the front and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.670 
our kayak quite easily off the front and
down<00:01:29.759> onto<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> ground<00:01:30.329> quite<00:01:31.079> safely<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
down onto the ground quite safely and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.249 
down onto the ground quite safely and
securely<00:01:32.070> single<00:01:32.790> handedly<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> reverse

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
securely single handedly so to reverse

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.220 
securely single handedly so to reverse
the<00:01:34.470> process<00:01:35.780> again

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.140 

taking<00:01:40.230> partially<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.040> weight<00:01:41.220> put<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:42.060> in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
taking partially the weight put it in

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.350 
taking partially the weight put it in
our<00:01:42.240> center<00:01:42.570> channel<00:01:43.790> we<00:01:44.790> come<00:01:45.030> around<00:01:45.150> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
our center channel we come around the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.800 
our center channel we come around the
back<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.780> two<00:01:46.080> hands<00:01:46.640> bent<00:01:47.640> knees<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.420> up

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
back here two hands bent knees and up

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.060 
back here two hands bent knees and up
she<00:01:49.320> goes<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> channel<00:01:51.200> into<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> holding

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
she goes up the channel into the holding

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.750 
she goes up the channel into the holding
pin<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.610> we've<00:01:54.390> got<00:01:54.570> our<00:01:54.720> holding<00:01:55.110> pin<00:01:55.350> here

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
pin and we've got our holding pin here

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.640 
pin and we've got our holding pin here
goes<00:01:56.760> into<00:01:57.120> our<00:01:57.420> hole<00:01:58.490> which<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> most<00:02:00.650> open

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
goes into our hole which is a most open

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:15.940 
goes into our hole which is a most open
deck<00:02:01.830> chi-x<00:02:05.360> strapping<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:08.780> strap<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.960> in

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.690 

again<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.130> are<00:02:17.220> using<00:02:17.459> our<00:02:18.360> pole<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:20.490> hole

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
again we are using our pole and the hole

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.640 
again we are using our pole and the hole
we're<00:02:20.910> taking<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.300> weight<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:22.050> our<00:02:22.170> hands

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
we're taking the weight with our hands

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.810 
we're taking the weight with our hands
take<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:23.910> onto<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.990> pole<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:26.760> we

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
take it up onto the pole and then we

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.690 
take it up onto the pole and then we
just<00:02:27.000> walk<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.390> back<00:02:28.640> up<00:02:29.640> onto<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.090> roof

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
just walk it back up onto the roof

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.940 
just walk it back up onto the roof
reversing<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.790> process<00:02:32.970> completely<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
reversing the process completely so the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.560 
reversing the process completely so the
last<00:02:35.100> thing<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.490> do<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.030> re-engage<00:02:36.360> our

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
last thing we do is we re-engage our

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.520 
last thing we do is we re-engage our
latch<00:02:37.020> here<00:02:38.660> making<00:02:39.660> sure<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:40.050> everything's

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
latch here making sure that everything's
