that<00:00:09.540> can<00:00:09.660> change<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.860> would<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.130> like

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
that can change and I would really like

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.220 
that can change and I would really like
to<00:00:11.580> get<00:00:11.759> Allen<00:00:12.179> Iverson<00:00:12.630> before<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> next

to get Allen Iverson before the next
game<00:00:13.530> comes<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.309> know<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.240> doesn't<00:00:15.420> look

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
game comes out I know it doesn't look

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.230 
game comes out I know it doesn't look
like<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.780> huge<00:00:16.170> pack<00:00:16.440> opening<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:18.150> never

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
like a huge pack opening but I can never

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.040 
like a huge pack opening but I can never
really<00:00:18.510> hold<00:00:18.810> out<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.320> like<00:00:19.529> 20k<00:00:20.220> or<00:00:20.400> 40<00:00:20.850> k<00:00:21.060> but

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
really hold out for like 20k or 40 k but

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.689 
really hold out for like 20k or 40 k but
right<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.590> get<00:00:22.710> Marcus<00:00:23.100> Morris<00:00:23.369> who's

worth<00:00:23.910> about<00:00:24.240> 14<00:00:25.050> K<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.980> that's<00:00:26.130> another<00:00:26.340> five

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
worth about 14 K so that's another five

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.060 
worth about 14 K so that's another five
packs<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.539> open<00:00:27.689> because<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.830> don't<00:00:28.980> really

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
