beating egg whites an aluminum bowl may

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.840 
beating egg whites an aluminum bowl may
cause<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.379> egg<00:00:42.530> whites<00:00:42.800> to<00:00:43.010> turn<00:00:43.249> gray<00:00:43.550> and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
cause the egg whites to turn gray and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.809 
cause the egg whites to turn gray and
plastic<00:00:44.809> bowls<00:00:45.019> may<00:00:45.319> have<00:00:45.589> fat<00:00:45.859> residue<00:00:46.339> which

plastic bowls may have fat residue which

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.450 
plastic bowls may have fat residue which
will<00:00:46.999> interfere<00:00:47.449> with<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.719> beating<00:00:48.460> also

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
will interfere with the beating also

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.880 
will interfere with the beating also
make<00:00:50.030> sure<00:00:50.059> that<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.600> beaters<00:00:50.929> on<00:00:51.199> your<00:00:51.710> mixer
