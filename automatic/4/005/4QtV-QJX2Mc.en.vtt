00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello gangsters panda magnus with you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.389
 flies in four successfully connects them and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.540
 in general, with some small help 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.420
 Abbadona easily and naturally 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 lays out all life in its path and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.380
 it only remains to finish off the little 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.619
 defenseless practically venge given 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.970
 that the guy is good enough farm there 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.130
 he has no problems 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.920
 Leshrac is another hero who often 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.480
 swoop in fact i'm glad i only cancer 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.940
 there is now in my opinion let it be better 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.860
 leshrac than a troll or a sniper 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.870
 which pecorino than jagerna there 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.129
 slark better fucking losik 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.660
 running round with dangerous enough 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.550
 big dimash despite the fact that only 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.460
 facts dressed guy but not cause 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.539
 shakhtarin cards have yes mean mad 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.309
 he will be wide 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.559
 link becoming pugna another very cool 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.160
 hero 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.199
 somewhat embarrassing 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.489
 opponents because pugna successfully 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.620
 sucked off the hill 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.750
 sucked off the hill like that just 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:11.159
 gorgeous sounds vivir gets tenacious 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.350
 Circuses caste I would say scared visit to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.520
 here is a very good positioning 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 practically does not go on their pugvachki 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 in the knead yes but at the same time successfully 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.939
 framed wards wines moncier and all this 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.700
 know together works great on 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.350
 dragon team intents this 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 really rarely seen to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 endings will also be added us participate in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.579
 battles if drives puts a dome and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.170
 starts to hit on the head here 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.729
 evil and already having arm s night 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.040
 stalker which is supposed to be worn 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.890
 good damage but no night no night and ulta 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.500
 doesn't even live it plays like this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.740
 net daytime ults because 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 time to catch up and venga remains out of work 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.890
 let's say then invoker leaves because 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.630
 there is no lumen sock I understand the fight with 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.500
 Alchemist Armlet Invoker Mace 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.939
 risky actually slept 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.799
 invoker maybe maybe worth it 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.379
 leave really not wanted to help in 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.180
 This gave rampagu so it turned out 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.519
 and nekrofos could not finish ok ok 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.680
 another blogger this time invoker 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.420
 sector encore good artifact not 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.349
 sure that these are top artifacts and nokia 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.180
 but basically when you already have 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.549
 Aganim skadi and wind up you can 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.159
 allow yourself to collect a lot of things in 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.629
 including such a thing as a battleship 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.920
 which will let those somehow 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.010
 notice enough hilitsya 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.450
 great damage even from the Invoker hand 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.609
 skadi still pull off the beetle sneezed and 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.469
 four clean quickly and 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.209
 naturally lacking force stuff all 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.040
 still missing a little bit yes i mean you 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.599
 you run fast but here it is damn 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.139
 force staff seems to me he will come 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.540
 not bad 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:53.739
 nonetheless confidently powerful rampag on 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.930
 invoker questions of course no well done 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.470
 and the plot opponents in full 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.639
 the program 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.469
 further we have omnis juggernaut only 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:07.409
 and as I slash Valid good 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:11.280
 lucky there were almost no creeps and 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.280
 he galloped exclusively on heroes 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.629
 Ward puts a little late again 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.579
 controls ward ward eventually dies 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.829
 for four in a row already cut remains 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.949
 silencer chances him to you understand 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.810
 a bit though he successfully throws in Russian 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:30.329
 the fishing of jagernaut malakhov jagernaut and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.760
 similar to managing to buy but given 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:38.260
 but the less rampag there is a winner 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.900
 and such do not judge further queen of pain with 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.579
 I don't know who found Shiva at queen of pain 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.329
 because I would actually prefer 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.310
 writhes cook first or in hex of course 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:52.299
 expensive to start the bazaar there is no text 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.509
 good thing is not the most successful 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.639
 Ult from whom you but nevertheless successfully 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:59.769
 she goes into the batch there is some 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.259
 some chance of making a storm while there 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.040
 resy comrade gyrocopter helps here 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:08.049
 demon not very many x spider questions 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.239
 Like in a gyrocopter, the hero is generally dangerous 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.189
 rocket flies need of course shoot down 600 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.379
 tons and bad for not eat further 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.989
 it only remains to catch up with the little one 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.970
 practically without a protective witch doctor 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.630
 gave can expect there but does not have time 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.430
 did have time but 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.390
 bring a hand with your flask but to 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:32.820
 Unfortunately, the chances of a guy here is unlikely 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:35.950
 Whether there was much left on the top hero 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.600
 public sector blink force staff not sure i am 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.310
 that line needs black pores of the foot and the same 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.680
 more useful artifact but nonetheless 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.150
 as always, the winners are not judged by cutting 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.490
 there are three in a row of course mobility with 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.830
 phases also on top yes it is very well 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.440
 very high and jellyfish and ogrebaet 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.710
 quietly dying by hand 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.410
 redheads witch good rampaga 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.760
 in the ring of light bright enough without 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.470
 Profit even with the terrible terrible ulta 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.870
 For some reason this guy does not shake 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.730
 Fat does not respect see this thing although I 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.390
 it seems on one Tarasov can swing 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.590
 It was nevertheless three in a row can 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:20.020
 girlfriend calmly go 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:23.020
 absolutely quietly hiding the moon blowing 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.570
 ulta moon just go nowhere was it 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.120
 its meaning to give a damn it knows well and ajax 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.980
 yes although the living guy would seem 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:38.710
 Spirit storm is given quickly enough 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:41.530
 another awesome hero 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.890
 straining to kill Void unlucky kid 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.460

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.110
 what it costs flies fast enough 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.700
 and 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:57.810
 mastitis for trying to punish a little 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.810
