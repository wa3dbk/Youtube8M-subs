00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
what it could be a button at all

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.100 
what it could be a button at all
laughing<00:05:21.330> yeah<00:05:22.289> button<00:05:23.660> what<00:05:24.660> but<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.080> know

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
laughing yeah button what but you know

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.820 
laughing yeah button what but you know
you<00:05:25.620> do<00:05:26.130> it'll<00:05:26.340> give<00:05:26.910> it<00:05:27.060> all<00:05:27.150> on<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.680> as<00:05:28.680> you

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
you do it'll give it all on it as you

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.110 
you do it'll give it all on it as you
can<00:05:28.950> see<00:05:29.010> it's<00:05:29.550> going<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:31.100> clean<00:05:32.120> original

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
can see it's going the clean original

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.750 
can see it's going the clean original

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
job I guess the next video will be if

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.940
