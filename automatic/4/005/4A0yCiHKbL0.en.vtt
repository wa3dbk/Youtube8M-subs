cauldrons red orange sky sort of dirty

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.240 
cauldrons red orange sky sort of dirty
ground<00:00:50.960> rocks<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> background<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.129> know

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
ground rocks in the background you know

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.840 
ground rocks in the background you know
sort<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.910> looks<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.300> desolate<00:00:54.840> place

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
sort of looks like a desolate place

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
sort of looks like a desolate place
there's<00:00:56.850> some<00:00:57.149> sort<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.840> buildings<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.379> the

there's some sort of buildings in the
background<00:00:59.570> that's<00:01:00.570> pretty<00:01:00.780> much<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
background that's pretty much it for the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.860 
background that's pretty much it for the
background<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.789> yeah<00:01:03.090> I'd<00:01:03.239> say<00:01:03.480> that's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
background really so yeah I'd say that's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.770 
background really so yeah I'd say that's
definitely<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.379> world<00:01:05.210> as<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.479> Baraka

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
definitely out world as for Baraka

himself<00:01:07.260> he<00:01:07.409> looks<00:01:07.590> pretty<00:01:07.740> awesome<00:01:08.310> he's<00:01:09.240> got

the<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.530> tell-tale<00:01:10.939> blades<00:01:12.080> which<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.409> think

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the the tell-tale blades which I think

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.050 
the the tell-tale blades which I think
get<00:01:13.950> bigger<00:01:14.250> every<00:01:14.340> time<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:15.119> him<00:01:16.400> he's<00:01:17.400> got
