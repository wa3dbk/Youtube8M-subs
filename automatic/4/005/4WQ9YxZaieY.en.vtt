little<00:02:51.880> lag<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.360> us<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:54.400> handle<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
little lag in us can handle it and the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.110 
little lag in us can handle it and the
graphics<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.350> it's<00:02:57.130> capable<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.730> graphics
