00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.549 
guess shows up to in here but for this
card<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.250> decided<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.360> use<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.019> image<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559

card I decided to use this image and
just<00:00:34.949> heat<00:00:35.309> emboss<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.660> which<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.840> did<00:00:36.989> for

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
just heat emboss it which I did for

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.840 
just heat emboss it which I did for
another<00:00:37.379> craft<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:37.980> article<00:00:38.370> which<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
another craft see article which if I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
another craft see article which if I
remember<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.300> will<00:00:39.510> link<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:40.980> basically

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
remember I will link to but basically

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400 
remember I will link to but basically
just<00:00:41.699> showing<00:00:41.969> how<00:00:42.089> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.239> use<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.809> line

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
just showing how you can use a line

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.259 
just showing how you can use a line
image<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.949> rather<00:00:44.129> than<00:00:44.250> color<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.879> just

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
image and rather than color it in just

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.959 
image and rather than color it in just
heat<00:00:45.989> emboss<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:47.100> contrasting

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
heat emboss it on some contrasting

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.770 
heat emboss it on some contrasting
cardstock<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.530> die<00:00:49.949> cut<00:00:50.429> some<00:00:50.820> mft

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
cardstock so I die cut some mft

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.479 
cardstock so I die cut some mft
razzleberry<00:00:52.379> cardstock<00:00:52.859> with<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
razzleberry cardstock with one of the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.450 
razzleberry cardstock with one of the
pierced<00:00:53.909> circle<00:00:54.390> stacks<00:00:54.690> dynamics<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> then

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
pierced circle stacks dynamics and then

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
pierced circle stacks dynamics and then
I<00:00:56.489> coated<00:00:57.089> it<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.629> ek<00:00:58.079> success<00:00:58.109> powder

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
I coated it with my ek success powder

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.099 
I coated it with my ek success powder
tool<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> remove<00:00:59.730> any<00:01:00.059> static<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
tool just to remove any static so that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.770 
tool just to remove any static so that
the<00:01:01.609> embossing<00:01:02.609> powder<00:01:02.909> would<00:01:03.089> only<00:01:03.210> stick<00:01:03.569> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the embossing powder would only stick to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.440 
the embossing powder would only stick to
the<00:01:04.199> stamped<00:01:04.530> image<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.700> used<00:01:05.880> Versamark

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the stamped image and I used Versamark

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.499 
the stamped image and I used Versamark
for<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.070> stamped<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.939> circle<00:01:09.329> and

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
for that stamped it on to the circle and

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.330 
for that stamped it on to the circle and
then<00:01:09.630> coated<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.560> detail<00:01:10.950> white

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
then coated it with some detail white

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.210 
then coated it with some detail white
embossing<00:01:11.670> powder<00:01:11.990> with<00:01:12.990> finer<00:01:13.649> images<00:01:14.070> like

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
embossing powder with finer images like

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.499 
embossing powder with finer images like
this<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.640> fine<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> detail

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
this I was fine like the detail

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
this I was fine like the detail
embossing<00:01:15.960> powders<00:01:16.470> work<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.829> lot<00:01:16.979> better<00:01:17.130> just

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
embossing powders work a lot better just

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.950 
embossing powders work a lot better just
because<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.969> regular<00:01:18.299> embossing<00:01:18.509> powders

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
because the regular embossing powders

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.590 
because the regular embossing powders
because<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.530> thicker<00:01:20.390> granules<00:01:21.390> they

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
because they have thicker granules they

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.350 
because they have thicker granules they
don't<00:01:21.750> give<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.350> much<00:01:22.530> detail<00:01:22.829> and<00:01:23.360> then

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
don't give you as much detail and then

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.539 
don't give you as much detail and then
once<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.780> dry<00:01:25.079> like<00:01:25.500> heated<00:01:26.250> through<00:01:26.430> with

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
once it was dry like heated through with

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.030 
once it was dry like heated through with
my<00:01:26.640> heat<00:01:26.790> tool<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.360> cooled<00:01:27.719> off<00:01:27.899> I<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.860> used

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
my heat tool and cooled off I just used

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.330 
my heat tool and cooled off I just used
a<00:01:29.159> Swiffer<00:01:29.579> cloth<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.270> wipe<00:01:30.509> off<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.340> ek

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
a Swiffer cloth to wipe off the ek

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.700 
a Swiffer cloth to wipe off the ek
powder<00:01:32.729> residue<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.930> nice<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.170> smooth

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
powder residue so it's nice and smooth

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
powder residue so it's nice and smooth
and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> umbrella<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.140> decided<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and then for the umbrella I decided that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
and then for the umbrella I decided that
so<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:37.920> I've<00:01:38.039> kind<00:01:38.219> of<00:01:38.280> wanted<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> focus<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
so what I've kind of wanted to focus to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.969 
so what I've kind of wanted to focus to
be<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> cleaned<00:01:40.140> off<00:01:40.289> my<00:01:40.439> stamp<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.860> just

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
be on so I cleaned off my stamp I just

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.109 
be on so I cleaned off my stamp I just
use<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> baby<00:01:41.310> wipe<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.729> clean<00:01:41.850> off<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
use a baby wipe to clean off that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.420 
use a baby wipe to clean off that
Versamark<00:01:42.810> ink<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> inked<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.310> up

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
Versamark ink and then I inked it up

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.160 
Versamark ink and then I inked it up

pieced<00:02:28.080> images<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.800> decided<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.880> use<00:02:29.940> pink<00:02:30.360> this

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
pieced images I decided to use pink this

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.280 
pieced images I decided to use pink this
time<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:32.070> i<00:02:32.100> started<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.580> RV<00:02:33.120> 23<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.110> then<00:02:34.170> i

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
time so i started with RV 23 and then i

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.400 
time so i started with RV 23 and then i
blend<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.740> out<00:02:34.800> with<00:02:35.010> 21<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.660> our<00:02:36.870> v10

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
blend that out with 21 and then our v10

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.140 
blend that out with 21 and then our v10
which<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.770> really<00:02:38.130> really<00:02:38.160> pale<00:02:38.550> pink<00:02:38.880> and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
which is a really really pale pink and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.000 
which is a really really pale pink and
then<00:02:39.840> finally<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> really<00:02:40.560> make<00:02:40.709> sure<00:02:40.860> we're

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
then finally to really make sure we're

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
then finally to really make sure we're
just<00:02:41.160> kind<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.370> blend<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.730> out<00:02:41.880> i<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:43.080> took<00:02:43.200> my

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
just kind of blend it out i just took my

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.620 
just kind of blend it out i just took my
zero<00:02:43.830> colorless<00:02:44.430> blender<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.450> went

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
zero colorless blender and just went

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.000 
zero colorless blender and just went
over<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.930> edges<00:02:46.080> there<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.560> smooth<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.890> out

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
over the edges there to smooth it out

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.220 
over the edges there to smooth it out
and<00:02:47.310> then<00:02:48.090> decided<00:02:48.540> i<00:02:48.630> wanted<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.930> little<00:02:49.050> bit

and then decided i wanted a little bit

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.570 
and then decided i wanted a little bit
more<00:02:49.350> definition<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.100> little<00:02:50.250> frilly

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
more definition on that little frilly

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.729 
more definition on that little frilly
edge<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.209> i<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.420> took<00:02:51.480> RV<00:02:51.989> 09<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.560> just

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739

that finished it off and then as always
with<00:02:59.940> paper<00:03:00.510> pieced<00:03:00.810> images<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:02.239> edge

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
with paper pieced images I like to edge

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.720 
with paper pieced images I like to edge
it<00:03:03.270> with<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> black<00:03:04.050> marker<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.830> just<00:03:05.130> covers<00:03:05.430> up

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
it with a black marker it just covers up

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.430 
it with a black marker it just covers up
that<00:03:05.940> little<00:03:06.150> white<00:03:06.510> edge<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:07.020> peeks<00:03:07.260> out

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
that little white edge that peeks out

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.010 
that little white edge that peeks out
and<00:03:07.770> any<00:03:08.489> spots<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.270> know<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.660> didn't

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
and any spots that you know I didn't

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.780 
and any spots that you know I didn't
trim<00:03:10.230> perfectly<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.040> marker<00:03:11.310> just<00:03:11.489> covers

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
trim perfectly the marker just covers

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.670 
trim perfectly the marker just covers
that<00:03:11.880> up<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.300> then<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.600> like<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.260> just<00:03:13.470> looks

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
that up so then it's like it just looks

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.100 
that up so then it's like it just looks
more<00:03:13.860> finished<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.540> amazing<00:03:15.989> how

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
more finished so it's amazing how

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.930 
more finished so it's amazing how
something<00:03:16.470> about<00:03:16.800> small<00:03:17.130> like<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.430> smallest

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
something about small like that smallest

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.850 
something about small like that smallest
step<00:03:18.180> makes<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:19.170> big<00:03:19.230> difference<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:19.769> my

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
step makes a really big difference in my

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.220 
step makes a really big difference in my
opinions<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.519> always<00:03:21.180> try<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.630> remember<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.989> do

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
opinions so always try to remember to do

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.370 
opinions so always try to remember to do
that<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.680> then<00:03:23.160> tombow<00:03:23.580> mono<00:03:23.760> multi<00:03:24.380> lightly

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
that was literally glued together

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.710
