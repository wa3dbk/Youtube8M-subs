00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.170 

Dukey

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.000 

there<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.260> X<00:01:21.410> 3<00:01:21.620> 12<00:01:21.920> dual<00:01:22.370> too

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.170 

now<00:01:27.730> dilemma<00:01:28.330> we<00:01:28.510> got<00:01:29.220> math<00:01:30.220> on<00:01:30.490> it's<00:01:30.640> like<00:01:30.820> 20

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
now dilemma we got math on it's like 20

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.220 
now dilemma we got math on it's like 20
x<00:01:31.390> 20<00:01:31.450> x<00:01:31.810> 20<00:01:32.020> x<00:01:32.380> 20<00:01:35.430> well<00:01:36.430> all<00:01:36.940> four<00:01:37.660> corners<00:01:37.930> and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
x 20 x 20 x 20 well all four corners and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
x 20 x 20 x 20 well all four corners and
then<00:01:38.350> it's<00:01:38.470> like<00:01:38.500> 16<00:01:39.010> and<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.190> half<00:01:39.220> up<00:01:41.160> but<00:01:42.160> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
then it's like 16 and a half up but the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.020 
then it's like 16 and a half up but the
problem<00:01:42.640> is<00:01:42.790> i<00:01:43.830> got<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:44.980> plastic<00:01:45.580> piece<00:01:45.610> back

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
problem is i got this plastic piece back

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.650 
problem is i got this plastic piece back
here<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.520> surround<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.210> damn<00:01:49.390> tall

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
here and the surround is so damn tall

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.310 
here and the surround is so damn tall
it's<00:01:49.840> going<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.020> be<00:01:50.080> right<00:01:50.320> on<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
it's going to be right on it so the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.630 
it's going to be right on it so the
stone<00:01:53.560> man<00:01:53.800> over<00:01:54.040> there<00:01:54.160> is<00:01:54.190> doing<00:01:54.520> some

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
stone man over there is doing some

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.340 
stone man over there is doing some
serious<00:01:54.850> math<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.720> we're<00:01:55.990> going<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.140> try<00:01:56.320> to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
serious math and we're going to try to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.520 
serious math and we're going to try to
make<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:58.090> Box<00:01:58.300> longer<00:01:58.990> and<00:02:00.390> shorter<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:02.440> we

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
make it the Box longer and shorter so we

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.430 
make it the Box longer and shorter so we
can<00:02:02.650> drop<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.100> sub<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.990> we<00:02:05.050> got<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.260> battery

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
can drop the sub so we got the battery

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.340 
can drop the sub so we got the battery
box<00:02:05.710> over<00:02:06.010> here<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.250> account<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.550> two

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.880
