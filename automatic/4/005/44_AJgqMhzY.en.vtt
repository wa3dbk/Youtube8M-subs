00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.520 
a drop step with the right leg watch it
again<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.509> look<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.380> leg

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
again see it look at the right right leg

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
again see it look at the right right leg
right<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:47.009> said<00:01:47.220> drop<00:01:47.430> step<00:01:47.780> that's<00:01:48.780> really

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
right there said drop step that's really

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.149 
right there said drop step that's really
interesting<00:01:49.320> we've<00:01:49.710> been<00:01:49.829> talking<00:01:50.130> about

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
interesting we've been talking about

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.520 
interesting we've been talking about
this<00:01:50.430> where<00:01:50.759> instead<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> pushing<00:01:52.049> off<00:01:52.290> with

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this where instead of pushing off with

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.289 
this where instead of pushing off with
the<00:01:52.829> left<00:01:53.070> leg<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> having<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> right<00:01:54.119> leg

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the left leg and having the right leg

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.859 
the left leg and having the right leg
extend<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> drop<00:01:56.610> step<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
extend you do a drop step and a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.469 
extend you do a drop step and a
crossover<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> left<00:01:59.250> leg<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.180> actually

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
crossover with the left leg you actually

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.850 
crossover with the left leg you actually
cover<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:00.869> distance<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.439> cross<00:02:01.649> over

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
cover more distance when you cross over

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.840 
cover more distance when you cross over
the<00:02:02.070> left<00:02:02.310> leg

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the left leg

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940 
the left leg
try<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.020> makes<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.380> difference<00:02:04.409> it's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
try it it really makes a difference it's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.260 
try it it really makes a difference it's
hard<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.250> me<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.399> do<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
hard for me to do because it's it's a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.550 
hard for me to do because it's it's a
totally<00:02:06.540> different<00:02:06.600> movement<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.290> me<00:02:07.380> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
totally different movement for me I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
totally different movement for me I
always<00:02:08.129> plant<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.459> my<00:02:08.550> left<00:02:08.849> leg<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.239> push

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
always plant with my left leg and push

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.150 
always plant with my left leg and push
off<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.229> my<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.470> leg<00:02:10.500> takes<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.800> giant<00:02:10.979> step

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
off and my right leg takes a giant step

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.890 
off and my right leg takes a giant step
say<00:02:11.940> push<00:02:12.209> off<00:02:12.420> drop<00:02:13.200> step

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
say push off drop step

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.720 
say push off drop step
cross<00:02:14.079> over<00:02:16.349> smooth<00:02:17.349> timing<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:18.250> watch<00:02:18.459> as

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
cross over smooth timing but watch as

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.140 
cross over smooth timing but watch as
she<00:02:18.760> hits<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.480> she<00:02:19.629> runs<00:02:19.900> through<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.319> ball<00:02:20.590> I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
she hits and she runs through the ball I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.220 
she hits and she runs through the ball I
don't<00:02:22.150> like<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.540> because<00:02:22.720> every<00:02:22.900> step<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
don't like that because every step you

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.869 
don't like that because every step you
take<00:02:23.409> after<00:02:23.799> you<00:02:23.890> run<00:02:24.010> through<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.250> ball<00:02:24.459> an

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
take after you run through the ball an

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.759 
take after you run through the ball an
extra<00:02:25.780> step<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.019> have<00:02:26.049> to<00:02:26.140> take<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.409> come<00:02:26.530> back

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
extra step you have to take to come back

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.599 
extra step you have to take to come back
1<00:02:27.430> 2<00:02:27.939> 3<00:02:28.569> now<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.319> have<00:02:29.439> to<00:02:29.500> think<00:02:29.680> 1<00:02:29.920> 2<00:02:30.159> 3<00:02:30.189> steps

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
1 2 3 now you have to think 1 2 3 steps

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.610 
1 2 3 now you have to think 1 2 3 steps
come<00:02:30.819> back<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.780> as<00:02:31.870> she<00:02:31.989> hits<00:02:32.140> pass<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.470> ball

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
come back so as she hits pass the ball

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.619 
come back so as she hits pass the ball
in<00:02:32.769> like<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.069> unless<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.909> hit<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.060> winner<00:02:34.269> but

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
in like that unless you hit a winner but

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.720 
in like that unless you hit a winner but
such<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> smooth<00:02:35.470> way<00:02:35.829> transition<00:02:36.489> she's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
such a smooth way transition she's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.309 
such a smooth way transition she's
bringing<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.480> straight<00:02:37.780> line<00:02:37.989> right<00:02:38.019> across

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
bringing a straight line right across

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.809 
bringing a straight line right across
that<00:02:38.409> base<00:02:38.739> line<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:44.069> did<00:02:45.069> like<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.310> backhand<00:02:45.760> I

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
that base line I did like the backhand I

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.220 
that base line I did like the backhand I
didn't<00:02:46.000> have<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> chance<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.510> see<00:02:46.690> her<00:02:47.109> in<00:02:47.139> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
didn't have a chance to see her in the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.660 
didn't have a chance to see her in the
back<00:02:47.379> end<00:02:47.620> now<00:02:48.099> I'm<00:02:48.159> looking<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.370> run<00:02:48.519> around

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
back end now I'm looking to run around

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.509 
back end now I'm looking to run around
forehand<00:02:49.359> and<00:02:49.569> watch<00:02:50.139> that<00:02:50.290> she<00:02:50.440> shuffles<00:02:50.950> so

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
forehand and watch that she shuffles so

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.940 
forehand and watch that she shuffles so
it's<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.909> push<00:02:52.780> off<00:02:52.989> shuffle<00:02:53.319> shuffle<00:02:53.500> shuffle
