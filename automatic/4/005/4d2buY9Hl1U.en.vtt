00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
people have been speculating is an air

tank<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.900> mocked<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.230> townhall<00:00:10.590> 9<00:00:10.620> that's<00:00:10.980> super

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
tank I mocked at townhall 9 that's super

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.310 
tank I mocked at townhall 9 that's super
effective<00:00:11.910> at<00:00:12.059> soaking<00:00:12.719> up<00:00:12.780> damage<00:00:12.840> for<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
effective at soaking up damage for the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.720 
effective at soaking up damage for the
remainder<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.740> your<00:00:14.009> troops<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.460> an<00:00:14.580> air

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
remainder of your troops in an air

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.340 
remainder of your troops in an air
attack<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.570> think<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.870> as<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> floating

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
attack so think of it as a floating

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.620 
attack so think of it as a floating
golem<00:00:16.890> but<00:00:17.160> instead<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.550> targeting<00:00:17.850> defenses

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
golem but instead of targeting defenses

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.660 
golem but instead of targeting defenses
and<00:00:18.810> specifically<00:00:19.710> targets<00:00:20.130> air<00:00:20.340> defense

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
and specifically targets air defense

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.220 
and specifically targets air defense
let's<00:00:21.420> go<00:00:21.539> ahead<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.779> check<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.020> lava

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
let's go ahead and check out the lava

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.689 
let's go ahead and check out the lava
hound<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.560> action<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.070> actually<00:00:23.460> pretty

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
hound in action it's actually pretty

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.759 
hound in action it's actually pretty
quick<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.240> tank<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.750> after<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.289> drop<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
quick for a tank and after I drop it you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.290 
quick for a tank and after I drop it you
can<00:00:25.890> see<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> strength<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> lab<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
can see that the strength of the lab and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.450 
can see that the strength of the lab and
definitely<00:00:27.689> isn't<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.170> its<00:00:28.349> damage<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.310> all

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
definitely isn't in its damage it's all

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.890 
definitely isn't in its damage it's all
about<00:00:29.670> creating<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> diversion<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> rest

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
about creating a diversion for the rest

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
about creating a diversion for the rest
of<00:00:30.990> your<00:00:31.080> troops<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.470> freely<00:00:31.890> destroy<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
of your troops to freely destroy the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610 
of your troops to freely destroy the
remainder<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.239> base<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.230> when<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.469> lava

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
remainder of the base so when your lava

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620 
remainder of the base so when your lava
hound<00:00:34.829> goes<00:00:35.010> down<00:00:35.250> lava<00:00:35.640> pups<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.300> spit<00:00:36.540> out

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hound goes down lava pups will spit out

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.360 
hound goes down lava pups will spit out
in<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> number<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> directions<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.920> deal

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
in a number of directions and deal

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
in a number of directions and deal
damage<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.790> anything<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.450> find<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> pups

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
damage to anything they find the pups

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.319 
damage to anything they find the pups
are<00:00:40.469> sort<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.920> mini<00:00:41.190> minions<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:42.120> deal

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
are sort of like mini minions they deal

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
are sort of like mini minions they deal
some<00:00:42.690> damage<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.680> shot<00:00:43.920> down

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
some damage but they can get shot down

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.220 
some damage but they can get shot down
pretty<00:00:44.430> easily<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> lava<00:00:46.020> hound

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
pretty easily so that was the lava hound

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.660 
pretty easily so that was the lava hound
by<00:00:46.379> itself<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:46.860> let's<00:00:47.039> try<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> use<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> pair<00:00:47.640> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
by itself but let's try to use a pair of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.610 
by itself but let's try to use a pair of
them<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.180> next<00:00:48.480> attack<00:00:48.840> I'm<00:00:49.320> gonna<00:00:49.530> be

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
them in this next attack I'm gonna be

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
them in this next attack I'm gonna be
using<00:00:49.739> 20<00:00:50.039> balloons<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.789> dragon<00:00:51.239> 30<00:00:51.480> minions

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
using 20 balloons one dragon 30 minions

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
using 20 balloons one dragon 30 minions
two<00:00:52.140> lava<00:00:52.379> hounds<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.949> let's<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.760> ahead

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
two lava hounds and let's just go ahead

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.340 
two lava hounds and let's just go ahead
and<00:00:54.030> try<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.360> care<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.840> base<00:00:55.050> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and try to take care of this base so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
and try to take care of this base so
again<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> lot<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.070> hounds<00:00:56.309> primarily<00:00:56.789> attack

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
again the lot of hounds primarily attack

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.700 
again the lot of hounds primarily attack
air<00:00:57.480> defense<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.050> I'm<00:00:58.170> gonna<00:00:58.260> want<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> drop

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
air defense so I'm gonna want to drop

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.319 
air defense so I'm gonna want to drop
them<00:00:58.949> upfront<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.730> follow<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
them upfront and then follow up with the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
them upfront and then follow up with the
rest<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.660> troops<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.410> attack<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.859> guy's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
rest of my troops to attack this guy's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
rest of my troops to attack this guy's
base<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.699> what<00:01:02.879> I'm<00:01:02.969> hoping<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> they'll

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
base so what I'm hoping is that they'll

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
base so what I'm hoping is that they'll
take<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> damage<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:05.549> balloons

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
take all of the damage and my balloons

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
take all of the damage and my balloons
dragon<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.720> minions<00:01:07.049> will<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.500> able<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
dragon and minions will be able to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
dragon and minions will be able to
destroy<00:01:08.040> everything<00:01:08.520> else<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.510> something

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
destroy everything else so something

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.300 
destroy everything else so something
cool<00:01:10.049> about<00:01:10.080> lava<00:01:10.439> hounds<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.159> when

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
cool about lava hounds just like when

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
cool about lava hounds just like when
golems<00:01:11.640> came<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> sort<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> opened<00:01:12.840> up<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
golems came out it sort of opened up a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.420 
golems came out it sort of opened up a
whole<00:01:13.260> different<00:01:13.409> part<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> game<00:01:14.220> because

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
whole different part of the game because

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
whole different part of the game because
you<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.820> use<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.240> many<00:01:15.390> army<00:01:15.780> compositions

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you can use so many army compositions

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.350 
you can use so many army compositions
with<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> used<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.180> lot

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
with them so for this one I used a lot

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.580 
with them so for this one I used a lot
of<00:01:18.390> balloons<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.990> pretty<00:01:19.200> good<00:01:19.320> amount<00:01:19.470> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
know that you can use a bunch of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.840 
know that you can use a bunch of
different<00:01:22.500> army<00:01:22.979> compositions<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:23.700> you

lot of loons or a lot of minions it
really<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.790> depends<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.240> type<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> base

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
really just depends what type of base

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.390 
really just depends what type of base
you're<00:01:30.840> attacking<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.439> what<00:01:32.009> their<00:01:32.159> type<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you're attacking and what their type of

you're attacking and what their type of
setup<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.290> 42%

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
of my balloons were still up and they

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.280 
of my balloons were still up and they
were<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.000> terrorizing<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.600> defenses<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290
