 combination therapy the ultrasound and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.649
 the dynamic stereo currents a 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.139
 bad diet sedentary lifestyle and action 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.170
 Hormonal can lead to accumulation 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.750
 of fat sometimes even people 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.690
 who maintain their healthy habits and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.320
 seemingly thin they can not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.990
 get rid of localized fat and this 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.109
 it's because some parts of the body 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.320
 are prone to accumulate fat that is not 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.899
 consumed by the body the man has 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.809
 a natural tendency to accumulate fat 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.690
 in the womb, women suffer more than 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.690
 the hips and the outer thighs but 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.450
 they are not free from abdominal fat 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.850
 with age localized fat begins 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.030
 to accumulate in the abdomen and hips 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.309
 especially after pregnancy some 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.649
 treatments act directly on 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.260
 the localized fat combining the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.899
 benefits of ultrasound and currents 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.090
 electrical is widely used to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.489
 the treatment of fat cellulite 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.710
 localized and flaccidity 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.030
 there are several types of programs in the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.579
 team 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.070
 the choice of the program will be made according to 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.920
 the purpose of the treatment and the case 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.619
 individual for example in combating 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.289
 localized fat cells these are 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.509
 affected and their content divided into 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.420
 smaller particles being 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.090
 eliminated by the lymphatic system and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.220
 the thermal effect of ultrasound 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 causes the release of histamine a 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 set of collagen and other substances 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.020
 chemicals that promote the repair of 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.330
 tissues by stimulating 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.459
 the cleaning of cellular debris 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.270
 allows to fight cellulite and fat 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:51.450
 located quickly and effectively the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.970
 procedure is fast and safe a gel 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.310
 driver extends over the area of 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.860
 the application and then the head of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.619
 team moves constantly and from 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.990
 soft form therefore there will always be 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.990
 a continuous change of position and the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.769
 intensity will also vary each session 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.060
 It lasts approximately 30 minutes when 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.880
 the belt is used 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.560
 electrical does not feel pain just the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.030
 tingling sensation that is the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.069
 electric stimulus 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.500
 the device is regulated according to the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.660
 sensitivity of each patient 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.599
 You can make several sessions always 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.630
 respecting the interval between them their 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.550
 results are excellent and will remain 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.550
 with the right accompaniment
