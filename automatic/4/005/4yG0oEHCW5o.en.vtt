00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.350
 today I have two reviews and many 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.350
 dilemmas 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.650
 Do you have to talk to you? 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.330
 respect of these two books here. 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 which is either break the thin Iraq 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.619
 your face and that which is the future habit and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.420
 today takes our this video is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 following is very easy for you to 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.480
 respect of a book that you love is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.160
 It's even easier for you to talk about it. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 of the book you hated but when you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 I find the book more or less is very 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.739
 I know hard to talk'm feeling good 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.540
 yes to talk about these two 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.370
 self-help books in this video because 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.079
 these books I requested a partnership from 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.879
 intrinsic of itself then half has a 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.680
 commitment to them to talk about 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.450
 books with you here on the channel but already 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 advance that are books that I do not half 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 mast in one day and knows how to stay there in the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.370
 and in this video I'll explain the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.140
 reasons for you 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.620
 so let's start by the side of the future 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.579
 IADE Satom this one is a hq 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.260
 biographical and the first thing that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.619
 drew attention to her when she was 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 bookstore were these wonderful colors 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.150
 my illustrator side pirouetted this affection 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.070
 because it is really very much 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.659
 cute how autobiographical it goes 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.090
 tell the story of the actor himself who is 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.159
 ead and his mother in Great Britain and father 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.270
 his is from Syria and this book that goes 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.490
 pass when he was still a child 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.330
 when he has the language the four years 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.950
 more or less 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.960
 hence the whole story is told by the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.820
 perspective with children and has 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.490
 various political conflicts that are 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 happening at that time in Libya and the father 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.240
 it ends up having to move to another city 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 sometimes looking for a job 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.170
 better always seeking the dream of being a 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.210
 university professor and history 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.979
 always told from his point of view 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.049
 as a child who does not understand much 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.149
 I respect politics, I do not understand everything 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.259
 What is happening there and I think 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.689
 that this is the most interesting point 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.549
 From this comic we introduce people here 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.259
 there are several things specific to certain 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.180
 cultures, for example, much of the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.040
 Syria I did not know I did not know 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.689
 to-day, but for example when 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.030
 He is going to take a trip to visit the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.590
 his grandmother he stays in a room with everyone 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.450
 the other women talking and everything 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.580
 more while men are in another 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.500
 room and suddenly a man arrives and brings 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.600
 a tray with all the remains of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.130
 men's lunch food and that's what 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.200
 women have the right to eat it 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.730
 they can only eat the rest of the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.770
 men and this is a very shocking thing 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.390
 It's a very absurd thing, but it's not 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.950
 book told in a more gentle way 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.750
 because it is being counted by a 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.520
 child who understands nothing of what is 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.500
 happening there then we have a 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.060
 comic strip with a very pretty art 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.920
 super interesting story with 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.050
 information about cultures that 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.000
 I did not know until then but what else 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.739
 I was disappointed in the comics we can 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.290
 to say so is that he is the first 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.170
 volume of a series in no time and 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.600
 your saying here does not have a number one here 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.519
 does not have the type has written continuation 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.470
 here below you have just read and 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.989
 you want to know what will happen and only 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.730
 has a continuum and oab of the future 2 already 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.680
 has been published but it has been 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.050
 published in French and I do not know how to read 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.519
 French, then I have to wait. 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.160
 I do not know how many books are going to be 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.840
 written and published tendons but 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.400
 Are you interested in reading this picture? 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.530
 that does not go like I think it's a 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.209
 closed story because this book is not 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.160
 continued then I do not expect 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.680
 all things will be solved in this 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.480
 single book here because they will not generate the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.430
 3-stars for this book because the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.019
 interesting story but in some 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.700
 moments she ends up falling a lot at the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.250
 political side that is an act that I do not 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.130
 I understand very mainly political 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.510
 of Libya in 1980, then these parts were 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.430
 a little you already had but the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.829
 protagonist is very nice has a 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.510
 very acid humor this picture here and if 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.370
 Do you like books with enough? 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.019
 historical context I'm sure that 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.299
 Are you going to enjoy this painting here? 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.549
 Now let's talk about and lawyer wants 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.950
 break your face from the medina 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.109
 book here is an ee tell the story of 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.860
 a girl named piri she lives in 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.960
 U.S 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.640
 her family, all Latina in fact and 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.740
 She lives in the United States, she's done 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.690
 to move to a new school and soon 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.820
 in the beginning of the first day of class she 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.830
 discovers that the lawyer wants to break the 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.260
 her face she does not know why she does not 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.900
 You know what she hurried, she 's a lawyer, but 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.970
 She knows she wants to break the face here. 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.380
 with her and will be walking towards 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.450
 a side that explores bullying 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.220
 within the school she did not 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.390
 You know what she did wrong but she 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.610
 knows that at any moment she can 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.560
 pick up and this ends up reviewing you and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.390
 scaring too fast because I liked it 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.609
 enough in this book was that he is a 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.230
 book realistic public school 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.060
 picture that reminded me very much of the 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.230
 Brazilian public schools despite 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.930
 not be a book that goes on in brazil 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.430
 the solutions to the decisions made here 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.950
 in this book are also play on the floor 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.470
 so there is no perfect world here 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.419
 where everything is settled out clean 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.550
 employment and resolution of all history 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.830
 ends up being well what would be 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.810
 possible to happen in real life but 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.850
 could not establish people book 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.590
 because I could not get it with this 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.090
 character at any time 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.340
 usually in other books about 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.560
 bullying I read you're just afraid 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.240
 until a certain empathy for the protagonist 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.760
 Why do you see what he is suffering from? 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.350
 in school and you see how difficult it is 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.060
 I really suffered a little bit of bullying. 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.070
 at school and I know how hard you are 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.020
 it was a place where you know it exists 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.750
 someone who hates you it exists within 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.580
 someone who is about to play games 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.680
 promised to stabilize more 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.750
 15 being very cruel but in a moment 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.850
 Someone I could feel sorry for 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.030
 girl because most of the time 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.530
 she is very annoying little chatinha you know 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.360
 want an example for you one thing that 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.520
 She does all the time she can not 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.740
 make me like her like a typical 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.479
 adolescent rebellious she 'll have mine 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.610
 her mother her mother a bag friend tea 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.990
 also does not have a screen that ends up getting worse 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.790
 the situation because she is suffering 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.530
 abuse at school but she did not 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.180
 able to feel comfortable to 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.490
 talk to her mother because her mother 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.400
 she is very boring at the moment 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.639
 Some people see her mother being boring. 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.919
 actually the band b 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.360
 sings know is still not annoying with her 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.159
 in no time and most of the 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.479
 time it seems that her tantrums her 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.919
 You do not want to tell your mother that you 're 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.020
 happening and I wanted to get in 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.759
 and he could only talk to his mother 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.409
 She will help you solve something else. 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.870
 who does not like it enough is that for this 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.999
 book was spent at the core of all Latin 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.800
 has many words in the middle Spanish 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.990
 dialogue and in the beginning I found 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.300
 interesting cool eyes they play 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.370
 so some Baltic words the core 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.900
 latino diesel black know more 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.909
 as you gain within the 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.039
 head a little boring and sometimes 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.919
 It seems like you know too much. 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.060
 I do not know, I do not know if a 100% bad book I 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.889
 I do not think that works for me. 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.659
 exactly that way I ended up 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.400
 taking the protagonist then everything that 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.259
 she made me I was already lazy 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.939
 maybe for those who are younger for whom 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.129
 is going through this situation that it 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:28.779
 passes in school maybe half a light 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.909
 there for how can you solve this in 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:33.159
 school but as I said do not you 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:34.779
 which will present the solutions and the world 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:36.219
 ideal to stop bullying until 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:38.620
 because I think that even there is a 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.569
 100% effective solution to eliminate 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.639
 bullying within schools but 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.919
 it is not in this book in the 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.360
 Overall I gave two and a half stars to 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.069
 this book but how much was 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.150
 nice when I finished reading I just finished 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:51.339
 returning to 3 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.740
 so today we have a review here 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:55.960
 This is how we can say two books 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.000
 who have won three stars are books 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.129
 who did not thrill so much but did not 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.439
 they discouraged me to make them wide 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.659
 I could not make it to the end, is not it? 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:06.009
 and it was the video today, I hope 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:07.750
 You liked to contain me here. 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.849
 below if you've ever read any of these two 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.800
 books and share with me here too. 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.479
 the construction that you are finished reading 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.310
 a book that was not even great 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.169
 I do not even realize because I know all of us. 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.460
 we can police very easy 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.529
 so if you want to open your heart 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.310
 With me, I said at ease here. 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:23.349
 in the comments 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.210
 here on the channel you have video all 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:27.310
 sometimes when you have time you have a 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:32.159
 video on Sunday and I see you in my 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.159
 next video that started a mall
