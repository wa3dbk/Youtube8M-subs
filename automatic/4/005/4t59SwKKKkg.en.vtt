but<00:00:38.010> anyway<00:00:38.309> where<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.850> start<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.420> has<00:00:40.129> 228

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
but anyway where can we start it has 228

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.799 
but anyway where can we start it has 228
tons<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.420> cargo<00:00:43.020> space<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:44.059> 228<00:00:45.059> units<00:00:45.539> of

tons of a cargo space or 228 units of
cargo<00:00:46.140> space<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.860> great<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.309> editing

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
cargo space so it's great for editing

is the only spaceship currently in elite

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.899 
is the only spaceship currently in elite
dangerous<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.740> has<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.250> class

eight weapon hair point and that weapon
in<00:01:14.610> question<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.250> plasma<00:01:17.250> accelerator

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
in question is the plasma accelerator

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.760 
in question is the plasma accelerator
and<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.619> seen<00:01:19.950> an<00:01:20.220> action<00:01:20.700> yet<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
and I have not seen an action yet and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.039 
and I have not seen an action yet and
I've<00:01:22.770> only<00:01:23.009> read<00:01:23.340> about<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.570> plasma

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
I've only read about it but the plasma

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.980 
I've only read about it but the plasma
accelerator<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.580> powerful<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.630> shot

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
accelerator is so powerful that one shot

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.249 
accelerator is so powerful that one shot
is<00:01:28.259> gonna<00:01:28.650> strip<00:01:29.180> annihilate<00:01:30.180> destroy<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
is gonna strip annihilate destroy and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.100 
is gonna strip annihilate destroy and
turn<00:01:31.860> any<00:01:32.220> spaceship<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.299> game<00:01:33.540> almost

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
turn any spaceship in this game almost

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.580 
turn any spaceship in this game almost
into<00:01:34.560> space<00:01:35.340> dust<00:01:35.420> immediately<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
into space dust immediately and I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590 
into space dust immediately and I
imagine<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.640> ridiculously

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
imagine it's gonna be ridiculously

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.130 
imagine it's gonna be ridiculously
expensive<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:41.630> purchase<00:01:42.740> such<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
expensive to purchase such a

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
expensive to purchase such a
ridiculously<00:01:46.140> powerful<00:01:46.409> weapon<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> i

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
ridiculously powerful weapon and i

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.819 
ridiculously powerful weapon and i
believe<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.329> also<00:01:48.509> very<00:01:48.810> rare<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> it's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
believe it's also very rare and it's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.310 
believe it's also very rare and it's
difficult<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.549> find<00:01:50.820> animeme<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.140> in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
difficult to find animeme right now in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.289 
difficult to find animeme right now in
the<00:01:52.409> game<00:01:52.560> there's<00:01:52.890> over<00:01:53.130> 50<00:01:53.340> star<00:01:53.790> systems

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the game there's over 50 star systems

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.410 
the game there's over 50 star systems
when<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> game<00:01:55.320> goes<00:01:55.619> final<00:01:56.430> when<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> game

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
when the game goes final when the game

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
when the game goes final when the game
is<00:01:57.600> finally<00:01:57.840> released<00:01:58.229> we're<00:01:58.950> gonna<00:01:59.070> have

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
is finally released we're gonna have

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.580 
is finally released we're gonna have
hundreds<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.450> hundreds<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.110> hundreds<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
star<00:02:01.829> systems<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.850> multiple<00:02:02.880> routes

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
star systems with multiple routes

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.840 
star systems with multiple routes
between<00:02:03.899> them<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.500> things<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.579> rare

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
between them so things that are rare

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.819 
between them so things that are rare
will<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.270> even<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.509> difficult<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.350> find<00:02:07.590> in

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
will be even more difficult to find in

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.620 
will be even more difficult to find in
the<00:02:07.950> future<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.750> looking<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.200> those

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
the future but just looking at those

open hair points and you know it's plain

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.780 
open hair points and you know it's plain
to<00:02:13.600> see<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.020> this<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.770> not<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.130> spaceship<00:02:15.550> that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
to see that this is not a spaceship that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.360 
to see that this is not a spaceship that
you<00:02:15.910> want<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.330> around<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:18.100> great

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
you want to around with it's great

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.850 
you want to around with it's great
for<00:02:18.580> trading<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.300> formidable<00:02:19.960> at<00:02:20.290> combat

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
for trading it's formidable at combat

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.930 
for trading it's formidable at combat
and<00:02:22.110> no<00:02:23.110> it's<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.530> quickest<00:02:23.980> or<00:02:24.220> fastest

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
and no it's not the quickest or fastest

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.160 
and no it's not the quickest or fastest
spaceship<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> world<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.840> think<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.110> a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
spaceship in the world I think it's a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
spaceship in the world I think it's a
max<00:02:26.410> speed<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:28.290> 180<00:02:29.290> or<00:02:29.650> max<00:02:30.370> boost<00:02:30.820> speed<00:02:31.330> of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
max speed of a 180 or max boost speed of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.040 
max speed of a 180 or max boost speed of
240<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.420> type<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.630> ship<00:02:34.900> you

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
240 so this is the type of ship you

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.050 
240 so this is the type of ship you
probably<00:02:35.500> want<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> be<00:02:35.980> putting<00:02:36.340> some<00:02:36.550> gimbal

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
probably want to be putting some gimbal

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.320 
probably want to be putting some gimbal
weapons<00:02:37.570> on<00:02:37.780> as<00:02:37.990> well<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.760> mostly<00:02:39.760> gimballed

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
weapons as well as missiles and well you

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.940 
weapons as well as missiles and well you
know<00:02:45.750> acquiring<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.050> amount<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.470> money<00:02:47.770> in

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
order to maintain such a ship you're

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.240 
order to maintain such a ship you're
gonna<00:02:49.930> have<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.170> pull<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> lot<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.980> play<00:02:51.220> time

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
gonna have to pull a lot of play time

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.910 
gonna have to pull a lot of play time
into<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:51.940> game<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> previously<00:02:53.500> in

sheer excuse me awesome factor of the
spaceship<00:03:08.800> it's<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.340> big<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:11.680> one<00:03:11.860> of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
spaceship it's so big and it's one of

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.110 
spaceship it's so big and it's one of
those<00:03:12.070> spaceships<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.730> would<00:03:12.970> be<00:03:13.090> a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
those spaceships that would be a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.810 
those spaceships that would be a
complete<00:03:13.540> joy<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.410> fly<00:03:14.560> especially<00:03:15.550> with<00:03:15.670> it's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
complete joy to fly especially with it's

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.840 
complete joy to fly especially with it's
very<00:03:16.030> unusual<00:03:16.320> at<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.680> very<00:03:17.980> unusual<00:03:18.580> long

very unusual at the very unusual long
nose<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> spaceship<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.790> push<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:22.180> I

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
nose to the spaceship and push it I

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.510 
nose to the spaceship and push it I
suppose<00:03:23.410> right<00:03:23.620> now<00:03:23.800> this<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.220> ultimate

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
suppose right now this is the ultimate

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.790 
suppose right now this is the ultimate
spaceship<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.840> one<00:03:26.020> where<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.380> kind

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
spaceship this is the one where you kind

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.580 
spaceship this is the one where you kind
of<00:03:26.920> anybody<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.460> comes<00:03:28.180> up<00:03:28.420> anybody<00:03:29.350> that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
of anybody that comes up anybody that

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.380 
of anybody that comes up anybody that
comes<00:03:29.740> up<00:03:29.950> against<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.460> kind<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.790> looks<00:03:30.970> at<00:03:31.150> at

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
comes up against you kind of looks at at

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.600 
comes up against you kind of looks at at
this<00:03:31.720> looks<00:03:32.170> at<00:03:32.320> you<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.590> says<00:03:32.740> right<00:03:33.040> this

this looks at you and says right this
guy<00:03:33.820> is<00:03:33.880> serious<00:03:34.540> he<00:03:34.570> knows<00:03:34.960> what<00:03:35.200> he's<00:03:35.320> doing

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
guy is serious he knows what he's doing

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.890 
guy is serious he knows what he's doing
I'm<00:03:35.860> afraid<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.550> better<00:03:37.030> get<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.570> out<00:03:37.810> of

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
I'm afraid I better get the out of

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.170 
I'm afraid I better get the out of
here<00:03:38.080> I'm<00:03:38.620> gonna<00:03:38.740> be<00:03:38.980> turned<00:03:39.550> into<00:03:39.790> space<00:03:40.150> dust

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
here I'm gonna be turned into space dust

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.370 
here I'm gonna be turned into space dust
and<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.400> Anaconda<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.060> powerful<00:03:43.300> that<00:03:43.870> it

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
and the Anaconda is so powerful that it

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.830 
and the Anaconda is so powerful that it
can<00:03:44.410> tackle<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.550> take<00:03:45.880> on<00:03:46.150> multiple

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
can tackle and take on multiple

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.470 
can tackle and take on multiple
spaceships<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:48.450> by<00:03:49.450> itself<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.170> mean<00:03:51.420> this<00:03:52.420> is

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
spaceships and by itself I mean this is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.170 
spaceships and by itself I mean this is
one<00:03:53.020> incredible<00:03:53.560> spaceship<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:54.820> really

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
one incredible spaceship so really

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.050 
one incredible spaceship so really
that's<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.660> this<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.260> ultimate

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
that's it this is the ultimate

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.699 
that's it this is the ultimate
multi-purpose<00:03:58.060> spaceship<00:03:58.990> right<00:03:59.230> now<00:03:59.410> but

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
multi-purpose spaceship right now but

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.490 
multi-purpose spaceship right now but
the<00:04:00.430> most<00:04:00.700> expensive<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.810> again<00:04:02.080> remember

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
the most expensive and again remember

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.670 
the most expensive and again remember
the<00:04:03.130> game<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.550> invaded<00:04:03.910> if<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.870> upgrade<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.440> an

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
the game is invaded if you upgrade to an

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.760 
the game is invaded if you upgrade to an
anaconda<00:04:06.280> now<00:04:06.750> before<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.870> game<00:04:08.050> comes<00:04:08.590> out

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
anaconda now before the game comes out

anaconda now before the game comes out
beta<00:04:09.100> phase<00:04:09.370> you're<00:04:09.610> gonna<00:04:09.730> lose<00:04:10.000> everything

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
beta phase you're gonna lose everything

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.900 
beta phase you're gonna lose everything
everything<00:04:10.930> is<00:04:11.050> going<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.380> be<00:04:11.500> reset

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
everything is going to be reset

everything is going to be reset
but<00:04:13.270> anyway<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> ship<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.080> I'm<00:04:14.380> saying<00:04:14.710> and

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
but anyway is a ship that I'm saying and

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.550 
but anyway is a ship that I'm saying and
you're<00:04:14.920> looking<00:04:15.190> forward<00:04:15.460> to<00:04:16.019> hopefully<00:04:17.019> one

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
you're looking forward to hopefully one

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.949 
you're looking forward to hopefully one
day<00:04:17.590> getting<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.580> opportunity<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:19.450> fly<00:04:19.660> and

is I'm really excited to hopefully one
day<00:04:23.940> try<00:04:24.940> out<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.390> plasma<00:04:26.140> accelerator<00:04:26.830> a

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
day try out that plasma accelerator a

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.280 
day try out that plasma accelerator a
weapon<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.360> can<00:04:29.020> be<00:04:29.170> put<00:04:29.380> on<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:31.050> class<00:04:32.050> a

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
weapon that can be put on the class a

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.880 
weapon that can be put on the class a
hair<00:04:32.620> point<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:34.060> yeah<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.720> that's<00:04:35.680> the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
hair point so yeah and that's the

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.760 
hair point so yeah and that's the
Anaconda<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.730> we<00:04:37.600> are<00:04:37.780> going<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.170> have<00:04:38.470> more

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
Anaconda and we are going to have more

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.830 
Anaconda and we are going to have more
space<00:04:39.100> ships<00:04:39.370> in<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.610> future<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.180> probably

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
space ships in the future and probably

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.200 
space ships in the future and probably
in<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.740> future<00:04:42.070> we'll<00:04:42.220> probably<00:04:42.490> look<00:04:42.910> at<00:04:43.090> the

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
in the future we'll probably look at the

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.700 
in the future we'll probably look at the
Anaconda<00:04:43.780> as<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:43.990> middle-of-the-road

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
Anaconda as a middle-of-the-road

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.980 
Anaconda as a middle-of-the-road
spaceship<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.610> there<00:04:46.150> will<00:04:46.330> be<00:04:46.360> other<00:04:46.660> space

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
spaceship and there will be other space

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.290 
spaceship and there will be other space
ships<00:04:47.230> that<00:04:47.440> are<00:04:47.650> four<00:04:48.220> times<00:04:48.520> more<00:04:48.730> powerful

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
ships that are four times more powerful

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.050 
ships that are four times more powerful
in<00:04:49.620> combat<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:50.770> four<00:04:51.130> times<00:04:51.430> better<00:04:51.790> in

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
in combat and four times better in

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.050 
in combat and four times better in
trading<00:04:52.480> who<00:04:52.810> knows<00:04:53.020> but<00:04:53.740> right<00:04:53.980> now<00:04:54.040> and<00:04:54.430> that

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
trading who knows but right now and that

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.450 
trading who knows but right now and that
is<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.360> ultimate<00:04:55.450> spaceship<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:57.370> that's

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
is the ultimate spaceship and so that's

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.970 
is the ultimate spaceship and so that's
