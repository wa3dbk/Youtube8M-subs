00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
since I learned how to do it and I've

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.850 
since I learned how to do it and I've
done<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.600> every<00:04:44.870> day<00:04:44.900> for<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.260> long<00:04:45.320> time<00:04:45.680> it's

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
done it every day for a long time it's

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.310 
done it every day for a long time it's
hard<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.250> not<00:04:46.430> do<00:04:46.639> it<00:04:46.669> now<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.780> small<00:04:48.110> wing

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
hard to not do it now and the small wing

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.740 
hard to not do it now and the small wing
this<00:04:48.530> looks<00:04:48.770> weird<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.220> me<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.419> think<00:04:50.630> the

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
this looks weird to me and I think the

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.810 
this looks weird to me and I think the
reason<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.200> do<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:51.889> dramatically<00:04:52.490> is

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
reason that I do it so dramatically is

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.450 
reason that I do it so dramatically is
because<00:04:53.330> my<00:04:54.229> eyes<00:04:54.440> are<00:04:54.470> very<00:04:54.710> big<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.130> they're

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
because my eyes are very big and they're

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.879 
because my eyes are very big and they're
very<00:04:55.490> round<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.300> large<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.229> that's<00:04:57.590> really

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
very round and large and that's really

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.450 
very round and large and that's really
attractive<00:04:58.100> um<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.139> even<00:05:00.350> it<00:05:00.590> out<00:05:00.770> like

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
attractive um and to even it out like

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.879 
attractive um and to even it out like
the<00:05:01.610> wing<00:05:01.790> kind<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.270> has<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:02.479> be<00:05:02.780> long<00:05:03.590> cuz<00:05:03.740> if

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
the wing kind of has to be long cuz if

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.530
