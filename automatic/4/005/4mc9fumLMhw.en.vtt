00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
 I want to learn mathematics 

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.590
 sign up come with me 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.769
 Welcome to the channel 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.230
 I'm going to talk about mathematics. 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.220
 Countless crimes are all numbers that 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.779
 have two divisors exactly 1 and it 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 own 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:30.599
 then we have that set of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:37.329
 prime numbers is formed by the number 235 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.309
 7 11 13 and infinite other numbers to 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.579
 end of this video I'll make a 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.989
 demonstration of why numbers that 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.410
 not infinite, there is no number 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.350
 worse that it's the biggest of all and we 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.680
 realize the only number park is prime is 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.960
 number two no other number pa 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.970
 will be a prime number because the two 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.559
 it is always a factor in this number to 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.170
 11 from the example here 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.449
 the number 4 for example it can be 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.040
 inscribed as twice 2 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.820
 number 6 is twice 3 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.600
 the number 8 twice 4 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.259
 the ten is twice five and so on 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.299
 against 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.549
 so you notice that number two is 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.039
 always factor of any other number 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.229
 That's why the only park number is 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.859
 cousin is number 2 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.759
 as well as the only prime number that has 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:36.429
 15 in its composition algae 15 is the 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:40.119
 5 because all other numbers 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:44.229
 that is 15 in the end are 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:48.549
 from five to fifteen can be 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.990
 inscribed as being three times 51 25 is 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.659
 five times five the number 35 is seven 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.700
 times five and so on 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.869
 all other numbers that are not 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.209
 number of hazards 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.849
 they can be entered as a 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:07.029
 multiplication of prime numbers by 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:09.069
 Example 4 prime number but four is 

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:11.500
 a multiplication of prime numbers is 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.810
 two months two have 12 here that april and 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.510
 other two that the number is also prime 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.760
 six also appears on the list is three 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.489
 times two a multiplication of two 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.080
 prime number 8 that does not 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.160
 It was there 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.640
 it's four times the 214 you know there's 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.110
 two months two then 28 then eight is 2 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.030
 times 2 times two 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.960
 number 9 is three times three 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.840
 the number 10 is five times two 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.510
 the multiplication of two primes the number 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:53.970
 12 is six times 26 is three times two per 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:57.090
 turn number 14 is seven times two 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.590
 also of prime numbers and thus by 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.620
 any other number will also go 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.790
 be that way if it is not the number 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.420
 premium for example the number 21 is seven 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.880
 times 3 and between several other numbers 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.770
 which are a multiplication of the numbers 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.390
 cousins who are all other right 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.660
 You have the prime numbers and the numbers. 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.410
 which are multiplications between numbers 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.800
 cousins 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.860
 nowadays the prime numbers they are 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.650
 used in computing to 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.050
 encrypt passwords for example in the 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.800
 What time are you going to get in? 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.390
 alone or join your orkut 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.610
 any other site that requires a password 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.200
 That one yes it is encrypted 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.970
 I'll show you now that the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 set of prime numbers is a 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.620
 infinite set does not exist number 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.590
 cousin who is the greatest of all 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.840
 suppose it absurd that there is a 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.330
 prime number that is the largest of all 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.650
 if the set of prime numbers is 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.080
 finite 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.140
 this means that there is a 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.860
 ip number that is the largest prime number 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.070
 all, and this also tells us that 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.830
 there is a number n which is a 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.630
 multiplication of all prime numbers 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.590
 so let's say prime number 1 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.859
 and number 2 the prime number 3 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.870
 and this multiplication follows you 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.030
 arrive at that prime number which is the largest 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.370
 prime number of all call dp 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.960
 at the same time as the set of 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.319
 numbers 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 is infinite after that number in 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:36.229
 here is a number that is on 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.880
 plus one yours add a unit to that 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.340
 eniac the meeting number coming soon 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.110
 after him how do we know all the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.060
 numbers that are not prime 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.740
 in this case and one more that will not be 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.660
 cousin because he's coming after 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.580
 that the multiplication of 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.169
 all prime numbers mean is 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.660
 greater than n 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:05:00.349
 this number and one more that will have at least 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:02.180
 minus a prime factor will never factor in 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:06.289
 here here dp 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.139
 this means that this pk there is a 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.300
 generic term prime number then as 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.520
 the number at from up here is a 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:20.060
 multiplication of all prime numbers 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:22.970
 this implies that pk it divides this 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.569
 belly button is the symbol 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:32.330
 of dividing the pk it divides the number n 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:36.710
 at the same time this pkk that will split 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.289
 the number and plus 1 of the properties of the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.400
 we have to sin 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.699
 video n 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:50.060
 and pk divide n plus one 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:54.590
 this means that pk it divides the 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.389
 number one which is absurd because the 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.110
 number is not the prime number so he 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.479
 can not be visible by another number 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.210
 cousin any of us have to 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:08.210
 to abandon the idea that all the 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.969
 primes is finite and we accept the 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.070
 fact that the prime numbers are 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.349
 There is no prime number that 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.849
 is the biggest of all 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.099
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.680
 just any prime numbers class 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:24.409
 doubt or suggestion let your 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.280
 comment write if our channel is up 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:28.060
 the next class 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.060
 Thank you very much for your attention.
