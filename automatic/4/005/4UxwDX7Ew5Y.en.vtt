00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.389
 otherwise I hope you have water 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.290
 drinking jugganauts fifteen days get 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.780
 found for the first presentation 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.250
 clan beach troops by the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.080
 type 1 troops who are the barbarians 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.189
 archers and goblins they have little 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.930
 of health points and do not need much 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.310
 damage they are used 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.439
 during big attacks because their numbers 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.849
 make their strength 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.830
 a year that if only one was enough already 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.449
 not bad that their numbers make their 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.920
 force they are not very resistant 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.390
 against the enemy defenses that make 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.489
 tone damage such as the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 wizard's tricks or mortars it takes 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.600
 know that a troop of type 1 can get 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.600
 easily decimated in one shot 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.960
 who holds it with the mortar well played 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 I think there is still more to see 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.020
 and so the first unit be unlocked 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.460
 in the barracks in offensive strategy 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.930
 the barbarians are useful to distract 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.280
 enemy defenses when they are in 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.199
 group and now play or do a 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 zoom in on the screen because it's written in everything 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.920
 little the barbarian uses there but lyon 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 type of attac the space they occupy and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.490
 from one place to the occupied space 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.049
 what is it for example if you 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.610
 have 100 places in your camp 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.650
 military and well you will be able to store 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.970
 without barbaric I also specify that the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.229
 military camp is where you 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.850
 troops gather before you 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.650
 launch an attack the duration of your 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.509
 barbarians will last twenty seconds his 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.460
 movement speed is 16 and its 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.710
 attacked speed of 1 second and then 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.299
 to finish its range is 0.4 box 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.439
 for the hips and open mark the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.119
 more often in physical change 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.890
 it's rock and the type of arrows 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.900
 back on the screen the type of attacked 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 archers is remote his occupied space 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.659
 and 2 1 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 the duration of his training is 25 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.320
 seconds for his traveling speed 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.520
 she is 24 and her attack speed 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.890
 and a half second 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.939
 the archer a range of 3.4 cases the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.470
 goblins who win high level that 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.149
 a word crouch what is practical 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.740
 to differentiate them they are also the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.189
 main antagonists in the countryside 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.140
 solo 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.610
 so it's best to deploy them 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.860
 in a group because their ravages are 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.420
 devastating the attacking goblins but 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.040
 the space they occupy and 1 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.719
 as for barbarians and archers 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.729
 for the speed of movement she is 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.129
 of 30 of his attack speed and a 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.690
 second and finally its reach is 0.4 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.099
 boxes like for barbarians I you 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.810
 thanks for watching this video 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.440
 I hope you have had fun and me 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.670
 on this I tell you 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.670
 on the skewer by everyone
