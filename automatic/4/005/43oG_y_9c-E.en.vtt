 end result this is so much that you 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.680
 like it too if you want to know how it is 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.850
 that I thought they act is known 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.340
 watching 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.520
 so let's see I'll start 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.399

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.429
 all over my eyelid it's going to 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.969
 To fix year this time is that makeup and 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.589
 It's more segmented, fine. 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.390
 after applied and wellington some 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.829
 tapping my own finger to 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.019
 leave everything here to not be drawing 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.030
 no eye patch with excess of 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.430
 Shade a place that has is more 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.940
 and another doctor knows how to 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.330
 shadow and 07 and the brush 15 of gut I go 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.430
 start making a base that does the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.500
 tender I actually like more shade 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.160
 brown from the inner front of my 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.230
 I look to the end 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.840
 this light brown shadow she goes 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.750
 serve as a transition from shellfish that 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.750
 will apply on the eyelid is pro the operator 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.520
 going down my brow're 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.840
 it will be what will smoke will do 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.840
 But of these two things 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.869
 to justify the illuminator as 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.320
 haunting 4 for more flour they see 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.780
 in her I came and will deposit her that is 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.390
 under my brow castro have 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.549
 made brown shade application and not 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.659
 It was okay as I did the light. 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.119
 it helps a lot to make a gradient're 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.030
 so she applied it and I think a little bit about 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:11.110
 toward the brown on the back in 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:18.430
 truth in the inner corner that 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:20.769
 I apply and like shadow who to 02 that simÃ£o 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.269
 very dark I'll fill my whole 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.140
 mobile eyelid 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.120
 I'll deposit it all over the eyelid 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.030
 This afternoon, I'm just giving 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.590
 smirks depicting me rubbing 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.750
 I want called pigment well 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.060
 limit of application of this shadow is 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.950
 always here in the concave I arrived here in 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.319
 rocinha stops climbing 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.549
 thence over the line of July goes 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.549
 to be marson 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.140
 now it's time to take the markings with the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.730
 brush 15 back and I'll start doing 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.890
 circular movements between brown 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.510
 clear and a dark brown to machine 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.970
 of great pretty good on the beach neither have 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.070
 I work a lot fast and do zig 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.829
 zag making balls I already have one 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.829
 blurred with no demarcations 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.580
 to make a dot of light now 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.709
 Illuminated here in the inner corner I 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.510
 I came with the pigment that gives color 05 and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.000
 brush 01 that I actually did it alone 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.650
 on the side but it's good that it's pretty accurate 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.780
 is little 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.000
 This is good, we see that there is a 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.299
 small or censorship wants to close the night 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.750
 has been looking and lighting up it will open 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.470
 the internal score will give a 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.470
 beautiful party 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.110
 now with the theme that before the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.290
 safe box 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.269
 It's the destination of cotton rui paiva ver 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.540
 with too much shadow falling here 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.840
 below my eyes 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.500
 the finish now I will make a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.760
 outlined 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.000
 I'm using the stylus pen 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.910
 guti she is super easy to make 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.890

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.430
 eyelashes 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.539
 but I have a lot of skill to do 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.310
 this trait 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.080
 I'm sure you'll get it because it's 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.539
 very practical 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.250
 I'm going to make a thinner leandro in the 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:32.200
 Inner corner in a little bit more 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.050

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.800

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.930
 start to finish and let it stop there is 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.240

 a little bit popular over the side 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:18.830
 in the morning the same brown shadow as I 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.259
 made application on my mobile eyelid I 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.479
 I'll apply it here it's under my eye 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:30.199
 I came to make a brush money that 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:31.940
 before I was to apply the 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.770
 false eyelashes and I'm coming back with them 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.880
 Coladinhos for us to finish this 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.669
 in that region 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.919
 if those applied that arrives from 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.830
 for you to see how it was 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:45.860
 he got very naturally became focus 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.900
 Look, he's very light of what I am. 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.430
 using this one here you want it 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:59.240
 He's the bucks. 01 That's his box . 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:07:03.199

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.330
 loved is examining I will use 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.820
 liquid lipstick from the fountain and if that pink 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:12.080
 good 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.340
 kiss brant but it's logical that 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.190
 your criteria to carry out the 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.530
 legal download is to be to form a 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:22.190
 network that matches everything where 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:25.310
 button any dog in clothes that 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.780
 you are wearing will tell you 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.639
 it would be that we are already 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.770
 I was very ready that you had 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:32.990
 liked the video to take advantage of 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.180
 of course you can adapt 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.909
 from here to when this brown can be 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.130
 a colder greener to change the 

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:42.440
 lipstick color but denied that his super 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.570
 adaptable to various formats which I 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.099
 and small eye prominent can 

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.930
 today or who has programmed the 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:51.960
 money can be that he is more caidinho 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:54.090
 This faded one falls well with all people. 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.680
 rd the social media program is everything 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.630
