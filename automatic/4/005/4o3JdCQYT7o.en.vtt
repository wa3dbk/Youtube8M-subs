but<00:02:59.700> they<00:02:59.880> shoot<00:03:00.090> much<00:03:00.360> faster<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.190> you

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
but they shoot much faster so if you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.479 
but they shoot much faster so if you
want<00:03:02.670> high<00:03:02.910> dps<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.829> the<00:03:04.829> way<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.220> but<00:03:05.370> you

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
want high dps is the way to go but you

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.160 
want high dps is the way to go but you
overheat<00:03:05.970> faster<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.720> even<00:03:07.049> though<00:03:07.110> you

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
overheat faster and you even though you

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.080 
overheat faster and you even though you
shoot<00:03:07.410> faster<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.980> mixture<00:03:08.250> each<00:03:08.430> shot

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090

it<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:13.400> but<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:15.030> i<00:03:15.120> said<00:03:15.299> this<00:03:15.720> rifle

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
it it's but the like i said this rifle

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.690 
it it's but the like i said this rifle
does<00:03:16.290> not<00:03:16.380> overcome<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.980> all<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.220> rifles<00:03:17.579> in

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
does not overcome to all the rifles in

does not overcome to all the rifles in
my<00:03:17.819> opinion<00:03:18.060> Marauders<00:03:18.569> are<00:03:18.690> still<00:03:18.900> viable

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
the ICA is still viable Zeus's are still

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.520 
the ICA is still viable Zeus's are still
good<00:03:22.650> as<00:03:22.769> they<00:03:22.950> are<00:03:23.959> good<00:03:24.959> rifles<00:03:25.319> all<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.309

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
although it's really really really

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.319 
although it's really really really
expensive<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:41.280> guess<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.700> will<00:03:41.760> justify<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
expensive I guess it will justify the

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.270 
expensive I guess it will justify the
cost<00:03:42.660> because<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.290> lot<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.680> people<00:03:43.799> using<00:03:44.160> it

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
cost because a lot of people using it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.860 
cost because a lot of people using it
looks<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.730> crab<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.150> looks<00:03:45.329> awesome<00:03:45.510> you

looks like a crab it looks awesome you

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
not really good at healing weapons but

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
looks awesome but only problem with this

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.370 
looks awesome but only problem with this
cannon<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:12.389> has<00:04:12.540> short<00:04:13.019> range<00:04:13.230> you

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
cannon is that it has short range you

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.020 
cannon is that it has short range you
know<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.739> has<00:04:13.889> like<00:04:14.040> 100<00:04:14.160> damage<00:04:14.489> one<00:04:14.819> in<00:04:14.910> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
know it has like 100 damage one in the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.099 
know it has like 100 damage one in the
CBA<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:16.169> CBA<00:04:16.579> has<00:04:17.579> much<00:04:18.269> longer<00:04:18.599> range<00:04:18.870> if<00:04:19.049> you

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
CBA the CBA has much longer range if you

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.659 
CBA the CBA has much longer range if you
just<00:04:19.260> look<00:04:19.440> at<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.560> range<00:04:19.769> here<00:04:19.859> it's<00:04:20.459> like

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
just look at the range here it's like

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.640 
just look at the range here it's like
right<00:04:21.239> there<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:22.109> then<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.289> look<00:04:22.500> at<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
right there and then you look at the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.159 
right there and then you look at the
redeye<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.010> drops<00:04:23.820> down<00:04:23.880> dramatically<00:04:24.450> it's

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
redeye it drops down dramatically it's

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.490 
redeye it drops down dramatically it's
the<00:04:25.680> range<00:04:25.890> does<00:04:26.130> make<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.340> difference<00:04:26.490> can

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
the range does make a difference can

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.230 
the range does make a difference can
ranges<00:04:28.500> all<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.800> matters<00:04:29.160> but<00:04:29.400> if<00:04:29.700> you<00:04:30.060> want

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
ranges all that matters but if you want

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.000 
ranges all that matters but if you want
to<00:04:30.300> use<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.510> red<00:04:30.630> eye<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:31.050> shoots<00:04:31.320> faster<00:04:31.830> than

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
to use the red eye it shoots faster than

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.450 
to use the red eye it shoots faster than
almost<00:04:32.370> all<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.090> other<00:04:34.220> cannons<00:04:35.220> that's<00:04:35.370> the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
almost all the other cannons that's the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.550 
almost all the other cannons that's the
only<00:04:35.730> good<00:04:35.970> thing<00:04:36.000> about<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:37.380> just

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
only good thing about it and you just

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.260 
only good thing about it and you just
have<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.889> make<00:04:38.610> sure<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:40.410> hit<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:41.180> do<00:04:42.180> it

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
have to make sure you hit and do it

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.300 
have to make sure you hit and do it
consistently<00:04:42.510> fast<00:04:43.020> that's<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.470> only<00:04:43.740> reason

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
consistently fast that's the only reason

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.820 
consistently fast that's the only reason
why<00:04:44.639> you<00:04:44.700> will<00:04:44.940> buy<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.360> red<00:04:45.600> eye<00:04:45.650> other<00:04:46.650> than

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
why you will buy the red eye other than

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.520 
why you will buy the red eye other than
that<00:04:46.919> I'm<00:04:47.580> just<00:04:47.790> good<00:04:47.910> for<00:04:48.090> their<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:49.230> looks

my<00:06:08.370> opinion<00:06:08.669> you'll<00:06:09.000> probably<00:06:09.210> get<00:06:09.479> one<00:06:09.660> of

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
my opinion you'll probably get one of

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.930 
my opinion you'll probably get one of
these<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.289> two<00:06:10.590> superior<00:06:11.100> storm<00:06:11.490> blasts<00:06:11.729> is

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
these and two superior storm blasts is

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.029 
these and two superior storm blasts is
if<00:06:12.090> you're<00:06:12.210> using<00:06:12.360> your<00:06:12.570> shield<00:06:13.470> and<00:06:13.710> spear

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
if you're using your shield and spear

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.940 
if you're using your shield and spear
combo<00:06:14.720> that's<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:16.050> way<00:06:16.500> to<00:06:16.560> go<00:06:16.710> since

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
combo that's the way to go since

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.040 
combo that's the way to go since
superior<00:06:17.610> storm<00:06:17.910> blasts<00:06:18.419> I<00:06:18.660> think<00:06:18.900> it's

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
superior storm blasts I think it's

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.719 
superior storm blasts I think it's
better<00:06:19.260> than<00:06:19.350> ultra<00:06:19.800> storm<00:06:20.010> blasts<00:06:20.280> in<00:06:20.490> some

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
better than ultra storm blasts in some

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.490 
better than ultra storm blasts in some
ways<00:06:20.880> but<00:06:20.970> ultra<00:06:21.300> storm<00:06:21.510> blasts<00:06:21.750> can<00:06:22.260> help<00:06:22.440> you

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
ways but ultra storm blasts can help you
