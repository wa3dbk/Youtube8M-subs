 hello everyone, here we are in one 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.500
 new episode 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:17.730
 I am a joker crisis and as a guest today 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.109
 special caristas to all well 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.840
 today we'll talk about how to get 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.150
 optimal online gaming experience 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.039
 with simple tricks 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 first of all you need to have one 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.220
 adequate connection in this me 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.820
 I realize just fine 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.530
 simply by going to speedtest.net and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.630
 take the connection test to this 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.059
 point would have three parameters to keep in 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.730
 Consider the download pin and a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.920
 floor the most important thing to keep 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.440
 under eye and the pd more you have low 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.440
 this value is less lag you will have game 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 it is necessary to have a value less than 50 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.190
 milliseconds for a good game and a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.120
 value less than 25 for a game 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.590
 excellent 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 unfortunately, not all providers 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.629
 have these connection values 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.970
 there are values ​​that came from 50 and 100 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.080
 or even even more and there the game 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.030
 it becomes unplayable 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.530
 so how do you call the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.810
 your provider and have it reviewed 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.729
 the lost office telling him to do 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 pass your line by interleaved 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.810
 the fast mode in this is the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.759
 cocaine 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 it's basically a configuration of 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.259
 connection they apply from the exchanges 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.360
 to decrease latency ie 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.030
 team for example with telecom italia a 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.280
 this offer is paid and costs 3 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.409
 euros per month and is called internet 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 flat while with other providers it could 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 be free 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.020
 second advice you will have to make sure that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.420
 born to be open to make it go in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.159
 settings of your console and you do 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.409
 the connection test if the nat 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.360
 close you will have to open the doors of the rose 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.110
 for those who don't know how to do it there are 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.790
 dozens of support tutorials 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.220
 another trick that many 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.960
 underestimate and live input ie 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.730
 delay that the image to a source 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.680
 video to the image that appears on the 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.660
 monitor not to be confused with 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.970
 monitor response time and are two 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.740
 things totally this problem can 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.900
 be started first by selecting 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.490
 from your screen the chi gaming coin 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.899
 will allow you to skip a series of 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.490
 successes that go to influence the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.440
 image delay if not available 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.320
 I strongly advise against this method 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.000
 says suffer the hdmi and cuddly cable 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.920
 we also recommend for those who have 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.540
 economic availability and those who do not 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.610
 wanted to compromise with 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.030
 buy a monitor with a vast input 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.250
 lag for example the real beginning that i 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.110
 our advice there are 30 non help 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.060
 greeting to all doug of stark joker 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.060
