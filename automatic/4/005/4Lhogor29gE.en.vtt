00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
Mayweather's had that long layoff and

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.120 
Mayweather's had that long layoff and
III<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.820> there<00:02:03.180> will<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.299> some<00:02:03.390> ring<00:02:03.750> rust

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
III think there will be some ring rust

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
III think there will be some ring rust
but<00:02:05.130> Marquez<00:02:05.729> fights<00:02:06.090> often<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.810> he

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
but Marquez fights often and he

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
but Marquez fights often and he
consistently<00:02:07.560> fights<00:02:08.099> good<00:02:08.310> fighters<00:02:08.640> so

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
consistently fights good fighters so

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.400 
consistently fights good fighters so
he's<00:02:09.330> definitely<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.959> fresh<00:02:10.229> for

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
he's definitely going to be fresh for

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.070 
he's definitely going to be fresh for
this<00:02:10.560> one<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.000> he<00:02:12.000> has<00:02:12.090> better<00:02:12.270> power

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
this one and he has better power

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.790 
this one and he has better power
he<00:02:13.890> absolutely<00:02:14.130> leveled<00:02:15.000> Juan<00:02:15.240> Diaz<00:02:15.480> who<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:16.770> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
he absolutely leveled Juan Diaz who is a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.350 
he absolutely leveled Juan Diaz who is a
very<00:02:17.100> sturdy<00:02:17.490> fighter<00:02:17.850> he<00:02:18.000> showed<00:02:18.210> that

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
very sturdy fighter he showed that

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.970 
very sturdy fighter he showed that
against<00:02:18.570> Nate<00:02:18.780> Campbell<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.650> know<00:02:19.740> he<00:02:19.860> could

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
against Nate Campbell you know he could

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.070 
against Nate Campbell you know he could
take<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.160> he<00:02:20.490> could<00:02:20.640> take<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> shot<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.270> Marcus

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
take a he could take a shot and Marcus

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.890 
take a he could take a shot and Marcus
just<00:02:22.320> absolutely<00:02:22.710> put<00:02:22.920> him<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.130> mat<00:02:23.900> some

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
just absolutely put him on the mat some

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.530 
just absolutely put him on the mat some
disadvantages<00:02:25.710> for<00:02:25.920> Floyd<00:02:26.160> Mayweather<00:02:26.550> again

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
disadvantages for Floyd Mayweather again

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.570 
disadvantages for Floyd Mayweather again
like<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.900> said<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.200> long<00:02:28.410> layoff<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.430> lack

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
like I said the long layoff and the lack

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.160 
like I said the long layoff and the lack
of<00:02:29.610> competition<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.390> really<00:02:30.630> don't<00:02:30.840> think<00:02:30.900> he's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
of competition I really don't think he's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.750 
of competition I really don't think he's
fought<00:02:31.380> anywhere<00:02:32.070> near<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> kind<00:02:32.670> of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
fought anywhere near the kind of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.270 
fought anywhere near the kind of
competition<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.390> Marquez<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.930> what<00:02:34.280> some

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
competition that Marquez is what some

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.420 
competition that Marquez is what some
disadvantages<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.330> Marquez<00:02:36.900> are<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.860> his

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
disadvantages for Marquez are that his

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.550 
disadvantages for Marquez are that his
defense<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:39.570> as<00:02:39.750> good<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:40.020> Mayweather's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
defense is not as good as Mayweather's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.100 
defense is not as good as Mayweather's
and<00:02:40.800> he<00:02:41.610> may<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:41.940> necessarily<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.660> that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
and he may not necessarily be that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.700 
and he may not necessarily be that
difficult<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:44.010> get<00:02:44.340> at<00:02:44.520> his<00:02:45.480> age<00:02:45.810> he's<00:02:46.200> 34

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
difficult to get at his age he's 34

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.160 
difficult to get at his age he's 34
years<00:02:46.740> old<00:02:47.240> now<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.270> know<00:02:48.450> that's<00:02:48.810> only<00:02:48.930> two

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
years old now I know that's only two

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.170 
years old now I know that's only two
years<00:02:49.290> older<00:02:49.770> than<00:02:49.890> Mayweather<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.670> he's<00:02:50.970> had

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
years older than Mayweather but he's had

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.760 
years older than Mayweather but he's had
the<00:02:51.300> much<00:02:51.480> more<00:02:51.660> difficult<00:02:51.900> fights<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.590> much

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
the much more difficult fights the much

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.610 
the much more difficult fights the much
more<00:02:52.980> physically<00:02:53.550> taxing<00:02:53.820> fights<00:02:54.500> even<00:02:55.500> in

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
more physically taxing fights even in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.199 
more physically taxing fights even in
fights<00:02:55.830> like<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.340> know<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.580> rocky<00:02:56.760> Juarez

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
fights like you know the rocky Juarez

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.850 
fights like you know the rocky Juarez
fight<00:02:57.450> he<00:02:57.570> took<00:02:57.750> some<00:02:57.900> serious<00:02:58.140> shots<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.740> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
fight he took some serious shots in that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.380 
fight he took some serious shots in that
fight<00:02:59.070> even<00:02:59.700> though<00:02:59.790> he<00:02:59.880> dominated

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
fight even though he dominated

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.970 
fight even though he dominated
Mayweather's<00:03:01.020> never<00:03:01.260> took<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> kind<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:01.800> hits

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
Mayweather's never took the kind of hits

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.490 
Mayweather's never took the kind of hits
that<00:03:02.190> Marquez<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.670> taken<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.260> as<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.440> said

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
that Marquez is taken and as I said

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.560 
that Marquez is taken and as I said
before<00:03:04.650> his<00:03:05.010> size<00:03:05.250> he's<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.000> much<00:03:06.330> smaller

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
before his size he's a much smaller

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.600 
before his size he's a much smaller
fighter<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.530> biggest<00:03:07.890> he's<00:03:08.040> ever<00:03:08.160> been<00:03:08.370> is

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
fighter the biggest he's ever been is

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.820 
fighter the biggest he's ever been is
135<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.630> think<00:03:09.870> he<00:03:09.930> looked<00:03:10.140> small<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.680> way

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
135 and I think he looked small that way

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.220 
135 and I think he looked small that way
and<00:03:11.790> Mabel<00:03:12.450> there's<00:03:12.600> been<00:03:12.750> all<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.990> way<00:03:13.020> up

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
and Mabel there's been all the way up

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.370 
and Mabel there's been all the way up
near<00:03:13.380> middleweight<00:03:14.540> what<00:03:15.540> Mayweather<00:03:15.810> has<00:03:16.170> to

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
near middleweight what Mayweather has to

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.350 
near middleweight what Mayweather has to
do<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.650> win<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:17.010> he<00:03:17.489> has<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.760> keep<00:03:17.910> Marquez

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
do to win is he has to keep Marquez

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.960 
do to win is he has to keep Marquez
moving<00:03:18.720> backwards<00:03:19.170> because<00:03:19.709> as<00:03:20.610> we<00:03:20.790> saw

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
moving backwards because as we saw

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.729 
moving backwards because as we saw
against<00:03:21.180> Wandy<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.780> he<00:03:22.350> doesn't<00:03:22.560> necessarily

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
against Wandy as he doesn't necessarily

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.250 
against Wandy as he doesn't necessarily
respond<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.880> pressure<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:25.830> well<00:03:27.260> he

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
respond to pressure on that well he

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.350 
respond to pressure on that well he
needs<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.680> off<00:03:28.830> early<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:29.580> Pacquio<00:03:30.150> did

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
needs to get off early like Pacquio did

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.410 
needs to get off early like Pacquio did
in<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.510> first<00:03:30.690> fight<00:03:30.900> um<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:31.980> he<00:03:32.640> does<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:32.910> I

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
in the first fight um if he does that I

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.449 
in the first fight um if he does that I
mean<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:34.019> he<00:03:34.110> doesn't<00:03:34.440> let<00:03:34.530> Marquez<00:03:34.950> warm<00:03:35.250> up

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
mean if he doesn't let Marquez warm up

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.070 
mean if he doesn't let Marquez warm up
if<00:03:35.850> he<00:03:35.970> doesn't<00:03:36.239> let<00:03:36.300> Marquez<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:36.930> into<00:03:37.050> a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
if he doesn't let Marquez get into a

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.540 
if he doesn't let Marquez get into a
groove<00:03:37.260> because<00:03:37.530> when<00:03:37.769> Marcus<00:03:38.070> gets<00:03:38.280> into<00:03:38.519> a

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
groove because when Marcus gets into a

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.330 
groove because when Marcus gets into a
groove<00:03:38.820> I<00:03:39.060> mean<00:03:39.600> he's<00:03:40.230> really<00:03:40.260> hard<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.130> beat

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
groove I mean he's really hard to beat

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.729 
groove I mean he's really hard to beat
if<00:03:41.519> he<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:41.880> start<00:03:42.239> off<00:03:42.450> early<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.959> really<00:03:43.500> get

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
if he can start off early and really get

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.949 
if he can start off early and really get
at<00:03:43.920> him<00:03:44.130> um<00:03:44.280> he<00:03:44.970> could<00:03:45.180> give<00:03:45.330> Marquez<00:03:45.780> some

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
at him um he could give Marquez some

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.350 
at him um he could give Marquez some
serious<00:03:46.410> trouble<00:03:46.590> early<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.280> maybe<00:03:47.940> build<00:03:48.269> a

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
serious trouble early and maybe build a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.750 
serious trouble early and maybe build a
bit<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.660> lead<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.080> scorecards<00:03:49.760> what

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
bit of a lead on the scorecards what

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.400 
bit of a lead on the scorecards what
Marquez<00:03:51.120> has<00:03:51.300> to<00:03:51.450> do<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.690> avoid<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.019> ropes

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
Marquez has to do is avoid the ropes

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.610 
Marquez has to do is avoid the ropes
like<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.709> said<00:03:53.070> um<00:03:53.220> because<00:03:54.209> he<00:03:55.200> didn't<00:03:55.470> do

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
like I said um because he didn't do

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.560 
like I said um because he didn't do
particularly<00:03:56.160> well<00:03:56.430> against<00:03:56.700> Diaz<00:03:57.060> until<00:03:57.450> the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
particularly well against Diaz until the

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.920 
particularly well against Diaz until the
big<00:03:57.720> punch<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.290> was<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.650> actually<00:03:59.430> had<00:03:59.730> Diaz<00:04:00.720> up

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
big punch it was I actually had Diaz up

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.030 
big punch it was I actually had Diaz up
523<00:04:01.709> at<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.430> time<00:04:02.580> of<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.760> stoppage<00:04:03.800> he<00:04:04.800> is<00:04:04.890> to

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
523 at the time of the stoppage he is to

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.530 
523 at the time of the stoppage he is to
keep<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.310> fight<00:04:05.519> in<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.850> center<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.360> Ring

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
keep the fight in the center of the Ring

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.300 
keep the fight in the center of the Ring
where<00:04:06.750> he<00:04:06.810> can<00:04:06.959> make<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.260> box<00:04:07.500> off<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:08.190> way

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
where he can make it a box off the way

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.640 
where he can make it a box off the way
the<00:04:08.430> two<00:04:08.580> patio<00:04:08.970> fights<00:04:09.209> were<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.410> think

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
the two patio fights were and I think

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.810 
the two patio fights were and I think
he'll<00:04:10.769> be<00:04:10.799> able<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.070> be<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.340> most<00:04:11.489> effective

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
he'll be able to be the most effective

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.289 
he'll be able to be the most effective
there<00:04:12.330> um<00:04:13.130> he<00:04:14.130> has<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.370> he<00:04:14.790> has<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:15.090> apply

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
there um he has to he has to apply

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.909 
there um he has to he has to apply
pressure<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.900> what<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.019> mean<00:04:16.200> by<00:04:16.260> PI<00:04:16.620> pressure

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
pressure and what I mean by PI pressure

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.520 
pressure and what I mean by PI pressure
is<00:04:17.160> not<00:04:17.549> necessarily<00:04:18.090> muscle<00:04:18.840> Mayweather<00:04:19.229> ran

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
is not necessarily muscle Mayweather ran

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.690 
is not necessarily muscle Mayweather ran
because<00:04:19.709> he's<00:04:19.890> not<00:04:20.040> going<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.220> be<00:04:20.280> able<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.549> do

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
because he's not going to be able to do

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.430 
because he's not going to be able to do
that<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.239> he<00:04:21.330> needs<00:04:21.539> to<00:04:21.660> be<00:04:21.840> willing<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.289> throw

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
that but he needs to be willing to throw

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.880 
that but he needs to be willing to throw
110<00:04:23.039> punches<00:04:23.370> around<00:04:24.289> fighters<00:04:25.289> in<00:04:25.530> recent

110 punches around fighters in recent

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
I've tried to have tried to beat

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.040 
I've tried to have tried to beat
Mayweather<00:04:29.070> um<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.940> only<00:04:30.300> throw<00:04:30.480> 50<00:04:30.750> punches

Mayweather um and only throw 50 punches

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.390 
Mayweather um and only throw 50 punches
around<00:04:31.290> it's<00:04:31.440> just<00:04:31.590> not<00:04:31.740> going<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.890> happen<00:04:31.980> on

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
around it's just not going to happen on

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.190 
around it's just not going to happen on
you<00:04:32.910> know<00:04:32.970> unless<00:04:33.240> you're<00:04:33.780> significantly

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
you know unless you're significantly

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.970 
you know unless you're significantly
larger<00:04:35.040> than<00:04:35.070> him<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.900> he<00:04:36.900> cannot<00:04:37.290> fall<00:04:37.590> into

what<00:04:38.280> i<00:04:38.310> like<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.670> call<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:39.270> mayweather<00:04:39.660> law

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
what i like to call the mayweather law

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.610 
what i like to call the mayweather law
which<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:40.890> around<00:04:41.670> you<00:04:42.660> know<00:04:42.780> around<00:04:42.990> six<00:04:43.500> or

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
which is around you know around six or

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.220 
which is around you know around six or
seven<00:04:43.980> after<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.700> very<00:04:44.970> close<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.750> competitive

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
seven after a very close and competitive

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.130 
seven after a very close and competitive
first<00:04:46.470> after<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.920> fight<00:04:47.160> mayweather

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
first after the fight mayweather

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.200 
first after the fight mayweather
components<00:04:49.140> kind<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.530> get<00:04:49.860> complacent<00:04:50.280> you

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
components kind of get complacent you

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.090 
components kind of get complacent you
know<00:04:51.300> start<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.840> throw<00:04:52.140> less<00:04:52.350> punches<00:04:52.860> the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
know start to throw less punches the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.460 
know start to throw less punches the
defense<00:04:53.550> gets<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:53.850> little<00:04:53.940> sloppy<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:55.320> think

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
defense gets a little sloppy and I think

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.320 
defense gets a little sloppy and I think
this<00:04:55.740> happens<00:04:56.160> because<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.700> know<00:04:56.790> fighters

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
this happens because you know fighters

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.700 
this happens because you know fighters
get<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:57.660> excited<00:04:57.930> that<00:04:58.290> they're<00:04:58.590> being

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
get so excited that they're being

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.590 
get so excited that they're being
competitive<00:04:59.070> with<00:04:59.640> Floyd<00:04:59.880> Mayweather<00:04:59.910> they

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
competitive with Floyd Mayweather they

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.270 
competitive with Floyd Mayweather they
forget<00:05:00.960> that<00:05:01.230> you<00:05:01.410> know<00:05:01.500> they<00:05:01.830> need<00:05:01.980> to<00:05:02.160> win

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
forget that you know they need to win

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.930 
forget that you know they need to win
the<00:05:02.430> fight<00:05:02.670> and<00:05:03.380> I<00:05:04.380> don't<00:05:05.220> think<00:05:05.400> Marquez<00:05:05.790> will

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
the fight and I don't think Marquez will

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.580 
the fight and I don't think Marquez will
do<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.270> but<00:05:06.510> he<00:05:06.660> needs<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:06.960> be<00:05:07.110> careful<00:05:07.500> of

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
do that but he needs to be careful of

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.250 
do that but he needs to be careful of
that<00:05:08.150> so<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.270> way<00:05:09.390> I<00:05:09.420> think<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:09.900> fight<00:05:10.110> is

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
that so the way I think this fight is

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.190 
that so the way I think this fight is
going<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.500> go<00:05:10.650> is<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.640> I<00:05:11.940> think<00:05:12.660> early<00:05:12.840> in<00:05:13.110> the

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
going to go is that I think early in the

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.220 
going to go is that I think early in the
fight<00:05:13.410> mayweather<00:05:14.220> style<00:05:14.790> is<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.810> really

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
fight mayweather style is is really

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.130 
fight mayweather style is is really
gonna<00:05:16.670> trouble<00:05:17.670> Marquette's<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.450> think<00:05:18.990> he's

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
gonna trouble Marquette's I think he's

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.180 
gonna trouble Marquette's I think he's
going<00:05:19.260> to<00:05:19.320> have<00:05:19.440> trouble<00:05:19.560> figuring<00:05:19.890> that

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
going to have trouble figuring that

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.520 
going to have trouble figuring that
early<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.880> what<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.000> mean<00:05:21.150> by<00:05:21.360> early<00:05:21.990> is<00:05:22.140> you

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
early and what I mean by early is you

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.710 
early and what I mean by early is you
know<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.800> first<00:05:23.010> three<00:05:23.250> or<00:05:23.340> four<00:05:23.520> rounds<00:05:23.910> but

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
know the first three or four rounds but

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.560 
know the first three or four rounds but
i<00:05:24.780> think<00:05:25.050> by<00:05:25.200> round<00:05:25.530> you<00:05:26.070> know<00:05:26.100> five<00:05:26.570> marquez

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
i think by round you know five marquez

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.540 
i think by round you know five marquez
will<00:05:27.810> have<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.350> know<00:05:28.380> gotten<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.070> game<00:05:29.280> plan

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
will have you know gotten a game plan

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.550 
decision maybe 115-113 116-112 somewhere
in<00:05:46.890> there<00:05:47.330> with<00:05:48.330> Marquez<00:05:48.810> coming<00:05:49.110> on<00:05:49.230> late<00:05:49.440> in

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
in there with Marquez coming on late in

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.840 
in there with Marquez coming on late in
the<00:05:49.620> fight<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:51.090> and<00:05:51.840> and<00:05:52.169> and<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.680> get<00:05:53.610> making

the fight and and and and and get making

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.520 
the fight and and and and and get making
it<00:05:54.090> close<00:05:54.270> enough<00:05:54.600> so<00:05:54.780> that<00:05:54.810> we<00:05:55.110> could<00:05:55.230> say<00:05:55.470> you

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
it close enough so that we could say you

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.200 
it close enough so that we could say you
know<00:05:55.710> if<00:05:55.830> this<00:05:55.950> was<00:05:56.100> 15<00:05:56.490> rounds<00:05:56.820> markets

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
know if this was 15 rounds markets

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.760 
know if this was 15 rounds markets
probably<00:05:57.540> would<00:05:57.660> have<00:05:57.720> won<00:05:57.840> this<00:05:58.020> fight<00:05:58.230> but<00:05:58.710> I

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
probably would have won this fight but I

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.180 
probably would have won this fight but I
don't<00:05:58.980> think<00:05:59.100> in<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.400> 12-round<00:05:59.790> limit<00:06:00.360> that

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
don't think in the 12-round limit that

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.409 
don't think in the 12-round limit that
that<00:06:02.190> Marquez<00:06:02.580> will<00:06:02.730> be<00:06:02.850> able<00:06:02.910> to<00:06:03.030> figure<00:06:03.210> out

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
that Marquez will be able to figure out

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.950 
that Marquez will be able to figure out
Floyd<00:06:03.600> style<00:06:04.020> so<00:06:04.890> that's<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:06.210> date<00:06:06.840> of

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
Floyd style so that's it the date of

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.360 
Floyd style so that's it the date of
this<00:06:07.050> fight<00:06:07.260> is<00:06:07.410> not<00:06:07.560> determined<00:06:07.860> but<00:06:08.190> it's

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
this fight is not determined but it's
