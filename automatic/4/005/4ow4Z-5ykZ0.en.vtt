00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.340
 the centenary park the theaters 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.840
 mercantile with his operas and the old 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.640
 fabric factory that became 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.680
 nest of artists are a clear sample 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.240
 that the snow has been and still is 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.310
 one of the most dynamic sectors of 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.349
 Bogotta is enough to take a look at this 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.880
 environment to realize that here the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.010
 who falls asleep ends up in 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.180
 jaws of a tiger maybe this is why 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.920
 that minerals is a neighborhood that 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.199
 change in the past that changes in the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.180
 present and that will change in the future with 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.370
 projects like the bacatÃ¡ tower that with 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.720
 its 66 floors will have to become the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.720
 tallest building in colombia 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.120
 but it has two towers one of 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.160
 fifty-five plants and one of 66 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.950
 plants collected from 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.880
 a central epicenter in the lower part of 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.309
 the one to the 4 that integrates the two towers 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.850
 We are talking about 55 and 66 plants 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.920
 height we will be around 225 250 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.000
 meters 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.910
 ah 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.780
 I am a general teacher of the work of this 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.630
 project my mission is to direct and review 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.490
 that all the activities are fulfilled 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.490
 according to the plans 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.050
 is a project that will have a 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.350
 complex an urban rissoto a mixture of 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.479
 uses that basically what you want is 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.479
 cover the services of the area 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.460
 I imagine it so very nice 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.750
 something that will give a glow to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.420
 center 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.010
 this will be something that everyone will 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.970
 to look like in some fetal time 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.970
 televised colpatria 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.320
 more than one whose 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.070
 because people watch my video more 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.070
 high vote 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.780
 the fact of being able to participate in the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.150
 development of a project 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.269
 in height 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.780
 it gives you a slightly different connotation 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.480
 a little special and makes you be a participant 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.099
 Of something 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.840
 iconographically, people perceive it 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.840
 as something much more interesting 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.390
 and the snows the manhattan of Bogota 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.010
 exaggeration probably but from 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.080
 exaggerations dreams are made 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.540
 dreams like those who had those 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.400
 almost 500 years ago they founded this neighborhood 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.530
 in the plaza de las hierbas today park 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 santander dreams like pietro 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.210
 cantina who wanted to make a Bogota 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.790
 Roman park dreams like those that 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.700
 they projected in the faenza in mexico the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.650
 metropol el mogador el olimpia y el rex 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.320
 and that today they continue projecting in the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.540
 cinemateca link to acevedo and in the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.940
 ambassador dreams that make us today 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.530
 think that in the snow the future is 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.530
 larger than the largest traces
