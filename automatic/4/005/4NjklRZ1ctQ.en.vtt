00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.361
 "What diet do doctors recommend?" 

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:14.670
 In 2013, the so-called Nutrition Update was published in Kaiser Permanente magazine for doctors. 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.039
 This is the largest managed healthcare organization in the United States 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.065
 which includes some nine million people and about 15,000 doctors who were 

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:26.763
 informed that healthy eating is best achieved by a diet of plant origin. 

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:29.601
 This was defined as a diet that supports unrefined food of plant origin, 

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:34.394
 discharging meat, dairy products, eggs as well as refined and processed products. 

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:38.701
 Too often, doctors ignore the potential benefits of quality nutrition 

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.101
 and prescribe drugs quickly instead of giving patients the opportunity 

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:46.970
 to correct the disease with healthy eating and active life. 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.835
 Therefore, doctors should consider recommending her diet to all her patients 

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:56.854
 especially those with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease 

00:00:56.854 --> 00:01:00.369
 or obesity. The main drawback is that it can work too well. 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.335
 If people are taking blood pressure medication or blood sugar, 

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:04.625
 their values ​​may fall as 

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.648
 that doctors may need to adjust their dosage, 

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:09.769
 or to exclude them altogether. 

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.419
 Despite strong evidence to support herbal diet, 

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:16.827
 nonetheless, many doctors do not emphasize the importance of herbal diet 

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.854
 as a primary treatment for chronic diseases. 

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:22.502
 This may be due to inadequate medical information - 

00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:26.636
 or lack of resources for patient education. 

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:31.068
 So they decided to change it with Kaiser. 

00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:33.553
 You want to lose weight, feel better, improve your condition, stabilize or even reverse your chronic 

00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:37.136
 illness, and thus stop taking some of the medications? If you answered yes 

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:43.370
 For any of these questions, then for you the right food based diet can be the right one 

00:01:43.378 --> 00:01:47.270
 plant origin. Side effects may include lowering cholesterol, blood pressure 

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:52.070
 and Sugar, Preventing or Reversing our No. 1 Killer, Longer Life, Healthier Weight 

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.420
 lower risk of cancer, diabetes. 

00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:56.530
 It may even slow down some types of cancer 

00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:02.040
 and to improve inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. 

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:10.940
 Kaiser employees offer tips for starting, ideas for building a diet 

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:17.530
 And it is an honor to say that they also have a good taste for the website. 

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.610
 The article ends with a familiar refrain: "Further research is needed". 

00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:27.180
 However, in this case, more research is needed to find ways 

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:34.300
 to ensure that plant nutrition becomes the new standard for both patients and staff.
