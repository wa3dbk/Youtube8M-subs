thoughts about hating on it or loving it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.490 
thoughts about hating on it or loving it
or<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.930> looks<00:00:33.960> pretty<00:00:34.170> good

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500

or not but I think it looks pretty good
I'm<00:00:35.070> still<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.670> bit<00:00:35.940> critical<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I'm still a little bit critical on the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.940 
I'm still a little bit critical on the
metal<00:00:36.690> arms<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.200> don't<00:00:37.350> think<00:00:37.530> he<00:00:37.590> should<00:00:37.620> have

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
metal arms I don't think he should have

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.680 
metal arms I don't think he should have
them<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.300> not<00:00:39.480> my<00:00:39.629> decision

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
them but you know it's not my decision

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.280 
them but you know it's not my decision
to<00:00:40.110> make<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.829> also<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.910> bottom<00:00:42.690> right

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to make and also on the bottom right

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770 
to make and also on the bottom right
corner<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.190> says<00:00:44.399> July<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.420> probably

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
corner it just says July which probably

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290 
corner it just says July which probably
means<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.710> probably<00:00:47.039> hinting<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.789> July

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
