here<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> find<00:01:49.799> rather<00:01:49.979> intriguing

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
here that I find rather intriguing

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.389 
here that I find rather intriguing

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
number one is going to be the linebacker

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
now as the scramble is completed we're

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.990 
now as the scramble is completed we're
going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.800> come<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:17.980> here<00:02:18.100> take<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> look<00:02:18.820> at

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
going to come up here take a look at

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.430 
going to come up here take a look at
Brent<00:02:19.240> Grimes<00:02:19.450> one<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.870> better<00:02:20.050> corners

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
Brent Grimes one of the better corners

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.140 
Brent Grimes one of the better corners
in<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.620> league<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.460> watch<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:22.000> he

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
in the league and just watch that he

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.840 
in the league and just watch that he
goes<00:02:22.360> from<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:23.020> curl<00:02:23.530> protection<00:02:24.220> where

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
goes from this curl protection where

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.400 
goes from this curl protection where
again<00:02:25.060> he<00:02:25.180> basically<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.570> stands<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.320> front

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
again he basically just stands in front

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.010 
again he basically just stands in front
of<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.620> receiver<00:02:26.770> as<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:28.030> receiver<00:02:28.390> runs<00:02:28.720> up

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
of the receiver as the receiver runs up

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.420 
of the receiver as the receiver runs up
which<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.350> actually<00:02:29.710> good<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.040> he's<00:02:30.190> trying

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
which is actually good that he's trying

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.270 
which is actually good that he's trying
to<00:02:30.580> get<00:02:30.670> open<00:02:30.850> but<00:02:31.360> look<00:02:31.570> at<00:02:31.720> how<00:02:31.930> grimes<00:02:32.680> only

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
to get open but look at how grimes only

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.970 
to get open but look at how grimes only
really<00:02:33.580> pays<00:02:33.820> attention<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.690> what<00:02:35.500> his

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
really pays attention to what his

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.860 
really pays attention to what his
receiver<00:02:36.550> is<00:02:36.730> doing<00:02:37.060> despite<00:02:37.450> being<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:37.780> his

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
receiver is doing despite being in his

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.620 
receiver is doing despite being in his
own<00:02:38.110> he<00:02:38.320> essentially<00:02:38.860> allows<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.580> past<00:02:39.940> to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
own he essentially allows this past to

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.110 
own he essentially allows this past to
get<00:02:40.780> caught<00:02:41.110> feet<00:02:41.560> away<00:02:41.710> from<00:02:41.890> him<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.940> has

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
get caught feet away from him that has

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.780 
get caught feet away from him that has
to<00:02:43.150> spin<00:02:43.660> around<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.860> try<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.130> make<00:02:45.370> attacker

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
to spin around to try to make attacker

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.840 
to spin around to try to make attacker
and<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.930> ends<00:02:47.170> up<00:02:47.260> getting<00:02:47.590> hit<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.220> rolling

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and that ends up getting hit and rolling

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.600 
and that ends up getting hit and rolling
kind<00:02:49.210> of<00:02:49.300> over<00:02:49.660> top<00:02:49.960> of<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:51.010> tight<00:02:51.190> end<00:02:51.370> he<00:02:51.490> was

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
kind of over top of the tight end he was

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.950

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.040 
to take to get you Geno Smith because
right<00:03:15.190> now<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.550> should<00:03:15.700> be<00:03:15.850> relatively<00:03:16.660> easy

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
right now it should be relatively easy

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.840 
right now it should be relatively easy
to<00:03:17.170> understand<00:03:17.710> how<00:03:18.130> he<00:03:18.190> would<00:03:18.460> attack<00:03:18.670> the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
to understand how he would attack the

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.790 
to understand how he would attack the
quarterbacks<00:03:19.330> launch<00:03:19.660> point<00:03:19.960> but<00:03:20.410> instead

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
quarterbacks launch point but instead

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.220 
quarterbacks launch point but instead
look<00:03:21.010> at<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.220> elongated<00:03:21.820> path<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.750> he<00:03:22.930> takes

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
look at the elongated path that he takes

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.200 
look at the elongated path that he takes
to<00:03:23.860> get<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.220> quarterback<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:24.670> mean<00:03:24.910> just<00:03:25.090> to

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
to get to the quarterback I mean just to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.940 
to get to the quarterback I mean just to
zoom<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.540> back<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:26.290> show<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.770> full

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
zoom it back to show you the full

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.920 
zoom it back to show you the full
perspective<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:27.790> actually<00:03:28.030> runs<00:03:28.570> as<00:03:28.780> if

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
perspective that you actually runs as if

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.600 
perspective that you actually runs as if
it's<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.140> wheel<00:03:29.380> route<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.310> quarterback

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
it's a wheel route to the quarterback

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.370 
it's a wheel route to the quarterback
and<00:03:30.970> then<00:03:31.060> after<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> balls<00:03:31.720> thrown<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.200> see

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
and then after the balls thrown you see

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.200 
and then after the balls thrown you see
you<00:03:32.500> puts<00:03:32.950> his<00:03:33.100> arms<00:03:33.370> out<00:03:33.520> around<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.030> tries

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
you puts his arms out around and tries

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.520 
you puts his arms out around and tries
to<00:03:34.240> pressure<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.810> quarterback<00:03:34.990> into<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
to pressure the quarterback into the
