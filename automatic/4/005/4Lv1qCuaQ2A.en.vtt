00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
as a teacher teaching about the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.619 
as a teacher teaching about the
cytoplasm<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.370> cytoskeleton<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.270> sometimes

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
cytoplasm and cytoskeleton is sometimes

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.089 
cytoplasm and cytoskeleton is sometimes
kind<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:06.990> challenging<00:00:07.529> because<00:00:07.560> it's

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
kind of challenging because it's

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.560 
kind of challenging because it's
everywhere<00:00:08.730> it's<00:00:08.880> kind<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.179> like<00:00:09.269> trying<00:00:09.450> to

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
everywhere it's kind of like trying to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.490 
everywhere it's kind of like trying to
teach<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.870> little<00:00:10.110> kid

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
teach a little kid

teach a little kid
what<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.070> air<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.610> point<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.030> say

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
what is air if you point to it and say

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.390 
what is air if you point to it and say
there<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.630> they<00:00:12.900> say<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.290> you're<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.219> air

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
there it is they say what you're the air

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.460 
there it is they say what you're the air
it's<00:00:14.670> right<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.240> see<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.599> there<00:00:15.870> where

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
it's right here see you there where

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.320 
it's right here see you there where
they've<00:00:16.890> seen<00:00:17.190> nothing<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:18.150> it's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
they've seen nothing because it's

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.779 
they've seen nothing because it's
actually<00:00:18.510> all<00:00:18.900> around<00:00:19.460> whenever<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.609> look<00:00:20.699> at

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
actually all around whenever you look at

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.179 
actually all around whenever you look at
a<00:00:20.910> diagram<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> cell<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.289> an

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
a diagram of the cell and you see an

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.500 
a diagram of the cell and you see an
arrow<00:00:23.460> pointing<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.000> what<00:00:24.240> looks<00:00:24.449> like

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
arrow pointing to what looks like

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.170 
arrow pointing to what looks like
nothingness<00:00:25.170> they're<00:00:25.949> often<00:00:26.640> typically

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
nothingness they're often typically

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.720 
nothingness they're often typically
pointing<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> cytoplasm<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
pointing at the cytoplasm so what is the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.720 
pointing at the cytoplasm so what is the
cytoplasm<00:00:30.349> technically<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> cytoplasm<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
cytoplasm technically the cytoplasm is a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.510 
cytoplasm technically the cytoplasm is a
location<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> cell<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.290> name<00:00:34.530> cytoplasm

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
location in the cell the name cytoplasm

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.869 
location in the cell the name cytoplasm
means<00:00:35.910> literally<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> cell<00:00:36.989> saito<00:00:37.920> plasmons

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
means literally the cell saito plasmons

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.360 
means literally the cell saito plasmons
gooey<00:00:39.210> liquid<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.320> means<00:00:40.590> literally<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
gooey liquid so this means literally the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.459 
gooey liquid so this means literally the
gooey<00:00:41.610> liquid<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> cell<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:43.050> people<00:00:43.350> are

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
gooey liquid of the cell when people are

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.930 
gooey liquid of the cell when people are
first<00:00:43.739> looking<00:00:43.920> through<00:00:44.219> microscopes<00:00:44.700> at

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
first looking through microscopes at

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.310 
first looking through microscopes at
cells<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.390> could<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.230> an

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
cells they could see that there is an

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
cells they could see that there is an
outside<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.980> some<00:00:47.160> sort<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:48.390> they're

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
outside of some sort and because they're

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.970 
outside of some sort and because they're
looking<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:48.899> plants<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.440> call<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
looking at plants they call that the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.770 
looking at plants they call that the
cell<00:00:50.190> wall<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.879> later<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.510> figured

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
cell wall and then later on they figured

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.240 
cell wall and then later on they figured
out<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.989> there's<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> membrane<00:00:52.559> there<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
out that there's a membrane there and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.380 
out that there's a membrane there and
then<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:53.550> saw<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.820> there's<00:00:54.030> something<00:00:54.210> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
then they saw that there's something in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.549 
then they saw that there's something in
the<00:00:54.480> middle<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.079> called<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the middle so they called that the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.770 
the middle so they called that the
nucleus<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.219> means<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.760> middle<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.270> then

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
nucleus which means the middle and then

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
nucleus which means the middle and then
everything<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.530> between<00:00:58.680> look<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.250> nothing

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
everything in between look like nothing

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
everything in between look like nothing
it<00:00:59.820> just<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.180> was<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> space<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.109> called<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it just it was a space so they called it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.429 
it just it was a space so they called it
the<00:01:01.559> gooey<00:01:01.770> liquid<00:01:02.120> that's<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.750> cell<00:01:03.960> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the gooey liquid that's of the cell so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.910 
the gooey liquid that's of the cell so
cytoplasm<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.110> location

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
cytoplasm we know now that that location

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980 
cytoplasm we know now that that location
is<00:01:08.400> actually<00:01:08.580> chock-full<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.630> other

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
is actually chock-full of other

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
is actually chock-full of other
organelles<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.310> when<00:01:11.460> most<00:01:11.610> people<00:01:11.909> talk

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
organelles so when most people talk

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.550 
organelles so when most people talk
about<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> cytoplasm<00:01:12.869> they're<00:01:13.320> still

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
about the cytoplasm they're still

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
about the cytoplasm they're still
talking<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.159> liquid<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.240> it's

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
talking about that liquid but it's

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
talking about that liquid but it's
actually<00:01:15.960> technically<00:01:16.740> according<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> some

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
actually technically according to some

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.910 
actually technically according to some
of<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> test<00:01:18.060> writers<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.570> location<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.530> beware

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
of the test writers a location so beware

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560 
of the test writers a location so beware
when<00:01:20.520> somebody's<00:01:20.850> asking<00:01:20.970> questions<00:01:21.479> about

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
when somebody's asking questions about

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.600 
when somebody's asking questions about
that<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.680> call<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.130> liquid<00:01:23.460> more

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
that so we call that liquid more

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.490 
that so we call that liquid more
properly<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> cytosol<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.080> means<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
properly the cytosol which means the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.609 
properly the cytosol which means the
solution<00:01:25.979> are<00:01:26.100> liquid<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.450> cell<00:01:27.689> what

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
solution are liquid of the cell what

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.219 
solution are liquid of the cell what
goes<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> cytosol<00:01:30.049> because<00:01:31.049> it's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
goes on in the cytosol because it's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990 
goes on in the cytosol because it's
mostly<00:01:31.470> water<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.950> allows<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> dissolve

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
mostly water it allows it to dissolve

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
mostly water it allows it to dissolve
materials<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.930> allows<00:01:34.229> them<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> easily

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
materials and allows them to easily

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.160 
materials and allows them to easily
diffuse<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.850> place<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.240> another<00:01:36.540> inside

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
diffuse from one place to another inside

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.190 
diffuse from one place to another inside
the<00:01:37.350> cell<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:38.400> also<00:01:38.610> chock-full<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.420> enzymes

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the cell it's also chock-full of enzymes

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.109 
the cell it's also chock-full of enzymes
and<00:01:40.500> proteins<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.310> even<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> ribosomes

here we see the standard cell diagram
and<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.120> see<00:02:21.570> these<00:02:22.260> little<00:02:22.590> lines<00:02:22.710> here

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and you can see these little lines here

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.600 
and you can see these little lines here
those<00:02:23.940> are<00:02:23.970> what<00:02:24.450> they<00:02:24.570> labeled<00:02:25.080> the

that's<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:31.020> cytoplasm<00:02:31.670> now<00:02:32.900> I've<00:02:33.900> always

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
that's the cytoplasm now I've always

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.630 
that's the cytoplasm now I've always
laughed<00:02:34.560> when<00:02:34.770> I've<00:02:34.890> seen<00:02:35.100> these<00:02:35.280> drawings

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
laughed when I've seen these drawings

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
laughed when I've seen these drawings
where<00:02:35.970> they<00:02:36.060> show<00:02:36.270> let's<00:02:36.630> see<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:37.020> two<00:02:37.260> three

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
where they show let's see one two three

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.950 
where they show let's see one two three
four<00:02:37.950> five<00:02:38.810> microtubules<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
four five microtubules and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.630 
four five microtubules and
microfilaments<00:02:40.200> let's<00:02:41.100> take<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> look<00:02:41.460> at<00:02:41.550> what

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
microfilaments let's take a look at what

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.060 
microfilaments let's take a look at what
it<00:02:41.730> would<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.270> look<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:42.540> if<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.410> look<00:02:43.950> at

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
it would really look like if we look at

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.670 
it would really look like if we look at
this<00:02:44.280> all<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:45.060> green<00:02:45.330> stuff<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.080> few

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
this all this green stuff is just a few

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.100 
this all this green stuff is just a few
of<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.820> microfilaments<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.780> are<00:02:48.900> within

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
of the microfilaments that are within

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.820 
of the microfilaments that are within
this<00:02:49.980> cell<00:02:50.370> are<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.760> microtubules<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.660> cell<00:02:52.620> is

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
this cell are the microtubules a cell is

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.070 
this cell are the microtubules a cell is
chock-full<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.640> them<00:02:53.790> if<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.180> could<00:02:54.360> see<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
chock-full of them if you could see the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.530 
chock-full of them if you could see the
proteins<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.770> make<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.700> cytoskeleton

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
proteins that make up the cytoskeleton

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.240

it<00:02:57.990> would<00:02:58.170> look<00:02:58.320> like<00:02:58.500> spider-man<00:02:58.950> went

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
it would look like spider-man went

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.920 
it would look like spider-man went
insane<00:02:59.730> just<00:03:00.000> started<00:03:00.300> spraying<00:03:00.570> these<00:03:00.690> webs

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
insane just started spraying these webs

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.050

also push out the membrane and this is

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.910 
also push out the membrane and this is
how<00:03:18.360> your<00:03:18.510> white<00:03:18.660> blood<00:03:18.840> cells<00:03:19.080> are<00:03:19.200> able<00:03:19.650> to
