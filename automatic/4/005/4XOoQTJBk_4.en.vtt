are<00:02:10.600> more<00:02:10.899> hidden<00:02:11.110> there's<00:02:11.650> no<00:02:11.980> you're<00:02:12.430> not

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
are more hidden there's no you're not

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.830 
are more hidden there's no you're not
that<00:02:12.840> warrior<00:02:13.840> monk<00:02:14.080> anymore

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
that warrior monk anymore

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.770 
that warrior monk anymore
normal<00:02:15.560> person<00:02:15.920> who<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.129> to<00:02:16.280> deal<00:02:16.489> with<00:02:16.780> with

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
normal person who have to deal with with

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.240 
normal person who have to deal with with
stuff<00:02:18.019> while<00:02:18.290> learning<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.860> become<00:02:19.010> an

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
stuff while learning to become an

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.479 
stuff while learning to become an
assassin<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.910> then<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.170> when<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.129> say<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.310> have

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
assassin and then so when I say I have

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.670 
assassin and then so when I say I have
we<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:22.790> 15<00:02:23.300> mission<00:02:23.599> types<00:02:23.810> what<00:02:24.140> we<00:02:24.290> do<00:02:24.440> it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
we have 15 mission types what we do it's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.240 
we have 15 mission types what we do it's
not<00:02:24.800> only<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.510> we<00:02:26.510> only<00:02:26.660> have<00:02:26.959> like<00:02:27.290> an

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
not only like we only have like an

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.860 
not only like we only have like an
assassination<00:02:29.030> for<00:02:29.269> example<00:02:29.569> that's<00:02:29.750> a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
assassination for example that's a

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.020 
assassination for example that's a
mission<00:02:30.140> type<00:02:30.349> but<00:02:31.160> we<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:31.489> play<00:02:31.730> with<00:02:31.910> that

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
mission type but we can play with that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.780 
mission type but we can play with that
mission<00:02:32.209> type<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.810> put<00:02:33.440> another<00:02:33.709> one<00:02:33.950> besides

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
mission type and put another one besides

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.330 
mission type and put another one besides
it<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:35.690> we<00:02:35.900> could<00:02:36.080> start<00:02:36.410> with<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.709> like<00:02:37.040> an

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
it so we could start with that like an

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.880 
it so we could start with that like an
escort<00:02:38.120> mission<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.930> transform<00:02:39.530> itself

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
escort mission that transform itself

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.339 
escort mission that transform itself
into<00:02:40.099> an<00:02:40.370> assassination<00:02:41.150> mission<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:41.810> with

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
into an assassination mission so with

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.830 
into an assassination mission so with
those<00:02:42.709> 15<00:02:43.160> different<00:02:43.340> types<00:02:43.790> we<00:02:44.299> can<00:02:44.599> create

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
those 15 different types we can create

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.009 
those 15 different types we can create
like<00:02:45.560> an<00:02:45.739> endless<00:02:46.120> numbers<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.150> mission<00:02:47.780> right

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
like an endless numbers of mission right

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.259 
like an endless numbers of mission right
now<00:02:48.049> roughly<00:02:48.620> were<00:02:49.040> around<00:02:49.579> 200<00:02:50.090> different

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
now roughly were around 200 different

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.750 
now roughly were around 200 different
missions<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.079> this<00:02:51.769> world<00:02:52.130> we're<00:02:52.340> creating

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
missions and this world we're creating

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.990 
missions and this world we're creating
since<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.930> sequel<00:02:54.560> we<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.819> first

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
since it's a sequel we have the first

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.170 
since it's a sequel we have the first
game<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.360> then<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:56.840> build<00:02:57.049> on<00:02:57.380> top<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:57.920> so

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
game and then we build on top of it so

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.160 
game and then we build on top of it so
everything<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.329> was<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.660> first<00:02:59.870> game<00:03:00.019> is

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
everything that was in the first game is

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.930 
everything that was in the first game is
still<00:03:00.319> in<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:01.040> then<00:03:01.190> we've<00:03:01.400> created<00:03:01.640> like

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
still in it but then we've created like

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.910 
still in it but then we've created like
new<00:03:02.209> moves<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.810> climbing<00:03:03.349> for<00:03:03.530> example

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
new moves in the climbing for example

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.309 
new moves in the climbing for example
with<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.250> addition<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.090> climb<00:03:05.420> leap<00:03:05.599> let's

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
with the addition of a climb leap let's

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.900 
with the addition of a climb leap let's
you'd<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:06.890> jump<00:03:07.250> in<00:03:07.370> there<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
you'd like jump in there and the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.839 
you'd like jump in there and the
climbing<00:03:08.329> make<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.049> faster<00:03:09.769> in<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.400> fight

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
climbing make it faster in the fight

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.940 
climbing make it faster in the fight
department<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.629> wanted<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.379> have<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> character

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
department I wanted to have a character

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.190 
department I wanted to have a character
that<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.160> really<00:03:13.579> much<00:03:14.180> more<00:03:14.390> an<00:03:14.540> assassin

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
that is really much more an assassin

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.650 
that is really much more an assassin
than<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.799> warrior<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.549> maybe<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.329> the<00:03:17.450> first

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
than a warrior that maybe in the first

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.590 
than a warrior that maybe in the first
game<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.560> character<00:03:18.980> was<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.910> that's<00:03:20.480> why

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
game the character was so that's why

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.360 
game the character was so that's why
he's<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:20.900> good<00:03:21.109> with<00:03:21.139> his<00:03:21.350> arm<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:22.130> he<00:03:22.220> can

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
he's so good with his arm so he can

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.069 
he's so good with his arm so he can
disarm<00:03:22.730> his<00:03:22.940> opponent<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.569> he<00:03:23.660> doesn't<00:03:23.930> have

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
disarm his opponent so he doesn't have

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.949 
disarm his opponent so he doesn't have

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
swords even though it'll have them it

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.220 
swords even though it'll have them it
doesn't<00:03:28.940> need<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:29.959> disarm
