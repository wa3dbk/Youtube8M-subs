you head into this corner by this truck

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.220 
you head into this corner by this truck
here<00:00:23.730> drop<00:00:24.180> down<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.660> little<00:00:24.810> bit<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.140> the

here drop down a little bit on to the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.320 
here drop down a little bit on to the
lower<00:00:25.410> level<00:00:25.740> look<00:00:26.189> directly<00:00:26.400> up<00:00:26.849> above<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
lower level look directly up above the a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
lower level look directly up above the a
bomb<00:00:27.689> site<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> sniper<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.039> line<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> up

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
bomb site use a sniper to line that up

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.650 
bomb site use a sniper to line that up
if<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.699> helps<00:00:29.939> throw<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.240> throwing<00:00:30.480> knife

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
if it helps throw that throwing knife

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
if it helps throw that throwing knife
and<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.050> gonna<00:00:31.199> land<00:00:31.380> right<00:00:32.130> next<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and that is gonna land right next to the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
and that is gonna land right next to the
bomb<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.030> hopefully<00:00:33.690> wherever<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.530> decided

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
bomb and hopefully wherever you decided

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.580 
bomb and hopefully wherever you decided
to<00:00:35.160> plant<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> bomb<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.030> we'll<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.170> taking

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
to plant the bomb and we'll be taking

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.260 
to plant the bomb and we'll be taking
out<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> enemy<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.090> going

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
out the enemy just like that going

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
out the enemy just like that going
straight<00:00:39.629> over<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.899> tree<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.739> straight

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
straight over that tree and straight

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
straight over that tree and straight
into<00:00:41.640> his<00:00:41.760> back<00:00:42.000> there<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.510> he<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.780> taken<00:00:43.170> out

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
into his back there so he is taken out

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.529 
into his back there so he is taken out
and<00:00:43.530> now<00:00:44.219> we're<00:00:44.370> gonna<00:00:44.489> jump<00:00:44.730> onto<00:00:44.940> two<00:00:45.300> more

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and now we're gonna jump onto two more

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.900 
and now we're gonna jump onto two more
spots<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> same<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.620> bomb<00:00:46.890> site<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.700> these

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
spots for the same a bomb site but these

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
spots for the same a bomb site but these
you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.899> without<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.559> perk<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.039> lets

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you can do without the perk that lets

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
you can do without the perk that lets
you<00:00:50.430> throw<00:00:50.789> throw<00:00:51.300> knives<00:00:51.510> further<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> believe

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you throw throw knives further I believe

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.990 
you throw throw knives further I believe
it's<00:00:52.530> strong-armed<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.520> corner<00:00:53.879> you're

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it's strong-armed this corner you're

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
it's strong-armed this corner you're
going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.690> by<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> pallet

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
going to you right here by the pallet

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.740 
going to you right here by the pallet
and<00:00:55.559> via<00:00:55.890> red<00:00:56.219> tank<00:00:56.460> bear<00:00:56.730> again<00:00:57.390> same<00:00:57.660> as

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and via red tank bear again same as

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.209 
and via red tank bear again same as
usual<00:00:57.899> straight<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.440> above<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> bombs<00:00:59.039> like

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
usual straight up above the bombs like

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.400 
usual straight up above the bombs like
when<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.000> suspect<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> enemy<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.960> defusing

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
when you suspect the enemy is defusing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.009 
when you suspect the enemy is defusing
throw<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.100> Faro<00:01:02.309> knife<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.629> actually

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
throw that Faro knife you can actually

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
throw that Faro knife you can actually
also<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> teammate<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> throw<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
also get a teammate to throw you to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.640 
also get a teammate to throw you to
throw<00:01:06.270> nice<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.689> you've<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> yourself<00:01:07.530> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
throw nice if you've got to yourself you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.070 
throw nice if you've got to yourself you
can<00:01:07.799> throw<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.220> every<00:01:08.909> five<00:01:09.119> seconds<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
can throw on every five seconds and it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480 
can throw on every five seconds and it
would<00:01:10.170> actually<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.619> physically<00:01:11.040> impossible

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
would actually be physically impossible

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
would actually be physically impossible
for<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.330> enemy<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> defuse<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> bomb<00:01:13.560> within

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
for the enemy to defuse the bomb within

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
for the enemy to defuse the bomb within
those<00:01:14.100> last<00:01:14.700> twenty<00:01:15.119> seconds<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> being

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
those last twenty seconds of it being

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.080 
those last twenty seconds of it being
detonated<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.100> definitely<00:01:17.790> recommend

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
detonated so I definitely recommend

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
detonated so I definitely recommend
giving<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> shot<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:20.400> we've<00:01:20.549> got

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
giving that a shot and here we've got

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.280 
giving that a shot and here we've got
the<00:01:20.729> final<00:01:21.150> spot<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> bomb<00:01:21.960> site<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the final spot for the a bomb site and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
the final spot for the a bomb site and
the<00:01:22.350> final<00:01:22.590> spot<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.070> map<00:01:23.280> plan<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the final spot for this map plan on that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
the final spot for this map plan on that
flat<00:01:24.299> side<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.229> head<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:25.770> into<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
straight up above the a bomb site throw

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
straight up above the a bomb site throw
the<00:01:33.000> throw<00:01:33.210> knife<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.840> once<00:01:34.439> again<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.950> can
