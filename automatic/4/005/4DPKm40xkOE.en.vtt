00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.660
 here we are going to talk about the brand 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:24.529
 little week surfers surfers 5 inches of 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.599
 super super super carbon onyx flesh 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.529
 carbon boards with bots not 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:34.670
 so it's really up to her 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:38.000
 nouriture with delivered with 5 fins in 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.590
 2 3 and 5 fin and four years of nine 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.600
 so full of positions 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.059
 we can either climb between 7 hours 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.090
 she breaks advanced to have some 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.980
 very handy thing or ride 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.350
 possibly remote where we can 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.640
 ride in quattro as I do and we 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.609
 can play on the size of the fins in 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.750
 from 2 from 2.3 to 2.9 to have 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.699
 something a little more eye-catching 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.059
 on the contrary if we prefer the 2 3 for 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.949
 to have more of that at the level of the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.870
 Border 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.360
 So here are beautiful boards at the level 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.370
 very light finesse very very 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.760
 light a beautiful a beautiful karen very with 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.950
 two places on the side here that allows for 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.530
 the board of being 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.619
 really very very easy to slip a 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.899
 important stretched part here so we have 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.280
 a board that goes that works great 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.539
 well 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.270
 now there is more than 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:38.679
 test small detail also so what 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 are short ss type casings with the 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.490
 spoon 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.020
 veronique what is provided with who is 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.329
 not fabulous besides nogier small 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.289
 problem me the car was not great by 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.810
 against but that's if we can recover 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.250
 a key mcs in all the others the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.319
 shorts the boardshop that go good where 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.319
 all doors two hours 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.110
 so little trick at the level of 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.210
 positioning the feet on on the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.700
 board 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.350
 here we must not hesitate to 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.320
 position on the front one foot foot 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.720
 quite advanced well position well towards 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.520
 the front and centered at the heel and 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.950
 tiptoe one step too leaning 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.290
 heels rather well in the middle of the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.810
 board because on a wave to cac40 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.240
 cm which is not too big that's it 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.740
 needs to be pretty advanced enough before 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.750
 for the board to go well to 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.460
 planning church do not want that well 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.160
 support too much talent like that but 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.260
 pretty much advanced on the board on 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.610
 relative to the KZ2 lasbordes 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.470
 this is a little bit close 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.020
 then simply at the level of the sizes 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.380
 actually available on this 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.210
