never pretended to be a rail engineer
I'm<00:01:53.119> not<00:01:53.299> one<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.599> I<00:01:53.630> don't<00:01:53.840> really<00:01:53.929> have<00:01:54.049> the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
I'm not one so I don't really have the

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.959 
I'm not one so I don't really have the
answers<00:01:54.530> on<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:55.549> bring<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.759> back<00:01:55.789> to

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
answers on that just bring it back to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.850 
answers on that just bring it back to
the<00:01:56.060> system<00:01:56.239> itself<00:01:56.659> sort<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.289> rolling<00:01:57.590> stock

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
the system itself sort the rolling stock

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.139 
the system itself sort the rolling stock
and<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.429> were<00:01:58.520> talking<00:01:58.670> about<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.119> the

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
and we were talking about that the the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.729 
and we were talking about that the the
trains<00:01:59.780> which<00:02:00.049> they're<00:02:00.200> gonna<00:02:00.259> be<00:02:00.439> using<00:02:00.649> on

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
trains which they're gonna be using on

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:03.760 
trains which they're gonna be using on
the<00:02:00.829> system<00:02:01.219> yeah<00:02:01.520> um<00:02:02.200> again<00:02:03.200> something<00:02:03.590> from

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the system yeah um again something from

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.219 
the system yeah um again something from
1955<00:02:04.579> because<00:02:05.090> interestingly<00:02:05.299> enough<00:02:05.959> this

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
1955 because interestingly enough this

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.529 
1955 because interestingly enough this
was<00:02:06.560> actually<00:02:07.459> designed<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.909> future<00:02:08.360> lane

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
was actually designed and future lane

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.130 
was actually designed and future lane
this<00:02:08.840> particular<00:02:09.170> model<00:02:09.769> okay<00:02:10.579> so<00:02:10.640> it's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
this particular model okay so it's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.130 
this particular model okay so it's
almost<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.379> genius<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.799> the<00:02:13.519> of<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.660> idea<00:02:14.989> so

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
almost the genius of the of the idea so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.479 
almost the genius of the of the idea so
about<00:02:15.319> getting<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.739> train<00:02:16.069> which<00:02:16.310> was

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
about getting at a train which was

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.220 
about getting at a train which was
designed<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.269> look<00:02:17.329> like<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.780> was<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.200> know

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
designed to look like it was you know

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.460 
designed to look like it was you know
running<00:02:18.950> around<00:02:19.100> in<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.489> year<00:02:19.579> 2050<00:02:20.329> 2056

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
running around in the year 2050 2056

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.259 
running around in the year 2050 2056
so<00:02:21.829> essentially<00:02:22.250> we've<00:02:22.400> got<00:02:22.579> 30<00:02:22.819> years<00:02:23.090> on

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
so essentially we've got 30 years on

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.599 
so essentially we've got 30 years on
that<00:02:23.299> train<00:02:23.660> before<00:02:24.049> it's<00:02:24.319> even<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.739> if

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
that train before it's even you if

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.940 
that train before it's even you if
you're<00:02:25.760> not<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:25.880> mean<00:02:26.030> yeah<00:02:26.500> let<00:02:27.500> alone<00:02:27.650> start

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
you're not I mean yeah let alone start

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.599 
you're not I mean yeah let alone start
to<00:02:28.099> look<00:02:28.220> old

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
to look old

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.729 
to look old
of<00:02:28.730> course<00:02:29.239> not<00:02:29.720> even<00:02:29.989> and<00:02:30.200> that's<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.560> net

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
and I mean obviously we can have a

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.800 
and I mean obviously we can have a
monorail<00:03:09.799> system<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.340> Oakland<00:03:10.760> because<00:03:11.389> I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
monorail system in Oakland because I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.900 
monorail system in Oakland because I
kept<00:03:11.989> like<00:03:12.560> wouldn't<00:03:13.250> let<00:03:13.340> wouldn't<00:03:13.819> allow

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
kept like wouldn't let wouldn't allow

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.430 
kept like wouldn't let wouldn't allow
you<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.060> do<00:03:14.269> they<00:03:14.419> don't<00:03:14.660> think<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:15.019> surely

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
you to do they don't think but surely

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.510 
you to do they don't think but surely
leave<00:03:15.620> electronic

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
leave electronic

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.210 
leave electronic
thus<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.360> hardware<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:18.990> in<00:03:19.140> there<00:03:19.350> hmm<00:03:19.920> so<00:03:20.160> you

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
thus the hardware is in there hmm so you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.530 
thus the hardware is in there hmm so you
just<00:03:20.460> have<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.730> take<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.090> off<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:21.240> stick

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
just have to take that off and stick

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.270 
just have to take that off and stick
your<00:03:21.660> own<00:03:21.810> figure<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.320> there<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.560> would<00:03:23.100> imagine

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
your own figure on there I would imagine

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.340 
your own figure on there I would imagine
yeah<00:03:24.110> something<00:03:25.110> that's<00:03:25.230> more

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
yeah something that's more

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.070 
yeah something that's more
representative<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:26.370> New<00:03:26.610> Zealand<00:03:26.940> yeah<00:03:27.390> while

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
representative of New Zealand yeah while
