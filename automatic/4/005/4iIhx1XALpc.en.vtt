00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.900 

the<00:00:24.390> first<00:00:24.840> thing<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.380> doing<00:00:25.829> as<00:00:26.009> always<00:00:26.669> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the first thing I'm doing as always is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.240 
the first thing I'm doing as always is
prepping<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> eye<00:00:27.750> area<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> base<00:00:28.829> for<00:00:29.130> my

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
prepping the eye area with a base for my

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
prepping the eye area with a base for my
shadows<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.970> would<00:00:30.810> usually<00:00:30.989> use<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> brush<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
shadows I would usually use a brush to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
shadows I would usually use a brush to
complete<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.520> step<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.510> using<00:00:33.870> your

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
complete this step but using your

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.530 
complete this step but using your
fingers<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.530> actually<00:00:34.920> more<00:00:35.100> effective<00:00:35.540> base

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
fingers is actually more effective base

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.329 
fingers is actually more effective base
is<00:00:36.720> quite<00:00:36.899> creamy<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> warmth<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.309> your

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
is quite creamy so the warmth of your

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.340 
is quite creamy so the warmth of your
fingers<00:00:38.850> will<00:00:39.059> help<00:00:39.239> melt<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.720> product<00:00:39.989> into

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
fingers will help melt the product into

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.290 
fingers will help melt the product into
the<00:00:40.409> skin<00:00:40.500> much<00:00:41.370> quicker<00:00:41.640> than<00:00:41.909> if<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.150> use

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the skin much quicker than if you use

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.250 
the skin much quicker than if you use
the<00:00:42.480> brush<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> base<00:00:45.210> leaves<00:00:45.659> are<00:00:45.960> slightly

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the brush the base leaves are slightly

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.500 
the brush the base leaves are slightly
tacky<00:00:46.949> finish<00:00:47.280> through<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> lids<00:00:47.790> which<00:00:48.360> I'm

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
tacky finish through the lids which I'm

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
tacky finish through the lids which I'm
not<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.900> keen<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.159> like<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.640> in

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
not really keen on so I like to go in

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
not really keen on so I like to go in
with<00:00:50.909> the<00:00:51.000> shadow<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.690> close<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.379> skin

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
with the shadow that's close to my skin

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.479 
with the shadow that's close to my skin
tone<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.549> set<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.059> base<00:00:54.330> in<00:00:54.629> place<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:56.309> could

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
tone to set that base in place you could

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.670 
tone to set that base in place you could
use<00:00:56.729> a<00:00:56.760> face<00:00:57.330> powder<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.110> step<00:00:58.409> either

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
use a face powder for this step either

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.399 
use a face powder for this step either
but<00:00:59.369> I'm<00:00:59.489> using<00:00:59.790> a<00:01:00.119> white<00:01:00.449> eyeshadow<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:01.350> over

the lid and up to the brow bone and that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.560 
the lid and up to the brow bone and that
way<00:01:04.379> it'll<00:01:04.650> develop<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.759> highlight<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.330> the

then flicking upwards that way most of
the<00:01:46.050> pigmentation<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:47.010> be<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.280> deepest<00:01:47.850> part

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the pigmentation will be in deepest part

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
the pigmentation will be in deepest part
of<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.330> crease<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.500> fading

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
of the crease and there will be a fading

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.149 
of the crease and there will be a fading
effect<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.760> point<00:01:51.350> next<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.560> taking<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
effect from that point next I'm taking a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.100 
effect from that point next I'm taking a
dark<00:01:53.549> brown<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.240> adding<00:01:54.630> some<00:01:54.870> more

definition<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.670> look<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:57.180> keeping<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
definition for this look I'm keeping the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.480 
definition for this look I'm keeping the
darkness<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> outer<00:01:58.650> third<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.340> eyes

darkness to the outer third of the eyes

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.510 
darkness to the outer third of the eyes
to<00:02:00.060> elongate<00:02:00.840> them<00:02:01.049> I'm<00:02:01.770> using<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> flatter

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
to elongate them I'm using the flatter

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520 
to elongate them I'm using the flatter
side<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.180> cotton<00:02:03.479> board<00:02:03.690> again<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
side of the cotton board again but this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.430 
side of the cotton board again but this
time<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:05.159> apply<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> shadow<00:02:05.940> only<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.750> find

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
time to apply the shadow only I find

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.320 
time to apply the shadow only I find
that<00:02:07.590> using<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> cotton<00:02:08.250> bud<00:02:08.519> ensures<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that using the cotton bud ensures the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
that using the cotton bud ensures the
color<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.750> quite<00:02:09.899> concentrated<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.670> once<00:02:11.879> I'm

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.030 
color is quite concentrated so once I'm
happy<00:02:12.269> with<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.690> placement<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.409> am<00:02:13.530> then

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
happy with the placement I am then

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.160 
happy with the placement I am then
softening<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.790> edges<00:02:14.819> with<00:02:15.330> my<00:02:15.360> finger<00:02:15.989> I'm

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
softening the edges with my finger I'm

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.830 
softening the edges with my finger I'm
using<00:02:16.830> my<00:02:17.069> baby<00:02:17.340> finger<00:02:17.849> for<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.180> step<00:02:18.510> too

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
using my baby finger for this step too

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960 
using my baby finger for this step too
because<00:02:19.379> it's<00:02:19.680> small<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.489> fits<00:02:20.700> nicely

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
because it's small and it fits nicely

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.320 
because it's small and it fits nicely
into<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.689> extra<00:02:22.080> tired<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.500> my<00:02:22.620> eye<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:24.120> want

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
into the extra tired of my eye you want

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.270 
into the extra tired of my eye you want
to<00:02:24.450> repeat<00:02:24.780> these<00:02:25.019> two<00:02:25.319> steps<00:02:25.709> again<00:02:26.069> with

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
to repeat these two steps again with

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.729 
to repeat these two steps again with
dark<00:02:26.610> brown<00:02:26.819> keep<00:02:27.659> layering<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.260> shadow<00:02:28.500> up

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
dark brown keep layering the shadow up

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.440 
dark brown keep layering the shadow up
little<00:02:29.130> by<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.520> until<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.090> are<00:02:30.209> happy

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
little by little until you are happy

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
with the level of intensity

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.050 
with the level of intensity
back<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.770> pointed<00:02:35.160> end<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.550> cottonwood

back to the pointed end the cottonwood

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.600 
back to the pointed end the cottonwood
now<00:02:36.270> I'm<00:02:36.570> dipping<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.410> very<00:02:37.650> tip<00:02:38.040> into<00:02:38.490> this

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
now I'm dipping the very tip into this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.670 
now I'm dipping the very tip into this
black<00:02:38.880> eyeshadow<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.750> I'm<00:02:39.930> starting<00:02:40.320> on<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
black eyeshadow and I'm starting on the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.980 
black eyeshadow and I'm starting on the
outer<00:02:40.830> turret<00:02:41.250> again<00:02:41.370> I'm<00:02:41.810> beginning<00:02:42.810> by

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
outer turret again I'm beginning by

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.810 
outer turret again I'm beginning by
pressing<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> black<00:02:43.800> into<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.460> upper

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
pressing the black into the upper

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.910 
pressing the black into the upper
lashline<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.540> then<00:02:46.080> once<00:02:46.320> again<00:02:46.500> I'm

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
lashline and then once again I'm

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.220 
lashline and then once again I'm
softening<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.700> shadow<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.360> an<00:02:48.690> upward

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
softening the shadow in an upward

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.590 
softening the shadow in an upward
direction<00:02:49.640> once<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> majority<00:02:51.210> of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
direction once you get the majority of

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.150

the black off your brush and into the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.520 
the black off your brush and into the
lashline<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:54.240> can<00:02:54.450> then<00:02:54.600> pull<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.080> color<00:02:55.320> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
lashline you can then pull the color of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.290 
lashline you can then pull the color of
words<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.100> achieve<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.760> gradient<00:02:57.180> effect

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
words and achieve the gradient effect

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.720 
words and achieve the gradient effect
that<00:02:57.690> way<00:02:57.960> or<00:02:58.230> if<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> find<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.610> little

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that way or if you find it a little

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.880 
that way or if you find it a little
easier<00:03:00.030> once<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.110> get<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.470> bulb<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.800> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
easier once you get the bulb of the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.950 
easier once you get the bulb of the
product<00:03:02.250> off<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.820> cotton<00:03:03.120> bud<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.780> can

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
product off of the cotton bud you can

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.960 
product off of the cotton bud you can
use<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.380> fluffy<00:03:04.800> side<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.370> diffuse<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
use that fluffy side to diffuse the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.760 
use that fluffy side to diffuse the
edges<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:09.660> decided<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.260> add<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> little

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
edges I then decided to add a little

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.430 
edges I then decided to add a little
more<00:03:11.040> brown<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.880> soften<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.690> black<00:03:12.900> even

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
more brown to soften the black even

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.770 
more brown to soften the black even

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
that both eyes look the same because I

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.680 
that both eyes look the same because I
do<00:03:40.500> one<00:03:40.920> eye<00:03:40.950> first<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.700> then<00:03:42.030> fill<00:03:42.420> them<00:03:42.540> on

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
do one eye first and then fill them on

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.260 
lashline and I need to bring the brown
across<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.680> crease<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.100> little<00:03:53.460> more<00:03:53.670> on<00:03:53.970> one

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
across the crease a little more on one

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.870 
across the crease a little more on one
