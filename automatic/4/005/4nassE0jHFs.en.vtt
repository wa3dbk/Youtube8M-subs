00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:14.049
 Welcome to the tinkering done 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:17.349
 in small cells ben spies one of the 23 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.810
 to build up the breast muscles we have 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.480
 at the bamberg bears the advantage that we 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.199
 use a bigger rally of motion 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 can have 1 brendel on and in small 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.970
 people pressed anyway to at the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.000
 normal meat also squeezes it again 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.580
 and a little bit of 20, so to speak 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.140
 a little further and in small 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.120
 It's not just fabric here, so to speak 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.180
 but comes a bit that's us 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:49.229
 have a bit more range of motion 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.229
 so the whole project is accurate 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.620
 push out 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.620
 There are now two different ways and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.300
 show template so to speak 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:11.500
 turn with the had and I think so 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.320
 partly open partly superfluous because one 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.490
 move here philipp almost 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.120
 exclusively only over l and 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.430
 speicherstadt 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.560
 It means he really has an influence 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.540
 big really needs to be smooth what she needs 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.060
 must be moved or influenced 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.130
 this is the movement over the arm 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.979
 that means we do it today 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.170
 it is equivalent to that of maine 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.900
 first of all I will do the whole thing if 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.580
 there have now and not two guys alone 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.670
 I almost always the signs 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:59.920
 that means I park the course had on 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:02:02.770
 my shoulders but position 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.120
 I owe my debt and I have to 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.540
 down 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.500
 under miserable stretching with the 1 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.870
 3 I did not speak anymore 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 that is the only thing that happens 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.130
 If I teach my hands out , that is 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.450
 I'm not in the bin I have several 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.810
 studios did not go by that 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.200
 rotate 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.400
 that means I only have this position 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.970
 must be 60 megawatts 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.500
 the outputs which also means position 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.270
 they are not directed upwards 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:45.700
 from China but that I am the shoulder 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:50.110
 I am parallel to g now piece is this 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.200
 a lot and definitely said more 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.450
 large shops have shouldered a lot 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.480
 hunger as well as in the position at 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.370
 Short work give underneath and try 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.260
 here, so to speak, always have with the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.260
 to do exercises 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.420
 you do not have to be correct 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.890
 I've been at it katrin normal 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.890
 ranges in this 55th 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:24.690
 our 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:28.959
 shot here then could either 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:33.489
 fortune to attach the knee and the 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:38.950
 know the release immediately or the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:41.769
 Work is first in the season 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:48.120
 is also firmly backward 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:51.400
 Weighing the last job 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.650
 that is when the band is short 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.159
 important that we get out a bit 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.379
 rotate 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.840
 the ending much wider never 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.830
 the long one had in the first of the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.330
 chest muscle totally larger frogs and 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.099
 we have to turn out collectors up 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.310
 does not come with 1 turn and that again 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.319
 whole typical bodybuilding more moderate 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.599
 activation of the chest muscles, of course, clearly 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.000
 We are short for I have one 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.380
 here less activation than if you 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.430
 now with meat for example the 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:26.350
 position behind will reach quite so 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.470
 stay away from sky messages stays 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.940
 as well as the banks under the hand 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:38.800
 and we try so little to get there 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:43.539
 Turn your skin in to wide and stay 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.289
 tuned around the day fit and going talk talks 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.289
 guest room
