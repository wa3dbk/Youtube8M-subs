most<00:02:23.250> about<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.580> SL<00:02:24.090> loop<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.420> I'm<00:02:24.480> sure<00:02:24.660> a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
most about the SL loop and I'm sure a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.140 
most about the SL loop and I'm sure a
lot<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.900> people<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.440> say<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.280> same<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.760> this

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
lot of people can say the same is this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.670 
lot of people can say the same is this
part<00:02:27.480> right<00:02:27.510> here<00:02:27.660> with<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> hazard<00:02:28.500> three

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
part right here with the hazard three

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.850 
part right here with the hazard three
stripes<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.550> was<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.060> clever<00:02:30.860> ploy

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
stripes that was just really clever ploy

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.400 
stripes that was just really clever ploy
that<00:02:31.890> they<00:02:32.250> did<00:02:32.460> here<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:32.910> taking<00:02:33.450> these<00:02:33.870> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
that they did here with taking these and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.810 
that they did here with taking these and
it<00:02:34.560> cause<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.010> an<00:02:35.130> SL<00:02:35.430> loop<00:02:35.550> which<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.760> don't

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
it cause it's an SL loop which I don't

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.400 
it cause it's an SL loop which I don't
know<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> history<00:02:36.180> behind<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.050> model<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:37.350> you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
know the history behind the model if you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.720 
know the history behind the model if you
guys<00:02:37.530> want<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.830> chime<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.010> leave<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> comment

guys want to chime in leave a comment

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.580 
guys want to chime in leave a comment
but<00:02:39.300> it's<00:02:39.510> called<00:02:39.690> as<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> loop<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.410> like

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
but it's called as a loop and I like

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.280 
but it's called as a loop and I like
that<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.580> parts<00:02:42.240> right<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.450> are<00:02:42.900> cut<00:02:43.140> out

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
that the parts right here are cut out

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.040 
that the parts right here are cut out
and<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:44.640> folds<00:02:44.880> up<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.330> then<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.660> creates<00:02:45.810> that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and it folds up and then it creates that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.680 
and it folds up and then it creates that
little<00:02:46.290> loop<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.520> lace<00:02:47.670> lock<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.150> in

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
little loop for the lace lock and in

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.830 
little loop for the lace lock and in
turn<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.350> leaves<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.220> impression<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.570> three

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
turn it leaves a impression of the three

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.990 
turn it leaves a impression of the three
stripes<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.770> adidas<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.490> known<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:53.970> I

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
that kind of adds a little dimension

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.390
