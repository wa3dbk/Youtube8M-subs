to<00:00:19.240> one<00:00:19.449> of<00:00:19.480> these<00:00:19.720> I<00:00:20.079> got<00:00:20.949> a<00:00:20.980> little<00:00:21.130> obsessed

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:21.249 
to one of these I got a little obsessed

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.069 
to one of these I got a little obsessed
with<00:00:21.609> mine<00:00:21.820> in<00:00:22.300> fact<00:00:22.539> I<00:00:22.689> got<00:00:22.839> a<00:00:22.900> little

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079 
with mine in fact I got a little

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.439 
with mine in fact I got a little
obsessed<00:00:23.199> with<00:00:23.529> all<00:00:23.829> my<00:00:24.070> stuff<00:00:24.400> have<00:00:25.179> you<00:00:25.269> ever

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
obsessed with all my stuff have you ever

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.519 
obsessed with all my stuff have you ever
wondered<00:00:25.839> where<00:00:25.960> all<00:00:25.989> the<00:00:26.050> stuff<00:00:26.169> we<00:00:26.380> buy

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
wondered where all the stuff we buy

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.779 
wondered where all the stuff we buy
comes<00:00:26.800> from<00:00:27.099> and<00:00:27.249> where<00:00:27.339> it<00:00:27.400> goes<00:00:27.460> when<00:00:27.759> we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
comes from and where it goes when we

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.179 
comes from and where it goes when we
throw<00:00:28.150> it<00:00:28.329> out<00:00:28.449> I<00:00:28.720> couldn't<00:00:29.589> stop<00:00:29.890> wondering

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
throw it out I couldn't stop wondering

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.609 
throw it out I couldn't stop wondering
about<00:00:30.519> that<00:00:30.819> so<00:00:31.239> I<00:00:31.269> looked<00:00:31.539> it<00:00:31.689> up<00:00:31.749> and<00:00:32.050> what

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
about that so I looked it up and what

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.890 
about that so I looked it up and what
the<00:00:32.710> textbook<00:00:33.130> said<00:00:33.520> is<00:00:33.700> that<00:00:34.210> stuff<00:00:34.510> moves

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
the textbook said is that stuff moves

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.870 
the textbook said is that stuff moves
through<00:00:35.200> a<00:00:35.260> system<00:00:35.650> from<00:00:36.160> extraction<00:00:36.640> to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
through a system from extraction to

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.150 
through a system from extraction to
production<00:00:37.300> to<00:00:38.260> distribution<00:00:38.470> to

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
production to distribution to

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.180 
production to distribution to
consumption<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.510> disposal<00:00:40.560> all<00:00:41.560> together

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
consumption to disposal all together

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.640 
consumption to disposal all together
it's<00:00:42.430> called<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.790> materials<00:00:43.270> economy<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:44.620> I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
it's called the materials economy well I

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's called the materials economy well I
looked<00:00:45.010> into<00:00:45.160> it<00:00:45.280> a<00:00:45.310> little<00:00:45.430> bit<00:00:45.580> more<00:00:45.730> in<00:00:46.120> fact

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
looked into it a little bit more in fact

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.630 
looked into it a little bit more in fact
I<00:00:46.690> spent<00:00:46.750> 10<00:00:47.320> years<00:00:47.430> traveling<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.550> world

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
I spent 10 years traveling the world

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.970 
I spent 10 years traveling the world
tracking<00:00:49.330> where<00:00:50.020> our<00:00:50.170> stuff<00:00:50.380> comes<00:00:50.620> from<00:00:50.830> and

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
tracking where our stuff comes from and

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.310 
tracking where our stuff comes from and
where<00:00:51.460> it<00:00:51.520> goes<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:52.480> know<00:00:52.630> what<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:52.810> found<00:00:53.110> out

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
where it goes you know what I found out

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.070 
where it goes you know what I found out
that<00:00:54.070> is<00:00:54.340> not<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.760> whole<00:00:54.880> story<00:00:55.090> there<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.050> a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
that is not the whole story there is a

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.770 
that is not the whole story there is a
lot<00:00:56.470> missing<00:00:57.010> from<00:00:57.160> this<00:00:57.310> explanation<00:00:57.780> for

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
lot missing from this explanation for

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.630 
lot missing from this explanation for
one<00:00:58.930> thing<00:00:59.170> this<00:00:59.710> system<00:00:59.980> looks<00:01:00.340> like<00:01:00.490> it's

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
one thing this system looks like it's

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.930 
one thing this system looks like it's
fine<00:01:00.910> no<00:01:01.600> problem<00:01:02.200> but<00:01:02.740> the<00:01:02.770> truth<00:01:03.130> is<00:01:03.370> it's<00:01:03.670> a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
fine no problem but the truth is it's a

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.600 
fine no problem but the truth is it's a
system<00:01:04.239> in<00:01:04.600> crisis<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:06.040> reason<00:01:06.400> it's<00:01:06.550> a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
system in crisis and the reason it's a

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.640 
system in crisis and the reason it's a
system<00:01:06.940> in<00:01:07.060> crisis<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.630> it's<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.900> linear<00:01:08.290> system

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
system in crisis is it's a linear system

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.130 
system in crisis is it's a linear system
and<00:01:09.040> we<00:01:09.490> live<00:01:09.640> on<00:01:09.730> a<00:01:09.790> finite<00:01:10.120> planet<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.900> you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
and we live on a finite planet and you

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.440 
and we live on a finite planet and you
cannot<00:01:11.590> run<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.890> linear<00:01:12.520> system<00:01:12.700> on<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.060> finite

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
cannot run a linear system on a finite

bumping up against limits limits we

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.160 
bumping up against limits limits we
don't<00:01:30.430> see<00:01:30.790> here<00:01:31.030> because<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.390> diagram<00:01:31.540> is

people yes people people live and work
all<00:01:42.640> along<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:43.450> system<00:01:43.659> and<00:01:44.140> some<00:01:45.040> people<00:01:45.369> in

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
all along this system and some people in

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.100 
all along this system and some people in
this<00:01:45.610> system<00:01:45.790> matter<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.299> little<00:01:46.630> more<00:01:46.930> than

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
this system matter a little more than

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.500 
this system matter a little more than
others<00:01:47.350> some<00:01:47.680> have<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.950> little<00:01:48.220> more<00:01:48.580> say<00:01:48.909> who

are<00:01:49.630> they<00:01:49.810> well<00:01:50.590> let's<00:01:50.799> start<00:01:51.040> with<00:01:51.130> the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
are they well let's start with the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.219 
are they well let's start with the
government<00:01:51.790> now<00:01:52.000> my<00:01:52.540> friends<00:01:52.900> tell<00:01:53.080> me<00:01:53.110> I

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
government now my friends tell me I

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.719 
government now my friends tell me I
should<00:01:53.440> use<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.590> tank<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.159> symbolize<00:01:54.549> the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
should use a tank to symbolize the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:55.830 
should use a tank to symbolize the
government<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.270> that's<00:01:55.360> true<00:01:55.690> in<00:01:55.810> many

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
government and that's true in many

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.719 
government and that's true in many
countries<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.680> increasingly<00:01:57.220> in<00:01:57.430> our<00:01:57.520> own

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
countries and increasingly in our own

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.120 
planets and you know what we've only got
one<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.870> my<00:03:55.049> country's<00:03:55.530> response<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.040> this

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
one so my country's response to this

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.220 
one so my country's response to this
limitation<00:03:56.549> is<00:03:56.880> simply<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.420> go<00:03:57.569> take<00:03:57.810> somebody

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
limitation is simply to go take somebody

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.400 
limitation is simply to go take somebody
else's<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.910> third<00:04:00.150> world<00:04:00.480> which

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
else's this is the third world which

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.319 
else's this is the third world which
some<00:04:01.739> would<00:04:01.920> say<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.340> another<00:04:02.790> word<00:04:02.970> for<00:04:03.000> our

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
some would say is another word for our

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.030 
some would say is another word for our
stuff<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.019> somehow<00:04:04.230> got<00:04:04.530> on<00:04:04.680> somebody

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
stuff that somehow got on somebody

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.009 
stuff that somehow got on somebody
else's<00:04:05.370> land<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:06.420> what<00:04:06.569> does<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.690> look<00:04:06.959> like

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
else's land so what does that look like

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.990 
else's land so what does that look like
the<00:04:07.560> same<00:04:07.829> thing<00:04:08.220> trashing<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.299> place<00:04:10.880> 75%<00:04:11.880> of
