00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.180
 but on the other hand, both of us should have had opportunities that we get and 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.640
 that doesn't happen 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.830
 yes and the first best ball that falls with the sixteen that professional who is in final 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.630
 but they knew nothing about it, this was still possible 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.010
 the attacks what you say and the quality difference was the size of the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.960
 world works 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.279
 the attacker was allowed to take 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.320
 nowadays you can play football there, you can not say that he belgian leg 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.410
 broken what fruit basket brought he died 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.140
 so he may not talk about that ball that hits the net klaas lodewyck water price 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.420
 to go what troubled much value had fallen 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.290
 I from the moment of monstrosity, even after a career like you, I think so 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.170
 she found living there both titles were 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.160
 we also have the chance that I myself also shoot at the intersection 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100
 with the outside 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100
 on the right many in the sixteen who dida shoot 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.850
 We only have the ball with bad legs. We give you the chance to get the right leg 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.890
 one more time in this idea a chance more myself I have to go through 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.840
 Ajax sat with so many question marks everything was going to do to link 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.110
 I think I have now passed the last two nuns of a traffic jam 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.939
 see it coming 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.869
 I enjoy this commitment because it is a place to give 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.760
 I also do not know what opportunities there were for the platform year 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.350
 suggested the this match 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.150
 this material stands 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.480
 well, it's a pity that the sector where the goalkeeper grasps how well braids fries 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.610
 he has to reserve it from both sides but it is gambling 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 just poorly shot 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.280
 but well the previous one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 yes that will be 20 out in the lurch they have not been there 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.370
 can you tell you get the fair happened free tonight but i have yes 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.750
 I also take a little longer than I will not sit 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.870
 he stood at 110 on his foot 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.910
 i won't be on his foot we just touched each other 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.600
 that is different 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.570
 only that he breaks his leg here in three places a lance olie.de 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.830
 play football 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.180
 well done 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.180
 yes yes if you want a quick view 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.560
 then I see again that where you do soccer and a language come out of the paint 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.360
 must happen after the utility left him, your mountains ran up 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.179
 happened exactly 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.619
 but I've already explained three times Sjaak Polak you have a moment that it 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.619
 hinterland 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.499
 the previous matches 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.529
 and I run into the man 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.989
 and if you do then they charge a console 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.839
 finding haacht is very handsome if you come from that 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.519
 well it is incomprehensible 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.619
 you have the camera of 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.929
 that of 3 meters in diameter 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:33.549
 and that he was not up 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.649
 mar 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:40.049
 I think we are now both feet on the ground for municipalities and to the 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.369
 turn to the 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.729
 it wasn't about anything 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.719
 good anyway 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.369
 that day a source arrived in basel warmer had much contact with him that 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:50.709
 not at all of course I had contact 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.909
 make it a death kick what is this 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.619
 then I might as well wait five minutes late 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:57.400
 to that team 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.359
 round the corner and then the finals kick in, especially what you get along with 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.899
 yes if you have animals that are not yet grandma 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.259
 had that chance 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.729
 yes and then again for the pentathlon
