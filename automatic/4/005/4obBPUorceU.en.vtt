this<00:02:54.150> one<00:02:54.420> actually<00:02:54.720> is

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.390 

it's<00:03:00.209> just<00:03:00.569> caused<00:03:00.810> too<00:03:01.170> many<00:03:01.260> problems<00:03:01.400> most

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
it's just caused too many problems most

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.620 
it's just caused too many problems most
people<00:03:02.730> don't<00:03:02.819> understand<00:03:03.270> how<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.480> works

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
people don't understand how it works

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.080 
people don't understand how it works
since<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.470> doesn't<00:03:04.890> do<00:03:05.190> exactly<00:03:05.459> what<00:03:05.910> you

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
since it doesn't do exactly what you

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.150 
since it doesn't do exactly what you
think<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.390> would<00:03:06.510> do<00:03:06.680> we're<00:03:07.680> replacing<00:03:07.890> that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
think it would do we're replacing that

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.190 
think it would do we're replacing that
with<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> sec<00:03:08.700> hold<00:03:08.849> mastery<00:03:09.450> which<00:03:09.720> we'll<00:03:10.110> be

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
with a sec hold mastery which we'll be

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.690 
with a sec hold mastery which we'll be
getting<00:03:10.410> into<00:03:10.500> more<00:03:10.680> later<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.220> believe<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
getting into more later I believe in the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.460 
getting into more later I believe in the
systems<00:03:12.090> panel<00:03:12.420> which<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.720> tomorrow<00:03:12.900> yeah

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
systems panel which is tomorrow yeah

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.150 
systems panel which is tomorrow yeah
okay<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> don't<00:03:15.180> know<00:03:15.270> what<00:03:15.420> master<00:03:15.780> does

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
okay if you don't know what master does

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.199 
okay if you don't know what master does
systems<00:03:17.160> panel<00:03:17.459> tomorrow<00:03:17.730> you'll<00:03:18.060> get<00:03:18.150> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
systems panel tomorrow you'll get a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.670 
systems panel tomorrow you'll get a
little<00:03:18.450> insight<00:03:18.780> into<00:03:18.959> how<00:03:19.380> that's<00:03:19.560> gonna

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
little insight into how that's gonna

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.280 
little insight into how that's gonna
work<00:03:19.800> but<00:03:20.130> basically<00:03:20.700> whatever<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:22.050> to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290

work but basically whatever you like to
do<00:03:22.440> mastery<00:03:23.010> makes<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.340> better<00:03:23.580> at<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.150> if

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
do mastery makes you better at it so if

we<00:03:47.010> talk<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> lot

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
we talk a lot

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.200 
we talk a lot
obviously<00:03:49.890> just<00:03:50.100> causing<00:03:50.520> problems<00:03:50.880> since<00:03:51.090> we

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
obviously just causing problems since we

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.600 
obviously just causing problems since we
implemented<00:03:51.540> mainly<00:03:52.380> because<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.860> does<00:03:53.010> very

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
implemented mainly because it does very

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.980 
implemented mainly because it does very
different<00:03:53.940> things<00:03:54.120> depending<00:03:54.540> on<00:03:54.600> your<00:03:54.780> class

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
different things depending on your class

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.740 
different things depending on your class
or<00:03:55.290> spec<00:03:55.850> casters<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:57.000> basically<00:03:57.270> does<00:03:57.510> what

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
or spec casters it basically does what

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.970 
or spec casters it basically does what
we<00:03:57.840> were<00:03:57.990> so<00:03:58.140> he<00:03:58.230> intended<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.560> do<00:03:58.770> which<00:03:58.950> is

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
we were so he intended to do which is

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.460 
we were so he intended to do which is
you<00:03:59.280> get<00:03:59.520> to<00:03:59.610> push<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.910> buttons<00:04:00.210> more<00:04:00.470> may

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
you get to push the buttons more may

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.380 
you get to push the buttons more may
late<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:02.160> much<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.670> we're<00:04:03.000> gonna<00:04:03.090> correct

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
late not so much so we're gonna correct

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.090 
late not so much so we're gonna correct
that<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.780> make<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.110> let<00:04:04.410> me<00:04:04.440> let<00:04:04.710> push<00:04:04.920> more

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
that and make it let me let push more

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.940 
that and make it let me let push more
buttons<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.170> pace<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.440> going<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.680> increase

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
buttons to so pace is going to increase

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.730 
buttons to so pace is going to increase
the<00:04:08.070> rate<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.790> gain<00:04:08.940> your<00:04:09.870> energy<00:04:10.410> rooms

the rate that you gain your energy rooms

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.370 
the rate that you gain your energy rooms
range<00:04:11.220> or<00:04:11.430> focus<00:04:11.850> back<00:04:12.060> for<00:04:12.690> all<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.900> melee

I know you all love this one to block

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.800 
I know you all love this one to block
value<00:04:26.670> goes<00:04:26.970> away<00:04:28.820> instead<00:04:29.820> blocks<00:04:30.390> are<00:04:30.690> going

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
value goes away instead blocks are going

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.360 
value goes away instead blocks are going
to<00:04:30.870> mitigate<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.230> percentage<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.920> incoming

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
the last conversation and then now you

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.960 
the last conversation and then now you
can<00:04:40.440> use<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.680> block<00:04:41.010> as<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.340> real<00:04:41.520> mitigation

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
can use this block as a real mitigation
