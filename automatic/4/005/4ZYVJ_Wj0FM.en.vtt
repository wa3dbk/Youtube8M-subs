00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:02:07.759 

I<00:01:44.450> mean<00:01:44.930> just<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.320> side-to-side<00:01:45.650> action

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:07.769 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.390 

you<00:02:08.769> can<00:02:08.920> actually<00:02:09.250> work<00:02:09.459> this<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.879> where<00:02:10.030> it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
you can actually work this to where it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.860 
you can actually work this to where it
hit<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.519> saltwater<00:02:12.819> caster<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.569> see<00:02:13.720> that

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
hit the saltwater caster you see that

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.660 
hit the saltwater caster you see that
little<00:02:14.019> bit<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.260> lead<00:02:14.500> look<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.549> I'm

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
little bit of lead look like I'm

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.990 
little bit of lead look like I'm
throwing<00:02:15.910> an<00:02:16.060> eye<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.180> there<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.849> can

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
throwing an eye on there but you can

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.369 
throwing an eye on there but you can
actually<00:02:19.090> make<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.569> slap<00:02:19.840> see<00:02:20.049> how<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.170> water

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
actually make it slap see how the water

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.500 
actually make it slap see how the water
is<00:02:20.500> really<00:02:20.650> choppy<00:02:21.040> now<00:02:21.400> I'm<00:02:21.730> working<00:02:22.030> in<00:02:22.269> fast

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
is really choppy now I'm working in fast

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.089 
is really choppy now I'm working in fast
but<00:02:22.750> it'll<00:02:22.930> actually<00:02:23.080> slap<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.709> top<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
but it'll actually slap the top of the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.289 
but it'll actually slap the top of the
water<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.549> even<00:02:24.819> though<00:02:24.910> there's<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.180> little

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
water so even though there's a little

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.390 
water so even though there's a little
bit<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.510> surface<00:02:25.930> disturbance<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.739> can<00:02:27.190> call

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
bit of surface disturbance I can call

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.080 
bit of surface disturbance I can call
those<00:02:27.580> fish<00:02:27.849> up<00:02:28.030> know<00:02:28.269> they'll<00:02:28.720> see<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.110> big

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
those fish up know they'll see that big

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
how you were telling me about your half

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.670 
how you were telling me about your half
step<00:03:00.519> in<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.840> what<00:03:01.840> half<00:03:02.019> steppin<00:03:02.410> use<00:03:02.530> is

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
step in it what half steppin use is

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440 
step in it what half steppin use is
basically<00:03:03.220> I'm<00:03:03.760> going<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.030> throw<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.239> little

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
basically I'm going to throw a little

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.259 
basically I'm going to throw a little
bit<00:03:04.690> off<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> little<00:03:06.640> bit<00:03:06.790> off<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:06.940> mark

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
bit off with a little bit off the mark

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.870 
bit off with a little bit off the mark
here<00:03:07.599> that's<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.019> little<00:03:08.260> far<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:08.799> let's<00:03:09.730> see

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
here that's a little far but let's see

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.580 
here that's a little far but let's see
if<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.060> can<00:03:10.209> make<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.480> work<00:03:10.510> still<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.440> what<00:03:11.560> a

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
if we can make it work still and what a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.229 
if we can make it work still and what a
half<00:03:11.769> steppin<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.579> I<00:03:12.609> do<00:03:12.760> kind<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.150> a

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
half steppin is is that I do kind of a

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.870 
half steppin is is that I do kind of a
half<00:03:13.450> step<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.049> then<00:03:14.859> a<00:03:15.040> long<00:03:15.280> step<00:03:15.639> this<00:03:15.819> way

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
half step and then a long step this way

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.160 
half step and then a long step this way
so<00:03:16.060> what<00:03:16.329> I'm<00:03:16.420> trying<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.720> do<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:16.900> actually

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170
