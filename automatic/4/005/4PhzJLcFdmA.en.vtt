by men I can find the places where I can

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.800 
by men I can find the places where I can
see<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.770> woman<00:01:31.100> designed<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.210> because<00:01:32.600> it

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
see that a woman designed it because it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.149 
see that a woman designed it because it
does<00:01:33.020> have<00:01:33.289> so<00:01:33.530> much<00:01:33.649> more<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:33.950> do<00:01:34.070> with
