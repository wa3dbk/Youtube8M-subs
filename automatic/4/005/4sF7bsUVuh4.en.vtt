hey<00:00:00.450> I<00:00:00.480> like<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.810> v2<00:00:01.199> lighting<00:00:01.530> effects<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.010> get<00:00:02.340> a

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hey I like a v2 lighting effects I get a

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.220 
hey I like a v2 lighting effects I get a
lot<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.639> questions<00:00:02.970> about<00:00:03.149> DMX<00:00:03.990> and

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
lot of questions about DMX and

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.320 
lot of questions about DMX and
microphone<00:00:05.160> cables<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.670> there<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> difference

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
microphone cables is there a difference

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.880 
microphone cables is there a difference
between<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.750> two<00:00:06.899> level<00:00:07.140> well<00:00:07.529> let<00:00:07.649> me<00:00:07.710> show

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
between the two level well let me show

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.100 
between the two level well let me show
you<00:00:07.950> here<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.940> what<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
you here is a what is this this is a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.589 
you here is a what is this this is a
microphone<00:00:10.500> cable<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.269> let<00:00:12.269> me<00:00:12.360> show<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.540> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
microphone cable and let me show you a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.900 
microphone cable and let me show you a
close-up<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.230> there<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.070> go<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.730> looks

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
close-up of it there you go and it looks

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.080 
close-up of it there you go and it looks
like<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.299> now<00:00:15.630> next<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.520> DMX

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
like that now next to that we have a DMX

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.910 
like that now next to that we have a DMX
cable<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.779> I'll<00:00:18.869> show<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.350> close-up<00:00:19.710> of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
cable and I'll show you that close-up of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.010 
cable and I'll show you that close-up of
that<00:00:20.029> and<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.240> tell<00:00:21.449> there's<00:00:21.720> not<00:00:21.869> really

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
that and you can tell there's not really

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.330 
that and you can tell there's not really
much<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.529> difference<00:00:22.650> between<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
much of a difference between the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.029 
much of a difference between the
microphone<00:00:23.789> cable<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.660> DMX<00:00:25.140> cable<00:00:25.529> well

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
microphone cable and the DMX cable well

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.029 
microphone cable and the DMX cable well
I<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:27.240> actually<00:00:27.750> used<00:00:28.019> microphone<00:00:28.650> cables

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
I have actually used microphone cables

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.519 
I have actually used microphone cables
to<00:00:29.279> run<00:00:29.460> DMX<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> past<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.869> I've<00:00:31.349> also

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
to run DMX in the past and I've also

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.430 
to run DMX in the past and I've also
used<00:00:31.980> DMX<00:00:32.640> cables<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> microphone<00:00:33.989> cable

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
used DMX cables for a microphone cable

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.530 
used DMX cables for a microphone cable
well<00:00:34.559> guess<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> good<00:00:36.210> thing<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
well guess what it's not a good thing to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.660 
well guess what it's not a good thing to
do<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> here's<00:00:37.440> why<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.070> main<00:00:38.280> difference

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
do and here's why the main difference

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
do and here's why the main difference
between<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.030> DMX<00:00:39.540> cable<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.260> microphone

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
between a DMX cable and a microphone

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.490 
between a DMX cable and a microphone
cable<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.280> impedance<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.899> shielding

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
cable is the impedance and the shielding

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.900 
cable is the impedance and the shielding
that<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.800> has<00:00:43.980> something<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> want<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that it has something you want to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.299 
that it has something you want to
remember<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> DMX<00:00:46.110> cable<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> balanced

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
remember is the DMX cable is a balanced

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.000 
remember is the DMX cable is a balanced
digital<00:00:47.969> cable<00:00:48.180> which<00:00:48.780> also<00:00:49.020> means<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.980> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
digital cable which also means one of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.240 
digital cable which also means one of
the<00:00:50.190> pins<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.030> cable<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:52.230> shielded<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the pins in the cable is not shielded to

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.770 
the pins in the cable is not shielded to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
when it comes to DMX cables I wanna read

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.520 
when it comes to DMX cables I wanna read
this<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.290> some<00:01:04.500> of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
up right yeah okay you'll typically find

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.789 
up right yeah okay you'll typically find
the<00:01:14.340> data<00:01:14.549> connectors<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.960> DMX<00:01:16.439> cable

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the data connectors in the DMX cable

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.210 
the data connectors in the DMX cable
pins<00:01:17.790> number<00:01:18.090> two<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.450> three<00:01:18.740> twisted<00:01:19.740> just

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
pins number two and three twisted just

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.820 
pins number two and three twisted just
like<00:01:20.400> an<00:01:20.580> Ethernet<00:01:21.240> cable<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.530> done<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
like an Ethernet cable this is done to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.679 
like an Ethernet cable this is done to
provide<00:01:23.100> common<00:01:23.640> mode<00:01:23.880> rejection<00:01:24.119> where

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
provide common mode rejection where

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.960 
provide common mode rejection where
noise<00:01:24.930> reaches<00:01:25.500> both<00:01:25.680> conductors<00:01:26.310> equally

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
noise reaches both conductors equally

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
noise reaches both conductors equally
but<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.630> opposite<00:01:28.170> phase<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.070> therefore

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
but in opposite phase and is therefore

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.969 
but in opposite phase and is therefore
canceled<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> no-brainer

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
canceled and if you are a no-brainer

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
canceled and if you are a no-brainer
like<00:01:32.280> me<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.090> no<00:01:33.360> idea<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> just

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
like me you have no idea what I just

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
like me you have no idea what I just
said<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.829> don't<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.030> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
said because I don't like it but I just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.249 
said because I don't like it but I just
said<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:37.020> bottom<00:01:37.890> line<00:01:37.920> make<00:01:38.610> life<00:01:38.850> simple<00:01:39.360> if

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
said but bottom line make life simple if

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
said but bottom line make life simple if
you're<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.009> running<00:01:41.220> DMX<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.090> your

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you're going to be running DMX for your

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.889 
you're going to be running DMX for your
DMX<00:01:42.570> lights<00:01:42.840> go<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:44.450> two<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.659> best

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
DMX lights go with two of the best
