00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
squared and what happens is it crimps

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.150

the<00:00:21.300> lashes<00:00:21.810> where<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.109> go<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.769> then

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the lashes where they go and then

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.519 
the lashes where they go and then
straight<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:24.420> actually<00:00:24.900> curls<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> lash

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
straight up this actually curls the lash

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
straight up this actually curls the lash
because<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.039> bumper<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.580> round<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.180> that's

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
because this bumper is round so that's

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.050 
because this bumper is round so that's
the<00:00:27.750> big<00:00:27.900> deal<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:29.670> gate<00:00:29.910> on

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the big deal with this and the gate on

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.999 
the big deal with this and the gate on
it's<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.359> little<00:00:30.599> bit<00:00:30.720> wider<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.380> fits<00:00:31.800> of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it's a little bit wider so it fits of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.889 
it's a little bit wider so it fits of
probably<00:00:32.850> more<00:00:33.030> people's<00:00:33.360> eyes<00:00:33.600> than<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
probably more people's eyes than the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.250 
probably more people's eyes than the
other<00:00:34.079> ones<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:35.989> built<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
other ones this was built and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830 
other ones this was built and
manufactured<00:00:38.040> by<00:00:38.280> an<00:00:38.399> Asian<00:00:38.550> company<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
manufactured by an Asian company so the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.569 
manufactured by an Asian company so the
eyes<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.230> bit<00:00:40.469> closer<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> face

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
eyes are a little bit closer to the face

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
eyes are a little bit closer to the face
and<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.420> bit<00:00:42.540> longer<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and a little bit longer so this this is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.490 
and a little bit longer so this this is
actually<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> reason<00:00:45.690> why<00:00:45.930> everybody<00:00:46.200> loves

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
actually the reason why everybody loves

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
actually the reason why everybody loves
this<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.010> curling<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.969> eyelash<00:00:48.360> curler

side and then we'll apply a quick coat
of<00:01:26.040> mascara<00:01:28.520> because<00:01:29.520> once<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.000> curl<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.420> we
