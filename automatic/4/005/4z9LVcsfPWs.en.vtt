00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 we criticize children because it brings us 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.150
 bad grades without realizing 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.919
 that there are elements by which 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.200
 It takes a lot of work to learn and put 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.090
 attention at school welcome this 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.180
 is a new capsule of neuro health to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.600
 who is 180 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.760
 [Music] 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.410
 or we recognize that many brains do not 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.270
 can learn because there are many 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.610
 factors through them what are 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.079
 the main one we know that 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.240
 children who have had trauma 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.800
 cranioencephalic or alterations to 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.599
 moment of birth may be 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.120
 involved in the migration of neurons 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.890
 that are obviously going to make the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.780
 brain does not learn properly 2 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.850
 In addition to how proteins are synthesized 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.890
 in the brain they are also used to 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.590
 communicate neurons if a child does not eat 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.530
 adequately protein the ability to 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.660
 learning falls 3 when a child or 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.670
 some adult person takes some 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.130
 antibiotic decreases the capacity of 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.230
 attention for that the next time you 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.450
 have a treatment with gentamicin 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.610
 amikacin will realize that 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.370
 learning processes decrease 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.369
 gradually 4 it is not common for children 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.680
 move away from groups and do this 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.780
 process a usual stage we should 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.520
 understand that in children the state in 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.479
 where they isolate is a state 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.190
 depressant 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.500
 you have to take it into consideration 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.410
 teachers who do not empathize and 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.750
 that naturally keep children away or 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.520
 they mark them or they say a few words 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.080
 that can be hurtful are 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.000
 fundamental so that children do not 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.830
 learn it is necessary to understand that for 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.600
 that we pay attention we should be 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.480
 empaths we must express the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.610
 teachers a very good attitude and being 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.830
 as empathetic as possible so that the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.530
 teaching-learning phenomenon is 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.660
 can achieve with greater emphasis 6o 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.580
 we recognize that we must learn in 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.410
 seven stages we must speak in another 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.540
 we must learn mathematics and what if 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.880
 we skip these periods 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.950
 critics we can learn but the degree 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.570
 of attention will diminish that's why it's 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.520
 very important to understand that if we want 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.280
 learn math the primary is the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.140
 better time but for example the analysis 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.940
 mathematical and the equations already 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.520
 high are learned from high school 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.770
 and geography you learn much better in 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.290
 high school 7 is not the same send 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.450
 a well-breakfasted child well asleep at 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.910
 the school that those who do not eat breakfast 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.920
 properly or do not eat or have passed 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.600
 an inadequate sleep stage 8 there 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.770
 children who do not see well and we do not give 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.660
 account of that 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.550
 do not listen properly these two 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.140
 associated phenomena that indicate 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.150
 clearly that children have a hard time 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.190
 work to learn and even they do not know 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.200
 they realize that the process is taking place 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.330
 many children do not know they are missing 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.830
 lenses to be able to see this properly 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.070
 clearly implies that if both 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.110
 organs, both the eye and the ear are 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.630
 well we are guaranteeing that they can 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.640
 have better care 9 not all 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.350
 children have attention deficit without 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.630
 However, we must recognize that many 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.850
 children may lose their attention to the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.010
 minor provocation possible however 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.480
 It is very important to take care that this 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.830
 they do it equally at home like the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.290
 school you have to take it with 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.630
 pediatricians, neuropsychologists 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.850
 physiologists who have the deficits of 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.250
 attention can help to make and give 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.890
 better diagnosis 10 if we do not 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.200
 we sleep properly at least 5 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.480
 to 6 hours the event is going to go undermining 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.760
 gradually because it is in the 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.890
 dream where consolidation is achieved 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.180
 of learning memories if we 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.280
 we have very well regulated this 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.290
 surely we are going to give it a better 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.840
 attention and we will be supervising 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.110
 that the brain suitably learn very 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.300
 all right 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.520
 this was a neuro health capsule here 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.590
 in health 180 leave us your comments 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.010
 Interested in reading your opinion until the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.010
 next
