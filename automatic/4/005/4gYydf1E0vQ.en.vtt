down<00:00:14.230> today<00:00:15.230> we're<00:00:15.410> going<00:00:15.500> to<00:00:15.590> be<00:00:15.710> talking

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
down today we're going to be talking

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.579 
down today we're going to be talking
about<00:00:16.129> how<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:16.759> use<00:00:17.329> a<00:00:17.359> chronograph<00:00:17.929> function

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:18.589 
about how to use a chronograph function

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.620 
about how to use a chronograph function
so<00:00:19.159> there<00:00:19.579> are<00:00:19.730> multiple<00:00:20.119> ways<00:00:20.269> to<00:00:20.329> measure

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
so there are multiple ways to measure

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.229 
so there are multiple ways to measure
time<00:00:20.989> but<00:00:21.649> what<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:21.980> one<00:00:22.339> of<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.489> easiest<00:00:22.819> is<00:00:23.210> to

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:23.239 
time but what I one of the easiest is to

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.419 
time but what I one of the easiest is to
essentially<00:00:23.839> use<00:00:24.019> a<00:00:24.169> stopwatch<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:25.099> simply

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
essentially use a stopwatch and simply

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.729 
essentially use a stopwatch and simply
put<00:00:25.640> that<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.149> what<00:00:26.329> a<00:00:26.359> chronograph<00:00:26.720> does<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:27.710> a

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
put that is what a chronograph does so a

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.469 
put that is what a chronograph does so a
chronograph<00:00:28.279> watch<00:00:28.699> is<00:00:28.970> essentially<00:00:29.449> a

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:29.479 
chronograph watch is essentially a

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.440 
chronograph watch is essentially a
mechanical<00:00:30.169> watch<00:00:30.550> and<00:00:31.550> there<00:00:32.119> are<00:00:32.239> also

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
mechanical watch and there are also

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.090 
mechanical watch and there are also
digital<00:00:33.019> chronograph<00:00:33.199> watches<00:00:33.890> that<00:00:34.010> are

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
digital chronograph watches that are

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.500 
digital chronograph watches that are
available<00:00:34.340> in<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.730> market<00:00:35.090> too<00:00:35.269> but

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
available in the market too but

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.479 
available in the market too but
traditionally<00:00:36.109> speaking<00:00:36.260> this<00:00:36.920> chronograph

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
traditionally speaking this chronograph

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.090 
traditionally speaking this chronograph
watch<00:00:37.730> is<00:00:38.090> characterized<00:00:38.929> by<00:00:39.109> additional<00:00:39.769> sub

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
watch is characterized by additional sub

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.970 
watch is characterized by additional sub
dials<00:00:40.609> on<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:40.940> main<00:00:41.539> dial<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.140> buttons<00:00:42.800> to

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
dials on the main dial and buttons to

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.400 
dials on the main dial and buttons to
start<00:00:43.429> and<00:00:43.640> stop<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.210> chronograph<00:00:44.780> or<00:00:45.079> the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
start and stop the chronograph or the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.860 
start and stop the chronograph or the
stopwatch<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:46.489> all<00:00:46.879> watches<00:00:47.449> work<00:00:47.629> a<00:00:47.749> little

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
stopwatch so all watches work a little

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.450 
stopwatch so all watches work a little
bit<00:00:48.109> differently<00:00:48.589> in<00:00:48.679> terms<00:00:48.859> of<00:00:49.190> how<00:00:49.249> you

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
bit differently in terms of how you

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.299 
bit differently in terms of how you
start<00:00:50.030> stop<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.420> reset<00:00:51.109> the<00:00:51.289> chronograph<00:00:51.410> so

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
start stop and reset the chronograph so

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.149 
start stop and reset the chronograph so
we're<00:00:52.519> gonna<00:00:52.640> look<00:00:53.329> at<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.659> Nickson<00:00:54.159> 48:20

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
we're gonna look at this Nickson 48:20

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.599 
we're gonna look at this Nickson 48:20
chrono<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:55.730> four<00:00:56.629> eight<00:00:57.109> six<00:00:57.589> all<00:00:57.949> golds<00:00:58.489> and

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
chrono a four eight six all golds and

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.130 
chrono a four eight six all golds and
use<00:00:58.789> this<00:00:58.940> as<00:00:59.120> an<00:00:59.239> example<00:00:59.629> because<00:00:59.870> it's

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
use this as an example because it's

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.549 
use this as an example because it's
really<00:01:00.319> easy<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.739> see<00:01:00.890> these<00:01:01.039> sub<00:01:01.249> dials<00:01:01.640> here

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
really easy to see these sub dials here

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.319 
really easy to see these sub dials here
so<00:01:03.559> essentially<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.460> start<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.939> clock<00:01:05.089> the

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
so essentially to start the clock the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.030 
so essentially to start the clock the
chronograph<00:01:05.780> we<00:01:05.960> hit<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:06.380> bottom<00:01:06.770> button

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
chronograph we hit this bottom button

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.789 
chronograph we hit this bottom button
here<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.259> that's<00:01:09.259> start<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:12.140> same<00:01:12.409> button

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
here so that's start and the same button

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.880 
here so that's start and the same button
will<00:01:13.159> stop<00:01:13.509> but<00:01:14.509> as<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:14.810> can<00:01:14.899> see<00:01:14.960> we've<00:01:15.619> got<00:01:15.829> a

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
will stop but as you can see we've got a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.670 
will stop but as you can see we've got a
few<00:01:16.009> different<00:01:16.460> things<00:01:16.549> happening<00:01:17.030> our<00:01:17.119> main

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
few different things happening our main

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.530 
few different things happening our main
second<00:01:18.680> hand<00:01:18.920> here<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.399> ticking<00:01:19.790> we've<00:01:20.270> got

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
second hand here is ticking we've got

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.690 
second hand here is ticking we've got
this<00:01:20.869> dial<00:01:21.229> which<00:01:21.469> actually<00:01:21.890> rotates<00:01:22.399> one

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
this dial which actually rotates one

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.090 
this dial which actually rotates one
complete<00:01:23.149> rotation<00:01:23.360> per<00:01:23.930> second<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:24.560> then

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
complete rotation per second and then

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.530 
complete rotation per second and then
the<00:01:25.219> dial<00:01:25.460> that's<00:01:25.700> located<00:01:26.000> at<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.299> three

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
the dial that's located at the three

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.149 
the dial that's located at the three
o'clock<00:01:26.630> there<00:01:27.110> is<00:01:27.259> gonna<00:01:27.439> measure<00:01:27.649> minutes

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
o'clock there is gonna measure minutes

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.459 
o'clock there is gonna measure minutes
but<00:01:28.460> we<00:01:29.299> won't<00:01:29.479> really<00:01:29.719> see<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.079> do<00:01:30.289> much

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
but we won't really see that do much

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.130 
but we won't really see that do much
because<00:01:30.680> we're<00:01:30.920> gonna<00:01:31.340> stop<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.729> right<00:01:31.939> now<00:01:32.299> so

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
because we're gonna stop it right now so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.279 
because we're gonna stop it right now so
that's<00:01:33.320> giving<00:01:34.310> us<00:01:34.430> accuracy<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.329> 1/100<00:01:36.079> of<00:01:36.170> a

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
that's giving us accuracy to 1/100 of a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.889 
that's giving us accuracy to 1/100 of a
second<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:36.829> terms<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.610> our<00:01:37.789> stopwatch<00:01:38.659> and

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
second in terms of our stopwatch and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.959 
second in terms of our stopwatch and
then<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.380> reset<00:01:39.829> in<00:01:40.039> this<00:01:40.219> case<00:01:40.430> we<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:40.820> use

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
then to reset in this case we just use

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.910 
then to reset in this case we just use
this<00:01:41.119> top<00:01:41.329> button<00:01:41.659> here<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.049> that<00:01:42.560> will<00:01:42.710> reset

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
this top button here and that will reset

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.120 
this top button here and that will reset
to<00:01:43.159> zero<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.990> very<00:01:45.649> simple<00:01:46.159> easy<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.549> use<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:48.130> I

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
to zero so very simple easy to use and I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.010 
to zero so very simple easy to use and I
can<00:01:49.250> demonstrate<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.060> same<00:01:50.270> thing<00:01:50.539> here<00:01:50.990> on

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
can demonstrate the same thing here on

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.950 
can demonstrate the same thing here on
this<00:01:51.380> say<00:01:51.649> covilhã<00:01:52.070> Torah<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:53.390> case<00:01:53.659> it's

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
this say covilhã Torah in this case it's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.120 
this say covilhã Torah in this case it's
the<00:01:54.109> upper<00:01:54.439> button<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:55.189> will<00:01:55.280> start<00:01:55.609> okay

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
the upper button that will start okay

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.999 
the upper button that will start okay
that'll<00:01:58.130> start<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:59.380> this<00:02:00.380> one<00:02:00.590> does<00:02:00.770> not<00:02:00.799> have

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009
