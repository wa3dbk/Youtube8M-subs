00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
gonna zoom in start with three sections

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.430 
gonna zoom in start with three sections
everybody<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.629> is<00:02:28.780> one<00:02:28.930> two<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.140> three

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
obviously then it just kind of your not

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:25.920 
obviously then it just kind of your not
your<00:03:24.700> hair<00:03:24.910> will<00:03:25.030> naturally<00:03:25.209> want<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.599> go<00:03:25.750> this
