00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.830
 all 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.910
 I'm here in the epic battle this mode 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 way little division and so good you 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.200
 we will make the first battle that would be the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.529
 diamond block here is block of 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.680
 diamond and the quad golem so 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.360
 well I only have they have the same 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.350
 amount of life so as not to cheat and 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.320
 Well let's get the goal and with that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.690
 about 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.079
 taxes now we continue with the block 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.590
 of love chau is very small but has 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.160
 that have a lot of strength and then attack 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:52.850
 and then come on let's fight fight 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.190
 fight pelé in honor fights ok ya 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.480
 is noticing pallia 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.670
 and they are catching fire I do not know about 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.790
 where they got that fucking fire but 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.710
 let's see it from different kind of 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.020
 angles or podiums and it seems that that with 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.790
 eto'o propóleo is very intense the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.380
 battle that will be winning the mind that 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.880
 has imposed the god wall and kirk and 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.649
 diamond that small and is winning 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.530
 the goal in four I can not believe that it is 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.759
 winning to something so big although the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.780
 diamond I think it's more resistant 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.979
 what's that but good 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.220
 If you want to make comments 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.280
 what would it be to win even if I give you the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.280
 win 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.530
 let's see who won as well as this 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.619
 time la la la la la la la la la la la 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.710
 I think we already saw and then God played 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.450
 which one is dying let's see wow 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.840
 some in question is winning the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.390
 blocking or do not know if as communicated 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.640
 tongues or mandan are long arm is it 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.930
 gaining gas the blockade by god and he 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.100
 is doing at night no no no no no 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.100
 we are going to put on the day 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.979
 we do not ask for a bit of direction so 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.780
 let's see or podiums or the block 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.850
 I was giving little blisters of happiness 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.610
 of so much punch that my 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.510
 corner or polyester has 100 and the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.090
 block when it has by God and the cast 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.620
 he is winning the block let's see 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.920
 what else to gain something that as I say is 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.569
 same in the block and the club that follows 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.019
 giving little bounces and keeps pulling 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.840
 fire wow that epic epic battle heavy 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.520
 keep it that way, keep it up, block says that you 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.410
 you are going to win let's go let's go let's go 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.470
 although we're going to keep running what 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.040
 they fight let's go here something that 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.140
 little bit uglier let's go 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.359
 although like that he's still killing folios and 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.069
 blocks and has guts if I had 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.049
 been that way I run into bigger bet 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.989
 that he sent me he threw stones but 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.000
 as the biggest block the most handsome 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.430
 because I think it's stronger because it's 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.069
 winning I think that 's it so let's see 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.120
 and it seems that he is winning the goal 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.760
 in each one was winning 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.959
 previously now the block of 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.370
 Diamond is winning a goal in 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.799
 question that I do not know why he gives the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.549
 back it seems that the 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.989
 then there was mine and by God won the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.319
 wow block 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.180
 a block greeting be here you want to give 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:21.359
 Greetings, since you won 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.609
 ok ok a greeting to if it falls because it was 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.010
 created and then it can be super strong 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.769
 I hope it grows that you grow more and 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.629
 kill everyone in the apocalypse 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.400

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.310

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.939
 battle with the block here that is super 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.349
