00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
as well but he has 87 chemistry which

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.650 
as well but he has 87 chemistry which
let<00:01:02.309> me<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:02.760> wrong<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.270> think

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
let me know if I'm wrong but I think

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.420 
let me know if I'm wrong but I think
that's<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> chemistry<00:01:04.439> weird<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:04.979> well<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that's the chemistry weird as well the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.100 
that's the chemistry weird as well the
exact<00:01:05.880> chemistry<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.820> start<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:09.510> we

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
exact chemistry so to start this off we

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
exact chemistry so to start this off we
are<00:01:10.229> attacking<00:01:10.590> pretty<00:01:11.130> well<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.330> think

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
are attacking pretty well and I think

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.899 
are attacking pretty well and I think
it's<00:01:12.600> ambrosini<00:01:13.320> yeah<00:01:13.860> Ambrosini<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> just

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
it's ambrosini yeah Ambrosini is just

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's ambrosini yeah Ambrosini is just
going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> give<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> rocket<00:01:15.990> into<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> top

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
going to give a rocket into the top

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.230 
going to give a rocket into the top
corner<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.040> net<00:01:17.250> give<00:01:17.549> us<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.759> one-nil<00:01:18.210> lead

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
corner of the net give us a one-nil lead

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.649 
corner of the net give us a one-nil lead
on<00:01:18.630> 40<00:01:19.170> minutes<00:01:20.000> Ibrahimovic<00:01:21.000> nearly<00:01:21.450> scored
