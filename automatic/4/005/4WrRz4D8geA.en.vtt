00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.700 

the<00:00:08.670> final<00:00:09.059> step<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.050> setup<00:00:10.349> is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
the final step in this setup is

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.549 
the final step in this setup is
intonation<00:00:11.690> intonation<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.960> basically<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
intonation intonation is basically a

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.000 
intonation intonation is basically a
calibration<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> string<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.870> itself<00:00:16.650> so

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
calibration of the string to itself so

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.460 
calibration of the string to itself so
that<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.310> remains<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:18.119> tune<00:00:18.510> over<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.109> entire

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
that it remains in tune over the entire

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.779 
that it remains in tune over the entire
range<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> neck

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
range of the neck

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.259 
range of the neck
and<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.630> way<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.730> by<00:00:23.730> using<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and the way you do that is by using the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.880 
and the way you do that is by using the
tuner<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:25.400> compare<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.320> frequency<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
tuner is compare the frequency of the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.120 
tuner is compare the frequency of the
tone<00:00:29.130> between<00:00:30.410> fretting<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.800> twelfth

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
tone between fretting at the twelfth

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
tone between fretting at the twelfth
fret<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> harmonic<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> twelfth

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
fret and the harmonic at the twelfth

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260 
fret and the harmonic at the twelfth
fret<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.770> if<00:00:35.070> there's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> difference<00:00:36.030> then

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
fret and if there's a difference then

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.580 
fret and if there's a difference then
you're<00:00:36.360> gonna<00:00:36.480> want<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> adjust<00:00:36.899> string

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you're gonna want to adjust string

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.700 
you're gonna want to adjust string
length<00:00:38.000> depending<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:40.140> relationship

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
length depending on the relationship

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.340 
length depending on the relationship
between<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.399> tones<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.930> fretted

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
between the two tones if the fretted

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.979 
between the two tones if the fretted
note<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.829> sharp<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:45.120> you're<00:00:45.570> gonna<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
note is sharp then you're gonna want to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
note is sharp then you're gonna want to
lengthen<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.829> string<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.520> lengthen<00:00:48.030> it

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
lengthen the string then you lengthen it

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.810 
lengthen the string then you lengthen it
just<00:00:48.390> by<00:00:48.539> simply<00:00:49.020> tightening<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.920> screw<00:00:50.280> here

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
just by simply tightening the screw here

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
just by simply tightening the screw here
to<00:00:51.090> move<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.449> saddle<00:00:51.840> back<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> fretted

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
to move the saddle back if the fretted

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
to move the saddle back if the fretted
note<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.610> instead<00:00:54.000> flat<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:55.289> you're<00:00:55.469> gonna

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
note is instead flat then you're gonna

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
note is instead flat then you're gonna
want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> shorten<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> string<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.360> case

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
want to shorten the string in that case

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200 
want to shorten the string in that case
you<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.289> loosen<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.190> screw<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:00.000> move

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
you would loosen up the screw to move

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.689 
you would loosen up the screw to move
the<00:01:00.359> saddle<00:01:00.750> forward<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.739> notice<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> do

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the saddle forward one notice if you do

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.340 
the saddle forward one notice if you do
want<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> move<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> saddle<00:01:03.870> forward<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
want to move the saddle forward you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.530 
want to move the saddle forward you
loosen<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> screw<00:01:05.060> sometimes<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.390> because

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
loosen the screw sometimes just because

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
loosen the screw sometimes just because
the<00:01:06.840> string<00:01:07.290> pressure<00:01:07.680> pulling<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.280> down

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the string pressure pulling it down

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
the string pressure pulling it down
doesn't<00:01:09.270> actually<00:01:09.420> move<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.530> always

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
doesn't actually move it so it's always

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.690 
doesn't actually move it so it's always
a<00:01:10.860> good<00:01:11.130> idea<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:12.270> give<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
a good idea to give the the back of the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.219 
a good idea to give the the back of the
screwdriver<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.420> tap<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.930> make<00:01:16.080> sure

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
screwdriver a little tap to make sure

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.370 
screwdriver a little tap to make sure
that<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.710> pushed<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.340> saddle<00:01:17.759> forward

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
that you have pushed the saddle forward

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.020 
that you have pushed the saddle forward
okay<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.680> said<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> tune

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
okay with that said we have to tune

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
okay with that said we have to tune
again<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.960> always<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.650> let's<00:01:22.830> just

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
again like we always do so let's just

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.149 
again like we always do so let's just
take<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> quick<00:01:23.400> check<00:01:24.680> we're<00:01:25.680> gonna<00:01:25.770> use<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
take a quick check we're gonna use the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
take a quick check we're gonna use the
first<00:01:26.430> string<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.970> time<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:27.780> gonna

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
first string this time and we're gonna

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.969 
first string this time and we're gonna
want<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> compare<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> fretted<00:01:29.100> note<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
want to compare the fretted note to the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
want to compare the fretted note to the
harmonic<00:01:34.280> okay<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.790> observing<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
harmonic okay so what I'm observing is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
harmonic okay so what I'm observing is
the<00:01:36.780> fretted<00:01:37.380> note<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:38.780> sharp<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.619> result

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the fretted note is sharp as a result

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
the fretted note is sharp as a result
what<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.579> need<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.390> lengthen<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
what we need to do is lengthen the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889 
what we need to do is lengthen the
string<00:01:43.920> slightly<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.970> we're<00:01:45.119> gonna<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.479> get

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
string slightly so we're gonna go get

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.830 
string slightly so we're gonna go get
the<00:01:46.049> screwdriver<00:01:47.030> tighten<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.299> screw<00:01:48.360> at

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the screwdriver tighten this screw at

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.929 
the screwdriver tighten this screw at
the<00:01:48.869> back<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> bridge<00:01:49.710> plate<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.610> move<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the back of the bridge plate to move the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.710 
the back of the bridge plate to move the
saddle<00:01:51.360> back<00:01:53.329> okay<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.570> should

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
saddle back okay and that should

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.870 
saddle back okay and that should
probably<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:56.250> check<00:01:56.520> tuning

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
probably do it and then check tuning

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.520 
probably do it and then check tuning
again<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.240> will<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> big<00:01:57.899> effect<00:01:58.079> on

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
again this will have a big effect on

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.609 
again this will have a big effect on
tuning<00:01:59.040> okay<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.350> better<00:02:01.469> but

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
tuning okay it's a little better but

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260 
tuning okay it's a little better but
there's<00:02:01.979> still<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> slight<00:02:02.490> difference<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
there's still a slight difference the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.080 
there's still a slight difference the
fretted<00:02:03.659> notes<00:02:03.840> still<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.740> hair<00:02:05.070> sharp

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.350 

retune<00:02:10.709> that's<00:02:11.709> good<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.579> just<00:02:12.819> repeat<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
retune that's good so just repeat the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.449 
retune that's good so just repeat the
