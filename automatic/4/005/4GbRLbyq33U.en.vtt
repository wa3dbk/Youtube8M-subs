00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
after I had finished my shift in my home

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.929 
after I had finished my shift in my home

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.490 
I had like only one hour to go around
the<00:02:00.060> school<00:02:00.180> look<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.750> everything<00:02:01.020> eat

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.060 
the school look at everything eat
something<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.210> rushed<00:02:03.630> directly<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
something and then I rushed directly to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.169 
something and then I rushed directly to
my<00:02:05.579> clubs<00:02:05.880> around<00:02:06.090> where<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.500> were<00:02:07.770> riding<00:02:08.670> on

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
