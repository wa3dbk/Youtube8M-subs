00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
Micro DX AFS very interesting lens think

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.869 
Micro DX AFS very interesting lens think
it's<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.989> great<00:00:57.289> idea<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.739> put<00:00:58.010> out<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.129> micro

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
it's a great idea to put out a micro

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.879 
it's a great idea to put out a micro
which<00:00:59.389> is<00:00:59.510> basically<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.899> macro<00:01:00.260> lens<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.619> close

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:00.889 
which is basically a macro lens it close

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:03.219 
which is basically a macro lens it close
focus<00:01:01.309> is<00:01:01.459> to<00:01:01.609> I<00:01:01.850> believe<00:01:02.359> it<00:01:02.510> said<00:01:02.690> 2<00:01:02.929> inches

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
focus is to I believe it said 2 inches

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.109 
focus is to I believe it said 2 inches
I'm<00:01:03.589> not<00:01:03.799> gonna<00:01:03.920> get<00:01:04.100> all<00:01:04.250> technical<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.879> read

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
I'm not gonna get all technical and read

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.970 
I'm not gonna get all technical and read
you<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.780> curves<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.500> specs<00:01:06.740> because

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
you the the curves and the specs because

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.910 
you the the curves and the specs because
nobody<00:01:07.400> I<00:01:07.780> don't<00:01:08.780> care<00:01:09.020> about<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.500> as<00:01:09.710> much

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
nobody I don't care about that as much

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.710 
nobody I don't care about that as much
and<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.250> think<00:01:10.460> most<00:01:10.670> people<00:01:10.820> don't<00:01:11.120> care<00:01:11.420> as

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
and I think most people don't care as

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.780 
and I think most people don't care as
much<00:01:11.810> they<00:01:12.590> want<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.800> know<00:01:12.890> what<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:13.280> lens<00:01:13.610> is

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
much they want to know what this lens is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.640 
much they want to know what this lens is
good<00:01:13.970> for<00:01:14.210> should<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.480> get<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.870> 40<00:01:15.230> millimeter

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
good for should I get the 40 millimeter

it's an interesting choice but let's

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.560 
it's an interesting choice but let's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.430 
winner it could be a winner the reason I
say<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.940> because<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.510> 60<00:01:47.990> millimeter

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
say that is because it's a 60 millimeter

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.560 
say that is because it's a 60 millimeter
equivalent<00:01:48.740> lens<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.550> could<00:01:49.970> be<00:01:50.150> good<00:01:50.300> for

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
testing this lens out I really think it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.920

may be the lens to go with when you're

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.800 
may be the lens to go with when you're
just<00:02:42.080> starting<00:02:42.319> out<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.920> mean<00:02:43.310> instead<00:02:43.940> of<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.360> 35

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
just starting out I mean instead of a 35

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.870 
just starting out I mean instead of a 35
mean<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.110> love<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.470> 35<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.160> think<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.459> 50<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.849> a

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
mean I love the 35 I think of 50 is a

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.120 
mean I love the 35 I think of 50 is a
great<00:02:47.299> lens<00:02:47.569> but<00:02:48.140> let's<00:02:48.349> break<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.890> down<00:02:48.920> I

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
great lens but let's break it down I

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.949 
great lens but let's break it down I
don't<00:02:49.459> think<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.730> 50<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.150> should<00:02:50.329> go<00:02:50.480> with<00:02:50.720> I

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
don't think the 50 you should go with I

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.949 
don't think the 50 you should go with I
think<00:02:51.349> it's<00:02:51.680> between<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:51.980> 35<00:02:52.549> and<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:53.000> 40<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.630> in

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
think it's between a 35 and a 40 and in

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.740 
think it's between a 35 and a 40 and in
this<00:02:54.110> case<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> 40<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.099> does<00:02:55.310> macro<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.390> 40

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
this case a 40 that does macro and a 40

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.870 
this case a 40 that does macro and a 40
that's<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.049> 2.8<00:02:57.709> it's<00:02:58.069> going<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.280> be<00:02:58.370> great<00:02:58.640> for

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
that's a 2.8 it's going to be great for

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.670 
that's a 2.8 it's going to be great for
bokeh<00:02:59.150> for<00:02:59.540> portraits<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:00.260> going<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.590> be

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
bokeh for portraits it's going to be

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.130 
bokeh for portraits it's going to be
great<00:03:01.010> for<00:03:01.220> macro<00:03:01.730> it's<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.329> more<00:03:02.599> versatile

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
great for macro it's a more versatile

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.750 
great for macro it's a more versatile
lens<00:03:03.290> now<00:03:03.799> I'm<00:03:03.890> gonna<00:03:04.040> have<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.220> hold<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.579> to

is really light we'll see I mean but
yeah<00:03:09.620> at<00:03:10.090> $279<00:03:11.090> it's<00:03:11.510> going<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.989> be<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.290> great

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
yeah at $279 it's going to be a great

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.680 
yeah at $279 it's going to be a great
starter<00:03:13.220> lens<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.549> go<00:03:13.670> with<00:03:13.849> I<00:03:14.000> can't<00:03:14.329> wait<00:03:14.510> to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.319 
starter lens to go with I can't wait to
test<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:15.079> out<00:03:15.170> on<00:03:15.379> my<00:03:15.560> D<00:03:16.069> 7000<00:03:16.819> or<00:03:16.910> maybe<00:03:17.180> I'll

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
test it out on my D 7000 or maybe I'll

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.840 
test it out on my D 7000 or maybe I'll
even<00:03:17.450> borrow<00:03:17.780> with<00:03:17.959> D<00:03:18.110> 3100<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.010> put<00:03:19.609> it<00:03:19.730> on

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
even borrow with D 3100 and put it on

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.000 
even borrow with D 3100 and put it on
that<00:03:20.060> but<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:20.630> going<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.109> be<00:03:21.380> very

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
that but it's going to be very

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.710 
that but it's going to be very
interesting<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.760> think<00:03:23.000> it's<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.209> lens<00:03:23.450> that

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
should look into and it's interesting to

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.559 
should look into and it's interesting to
see<00:03:31.010> Nikon<00:03:31.489> coming<00:03:31.849> out<00:03:31.970> with<00:03:32.090> more<00:03:32.329> of<00:03:32.480> these

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
lenses on the low end and my answer to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.670 
lenses on the low end and my answer to
that<00:03:34.459> why<00:03:35.180> they<00:03:35.420> do<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:35.780> is<00:03:35.930> because<00:03:36.530> the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
that why they do that is because the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.400 
that why they do that is because the
