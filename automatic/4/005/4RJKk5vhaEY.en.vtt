00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
stebbins earlier this year so it might

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.879 
stebbins earlier this year so it might
be<00:06:47.389> a<00:06:47.419> shootout<00:06:47.810> against<00:06:48.110> Anderson<00:06:48.589> we<00:06:48.710> just

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889 
be a shootout against Anderson we just

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:49.869 
be a shootout against Anderson we just
talked<00:06:49.099> about<00:06:49.339> how<00:06:49.460> good<00:06:49.669> they're<00:06:49.849> all

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.969 
talked about how good they're all
offenses<00:06:50.449> so<00:06:50.750> I<00:06:50.960> think<00:06:51.529> it's<00:06:51.650> going<00:06:51.710> to<00:06:51.800> be<00:06:51.889> a

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979 
offenses so I think it's going to be a

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.339 
offenses so I think it's going to be a
good<00:06:52.490> ballgame<00:06:52.759> to<00:06:53.389> come<00:06:53.659> some<00:06:53.900> my<00:06:54.050> to<00:06:54.110> play<00:06:54.319> a
