00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that I feel with distance don't really

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.410 
that I feel with distance don't really
matter<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.610> we're<00:01:05.909> getting<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> game

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

and a night you stuck in with certain

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
and a night you stuck in with certain
things<00:01:08.580> position<00:01:09.240> before<00:01:09.360> play<00:01:09.840> how<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.020> play

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

so now we getting into the small forward

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.870 
so now we getting into the small forward
position<00:01:12.500> top<00:01:13.500> five<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.400> wasn't<00:01:14.610> really

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
position top five here it wasn't really

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
position top five here it wasn't really
hard<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.240> me<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.450> come<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.900> top<00:01:16.140> file<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
hard for me to come up with a top file I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.200

had<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.040> them<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.340> some<00:01:17.520> type<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> order

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
had to get them in some type of order

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
had to get them in some type of order
that<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:18.990> kind<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.229> tricky<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.860> got

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that was kind of tricky because you got

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.440 
that was kind of tricky because you got
players<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.549> injuries<00:01:20.820> players<00:01:21.240> who

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
throw a lot of individual that we so far

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.140 
throw a lot of individual that we so far

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
so I had to kind of project a little bit

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.090 
so I had to kind of project a little bit
let<00:01:29.810> me<00:01:29.900> get<00:01:30.080> right<00:01:30.230> into<00:01:30.410> it<00:01:30.560> without<00:01:30.740> further
