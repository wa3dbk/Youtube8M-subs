00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and other disasters the problem that I'm

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
and other disasters the problem that I'm
having<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.710> head<00:01:53.070> wrap<00:01:53.280> tutorials<00:01:53.820> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
having with my head wrap tutorials is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.590 
having with my head wrap tutorials is
that<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.509> don't<00:01:55.219> there's<00:01:56.219> no<00:01:56.490> science<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.390> how<00:01:57.570> i

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that I don't there's no science to how i

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
that I don't there's no science to how i
do<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> more<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.710> an<00:01:58.799> art<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.579> do

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
do it is more of an art it's like I do

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.260 
do it is more of an art it's like I do
I'll<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:01.380> things<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> exact<00:02:02.280> same<00:02:02.490> way<00:02:02.820> but

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
I'll do things the exact same way but

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
I'll do things the exact same way but
each<00:02:03.509> time<00:02:03.540> it'll<00:02:04.049> turn<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.439> differently<00:02:05.159> and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
each time it'll turn out differently and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.980 
each time it'll turn out differently and
so<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:05.880> having<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> hard<00:02:06.450> time<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
so I'm having a hard time with that so

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.389 
so I'm having a hard time with that so
I'm<00:02:07.049> thinking<00:02:07.439> may<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.770> need<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.979> record<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I'm thinking may just need to record the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.770 
I'm thinking may just need to record the
video<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.759> let<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> watch<00:02:09.209> me<00:02:09.239> do<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> I'll

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
video and let you watch me do it I'll

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.309

try to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.809 
try to
the<00:02:10.439> best<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.799> can<00:02:11.159> and<00:02:11.340> we'll<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.609> see<00:02:11.700> what

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
