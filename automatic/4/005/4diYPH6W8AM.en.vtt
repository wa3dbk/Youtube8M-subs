00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:17.269 
as I'd like to sit down and make a more

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.380 
as I'd like to sit down and make a more
formal<00:00:17.689> video<00:00:17.960> I'm<00:00:18.619> kind<00:00:18.920> of<00:00:19.010> a<00:00:19.390> spatially

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
formal video I'm kind of a spatially

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.779 
formal video I'm kind of a spatially
challenged<00:00:20.900> for<00:00:21.349> the<00:00:21.439> moment<00:00:21.769> but<00:00:21.890> this<00:00:22.580> was

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
challenged for the moment but this was

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.009 
challenged for the moment but this was
too<00:00:22.970> good<00:00:23.089> of<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:23.269> deal<00:00:23.300> not<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:23.810> have<00:00:23.990> it

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
too good of a deal not to have it

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.230 
too good of a deal not to have it
documented<00:00:24.439> in<00:00:24.800> a<00:00:24.890> video<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:25.429> I'll<00:00:25.970> start

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
documented in a video so I'll start

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.150 
documented in a video so I'll start
skimming<00:00:26.630> through<00:00:26.660> these<00:00:26.929> here<00:00:27.230> these<00:00:27.980> first

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
skimming through these here these first

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.409 
skimming through these here these first
three<00:00:28.369> stacks<00:00:28.609> are<00:00:28.789> kind<00:00:28.939> of<00:00:29.000> just<00:00:29.150> like<00:00:29.240> your

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
three stacks are kind of just like your

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.069 
three stacks are kind of just like your
generic<00:00:29.859> ps2<00:00:30.859> titles<00:00:31.220> or<00:00:31.640> filler<00:00:32.480> titles<00:00:32.899> I

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
generic ps2 titles or filler titles I

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.160 
generic ps2 titles or filler titles I
guess<00:00:33.469> is<00:00:33.680> what<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:34.129> would<00:00:34.219> consider<00:00:34.700> them<00:00:34.910> but

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
guess is what I would consider them but

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.270 
guess is what I would consider them but
for<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.260> most<00:00:36.289> part<00:00:36.620> they're<00:00:36.710> all<00:00:36.739> in<00:00:37.039> pretty

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
for the most part they're all in pretty

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.810 
for the most part they're all in pretty
nice<00:00:37.550> shape<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.329> guy<00:00:38.449> I<00:00:38.480> got<00:00:38.780> him<00:00:38.930> off<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.079> was

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
nice shape the guy I got him off of was

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.760 
nice shape the guy I got him off of was
or<00:00:40.820> I<00:00:40.879> guess<00:00:41.180> used<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.510> be<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.840> collector<00:00:42.469> anyway

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
or I guess used to be a collector anyway

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.380 
or I guess used to be a collector anyway
I<00:00:42.949> don't<00:00:43.039> know<00:00:43.190> if<00:00:43.280> he<00:00:43.340> just<00:00:43.370> lost<00:00:43.699> interest<00:00:44.120> or

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
I don't know if he just lost interest or

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.810 
I don't know if he just lost interest or
moved<00:00:44.600> on<00:00:44.719> or<00:00:44.989> what<00:00:45.140> but<00:00:45.320> he<00:00:45.559> had<00:00:46.309> some<00:00:46.489> pretty

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
moved on or what but he had some pretty

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.240 
moved on or what but he had some pretty
quality<00:00:47.660> stuff<00:00:47.899> here<00:00:48.170> I'm<00:00:48.710> not<00:00:48.920> sure<00:00:49.070> he<00:00:49.160> knew

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
quality stuff here I'm not sure he knew

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.090 
quality stuff here I'm not sure he knew
exactly<00:00:49.520> what<00:00:49.820> he<00:00:49.940> had<00:00:50.410> there<00:00:51.410> was<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.559> few<00:00:51.980> that

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
exactly what he had there was a few that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.349 
exactly what he had there was a few that
I<00:00:52.129> could<00:00:52.309> tell<00:00:52.460> he<00:00:52.579> got<00:00:52.730> from<00:00:52.910> like<00:00:53.000> rental

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
I could tell he got from like rental

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.209 
I could tell he got from like rental
stores<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:53.780> stuff<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:54.170> small<00:00:54.769> stack<00:00:54.980> of<00:00:55.160> them

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
stores and stuff a small stack of them

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.060 
stores and stuff a small stack of them
had<00:00:55.539> family<00:00:56.539> video<00:00:56.780> stickers<00:00:57.199> like<00:00:57.379> laminated

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
had family video stickers like laminated

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.310 
had family video stickers like laminated
to<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.280> top<00:00:58.429> of<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.640> disks<00:00:59.000> but<00:00:59.269> for<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.140> most

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
to the top of the disks but for the most

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.849 
to the top of the disks but for the most
part<00:01:00.559> they're<00:01:00.800> in<00:01:01.640> pretty<00:01:02.059> nice<00:01:02.210> shape<00:01:02.239> and

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
part they're in pretty nice shape and

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.710 
part they're in pretty nice shape and
then<00:01:03.859> this<00:01:04.220> four<00:01:04.519> stack<00:01:04.820> up<00:01:05.030> here<00:01:05.269> I<00:01:05.299> guess<00:01:05.570> is

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
then this four stack up here I guess is

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.570 
then this four stack up here I guess is
kind<00:01:05.900> of<00:01:05.930> like<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.259> little<00:01:06.950> more<00:01:07.100> desirable

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
kind of like a little more desirable

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.719 
kind of like a little more desirable
titles<00:01:08.000> but<00:01:08.470> I'd<00:01:09.470> still<00:01:09.710> consider<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:10.250> most

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
titles but I'd still consider this most

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.300 
titles but I'd still consider this most
of<00:01:10.850> this<00:01:10.939> anyway<00:01:11.180> filler<00:01:11.479> stuff<00:01:11.979> some<00:01:12.979> decent

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310
