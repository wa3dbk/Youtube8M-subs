so there's part number one just
immediately<00:01:37.439> there

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.210

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
couch and you can come upstairs and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.000 
couch and you can come upstairs and
there's<00:02:05.270> usually<00:02:05.420> there's<00:02:06.050> one<00:02:06.260> right<00:02:06.680> in<00:02:06.920> the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
there's usually there's one right in the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.160 
there's usually there's one right in the
middle<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.460> TV<00:02:07.850> area<00:02:08.119> here<00:02:08.570> almost<00:02:08.690> always

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
middle of the TV area here almost always

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.980 
middle of the TV area here almost always
I<00:02:12.490> think<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.670> one<00:02:13.910> does<00:02:14.210> not<00:02:14.420> change<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.930> think

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
I think that one does not change I think

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.310 
I think that one does not change I think
that<00:02:15.200> always<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:15.770> there<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:20.330> then<00:02:20.870> finally

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
that always is there and then finally

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.210 
that always is there and then finally
you<00:02:21.950> know<00:02:22.040> right<00:02:22.310> around<00:02:22.520> powers<00:02:23.000> typically

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
you know right around powers typically

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.410 
you know right around powers typically

mystery box but it is single kill

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.430 
mystery box but it is single kill
explosive<00:02:51.790> type<00:02:52.790> gun<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.959> achievement<00:02:54.350> is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
explosive type gun so the achievement is

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.560
