00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
eyes by the brightness layer I then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.630 
eyes by the brightness layer I then
inverted<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.960> mask<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.620> painted<00:00:56.340> over<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640

area<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:59.250> remove<00:00:59.430> excessive<00:01:00.059> redness<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.960> used

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
area to remove excessive redness I used

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.709 
area to remove excessive redness I used
hue/saturation<00:01:02.520> layer<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> saturation

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
hue/saturation layer with the saturation

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:13.660 
hue/saturation layer with the saturation
in<00:01:04.140> rats<00:01:04.500> very<00:01:04.979> low

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.719 

I<00:01:17.439> then<00:01:18.439> used<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.830> hilum<00:01:19.130> brush<00:01:19.369> tool<00:01:19.700> to

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
I then used the hilum brush tool to

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:33.940 
I then used the hilum brush tool to
remove<00:01:20.150> some<00:01:20.659> distracting<00:01:21.259> elements<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:32.950> soon

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
remove some distracting elements I soon

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.120 
remove some distracting elements I soon
realized<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:35.000> want<00:01:35.750> even<00:01:36.170> more<00:01:36.200> snap<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:36.979> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
realized I want even more snap in the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.179 
realized I want even more snap in the
iris<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.570> there<00:01:38.869> goes<00:01:39.200> another<00:01:39.229> brightness

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
iris so there goes another brightness

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:49.120 
iris so there goes another brightness
layer<00:01:46.179> and<00:01:47.179> let<00:01:47.330> us<00:01:47.479> get<00:01:47.690> very<00:01:48.050> blue<00:01:48.350> eyes<00:01:48.560> but

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
layer and let us get very blue eyes but

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.059 
layer and let us get very blue eyes but
in<00:01:49.399> my<00:01:49.580> bluest<00:01:49.880> portray<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.750> wanted<00:01:51.500> them<00:01:51.710> even

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
in my bluest portray I wanted them even

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.130 
in my bluest portray I wanted them even
more<00:01:52.280> blue<00:01:52.539> so<00:01:53.539> I<00:01:53.750> used<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.319> solid<00:01:54.590> color<00:01:55.159> layer

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
more blue so I used a solid color layer

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:31.130 
more blue so I used a solid color layer
with<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.289> layer<00:01:57.440> mask<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:58.009> it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.030 

to<00:02:32.140> add<00:02:32.319> more<00:02:32.590> contrast<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.489> deepness<00:02:34.090> I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
to add more contrast and deepness I

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.819 
to add more contrast and deepness I
decided<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:37.090> darken<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.690> lips<00:02:37.900> using<00:02:38.709> the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
decided to darken the lips using the

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:46.059 
decided to darken the lips using the
curves<00:02:39.099> adjustment<00:02:39.430> layer

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.040 

and<00:02:47.069> finally<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.790> add<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.209> Blues<00:02:48.480> looked<00:02:48.870> at

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
and finally to add the Blues looked at

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.020 
and finally to add the Blues looked at
the<00:02:49.140> picture<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.800> used<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.910> solid<00:02:51.390> color<00:02:51.780> layer

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
the picture I used a solid color layer

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.690 
the picture I used a solid color layer
on<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.090> color<00:02:54.959> blending<00:02:55.350> mode<00:02:55.590> at<00:02:55.920> about<00:02:56.280> 20

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
on a color blending mode at about 20

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.650 
on a color blending mode at about 20
percent<00:02:57.090> opacity<00:02:59.060> and<00:03:00.060> here's<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.450> final

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
percent opacity and here's the final

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.700 
percent opacity and here's the final
result<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.470> hope<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.220> enjoy<00:03:02.550> it
