one of the many consoles that has been
released<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.770> and<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.580> probably<00:00:29.880> avoided<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
released on and you probably avoided the

GBA<00:00:30.810> version<00:00:30.900> fearing<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> worst<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.160> mean<00:00:32.699> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
GBA version fearing the worst I mean the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.420 
GBA version fearing the worst I mean the
original<00:00:33.449> game<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.780> nothing<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:34.320> 3d<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
original game is nothing but 3d and the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.139 
original game is nothing but 3d and the
GBA<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.969> notoriously<00:00:36.780> bad<00:00:37.079> at<00:00:37.350> 3d<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> seems

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
GBA is notoriously bad at 3d so it seems

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.419 
GBA is notoriously bad at 3d so it seems
like<00:00:39.359> a<00:00:39.390> bad<00:00:39.629> match<00:00:39.929> well<00:00:40.469> usually<00:00:41.069> you're

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
like a bad match well usually you're

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.910 
like a bad match well usually you're
right<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.420> time<00:00:42.600> you're<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.769> only

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
right but this time you're not not only

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.520 
right but this time you're not not only
is<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.280> game<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.760> 3d<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.659> it<00:00:45.809> also<00:00:45.960> has<00:00:46.229> no

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
is the game in 3d but it also has no

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.009 
is the game in 3d but it also has no
analog<00:00:47.010> control<00:00:47.429> and<00:00:47.699> it<00:00:48.089> still<00:00:48.479> manages<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
analog control and it still manages to

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.259 
analog control and it still manages to
be<00:00:49.289> fun<00:00:49.530> when<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.249> first<00:00:50.579> heard<00:00:50.729> the<00:00:50.879> game<00:00:51.059> was

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
be fun when I first heard the game was

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.180 
be fun when I first heard the game was
going<00:00:51.479> to<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.659> on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> GBA<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.469> hope<00:00:52.859> that<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
going to be on the GBA I hope that it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.919 
going to be on the GBA I hope that it
was<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.579> an<00:00:53.670> isometric<00:00:54.449> game<00:00:54.629> more

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
was going to be an isometric game more

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.410 
was going to be an isometric game more
like<00:00:55.109> marble<00:00:55.589> madness<00:00:55.769> than<00:00:56.190> monkey<00:00:56.460> ball<00:00:56.639> but

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
like marble madness than monkey ball but

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
like marble madness than monkey ball but
it's<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.749> in<00:00:58.049> fact<00:00:58.409> it's<00:00:58.679> a<00:00:58.799> very<00:00:59.039> faithful

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it's not in fact it's a very faithful

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.119 
it's not in fact it's a very faithful
port<00:00:59.909> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> original<00:01:00.690> game<00:01:01.129> everything

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
port of the original game everything

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
port of the original game everything
here<00:01:02.339> is<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.579> full<00:01:02.789> 3d<00:01:02.819> and<00:01:03.449> honestly<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.140> think

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
here is in full 3d and honestly I think

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
here is in full 3d and honestly I think
it's<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:04.739> best<00:01:04.920> looking<00:01:05.129> 3d<00:01:05.519> game<00:01:05.820> I've<00:01:06.030> seen

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's the best looking 3d game I've seen

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.170 
it's the best looking 3d game I've seen
on<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> GBA<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.650> fast<00:01:08.010> there's<00:01:08.460> no<00:01:08.670> pop<00:01:08.940> in

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
on the GBA it's fast there's no pop in

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.090 
on the GBA it's fast there's no pop in
and<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> camera<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.020> always<00:01:10.440> behind<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.890> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and the camera is always behind you so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
and the camera is always behind you so
you<00:01:11.130> never<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.730> worry<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
you never have to worry about it the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.720 
you never have to worry about it the
other<00:01:13.290> big<00:01:13.470> reservation<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.190> I<00:01:14.250> had<00:01:14.490> was

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
other big reservation that I had was

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.790 
other big reservation that I had was
that<00:01:14.850> moving<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> consoles<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.440> DBA

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
that moving from the consoles to the DBA

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.920 
that moving from the consoles to the DBA
would<00:01:17.190> mean<00:01:17.370> losing<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.940> precise<00:01:18.360> analog

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
would mean losing the precise analog

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740 
would mean losing the precise analog
controls<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.620> original<00:01:20.100> well<00:01:20.940> I<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.570> half

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
controls of the original well I was half

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.540 
controls of the original well I was half
right<00:01:21.870> on<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.230> one<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:23.010> controls<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.490> not

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
right on this one the controls are not

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.640 
right on this one the controls are not
perfect<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> bit<00:01:25.170> harder<00:01:25.530> at

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
perfect and it can be a bit harder at

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
perfect and it can be a bit harder at
time<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.160> some<00:01:26.400> movements<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.390> overall<00:01:27.690> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
time to do some movements but overall I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.780 
time to do some movements but overall I
think<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.320> controls<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.770> very<00:01:28.800> solid<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
think the controls are very solid and I

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
think the controls are very solid and I
almost<00:01:29.940> never<00:01:30.330> die<00:01:30.660> because<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.050> them<00:01:31.260> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
almost never die because of them the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
almost never die because of them the
only<00:01:32.160> real<00:01:32.310> drawback<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.300> monkey

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
only real drawback is that in monkey

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
only real drawback is that in monkey
ball<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.930> control<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.440> level<00:01:34.620> not<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> ball

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
ball you control the level not the ball

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
ball you control the level not the ball
and<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.330> be<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.720> bit<00:01:36.870> jumpy<00:01:37.230> at

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and so it can be a little bit jumpy at

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.100 
and so it can be a little bit jumpy at
times<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.520> GBA<00:01:38.850> version<00:01:38.940> has<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.930> modes

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
times the GBA version has all the modes

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.440 
times the GBA version has all the modes

of<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.690> time<00:02:00.900> I<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.290> talk<00:02:01.560> about<00:02:01.740> mini

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
of the time I don't talk about mini

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
of the time I don't talk about mini
games<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.610> these<00:02:02.760> are<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:02.970> pretty<00:02:03.300> substantial

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
games but these are a pretty substantial

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
games but these are a pretty substantial
part<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.350> game<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.770> unfortunately<00:02:05.700> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
part of the game and unfortunately I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.790 
part of the game and unfortunately I
didn't<00:02:06.270> find<00:02:06.479> them<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.780> nearly<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.440> fun<00:02:07.650> as

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
didn't find them to be nearly as fun as

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.740 
didn't find them to be nearly as fun as
the<00:02:07.890> console<00:02:08.310> versions<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.209> were<00:02:09.269> ok<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the console versions but they were ok I

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.140 
the console versions but they were ok I
guess<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:11.069> sound<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> game<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.879> also

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
guess the sound in the game is also

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.059 
guess the sound in the game is also
excellent<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.989> even<00:02:13.379> includes<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.860> voice

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
excellent and even includes the voice

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.129 
excellent and even includes the voice
clips<00:02:14.400> from<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> console<00:02:15.120> versions<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:16.139 
clips from the console versions the

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.869 
clips from the console versions the
music<00:02:16.530> sounds<00:02:16.769> great<00:02:17.159> but<00:02:17.400> there<00:02:17.579> isn't<00:02:17.849> much

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
music sounds great but there isn't much

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.690 
music sounds great but there isn't much
of<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.329> so<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.840> gets<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.109> little

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
of it so it gets a little

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.059 
of it so it gets a little
after<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:19.910> while<00:02:20.120> if<00:02:21.050> there's<00:02:21.260> one<00:02:21.530> reservation

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
after a while if there's one reservation

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.920 
after a while if there's one reservation
