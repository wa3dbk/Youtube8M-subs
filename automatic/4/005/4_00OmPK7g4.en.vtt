00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
for instance I am in a habit of getting

for instance I am in a habit of getting
out<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.100> bed<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.520> beelining<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.420> straight<00:01:57.750> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
going to interrupt that habit break the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.380 
going to interrupt that habit break the
pattern<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.679> I'm<00:02:11.069> gonna<00:02:11.190> start<00:02:11.580> my<00:02:11.730> day<00:02:11.790> with

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
pattern and I'm gonna start my day with

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.610 
pattern and I'm gonna start my day with
the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.009 
the
lemon<00:02:13.129> water<00:02:13.340> now<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.299> not<00:02:14.599> tell<00:02:14.870> myself

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
lemon water now I do not tell myself

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.020 
lemon water now I do not tell myself
that<00:02:15.349> I'm<00:02:15.440> not<00:02:15.470> allowed<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.799> have<00:02:16.040> coffee<00:02:16.310> what

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
that I'm not allowed to have coffee what

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.940 
that I'm not allowed to have coffee what
I<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.450> say<00:02:17.659> you<00:02:17.989> can<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.290> coffee<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.830> can

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
I do is say you can have coffee you can

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.440 
I do is say you can have coffee you can
have<00:02:19.129> it<00:02:19.280> whenever<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.670> want<00:02:19.790> throughout<00:02:20.299> the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
have it whenever you want throughout the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.509 
have it whenever you want throughout the
day<00:02:20.629> but<00:02:21.200> we're<00:02:21.379> just<00:02:21.620> going<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.890> start<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
day but we're just going to start the

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.280 
day but we're just going to start the
day<00:02:22.640> with<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.879> hot<00:02:23.030> lemon<00:02:23.360> water<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.720> what<00:02:24.260> I

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
day with the hot lemon water and what I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.410 
day with the hot lemon water and what I
find<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:24.860> by<00:02:25.310> breaking<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.030> pattern

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
find is just by breaking that pattern

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.059 
find is just by breaking that pattern
and<00:02:26.540> creating<00:02:27.019> a<00:02:27.110> little<00:02:27.349> bit<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.620> space<00:02:27.860> for

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
and creating a little bit of space for

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.220 
and creating a little bit of space for
myself<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.879> there<00:02:29.269> are<00:02:29.420> many<00:02:29.659> a<00:02:29.750> days<00:02:29.989> when<00:02:30.200> I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
myself that there are many a days when I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.710 
myself that there are many a days when I
don't<00:02:30.500> even<00:02:30.680> want<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.430> coffee<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.480> think

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
don't even want the coffee and I think

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.039 
don't even want the coffee and I think
by<00:02:32.840> giving<00:02:33.409> yourself<00:02:33.530> permission<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.930> it

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
by giving yourself permission to have it

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.330 
by giving yourself permission to have it
or<00:02:36.140> not<00:02:36.200> have<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.590> then<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.829> can<00:02:36.980> really<00:02:37.190> ask

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
or not have it then you can really ask

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.729 
or not have it then you can really ask
yourself<00:02:37.519> if<00:02:37.879> you<00:02:38.000> want<00:02:38.269> it<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.780> again<00:02:39.049> break

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
yourself if you want it so again break

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.589 
yourself if you want it so again break
the<00:02:39.890> habit<00:02:40.190> create<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.610> little<00:02:40.819> space<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.450> then

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
the habit create a little space and then

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.080 
the habit create a little space and then
decide<00:02:41.900> what<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.200> want<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.409> do<00:02:42.530> from<00:02:42.650> there

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
decide what you want to do from there

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.849 
decide what you want to do from there

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
leafy greens but sometimes you just fall

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.460 
leafy greens but sometimes you just fall
out<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.239> habit<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:05.750> I'm<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:05.959> not<00:03:06.079> thinking

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
out of a habit and I'm just not thinking

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.080 
out of a habit and I'm just not thinking
about<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:07.129> I'm<00:03:07.280> gonna<00:03:07.400> really<00:03:07.609> be<00:03:07.819> mindful

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
about it so I'm gonna really be mindful

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and incorporate that into my diet and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.309 
and incorporate that into my diet and
what<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.609> find<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.329> is<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.780> when<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:11.989> start

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
what I find is is that when I start

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.819 
what I find is is that when I start
incorporating<00:03:12.590> more<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.340> these<00:03:13.879> high<00:03:14.540> quality

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
incorporating more of these high quality

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.620 
incorporating more of these high quality
nutrient-dense<00:03:15.829> foods<00:03:16.220> into<00:03:16.489> my<00:03:16.760> diet<00:03:17.030> that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
nutrient-dense foods into my diet that

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.360 
nutrient-dense foods into my diet that
my<00:03:17.780> body<00:03:17.989> actually<00:03:18.380> starts<00:03:18.650> craving<00:03:19.130> more<00:03:19.250> of
