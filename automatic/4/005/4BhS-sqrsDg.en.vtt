00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.090 
pretty simple to me it's also easy to
reassign<00:01:57.810> which<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> master<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
reassign which one is the master and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.920 
reassign which one is the master and
which<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> slave<00:01:59.939> simply<00:02:00.780> by

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
which one is the slave simply by

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.990 
which one is the slave simply by
reversing<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.439> connections<00:02:01.979> anything<00:02:02.880> else

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
reversing the connections anything else

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.009 
reversing the connections anything else
we<00:02:03.119> need<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.329> know<00:02:03.560> that's<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.770> Tom
