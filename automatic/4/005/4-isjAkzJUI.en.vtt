00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.949
 chin esparta 95 where they grab them there's no 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.050
 process over here then makes your look 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.050
 back he sees that there is an enemy shoots 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.480
 for not spitting excellent falling from his

 elevator let's see exactly how 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.160

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.230
 shoots and has been the subject of a bullet and 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.170
 well nothing else wanted to kill the latter 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.820
 kind but could not but good in itself what 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.920
 more important was that he killed the two 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 guys with a single bullet with another epic 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.190

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.409
 chip toas terry buy where good 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.570
 it starts being subtle to the head with the 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.100
 of m &amp; r makes his first blow does everything 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.320
 book and the throwing grenade launcher 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.820
 Fury make triple death and good nothing 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.820
 more than the piloncillo that came here 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.590
 he does his extermination before dying there 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.990
 we see how it is that is firing is 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.840
 throwing bursts of the tmr grenade launcher 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.280
 with his grenade launcher pro xd then 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.289
 well nothing else this last guy comes out 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.860
 flying and there ends his extermination 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.860
 Super pro 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.550
 in number 7 we have a triple tie 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.590
 and let's start with because root and 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.660
 where good starts making a matrix 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.550
 normal a guy who came with his backpack 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.800
 propelled once you look out you are 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.050
 looking for a few enemies that 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.770
 is there the whole ball then makes a 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.780
 murder 720 I suppose there we see that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.430
 they kill him later but well I told them that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 it was triple tie because the truth told me 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.790
 came three very similar clips and that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.680
 I liked them a lot this time 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.480
 right now is general on where good 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.370
 He also did the same thing in a more 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.560
 different a little harder and good 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.180
 neither can you miss plays or here 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.490
 we see that it is the same throwing granaditas 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.850
 pro looks out I wanted snow that came 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.900
 well you can comment or comment 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.970
 which of these three was the one that liked 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.720
 more and well then there their murders 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.720
 super pros 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.620
 and in number 6 we have angel ls a 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.540
 where is it going up here by the elevator 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.219
 here we see that an enemy is crossing 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.290
 the murders super pro is done for 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:33.150
 back murders the other guy who came to 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.310
 I went to the other guy I wanted to do 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.680
 matrix and the other pokes out to give 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.170
 double cachazo and killing him doing his 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.239
 annihilation super pro there we see how 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.879
 he does his massacre with only cigars 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.920
 cachazos assassinations ninjas matrix super 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.359
 pro a combination of several things 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.129
 several murders that I liked 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.340
 we pretty much see how it kills the last guy 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.250
 and there it is for number 6 with its epic 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.550
 win 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.620
 [Music] 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.350
 and now although in the sniper plays 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.690
 at number 5 he arrives at kaiser 3d with his 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.060
 triple double death right now they will see 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.130
 because here we see that he is killing 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.680
 how many enemies we see here that kills one 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.510
 there occurs a small problem of 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.430
 Lag shoots him but not against death 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.320
 I do not know why but good at the end ago 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.630
 triple death already with the one of m &amp; r and good 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.250
 that's not all, you just see that 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.770
 the enemies reappeared again 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.480
 then there cedoc the tribute and good 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.980
 because nothing else wanted to kill the last guy 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.020
 above with the same as the m &amp; r of the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.130
 fury but it did not reach but the good 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.130
 managed to make two tributes 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.470
 for the 4 arrives x newsnight but the same 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.900
 with a sniper play we see that there 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.550
 Abate a guy in the distance is done to 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.590
 Once the enemy back appears the same 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.390
 triple death and good this last one 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.670
 strained wants him to annihilate 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.290
 recharge then they still reach 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.360
 enemies to them I think an enemy 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.070
 traditional that was opposite I do not know 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.960
 why did that happen but well there 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.960
 he got his fifth rent super pro 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.370
 and at number 3 comes a play from 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.350
 blake alone on this occasion equal with 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.150
 sniper here we see that it makes him a dark 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.040
 super pro a guy who came out there 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.380
 then he wants to look for enemies he wants 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.210
 start a small streak super pro and 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.260
 Well, in the end, it's not here 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.210
 we see that it makes an obscure 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.830
 excellent to the guy who was there to this 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.080
 Last type makes it scope but good 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.910
 gets his double death tribute to this 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.250
 strained that he was adding up to try 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.110
 of to try to kill the ex or not what 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.870
 got and managed to make a 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.220
 excellent annihilation 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.560
 [Music] 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.360
 and we have an honorable mention and in 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.090
 this time we have squad series 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.830
 where you can imagine what will happen 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.530
 or the truth not here we see that it is 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.200
 trying to do 360 super pro and what 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.110
 get it but look who did it 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.780
 george spartan 01 there we see how 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.450
 gets to do his 3 sixty of fury 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.850
 super broken if it was like 1080 but good 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.970
 there we see that he finally gets there 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.100
 it makes its celebration of life 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.830
 Spartan georg and we see how it is 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.570
 go through let's say it was arranged one of 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.760
 the lucky few who have been able to kill 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.260
 in a way super pro ayers spartan and 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.320
 there we see that he gets it in the mention 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.320
 honorific 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.680
 arrives at a pretty good epic wind of 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.680
 melissa 14 where here is making a 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.260
 shot of sniper gets to death 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.000
 bounce with a kill bus and well then 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.010
 if they thought that that was all not here we see 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.020
 which it makes quiet the guy who was 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.310
 through the bars and wanted to kill the 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.710
 last to make his annihilation 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.140
 I would have been more than perfect but 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.700
 well the guy was very far away was a 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.620
 little difficult but there he got his 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.920
 rebound death and there we see how 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.800
 get your epic win 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.350
 and at number 1 we have a move of 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.540
 I pass the order where the game starts 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:53.440
 with the triple or ambular there we see how 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.210
 got triple death from a single bullet 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.980
 and there are the types that in fact two of 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.460
 they were heirs of the fury 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.350
 he managed to kill them and actually get 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.920
 this guy stayed with waterford face 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.420
 and there it is in number one and that has 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.280
 been everything I hope you liked the 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.410
 today's episode do not forget to send me your

 top 10 halo reach down here as you see 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.410
 is the game such that you can send me 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.480

 your messages more than anything and good here to 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.840
 the left I leave the tutorial in case 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.670
 you still do not know very well how to send 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.130

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.990
 number 4 of the top 10 of halo reach and 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.480
 well maybe they realized some 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.330
 that in today's episode there was not so much 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.370
 in fact only wins and that's because 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.410
 that if they came one or two batting 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.510
 folk and fail but they were very few and the 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.000
 true not so for me to seem 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.770
 they were very seen then good if 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.020
 you have the same water 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.970
 the one that happened to you is also going to be 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.039
 received as long as it's say 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.599
 something extraordinary and good because nothing 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.370
 more that has been everything I hope that I have 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:57.310
