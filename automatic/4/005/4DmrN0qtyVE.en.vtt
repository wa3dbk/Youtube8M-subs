negative downside I can say about the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.460 
negative downside I can say about the
graphics<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> view<00:01:15.780> objects<00:01:16.290> really

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
graphics is when you view objects really

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
graphics is when you view objects really
close<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.100> any<00:01:17.250> gun<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:18.060> notice<00:01:18.360> some<00:01:18.509> jagged

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
things but for the most part I was

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.550 
things but for the most part I was
really<00:01:23.040> impressive

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
can feel stiff at times on foot but it

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.390
