00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.500
 I am the front-end professor of the diploma 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.969
 of science and gastronomy management 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.390
 in charge of module number 8 on the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.530
 food cost control 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:23.150
 let's do related exercises 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.150
 with the relation cost sale 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.230
 in this video we will show how 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.440
 calculate one of the variables of the 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.449
 relationship knowing the other two for 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.160
 each form we will perform three exercises 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.920
 apparently the first two figures or 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.680
 variables of the relationship should pause 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.260
 the video to perform the calculation and 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.320
 then resume it to know the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.989
 result there we go 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.970
 in that first exercise the sale is given 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.610
 and the cost in bolivars 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.400
 the purpose is to show the relationship in 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.590
 percentage form according to the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.530
 rule of three the cost is divided between 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.500
 regrets and multiplies percent aus 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.020
 the video once the two appeared 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.560
 first figures and repeat for the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.560
 following 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.150
 in that second exercise the sale is given 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 in bolivars and the cost in percentage of 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.130
 sale is looking to calculate the cost in 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 bolivars according to the rule of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.920
 three multiply the sale by the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.229
 percentage and divided into three in not 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.350
 forget to stop the video to perform the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.350
 exercise 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.769
 in that third exercise the cost is given 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.019
 in bolivars and percentage of sale 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.409
 proposes to calculate the sale in bolivars 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.299
 if we follow the rule of 3 the 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.620
 cost in boulevards between the percentage and 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.620
 multiply by 100 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.300
 i 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.880
 Once the video is finished it is recommended 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.700
 perform exercises material 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.210
 text and also performs the exercises 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.790
 proposed to request from the teacher 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.170
 the correct answers and verify the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.170
 good luck
