00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
one two three we have a wall and then

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.709 
one two three we have a wall and then
one<00:02:01.140> two<00:02:01.320> three<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:02.189> also<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.360> side<00:02:03.509> now

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
one two three now also on this side now

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.569 
one two three now also on this side now
this<00:02:04.049> wall<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.590> cannot<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.979> hollow<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.430> it's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
this wall it cannot be hollow and it's

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.760 
this wall it cannot be hollow and it's
going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.969> solid<00:02:06.540> because<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.409> monsters

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
going to be solid because the monsters

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.130 
going to be solid because the monsters
do<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> spawn<00:02:08.520> within<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.060> four-block<00:02:09.929> radius

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
do you spawn within a four-block radius

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
do you spawn within a four-block radius
so<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:10.860> there's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.129> hollow<00:02:11.400> area<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.970> it's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
so if there's a hollow area and it's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850 
so if there's a hollow area and it's
dark<00:02:12.330> they're<00:02:12.660> going<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.900> spawn<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.290> there

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
dark they're going to spawn in there
