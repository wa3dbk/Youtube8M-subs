you know

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.020 
you know
it<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.850> rough<00:02:18.830> male-dominated<00:02:19.830> sport<00:02:20.370> if

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it is a rough male-dominated sport if

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.940 
it is a rough male-dominated sport if
you<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.420> look<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.660> certain<00:02:21.930> way<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.740> media

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
you do look a certain way the media

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.110 
you do look a certain way the media
would<00:02:23.610> attach<00:02:24.180> themselves<00:02:25.110> better<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
would attach themselves better and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.860 
would attach themselves better and
together<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.740> I'd<00:02:29.100> simply<00:02:29.610> because<00:02:30.209> they

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
together and I'd simply because they

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.990 
together and I'd simply because they
believe<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.200> also<00:02:31.650> more<00:02:32.130> because<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.970> are

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
believe that also more because you are

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.140 
believe that also more because you are
prettier<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:34.380> are<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.740> same<00:02:34.980> type<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.459> person

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
prettier you are the same type of person

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.000 
prettier you are the same type of person
you<00:02:36.330> should<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.810> about<00:02:36.900> what<00:02:37.860> you're

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
you should just be about what you're
