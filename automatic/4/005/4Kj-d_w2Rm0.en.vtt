you would have seen on on a lot of wine

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.880 
you would have seen on on a lot of wine
nights<00:02:24.390> out<00:02:24.630> here<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.770> it's

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
nights out here and that is that it's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.420 
nights out here and that is that it's
actually<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.280> plane<00:02:26.610> blade<00:02:27.020> now<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.920> reason

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
actually a plane blade now the reason

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.880 
actually a plane blade now the reason
this<00:02:30.330> product<00:02:30.600> has<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> plane<00:02:31.230> blade<00:02:31.530> is

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
this product has a plane blade is

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.010 
this product has a plane blade is
because<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.790> serrated<00:02:33.180> blade<00:02:33.570> has<00:02:33.810> got<00:02:33.990> a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
because the serrated blade has got a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.610 
because the serrated blade has got a
tendency<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:36.240> actually<00:02:36.390> tear<00:02:36.810> up<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.080> edge<00:02:37.230> or

tears the edge up as you probably know

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.660 
tears the edge up as you probably know
as<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.290> run<00:02:43.470> your<00:02:43.620> finger<00:02:43.950> around<00:02:44.070> it'll

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
as you run your finger around it'll

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.430 
as you run your finger around it'll
little<00:02:45.030> put<00:02:45.240> tiny<00:02:45.450> cuts<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:46.020> your<00:02:46.050> finger

that's<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.610> exactly<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:48.180> Pleasant<00:02:48.570> now<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
that's not exactly that Pleasant now the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.220 
that's not exactly that Pleasant now the
idea<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> plane<00:02:50.190> blade<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:52.050> it's

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
idea of the plane blade is if it's

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.110 
idea of the plane blade is if it's
maintained<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.010> shops<00:02:53.280> night<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.880> might

sharpening steel that one's actually

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.380 
sharpening steel that one's actually
ceramic<00:03:13.560> one<00:03:13.890> there's<00:03:14.400> even<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:15.180> come

across<00:03:15.630> those<00:03:16.760> what<00:03:17.760> you're<00:03:17.940> most<00:03:18.120> likely<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
across those what you're most likely to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.280 
across those what you're most likely to
find<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:19.050> actually<00:03:19.340> chef<00:03:20.340> steel<00:03:21.020> if<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.140> go

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
find is actually chef steel if you go

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.950 
find is actually chef steel if you go
out<00:03:22.680> into<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.040> kitchen<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.550> ask<00:03:24.270> nicely<00:03:24.690> I

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
out into the kitchen and ask nicely I

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.010 
out into the kitchen and ask nicely I
think<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.560> chef<00:03:25.770> batali<00:03:26.190> give<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.330> quick

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
geologist you probably actually showed

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.960 
geologist you probably actually showed
it<00:03:31.470> how<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> use<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.980> as<00:03:32.220> well<00:03:32.430> which<00:03:32.640> could<00:03:32.850> be

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
it how to use it as well which could be

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.110 
it how to use it as well which could be
quite<00:03:33.210> heavy<00:03:34.310> now<00:03:35.310> I'm<00:03:35.520> just<00:03:35.700> going<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.910> show

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
quite heavy now I'm just going to show

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.910 
quite heavy now I'm just going to show
you<00:03:36.180> how<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.600> actually<00:03:36.900> do<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.470> sharpening

you how to actually do the sharpening
part<00:03:38.930> now<00:03:39.930> what<00:03:40.890> we<00:03:41.010> need<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.430> get<00:03:42.240> our

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
part now what we need to do get our

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.500 
part now what we need to do get our
chef's<00:03:42.660> steel<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:43.770> we<00:03:43.920> need<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.340> set<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.330> at

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
chef's steel and we need to set it at

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.450 
chef's steel and we need to set it at
the<00:03:45.690> right<00:03:45.900> angle<00:03:45.960> against<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.920> blade<00:03:47.130> now

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
the right angle against the blade now

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.130 
the right angle against the blade now
the<00:03:47.790> right<00:03:47.970> angle<00:03:50.570> let<00:03:51.570> me<00:03:51.690> just<00:03:51.900> show<00:03:52.110> you

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
the right angle let me just show you

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.870 
the right angle let me just show you
what<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:52.620> angle<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.490> angle<00:03:53.520> is

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
what the right angle is the angle is

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.150 
what the right angle is the angle is
going<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.270> be<00:03:54.420> roughly<00:03:55.170> it's<00:03:55.770> meant<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.010> be

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
going to be roughly it's meant to be

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.680 
going to be roughly it's meant to be
exactly<00:03:56.520> thirty<00:03:56.850> degrees<00:03:57.210> but<00:03:57.450> you're<00:03:57.600> going

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
exactly thirty degrees but you're going

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.740 
exactly thirty degrees but you're going
to<00:03:57.780> kind<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.050> have<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.260> judge<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.570> if<00:04:00.570> that's

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
to kind of have to judge it so if that's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.190 
to kind of have to judge it so if that's
the<00:04:00.960> blade<00:04:02.630> if<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.750> can<00:04:03.930> see<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:05.960> the<00:04:06.960> blood

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
the blade if you can see that the blood

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.900 
the blade if you can see that the blood
an<00:04:07.380> angle<00:04:07.710> is<00:04:07.830> going<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.010> be<00:04:08.160> roughly<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.640> now

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
an angle is going to be roughly that now

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.350 
an angle is going to be roughly that now
the<00:04:09.209> steel<00:04:09.560> needs<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.740> be<00:04:10.860> sitting<00:04:11.310> sort<00:04:12.300> of

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
the steel needs to be sitting sort of

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.070 
the steel needs to be sitting sort of
just<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.110> edge<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.590> blade

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
just on the edge of the blade

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.750 
just on the edge of the blade
now<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.260> hold<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.739> action<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:17.459> need<00:04:17.489> to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
now that hold the action that we need to

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.960 
now that hold the action that we need to
follow<00:04:17.910> here<00:04:18.270> is<00:04:18.560> like<00:04:19.560> that

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.170 

so<00:04:22.870> we're<00:04:23.020> actually<00:04:23.280> pulling<00:04:24.280> was<00:04:24.940> sort<00:04:25.120> of

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
so we're actually pulling was sort of

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.090 
so we're actually pulling was sort of
pulling<00:04:25.480> away<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:26.110> we're<00:04:26.440> moving<00:04:26.770> along<00:04:26.980> the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
pulling away and we're moving along the

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.550 
pulling away and we're moving along the
blade<00:04:27.280> at<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.580> same<00:04:27.760> time<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:29.110> we<00:04:29.200> want<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.440> do

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
blade at the same time and we want to do

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560 
blade at the same time and we want to do
that<00:04:29.680> on<00:04:29.830> both<00:04:30.100> sides<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:31.060> you'll<00:04:31.240> need<00:04:31.360> to

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
that on both sides so you'll need to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.240 
that on both sides so you'll need to
mirror<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:32.020> angle<00:04:32.380> onto<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.830> other<00:04:32.950> side<00:04:33.040> of

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
mirror that angle onto the other side of

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.910 
mirror that angle onto the other side of
the<00:04:33.430> blade<00:04:35.850> we<00:04:36.850> would<00:04:37.030> do<00:04:37.180> that<00:04:37.920> probably

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
the blade we would do that probably

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.220 
the blade we would do that probably
about<00:04:39.160> three<00:04:39.490> or<00:04:39.520> four<00:04:39.790> times<00:04:40.030> aside<00:04:40.480> you<00:04:41.050> can

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
about three or four times aside you can

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.870 
about three or four times aside you can
always<00:04:41.350> check<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.920> sharpness<00:04:42.280> if<00:04:42.580> you<00:04:42.700> need

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
always check the sharpness if you need

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.120 
always check the sharpness if you need
to<00:04:43.000> do<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.180> bit<00:04:43.360> more<00:04:43.390> you<00:04:44.170> do<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.320> bit<00:04:44.500> more<00:04:44.680> now

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
to do a bit more you do a bit more now

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.680 
to do a bit more you do a bit more now
the<00:04:45.190> pressure<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:45.910> apply<00:04:45.940> during<00:04:46.450> that

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
the pressure that you apply during that

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.370 
the pressure that you apply during that
process<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.840> moderate<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:49.990> light<00:04:50.170> pressure

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
process is a moderate to light pressure

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.730 
process is a moderate to light pressure
that's<00:04:50.830> all<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:51.160> need<00:04:52.170> okay<00:04:53.170> well<00:04:53.380> that

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
that's all you need okay well that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.740 
that's all you need okay well that
pretty<00:04:54.310> much<00:04:54.460> covers<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.120> sharpening<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.690> the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
pretty much covers the sharpening of the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.720 
pretty much covers the sharpening of the
knife<00:04:56.560> blade<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:59.070> you<00:05:00.070> know<00:05:00.190> if<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.430> have<00:05:00.610> any

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
knife blade and you know if you have any
