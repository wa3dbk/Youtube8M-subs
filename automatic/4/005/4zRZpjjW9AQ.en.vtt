and<00:00:16.320> get<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.619> beginning<00:00:17.480> but<00:00:18.480> if<00:00:18.600> you're

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
and get in the beginning but if you're

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.050 
and get in the beginning but if you're
having<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.580> that's<00:00:20.580> probably<00:00:20.880> not

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
having to do that that's probably not

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.759 
having to do that that's probably not
the<00:00:21.119> direction<00:00:21.720> or<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> place<00:00:22.380> or<00:00:22.560> not

the direction or not the place or not
the<00:00:22.920> way<00:00:23.039> now<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:24.000> they've<00:00:24.180> got<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.600> much<00:00:24.750> more

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the way now if they've got so much more

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
the way now if they've got so much more
going<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.529> everything<00:00:26.369> about<00:00:26.550> them<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
going on that everything about them is

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.480 
going on that everything about them is
that<00:00:27.180> much<00:00:27.480> stronger<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> right<00:00:28.380> now<00:00:29.279> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that much stronger and right now you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.740 
that much stronger and right now you
might<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> put<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> little<00:00:30.269> bit<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.570> there

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
might have to put a little bit in there

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.269 
might have to put a little bit in there
in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> beginning<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.650> ideally<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.160> would

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
in the beginning but ideally you would

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.340 
in the beginning but ideally you would
build<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.730> skill<00:00:33.300> sets<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.960> terms<00:00:34.140> of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
build the skill sets in terms of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.130 
build the skill sets in terms of
structure<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.920> relaxation<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.850> feeling<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
structure and relaxation and feeling so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.569 
structure and relaxation and feeling so
that<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:37.739> go<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.250> place

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that you can really go to that place

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.490 
that you can really go to that place
that<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.850> need<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.750> terms<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.260> where

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that you need to in terms of where

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
that you need to in terms of where
you're<00:00:40.710> pushing<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.399> you're<00:00:41.640> pushing<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you're pushing and how you're pushing to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.209 
you're pushing and how you're pushing to
there<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> how<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.500> being<00:00:43.770> keeping

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
there and the how really being keeping

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.069 
there and the how really being keeping
your<00:00:44.399> structure<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.059> your<00:00:45.239> relaxation<00:00:45.690> and

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
your structure and your relaxation and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.310 
your structure and your relaxation and
how<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.620> aim<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.910> order<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.300> get<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:48.930> so

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
how you aim in order to get in there so

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.590 
how you aim in order to get in there so
we<00:00:50.100> talked<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.850> lot<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
we talked about a lot to do with the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
we talked about a lot to do with the
position<00:00:51.780> at<00:00:52.320> first<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.160> still<00:00:53.399> use

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
position at first and so we still use

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.610 
position at first and so we still use
that<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.239> both<00:00:54.420> people<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.930> Lucci<00:00:55.260> now

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that so both people are in Lucci now

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
that so both people are in Lucci now
let's<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.399> equal<00:00:56.610> oh<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.690> he's

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
let's do a little more equal oh so he's

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.979 
let's do a little more equal oh so he's
in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> strong<00:00:58.260> position<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:59.719> I'm<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
in the strong position here I'm in the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.520 
in the strong position here I'm in the
outside<00:01:01.770> position<00:01:02.280> there<00:01:02.989> I'm<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> strong

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
outside position there I'm in the strong

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.789 
outside position there I'm in the strong
position<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:05.659> right<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.260> here

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
position there right and then out here

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
position there right and then out here
I<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.580> by<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
like I'm pushing through him to push off

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
like I'm pushing through him to push off
the<00:01:32.340> floor<00:01:32.509> if<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.689> feel<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> there's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> break

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the floor if I feel that there's a break

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
the floor if I feel that there's a break
on<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.009> I'll<00:01:35.250> gently<00:01:35.670> push<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.689> see

on that I'll gently push that and see

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
on that I'll gently push that and see
where<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.500> goes<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> same<00:01:38.909> thing

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
where it goes with it do the same thing

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.289

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
with me push into me to the floor now

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.960 
with me push into me to the floor now
when<00:01:42.659> he<00:01:42.720> does<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.790> not

she pushes in they're not fighting it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.710 
she pushes in they're not fighting it
force<00:02:27.260> letting<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.680> go<00:02:27.950> into<00:02:28.400> me<00:02:28.520> so<00:02:29.090> now<00:02:29.360> I'm

going to give him something back to get

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.310 
going to give him something back to get
to<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> floor<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.600> feel<00:02:32.780> me<00:02:32.870> resisting<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
to the floor you feel me resisting that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.030 
to the floor you feel me resisting that
so<00:02:33.620> push<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.450> there<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.590> then<00:02:36.740> push

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
so push that there it is so then push

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.570 
so push that there it is so then push
there<00:02:37.220> again<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.740> now<00:02:39.920> when<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.250> feel<00:02:40.430> they

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
there again and so now when I feel they

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.130 
there again and so now when I feel they
put<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.790> bunch<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.120> force<00:02:41.390> into<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.990> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
put a bunch of force into that to the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.410 
put a bunch of force into that to the
floor<00:02:42.380> he's<00:02:42.980> got<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.250> line<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.880> power<00:02:44.090> this

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
floor he's got this line of power this

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.940 
floor he's got this line of power this
way<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:45.110> if<00:02:45.200> I'm<00:02:45.320> pushing<00:02:45.680> I'll<00:02:45.770> push

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
way so that if I'm pushing I'll push

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.040 
way so that if I'm pushing I'll push
here<00:02:46.130> where<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.430> force<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.840> isn't<00:02:47.840> going<00:02:47.960> to

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
here where the force is isn't going to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.260 
here where the force is isn't going to
go<00:02:48.140> anywhere<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.590> strong<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.730> he's<00:02:50.090> got

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
go anywhere it's strong but he's got

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.810 
go anywhere it's strong but he's got
that<00:02:50.480> line<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:51.080> force<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.920> he's<00:02:52.100> aiming<00:02:52.400> to

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
that line of force that he's aiming to

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.060 
that line of force that he's aiming to
that<00:02:53.000> way<00:02:53.240> and<00:02:53.570> so<00:02:53.990> if<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.200> push<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.590> across<00:02:54.650> that

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
that way and so if I push it across that

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.960 
that way and so if I push it across that
in<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.250> right<00:02:55.400> direction

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
in the right direction

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.630 
in the right direction
it<00:02:56.870> doesn't<00:02:57.230> take<00:02:57.350> hardly<00:02:57.620> even<00:02:57.770> force<00:02:58.070> at<00:02:58.220> all

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
it doesn't take hardly even force at all

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.890 
it doesn't take hardly even force at all
you<00:02:59.510> move<00:02:59.770> so<00:03:00.770> we're<00:03:01.070> here<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.640> push<00:03:02.480> down<00:03:02.510> until

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
you move so we're here I push down until

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.300 
you move so we're here I push down until
shears<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.440> other<00:03:03.560> reason<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:03.860> push<00:03:04.040> down<00:03:04.070> in

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
shears the other reason I push down in

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.900 
shears the other reason I push down in
front<00:03:04.459> first

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
front first

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.060 
front first
most<00:03:05.090> people<00:03:05.420> stand<00:03:05.750> in<00:03:05.840> there<00:03:06.050> if<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.830> push

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
most people stand in there if I push

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.460 
most people stand in there if I push
into<00:03:07.250> them<00:03:07.430> here<00:03:07.700> he's<00:03:08.060> strong<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.780> way<00:03:08.959> but

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
into them here he's strong that way but

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.340 
into them here he's strong that way but
if<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.650> push<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.130> where<00:03:10.310> towards<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.390> floor<00:03:11.660> go

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
if I push to where towards the floor go

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.100 
if I push to where towards the floor go
ahead<00:03:12.470> put<00:03:12.650> hands

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
ahead put hands

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.800 
ahead put hands
and<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.440> feel<00:03:13.770> an<00:03:13.920> interruption<00:03:14.340> there<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.690> I

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
and I feel an interruption there and I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.650 
and I feel an interruption there and I
pushed<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.370> than<00:03:17.370> they<00:03:17.490> move<00:03:17.700> if<00:03:18.060> he's<00:03:18.510> able

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
pushed that than they move if he's able

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.790 
pushed that than they move if he's able
to<00:03:18.840> let<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:18.960> go<00:03:19.200> all<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> way<00:03:19.380> through<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
to let it go all the way through the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.050 
to let it go all the way through the
floor<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.940> next<00:03:21.300> step<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:23.550> start<00:03:23.820> feeling

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
floor the next step is to start feeling

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.850 
floor the next step is to start feeling
it<00:03:24.330> towards<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> bottom<00:03:25.050> of<00:03:25.290> his<00:03:25.350> feet<00:03:25.560> feel

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
it towards the bottom of his feet feel

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.990 
it towards the bottom of his feet feel
where<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.100> pressure<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.880> then

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
where the pressure is and then

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.310 
where the pressure is and then
overcoming<00:03:27.740> try<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:28.800> do<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.220> me<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:31.170> it's

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
overcoming try to do that to me so it's

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.780 
overcoming try to do that to me so it's
pushing<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.740> floor<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.400> feel<00:03:32.580> where

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
pushing to the floor you can feel where

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.180 
pushing to the floor you can feel where
my<00:03:32.910> pressure<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.300> on<00:03:33.510> my<00:03:33.630> feet<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.260> now<00:03:34.980> he's

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
my pressure is on my feet and now he's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.520 
my pressure is on my feet and now he's
pushing<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.270> now<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.960> way<00:03:37.110> I'm<00:03:37.260> going<00:03:37.470> to

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
pushing that now the way I'm going to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.830 
pushing that now the way I'm going to
deal<00:03:37.710> with<00:03:37.740> that<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.460> couple<00:03:39.360> things<00:03:39.510> one<00:03:39.750> of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
deal with that is a couple things one of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.630 
deal with that is a couple things one of
it<00:03:39.960> is<00:03:40.050> I'm<00:03:40.320> still<00:03:40.620> holding<00:03:40.980> my<00:03:41.100> feet<00:03:41.370> with

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
it is I'm still holding my feet with

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.630 
it is I'm still holding my feet with
some<00:03:41.790> tension<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.350> release<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.950> way<00:03:47.160> so

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
some tension I release that this way so

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.260 
some tension I release that this way so
pushing<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:49.250> now<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.430> feels<00:03:50.580> like<00:03:50.730> he's<00:03:51.000> lost

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
pushing in now it feels like he's lost

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.760 
pushing in now it feels like he's lost
and<00:03:51.480> they'll<00:03:51.600> have<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.870> push<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
and they'll have to push and get to the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.160 
and they'll have to push and get to the
bottom<00:03:53.010> somehow<00:03:53.610> before<00:03:54.570> he<00:03:54.660> starts<00:03:54.990> to<00:03:55.050> get

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
bottom somehow before he starts to get

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.630 
bottom somehow before he starts to get
something<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.560> push<00:03:55.740> but<00:03:55.950> we<00:03:56.040> gave<00:03:56.250> up<00:03:56.280> an

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
something to push but we gave up an

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.949 
something to push but we gave up an
awful<00:03:57.090> lot<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.630> do<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.520> push<00:03:59.520> again<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:00.930> I

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
awful lot to do that push again and so I

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.820 
awful lot to do that push again and so I
just<00:04:01.170> push<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.620> thing<00:04:01.890> he's<00:04:02.070> pushing<00:04:02.430> one

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
just push that thing he's pushing one

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.690 
just push that thing he's pushing one
okay<00:04:04.830> now<00:04:06.260> he<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.470> building<00:04:07.860> internal<00:04:08.160> all<00:04:08.520> the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
okay now he is building internal all the

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.820 
okay now he is building internal all the
pressures<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.660> all<00:04:09.840> its<00:04:10.050> stuff<00:04:10.320> going<00:04:10.560> on<00:04:10.650> it

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
pressures and all its stuff going on it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.070 
pressures and all its stuff going on it
makes<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.250> very<00:04:11.550> strong<00:04:12.060> inside<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:12.930> it's

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
makes you very strong inside so it's

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.470 
makes you very strong inside so it's
building<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.560> musculature<00:04:14.070> as<00:04:14.400> well<00:04:14.640> even

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
building that musculature as well even

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.240 
building that musculature as well even
though<00:04:15.750> your<00:04:15.959> goal<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.709> get<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.040> point

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
though your goal is to get to the point

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.990 
though your goal is to get to the point
where<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.519> don't<00:04:17.790> use<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.239> lot<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.510> force<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.989> do

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.880 

so<00:04:24.000> I'm<00:04:24.270> relaxing<00:04:24.960> down<00:04:25.140> into<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.530> floor

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
so I'm relaxing down into the floor

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.920 
so I'm relaxing down into the floor
and<00:04:26.070> I'm<00:04:26.550> feeling<00:04:26.940> for<00:04:27.210> him<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.570> as<00:04:27.630> soon<00:04:27.780> as<00:04:27.870> I

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
and I'm feeling for him and as soon as I

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.659 
and I'm feeling for him and as soon as I
feel<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.290> place<00:04:28.500> it's<00:04:28.770> not<00:04:28.890> relaxed<00:04:29.400> they<00:04:29.490> go

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
feel that place it's not relaxed they go

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.490 
feel that place it's not relaxed they go
just<00:04:30.210> past<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:33.000> use<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.020> move<00:04:34.169> by

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
just past it and use that to move by

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.830 
just past it and use that to move by
just<00:04:34.740> passes<00:04:35.100> until<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.430> think<00:04:35.550> about<00:04:35.850> if<00:04:36.660> I'm

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
just passes until you think about if I'm

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.870 
just passes until you think about if I'm
pushing<00:04:37.169> here<00:04:37.500> that's<00:04:37.830> straight<00:04:38.250> into<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.669> I

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
pushing here that's straight into it I

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.590 
pushing here that's straight into it I
start<00:04:39.540> pushing<00:04:39.930> towards<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.590> floor<00:04:40.890> until<00:04:41.600> I

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
start pushing towards the floor until I

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.150 
start pushing towards the floor until I
feel<00:04:42.960> where<00:04:43.140> he's<00:04:43.230> really<00:04:43.410> got<00:04:43.650> his<00:04:43.770> power<00:04:43.980> out

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
feel where he's really got his power out

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.560 
feel where he's really got his power out
and<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.370> push<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.790> feel<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.030> other<00:04:45.180> side<00:04:45.419> of

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
and I push and I feel the other side of

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.000 
and I push and I feel the other side of
that<00:04:45.660> man<00:04:45.840> go<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:45.990> didn't<00:04:46.440> have<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:46.650> much<00:04:46.770> there

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
that man go I didn't have so much there

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.860 
that man go I didn't have so much there
and<00:04:47.190> then<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.490> crossed<00:04:47.730> that<00:04:47.790> and<00:04:48.419> it<00:04:48.660> really

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
and then I crossed that and it really

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.220 
and then I crossed that and it really
only<00:04:49.020> takes<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:50.310> is<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.520> firmness<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.480> fullness

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
only takes it is a firmness a fullness

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.890 
only takes it is a firmness a fullness
if<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.560> will<00:04:52.770> but<00:04:53.010> not<00:04:53.630> because<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.720> don't
