there<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.110> couple

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
there was one in here in just a couple

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.790 
there was one in here in just a couple
minutes<00:00:37.380> ago<00:00:37.620> oh<00:00:37.920> yeah<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:39.000> had<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.800> this

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
minutes ago oh yeah we had one and this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520 
minutes ago oh yeah we had one and this
is<00:00:40.980> an<00:00:41.100> idea<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.550> IKEA<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.329> putting<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
is an idea that IKEA is putting out it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
is an idea that IKEA is putting out it
has<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:44.010> been<00:00:44.070> implemented<00:00:44.610> yet<00:00:44.820> so

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
has not been implemented yet so

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.090 
has not been implemented yet so
basically<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.410> they're<00:00:46.559> doing<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.070> they're

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
basically what they're doing is they're

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
basically what they're doing is they're
putting<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:47.910> kits<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.629> able<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.200> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
putting out these kits to be able to I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.810 
putting out these kits to be able to I
guess<00:00:50.989> capitalize<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.500> idea<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> ikea

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
guess capitalize on this idea of ikea

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
guess capitalize on this idea of ikea
hacking<00:00:54.300> first<00:00:54.840> off<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.289> want<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> say<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
hacking first off I want to say I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
hacking first off I want to say I
disagree<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.879> using<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> word<00:00:57.360> hack<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.899> this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
disagree of using the word hack in this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it's probably time I don't know why they

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.499 
it's probably time I don't know why they
sound<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.840> they're<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:26.070> Midwest<00:01:26.509> but

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
probably sound sweet yeah i know i'm

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.420 
probably sound sweet yeah i know i'm
really<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> switch<00:01:30.659> exit<00:01:31.310> but<00:01:32.310> yeah

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
really not going to switch exit but yeah

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.679 
really not going to switch exit but yeah
and<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.640> said<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.909> hey<00:01:32.939> let's<00:01:33.240> let's<00:01:33.479> find

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and they said like hey let's let's find

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.600 
and they said like hey let's let's find
a<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.170> capitalize<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:35.100> but

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
a way that we can capitalize on this but

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.999 
a way that we can capitalize on this but
that<00:01:35.729> defeats<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> entire<00:01:36.329> purpose<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:37.110> what

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that defeats the entire purpose of what

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800 
that defeats the entire purpose of what
i<00:01:38.159> mean<00:01:38.430> i<00:01:38.549> know<00:01:38.610> hacking<00:01:38.939> annoying<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.659> let's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
i mean i know hacking annoying but let's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.640 
i mean i know hacking annoying but let's
just<00:01:39.960> use<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> sake<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
just use it for the sake of the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
just use it for the sake of the
conversation<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
conversation because you just use the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.670 
conversation because you just use the
word<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.659> i<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.079> would<00:01:43.200> remiss<00:01:43.500> for
