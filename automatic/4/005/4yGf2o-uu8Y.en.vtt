00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.550
 live television from our 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.590
 Android device no matter what 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.390

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.080

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.300
 four days well of this checking this 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.220

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.980
 here of some 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.290
 cable programs totally without 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.320
 device we only need to have 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.020
 active wifi in our 3g our data 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.560
 I recommend you use them in your 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:13.180
 wifi since this as is a pull 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.200
 many resources a lot of data because if not 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.560
 it would be very is like in this picture what 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.829
 let's see the program 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.829
 well it's called the most tv application 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.130
 the convention the download link good 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.450
 here as you will see I have channels from my 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.939
 country says mexico 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.140
 I have several good ones going to try

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.900
 of cable 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.780
 When you read US channels from Spain 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.350
 colombia argentina 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.390

 etcetera good are those that contain are 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.500
 pretty but most are pebble 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.800
 and we can visualize them without any 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.330
 problem 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.280
 I'm going to play a video 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.740
 well clear before that of that by 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.830
 example in Mexican channels where I 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.530
 alive 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.730
 it links directly to a network I do not know 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.010
 let it be but 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.049
 at the time that you are going to see a program 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.959
 on the television that you see him on 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.269
 your new tablet device android 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.510
 variable that are 15 seconds 10 seconds 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.360
 of delay or advancement depends let's say the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.519
 connectivity but that does not prevent you from not 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.569
 work well the application I will open 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.980
 program 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.980
 from the country of mexico 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.720
 and this one I want to clarify to you 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.250
 this explanation contains advertising and 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.690
 you just have to jump or close it 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.970
 depending on the case it will always be 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.220
 A) Yes 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.090
 and another for copyright issues that 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.520
 I'm going to cover these images but I 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.800
 I want you to listen to the audio I'm 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.610
 recording at 5 11 of mexico the day 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.610

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.840
 [Music] 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.560
 good friends, I'll show you another video 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.850
 they will not see it like that 100 because 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.380
 copyright issues 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.480
 I will be covering the image but that 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.370
 tell him that this application works and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.110
 I'm going to open another good program to another 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.240
 channel or record of one cable say 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.240

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.439
 one of bandamax 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.439
 [Applause] 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.350
 you always have to skip the advertising 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.100
 so that we directional to the border 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.100
 of what is coming 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.260
 a programming they went through the east 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.260
 I'm going to skip advertising anyway

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.360

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.139

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.229
 I'll wait for the camera that cable and 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.020

 very well and I want to teach them with another 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.310

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.449
 they will open it for the first time, which is the 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.389
 what are you seeing here 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.870
