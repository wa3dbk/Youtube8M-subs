00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.739
 today for a little video a bit special because percent indeed 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:21.079
 this is a video the crush on a very interesting game that 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.089
 is called 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.939
 planet 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.759
 it could offer some kind of alternative for all those who 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.889
 would be a little tired she remains a tie 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.390
 so why are you talking about this game project 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.130
 first of all simply because it is being funded 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.970
 participatory via the kickstarter website hurts unfortunately are coming soon 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.380
 at the end 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.140
 moreover about this I will put in the description the link to this site if 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.310
 never again do you want to help the creators of the game who are in 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.100
 French by the way 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.020
 and then because he feels it 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.470
 it's really to see in my eyes in any case the potential to bring a 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.470
 real alternative to magny-course 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.440
 in addition only to have a colorful universe and very kubica manna kraft 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.410
 so it offers a real scenario as well as a much more rpg side 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.050
 you will find a signal a priori all the classical pattern of classes and 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.250
 professions 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.480
 which will allow you to kraft various object 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.920
 is added the pump luce the space exploration part with the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.440
 possibility to create a small vessel and to walk two planets in 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.720
 planets and maybe even according to the evolution of the game 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.200
 2 galaxy in case of accident 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.720
 so here is something very interesting in the final 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.220
 who I think deserves your attention in any case for me that's what 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 justify this little video a bit special 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.920
 let's quickly go back to the planet RPG side 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.580
 indeed m 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.950
 you will have the opportunity to perform a series of main quests 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.820
 and secondary 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.399
 that unfolds on an unknown planet and that will allow you 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.399
 to discover information about an alien race 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.399
 on this same planet 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.129
 forgotten by the classic operation of the experiment proves 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.679
 the talent tree because here it simply does not exist 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.770
 the game is rather based on increasing the characteristics of the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.359
 pro player as time goes by 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.749
 that is, the more action you take 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.119
 what's more, what will be done 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:37.709
 it is also noted that it will be exactly the same with regard to the use 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.769
 hand errors 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.560
 what does it imply well 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.370
 simply the choice of the type of character you want to play and 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.010
 will depend only on the equipment you choose 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.849
 to use 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.880
 concretely a look and use it not noticed but sooner 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.259
 a sword 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.999
 then move on to the craft section which would allow exchanges with the 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:05.289
 various pnj and that will offer you the opportunity to customize your 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.799
 much more equipment than mague kraft has 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.459
 a little 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.649
 the commission could find in a clear that I have typhus what image 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:20.429
 regarding the exploration of evolution within this autumn under 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.709
 we can the player who was under study 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.919
 you will be limited by the water level goes up vote 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.829
 equipment both groups features 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.400
 we find ourselves there with a more valid operation q bordeaux 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.809
 or when the voice sometimes quartet 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.479
 especially in relation to the level of enemies present in the different 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.199
 areas 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.579
 you will also have the opportunity to nominate 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.339
 but again depending on the characteristics of your equipment 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:49.339
 you will not be able to break all the blogs from the beginning 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.689
 then regarding hoeing as usual you will be able to create 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.389
 dig beautiful France 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.019
 cavemen that will certainly lead you to veteran's day don 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.699
 johnson embossed other more or less rare enemies 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.169
 we have the equipment 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.749
 pwd 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.209
 optimized muluzi of the game 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.699
 on the creative side proper in the game unlike a strong no 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.669
 would be more limited by simple 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.689
 but you will also have at your disposal a whole series of products 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:26.120
 for the others 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.820
 allowing your imagination to implement constructions 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.639
 a lot 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.639
 with many more details 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:39.139
 let's move on to the most interesting part for me the fire 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.389
 the multiplayer 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.059
 just as normal everywhere and always 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.650
 we could create a server had invited his friends to play with you 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.690
 this will make between very interesting possibilities like for example the 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.110
 opportunity to shop with the vehicles you have created 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.830
 or even explore dungeons that we talked about earlier and so 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.110
 to pave the way for even more adventures in Picardy 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.009
 she finds herself there corollary times with a type of gameplay in the cub 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.069
 see below 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.580
 because you will not be able to make new piette as a group 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.089
 note anyway that unlike passes him if you will not be able to 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:23.929

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:26.929

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.419
 we can conclude after this second act overview of the main features 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.180
 of planets more than it's a very promising project that I still think 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.360
 once deserves your attention 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.020
