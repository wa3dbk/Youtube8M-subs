definitely my favorite part of the game
I<00:02:40.440> think<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.220> most<00:02:41.519> people<00:02:41.609> who<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.239> a

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
I think that most people who have a

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.180 
I think that most people who have a
passing<00:02:42.989> interest<00:02:43.079> in<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.530> series<00:02:43.890> are

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
passing interest in this series are

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.979 
passing interest in this series are
probably<00:02:44.609> most<00:02:44.850> familiar<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.720> version

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
probably most familiar with this version

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.009 
probably most familiar with this version
I<00:02:46.470> guess<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.579> probably<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.269> it's<00:02:48.870> been

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
I guess is probably because it's been

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.780 
I guess is probably because it's been
ported<00:02:49.350> about<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.829> million<00:02:50.190> times

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
ported about a million times

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.330 
ported about a million times
it<00:02:51.660> also<00:02:51.870> helps<00:02:52.320> at<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.500> sequel<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.130> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it also helps at the sequel and the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.490 
it also helps at the sequel and the
reboot<00:02:53.700> were<00:02:54.269> both<00:02:54.480> based<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:55.109> this<00:02:55.260> version

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
