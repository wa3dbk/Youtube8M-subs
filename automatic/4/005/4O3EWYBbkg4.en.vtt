was the second version this is the first
verse<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:18.000> actually<00:00:18.240> Ibanez<00:00:18.930> his

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
verse and this was actually Ibanez his

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.710 
verse and this was actually Ibanez his
answer<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.340> big<00:00:20.490> muff<00:00:20.760> pedal<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> has

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
answer to the big muff pedal so it has

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.009 
answer to the big muff pedal so it has
similar<00:00:22.230> controls<00:00:24.470> basically<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
similar controls basically it was the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.600 
similar controls basically it was the
ibanez<00:00:28.189> overdrive<00:00:29.189> 850<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.929> one's<00:00:31.199> called

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
ibanez overdrive 850 this one's called

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.069 
ibanez overdrive 850 this one's called
850<00:00:32.610> OD<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.660> don't<00:00:34.079> know<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> time<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:36.329> it's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
850 OD I don't know like a time so it's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.860 
850 OD I don't know like a time so it's
got<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> new<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.890> life<00:00:38.570> got<00:00:39.570> three

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
got a new time in life got three

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.270 
got a new time in life got three
controls<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.710> sustained<00:00:41.610> balanced<00:00:42.300> tone

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
controls here sustained balanced tone

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.819 
controls here sustained balanced tone
sustained<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:45.120> kind<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> distortion

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
sustained it's kind of like a distortion

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.209 
sustained it's kind of like a distortion
level<00:00:48.260> balance<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.890> more<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
level balance is actually more like a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.119 
level balance is actually more like a
volume<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.469> tone<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.600> says<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> all

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
volume and tone is you know says it all

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.610 
volume and tone is you know says it all
anyway<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> kick<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.899> show<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
anyway just going to kick it up show you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.340 
anyway just going to kick it up show you
the<00:00:58.770> ampere<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.280> through<00:00:59.640> basically<00:01:00.539> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the ampere going through basically this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.469 
the ampere going through basically this
is<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:02.460> watt<00:01:02.699> amp<00:01:03.080> going<00:01:04.080> through<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> old

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
is a one watt amp going through a old

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:32.170 
is a one watt amp going through a old
radio<00:01:06.479> housing<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:09.990> go

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:51.220
