00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:09.990
 so we're back aboard the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:12.920
 renault zoé 100% electric for a 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.920
 little road test 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.320
 so we can see that we are halfway 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.070
 battery wear and that remains to be 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.510
 about 72 km of autonomy 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:46.129
 it may vary depending on how 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.129
 we drive the car to the right 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.960
 so if we have a casting pipe 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.629
 we will do more and if we are a little nervous 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.280
 on the pedal we will do less for 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.309
 look at the general look 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 mature a gps with points of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.270
 recharge with anything that can serve 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.299
 sites air conditioning controls 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.299
 belga chds 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 7 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:23.880
 10 storage is very comfortable very 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.880
 quiet 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.190
 take a little bit of road 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.200
 that we had not been able to do during the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:38.009
 previous test we had family 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 here we go 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.110
 really accelerates very well 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.670
 that at least cars ended 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.280
 the owls 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.630
 I have four in the vehicle 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.250
 here 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.870
 and we walk on the side of that 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.870
 citywas the bread 30,77 little problem 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.370
 so we'll test an acceleration on 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.989
 arrived on a four-way 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.010
 speed up frankly we see a small 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.660
 little acceleration that in real it was 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.989
 there for now we did a little bit 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.989
 from the city 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.630
 to have fun 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.470
 we left 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.130
 really accelerates very very well 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.680
 you will learn gouffran points then we 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.680
 will resume in the direction 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.960
 I can all boast 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.480
 so the price of the model we are trying 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.360
 currently is the state deducted from 7000 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.660
 euros those fifteen thousand five hundred euros 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.420
 to which we must add about 850 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.940
 wall box euros 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.990
 so that brings the car back to almost 16 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.040
 1500 euros it's still a little bit 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.240
 expensive for a city dweller especially as 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:40.330
 to add the rental of the battery 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:43.840
 which from 79 euros per month for 2500 km 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.610
 per year and if like me we do rather 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.290
 in the twenty eight kilometers 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.200
 it exceeds the 100 euros of rent by 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.650
 months so really really think about his 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.290
 investment before deciding because 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.970
 that the savings we make in 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.700
 fuel if you eat them 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.130
 of battery in purchase of the vehicle 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.620
 must really think but cons 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.590
 it's true we have a car that is 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.450
 really excellent quality well finished 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.040
 with driving pleasure 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.100
 exceptional so that's after it's a 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.100
 choice 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.060
 so that was a new test of the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.910
 renault zoé especially the pros riders 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.330
 like and see you soon for the test of the 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.720
 zero to make a comparison of these 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.250
 two vehicles fighting in the 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.190
 same niche but that are totally 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.780
 different in reality and we'll see that during 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.780
 from the next test just now
