lower down the resolution quite a bit or

you can definitely get in that kind of
playable<00:05:29.470> frame<00:05:29.710> rates<00:05:29.889> but<00:05:30.010> that's<00:05:30.190> not<00:05:30.340> what

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
playable frame rates but that's not what

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
specific monitor is not really geared

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.670 
specific monitor is not really geared
towards<00:05:51.430> gamers<00:05:52.000> at<00:05:52.150> all<00:05:52.270> is<00:05:52.479> 8<00:05:53.050> milliseconds

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
towards gamers at all is 8 milliseconds

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.409 
towards gamers at all is 8 milliseconds
response<00:05:54.100> time<00:05:54.340> which<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:54.610> unsuitable<00:05:55.030> for

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
response time which is unsuitable for

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.630 
response time which is unsuitable for
most<00:05:55.870> serious<00:05:56.350> gamers<00:05:56.800> plus<00:05:57.310> it's<00:05:57.490> more

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
most serious gamers plus it's more

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.820 
most serious gamers plus it's more
geared<00:05:57.910> towards<00:05:58.000> content<00:05:58.780> creation<00:05:59.440> and

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
geared towards content creation and

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.409 
geared towards content creation and
professionals<00:06:00.669> that<00:06:00.789> want<00:06:00.910> to<00:06:01.030> get<00:06:01.150> really

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
professionals that want to get really

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.260 
professionals that want to get really
accurate<00:06:01.630> colors<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:02.500> has<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:03.010> very<00:06:03.550> nice<00:06:03.850> 10

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
accurate colors it has a very nice 10

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.659 
accurate colors it has a very nice 10
bit<00:06:04.479> panel<00:06:04.870> with<00:06:05.080> very<00:06:05.770> good<00:06:06.010> color<00:06:06.220> accuracy

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
bit panel with very good color accuracy

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.550 
bit panel with very good color accuracy
so<00:06:07.150> for<00:06:07.360> content<00:06:07.720> creators<00:06:07.960> this<00:06:08.200> is<00:06:08.320> great

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
so for content creators this is great

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.080 
so for content creators this is great
and<00:06:08.770> even<00:06:08.860> though<00:06:09.039> you<00:06:09.100> can<00:06:09.310> play<00:06:09.490> games<00:06:09.700> on<00:06:10.060> a

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
and even though you can play games on a

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.990 
and even though you can play games on a
5k<00:06:10.660> display<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:11.289> is<00:06:11.650> still<00:06:11.890> too<00:06:12.130> early<00:06:12.160> to<00:06:12.610> do

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
5k display it is still too early to do

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.060 
5k display it is still too early to do
so<00:06:13.240> I<00:06:13.270> think<00:06:13.419> at<00:06:13.750> this<00:06:13.900> point<00:06:14.169> but<00:06:14.680> if<00:06:14.860> you<00:06:14.979> are

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
so I think at this point but if you are

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.710 
so I think at this point but if you are
interested<00:06:15.520> again<00:06:15.610> in<00:06:15.850> a<00:06:15.880> full<00:06:16.300> review<00:06:16.600> of
