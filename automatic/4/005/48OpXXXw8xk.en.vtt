00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
little on the top my husband does not

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.910 
little on the top my husband does not
like<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.270> coordinate<00:01:09.630> colors<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.680> are

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
like to coordinate colors so these are

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.530 
like to coordinate colors so these are
the<00:01:11.070> place<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:12.630> can't<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:13.920> now

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
the place you can't see can you see now

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.249 
the place you can't see can you see now
hmm

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
hmm

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140 
hmm
but<00:01:16.500> anyways<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.040> reason<00:01:17.070> why<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.939> these

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
but anyways the reason why I like these

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.719 
but anyways the reason why I like these
bottles<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.710> air<00:01:19.979> vents<00:01:20.490> in

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
bottles is they have the air vents in

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
bottles is they have the air vents in
the<00:01:20.790> bottom<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.920> part<00:01:23.630> comes<00:01:24.630> off<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the bottom so this part comes off and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.679 
the bottom so this part comes off and
then<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.189> piece<00:01:26.549> inside<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
then there is this piece inside that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.350 
then there is this piece inside that
pulls<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.979> wash<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.119> this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
pulls out so you can wash it so this

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.420 
pulls out so you can wash it so this
lets<00:01:30.720> air<00:01:31.340> come<00:01:32.340> through<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> bottom<00:01:33.049> and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
lets air come through the bottom and

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.359 
lets air come through the bottom and
then<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.420> wide<00:01:36.900> inna<00:01:37.619> poles<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
then you have the wide inna poles and I

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.460 
then you have the wide inna poles and I
like<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> wide<00:01:39.180> nipples<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.439> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
like the wide nipples I do like that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.050 
like the wide nipples I do like that
this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.009> flat<00:01:42.020> because<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.470> nipple

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
this is flat because when your nipple

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.280 
this is flat because when your nipple
goes<00:01:45.060> into<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.380> baby's<00:01:46.680> mouth<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.810> they<00:01:48.810> suck

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
goes into the baby's mouth and they suck

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.219 
goes into the baby's mouth and they suck
on<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:50.189> flatten<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
on it they flatten it out and this is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.300 
on it they flatten it out and this is
texture<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.000> little<00:01:54.270> bit<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:56.040> don't

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
texture just a little bit and I don't

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.440 
texture just a little bit and I don't
know<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.759> see<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.240> there's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
know if you can see that but there's

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.920 
know if you can see that but there's
little<00:01:58.579> like<00:01:59.579> lines<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.299> make<00:02:00.450> sure<00:02:00.689> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
little like lines that make sure that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.670 
little like lines that make sure that
the<00:02:01.460> nipple<00:02:02.460> does<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:03.000> fully<00:02:03.450> collapse<00:02:04.380> on

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the nipple does not fully collapse on

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.010 
the nipple does not fully collapse on
itself<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.729> doesn't<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:06.329> lose<00:02:06.659> like

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
itself so then it doesn't like lose like

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.559 
itself so then it doesn't like lose like
the<00:02:07.200> flow<00:02:07.520> but<00:02:08.520> anyway<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:08.879> these<00:02:09.239> are<00:02:09.450> my

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
