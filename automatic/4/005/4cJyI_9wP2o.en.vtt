the<00:00:00.630> feet<00:00:00.930> should<00:00:01.170> leave<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:01.560> wall<00:00:01.770> and

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
the feet should leave the wall and

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.070 
the feet should leave the wall and

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.550 
immediately begin to body dolphin
technique<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:05.490> will<00:00:05.730> allow<00:00:06.029> for<00:00:06.560> maximum

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
technique this will allow for maximum

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.250 
technique this will allow for maximum
speed<00:00:07.770> off<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.519> turn<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.090> generate<00:00:10.019> momentum

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
speed off the turn and generate momentum

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.640 
speed off the turn and generate momentum
for<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.190> important<00:00:11.700> breakout<00:00:12.179> stroke

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
for the important breakout stroke

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.560 
for the important breakout stroke
Michael<00:00:13.650> takes<00:00:13.889> his<00:00:14.099> breakout<00:00:14.490> stroke<00:00:14.880> just

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
Michael takes his breakout stroke just

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.200 
Michael takes his breakout stroke just
at<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.139> surface<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.160> his<00:00:17.279> body<00:00:17.580> line<00:00:17.910> is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
at the surface so that his body line is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.810 
at the surface so that his body line is
horizontal<00:00:18.980> when<00:00:19.980> he<00:00:20.070> makes<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.550> first

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
horizontal when he makes the first

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.070 
horizontal when he makes the first
movement<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.449> his<00:00:21.480> arm

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
movement with his arm

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.529 
movement with his arm
this<00:00:22.529> technique<00:00:23.150> minimizes<00:00:24.150> frontal

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
this technique minimizes frontal

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
this technique minimizes frontal
resistance<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.260> allows<00:00:25.800> for<00:00:26.250> maximum

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
resistance and allows for maximum

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.450 
resistance and allows for maximum
transfer<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.750> power<00:00:27.990> into<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> swimming

transfer of power into the swimming

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.800 
transfer of power into the swimming
portion<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> race

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
with a full stroke time to finish so

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.730 
with a full stroke time to finish so
that<00:00:44.910> there's<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.570> room<00:00:45.810> to<00:00:46.050> glide<00:00:46.320> and
