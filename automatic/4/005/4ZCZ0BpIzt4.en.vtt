course and then and then great

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.780 
course and then and then great
expectations<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.350> course<00:01:36.560> which<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:37.010> which<00:01:37.340> is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
expectations of course which is which is

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.260 
expectations of course which is which is
very<00:01:38.240> difficult<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.530> live<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.400> know<00:01:40.520> but

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.340 
and I think the audience recognizes that
and<00:01:44.030> also<00:01:44.150> recognizes<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.020> we're<00:01:45.259> not
