black and white this is an old master
technique<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.880> I'm<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.599> glaze<00:00:27.900> color

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
technique and I'm going to glaze color

technique and I'm going to glaze color
on<00:00:28.560> top<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.560> old

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
on top of this so see the the the old

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.740 
on top of this so see the the the old
master<00:00:32.189> separated<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> problems<00:00:33.570> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
master separated the problems of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.979 
master separated the problems of
painting<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.860> paint<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> form<00:00:35.610> first<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
painting that paint the form first the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
painting that paint the form first the
light<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.410> shadow<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.820> always<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
light and shadow and it's always in a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.020 
light and shadow and it's always in a
higher<00:00:39.629> key<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.040> when<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.340> glaze<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
higher key and then when we glaze the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.180 
higher key and then when we glaze the
glaze<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.540> darker<00:00:43.050> color<00:00:43.320> over<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> light

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
glaze is a darker color over the light

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.020 
glaze is a darker color over the light
the<00:00:44.610> lighter<00:00:44.820> gray<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.550> let's<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.670> get

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the lighter gray here so let's just get

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.869 
the lighter gray here so let's just get
right<00:00:48.239> into<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:48.750> there's<00:00:49.579> some<00:00:50.579> cadmium

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
right into it here there's some cadmium

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.880 
right into it here there's some cadmium
yellow<00:00:51.510> light<00:00:52.520> I'm<00:00:53.520> gonna<00:00:53.699> dip<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> medium

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
yellow light I'm gonna dip in the medium

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.450 
yellow light I'm gonna dip in the medium
and<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> little<00:00:56.430> bit<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> paint<00:00:58.250> wipe<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and a little bit in the paint wipe it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.869 
and a little bit in the paint wipe it
off<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.629> we'll<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.879> put

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
off a little bit and then we'll just put

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.740 
off a little bit and then we'll just put
it<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.390> there<00:01:03.570> very<00:01:03.840> thinly<00:01:05.479> it's<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it right on there very thinly it's not a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.310 
it right on there very thinly it's not a
really<00:01:07.530> soupy<00:01:08.159> mixture<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:10.170> know

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
really soupy mixture at all you know

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.250 
really soupy mixture at all you know
it's<00:01:10.680> very<00:01:10.740> thin<00:01:11.280> no<00:01:11.659> we<00:01:12.659> don't<00:01:12.840> need<00:01:12.990> much

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
it's very thin no we don't need much

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.899 
it's very thin no we don't need much
medium<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.330> start<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
medium at all so we start with that and

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.690 
medium at all so we start with that and
then<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.420> color<00:01:18.710> will<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.860> richer<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.520> we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
then as the color will get richer as we

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.450 
then as the color will get richer as we
move<00:01:20.909> towards<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.900> halftone<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
move towards the this halftone here so

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.010 
move towards the this halftone here so
let's<00:01:23.729> take<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> deeper<00:01:24.750> yellow<00:01:26.689> very<00:01:27.689> little

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
let's take the deeper yellow very little

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.690 
let's take the deeper yellow very little
medium<00:01:29.060> it'll<00:01:30.060> put<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:35.490> it'll

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
medium it'll put it in here and it'll

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
medium it'll put it in here and it'll
actually<00:01:35.970> you'll<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> gray<00:01:37.170> through

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
actually you'll see the gray through

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.060 
actually you'll see the gray through
that<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.659> it'll<00:01:39.900> help<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.680> keep<00:01:40.890> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that and it'll help to keep that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.370 
that and it'll help to keep that
atmospheric<00:01:42.560> feeling<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:45.000> form

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
atmospheric feeling about the the form

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.420 
atmospheric feeling about the the form
see<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:48.140> will<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.290> into<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> shadow<00:01:50.100> this

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
see now I will get into the shadow this

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.149 
see now I will get into the shadow this
is<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> shadow<00:01:51.000> area<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> could<00:01:52.950> take

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is the shadow area so I could take

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.039 
is the shadow area so I could take
another<00:01:53.310> brush<00:01:55.939> dip<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> oil<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.930> then

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
another brush dip it in the oil and then

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.160 
another brush dip it in the oil and then
I<00:01:58.200> made<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> mixture<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.520> raw<00:01:59.790> umber<00:02:00.170> with

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
I made a mixture here of raw umber with

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.319 
I made a mixture here of raw umber with
a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.500> bit<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.829> cadmium<00:02:02.460> red<00:02:02.610> light<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
a little bit of cadmium red light it's a

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.980 
a little bit of cadmium red light it's a
very<00:02:03.509> thin<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> want<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.040> keep<00:02:05.189> these

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
very thin so you want to keep these

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.850 
very thin so you want to keep these
these<00:02:06.990> colors<00:02:07.439> very<00:02:07.560> thin<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.560> we'll

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
these colors very thin and then we'll

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.559 
these colors very thin and then we'll
put<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.250> warm<00:02:11.610> shadow

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
put this warm shadow

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:27.190 
put this warm shadow
right<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.739> here<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:17.159> then<00:02:17.280> just<00:02:17.519> blend<00:02:17.819> that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.390 

and<00:02:27.770> under<00:02:28.069> here<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.490> reflected<00:02:29.030> light<00:02:30.400> so

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
and under here is the reflected light so

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.790 
and under here is the reflected light so
I'll<00:02:32.180> clean<00:02:32.390> my<00:02:32.450> brush<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:33.230> we'll<00:02:33.590> take

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
I'll clean my brush and then we'll take

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.380 
I'll clean my brush and then we'll take
some<00:02:33.860> yellow<00:02:34.250> ochre<00:02:36.459> then<00:02:37.459> once<00:02:37.700> again<00:02:37.880> very

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
some yellow ochre then once again very

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.770 
some yellow ochre then once again very
thin<00:02:38.810> lead<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:41.780> put<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.410> right<00:02:42.650> here

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
thin lead you just put that right here

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.750 
thin lead you just put that right here
and<00:02:44.780> see<00:02:45.020> this<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.410> creates<00:02:45.800> more<00:02:46.040> depth<00:02:46.400> in

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
and see this this creates more depth in

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.449 
and see this this creates more depth in
the<00:02:46.940> painting<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.739> doesn't<00:02:52.100> take<00:02:52.250> much

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
the painting so it doesn't take much

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.199 
the painting so it doesn't take much
color<00:02:52.790> at<00:02:52.970> all<00:02:56.980> what<00:02:57.980> I'll<00:02:58.099> do<00:02:58.310> too<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.970> I'll

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
color at all what I'll do too is I'll

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.160 
color at all what I'll do too is I'll
take<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.480> little<00:02:59.870> bit<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.640> cadmium<00:03:01.900> orange<00:03:02.900> I

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
take a little bit of cadmium orange I

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.270 
take a little bit of cadmium orange I
think<00:03:06.170> I'm<00:03:06.290> gonna<00:03:06.440> make<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:06.799> just<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.160> little

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
think I'm gonna make this just a little

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.630 
think I'm gonna make this just a little
richer<00:03:07.790> yet<00:03:08.709> when<00:03:09.709> we<00:03:09.830> move<00:03:10.040> towards<00:03:10.430> that

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
richer yet when we move towards that

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.180 
richer yet when we move towards that
shadow<00:03:12.340> see<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:14.090> richest<00:03:14.630> color<00:03:15.010> than<00:03:16.010> any

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
shadow see the richest color than any

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.880 
shadow see the richest color than any
object<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:17.030> towards<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.660> halftone<00:03:18.500> as<00:03:18.739> it

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
object is towards the halftone as it

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.440 
object is towards the halftone as it
moves<00:03:19.069> into<00:03:19.310> shadow<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:22.160> that's<00:03:22.370> there<00:03:22.880> and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
moves into shadow so that's there and

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.160 
moves into shadow so that's there and
then<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:24.440> top<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.799> that<00:03:25.010> lemon<00:03:25.580> will<00:03:26.510> take<00:03:26.780> pure

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
then on top of that lemon will take pure

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.050 
then on top of that lemon will take pure
white<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.190> think<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.459> could<00:03:28.489> load<00:03:28.850> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
white so I just think I could load the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.920 
white so I just think I could load the
brush<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.989> put<00:03:30.319> a<00:03:30.560> nice<00:03:30.860> opaque<00:03:31.660> highlight<00:03:32.660> on

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
brush and put a nice opaque highlight on

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.080 
brush and put a nice opaque highlight on
there<00:03:33.290> see<00:03:34.299> just<00:03:35.299> blend<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.930> out<00:03:36.260> there<00:03:40.090> like

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
there see just blend it out there like

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.710 
there see just blend it out there like
that

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.410 

take<00:03:46.260> them<00:03:46.440> all<00:03:46.620> stick<00:03:47.010> very<00:03:47.460> maybe<00:03:48.090> just

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
take them all stick very maybe just

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.460 
take them all stick very maybe just
blend<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> little<00:03:48.960> bit<00:03:49.290> more<00:03:49.530> see<00:03:54.470> well

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
blend it a little bit more see well

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.380 
blend it a little bit more see well
let's<00:03:55.680> take<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.220> background<00:03:56.790> color<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.240> can

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
let's take the a background color I can

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.740 
let's take the a background color I can
glaze<00:03:57.750> on<00:03:58.050> there<00:03:58.490> we'll<00:03:59.490> take<00:03:59.730> some<00:04:00.000> phthalo

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
glaze on there we'll take some phthalo

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.970 
glaze on there we'll take some phthalo
green<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.290> some<00:04:01.440> ombre

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
green and some ombre

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.660 
green and some ombre
just<00:04:02.220> as<00:04:02.430> because<00:04:03.240> it's<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.540> rich<00:04:03.780> dark<00:04:04.670> and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
just as because it's a rich dark and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.540 
just as because it's a rich dark and
it's<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.970> cool<00:04:06.240> dark<00:04:06.630> see<00:04:07.140> very<00:04:07.380> thinly<00:04:07.770> again

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
it's a cool dark see very thinly again

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.900 
it's a cool dark see very thinly again
what's<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.420> medium<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.310> can<00:04:11.520> just<00:04:11.700> put

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
what's the medium and I can just put

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.680 
what's the medium and I can just put
that<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.150> top<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:14.070> hard<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.430> see<00:04:14.640> but<00:04:14.850> because

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
that on top it's hard to see but because

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:28.950 
that on top it's hard to see but because
it's<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.049> dark<00:04:16.380> but<00:04:16.709> there's<00:04:16.950> color<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.519> this

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.840 

see<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.830> key<00:04:30.039> though<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.250> just<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.669> keep

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
see that the key though is just to keep

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.529 
see that the key though is just to keep
it<00:04:31.060> thin<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.930> also<00:04:32.530> don't<00:04:32.979> make<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.639> don't

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
it thin and also don't make it to don't

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.390 
it thin and also don't make it to don't
make<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:34.840> runny<00:04:35.139> at<00:04:35.380> all<00:04:35.560> because<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.979> think<00:04:36.039> the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
make it runny at all because I think the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.700 
make it runny at all because I think the
the<00:04:36.880> myth<00:04:37.120> is<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.750> glaze<00:04:37.990> has<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.560> be

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
the myth is that the glaze has to be

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.900 
the myth is that the glaze has to be
very<00:04:38.979> wet<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:40.509> it<00:04:40.720> really<00:04:40.990> doesn't<00:04:41.350> so<00:04:41.910> here's

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
very wet and it really doesn't so here's

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.730 
very wet and it really doesn't so here's
some<00:04:43.150> ochre<00:04:43.600> we'll<00:04:43.810> put<00:04:43.990> this<00:04:44.139> on<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.530> table

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
some ochre we'll put this on the table

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.560 
some ochre we'll put this on the table
plane<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.590> see<00:04:47.860> it'll<00:04:48.340> look<00:04:48.759> luminous<00:04:49.030> is

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
plane and see it'll look luminous is

00:04:49.570 --> 00:05:01.780 
plane and see it'll look luminous is
that<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.350> light<00:04:50.560> comes<00:04:50.860> through<00:04:51.190> that

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.610 

and<00:05:02.360> actually<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.810> last<00:05:02.840> thing<00:05:03.260> we'll<00:05:03.410> do<00:05:03.590> is

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
and actually the last thing we'll do is

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.610 
and actually the last thing we'll do is
put<00:05:03.950> some<00:05:04.280> more<00:05:04.460> that<00:05:04.640> shadow<00:05:05.140> right<00:05:06.140> under

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
put some more that shadow right under

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:21.390 
put some more that shadow right under
the<00:05:06.800> lemon<00:05:07.280> right<00:05:07.730> here<00:05:08.090> see<00:05:09.190> right<00:05:10.190> there

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400
