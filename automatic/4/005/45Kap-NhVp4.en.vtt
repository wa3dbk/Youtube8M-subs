modern<00:00:27.869> look<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.289> look<00:00:28.500> I'd<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.099> city<00:00:29.400> of

skyscrapers who had explodes anyway huh

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.479 
skyscrapers who had explodes anyway huh
so<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> think<00:00:33.930> nature<00:00:34.739> has<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.129> such<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> bad

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

it's<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.230> check<00:00:40.680> could<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.040> seen<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.610> thought

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it's a check could be seen but I thought

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
it's a check could be seen but I thought
it<00:00:42.089> wasn't<00:00:42.239> an<00:00:42.390> interesting<00:00:42.989> expression<00:00:43.589> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it wasn't an interesting expression I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.670 
it wasn't an interesting expression I
loved<00:00:44.699> all<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> these<00:00:45.300> geometric<00:00:46.140> shapes<00:00:46.470> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
loved all of these geometric shapes that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.500 
loved all of these geometric shapes that
he<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:46.980> giving<00:00:47.339> us<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> colors<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
he was giving us and the colors and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.990 
he was giving us and the colors and
textures<00:00:49.050> everything<00:00:49.949> was<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.190> cohesive<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
textures everything was so cohesive and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
textures everything was so cohesive and
beautiful<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.079> contrast<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
beautiful I think the contrast of the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.040 
beautiful I think the contrast of the
texture<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.579> bit<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.269> glitter<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
texture is the bit of glitter with the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.530 
texture is the bit of glitter with the
stripes<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.460> ATS<00:00:56.879> within<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.300> really

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
stripes little bit ATS within a really

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.890 
stripes little bit ATS within a really
modern<00:00:57.720> way<00:00:58.280> it<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.549> so<00:01:00.089> much<00:01:00.299> about<00:01:00.570> new
