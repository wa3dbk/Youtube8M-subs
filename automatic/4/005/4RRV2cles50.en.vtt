called a unity statue and this is

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.709 
called a unity statue and this is
crafted<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.350> two<00:01:02.100> blocks<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.210> play<00:01:03.420> on

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
crafted like so two blocks of play on

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.410 
crafted like so two blocks of play on
top<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.739> stone<00:01:04.949> block<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.880> two<00:01:06.060> sticks

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
top of a stone block and then two sticks

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
top of a stone block and then two sticks
that<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:07.080> give<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> unity<00:01:07.680> statue<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
that will give you a unity statue so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.950 
that will give you a unity statue so
that's<00:01:08.820> pretty<00:01:09.000> easy<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> craft<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that's pretty easy to craft so it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.050 
that's pretty easy to craft so it
doesn't<00:01:10.470> make<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.740> too<00:01:10.890> difficult<00:01:10.920> which<00:01:11.850> i

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
doesn't make it too difficult which i

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
doesn't make it too difficult which i
think<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.360> good<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.320> previous

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
think is good because in previous

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.020 
think is good because in previous
versions<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> mod<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.610> buddy<00:01:14.790> just

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
versions of the mod the buddy just

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
versions of the mod the buddy just
spawned<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
spawned in with you and I think a lot of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.620 
spawned in with you and I think a lot of
people<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.600> don't

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
people are going to like that you don't

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.350 
people are going to like that you don't
have<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> buddy<00:01:19.409> by<00:01:19.860> default<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.520> some

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
have the buddy by default because some

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.580 
have the buddy by default because some
people<00:01:21.600> might<00:01:21.689> want<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> buddy<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.350> some

people might want the buddy in some

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.749 
people might want the buddy in some
worlds<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.729> others<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.610> your

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
the normal minecraft mobs adult

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.330 
the normal minecraft mobs adult
minecraft<00:05:23.210> mobs<00:05:23.600> um<00:05:23.870> also<00:05:24.500> they<00:05:24.919> don't<00:05:25.130> all

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
minecraft mobs um also they don't all

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.250 
minecraft mobs um also they don't all
just<00:05:25.700> go<00:05:25.789> down<00:05:25.940> like<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.300> scale<00:05:26.570> like<00:05:26.900> as<00:05:27.110> you

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
just go down like to scale like as you

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.440 
just go down like to scale like as you
can<00:05:27.380> see<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.680> bat<00:05:27.950> for<00:05:28.789> the<00:05:28.850> most<00:05:29.000> part<00:05:29.150> is<00:05:29.360> the

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
can see the bat for the most part is the

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.100 
can see the bat for the most part is the
same<00:05:29.630> size<00:05:29.900> but<00:05:30.889> the<00:05:31.210> ghast<00:05:32.210> is<00:05:33.639> much<00:05:34.639> smaller

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
same size but the ghast is much smaller

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.330 
same size but the ghast is much smaller
so<00:05:36.110> there<00:05:36.260> are<00:05:36.289> pretty<00:05:36.650> much<00:05:36.740> all<00:05:36.950> of<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.160> mobs

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
so there are pretty much all of the mobs

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.730 
so there are pretty much all of the mobs
that<00:05:37.460> you<00:05:37.639> can<00:05:37.760> find<00:05:37.970> in<00:05:38.120> Minecraft<00:05:38.740> these

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
that you can find in Minecraft these

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.409 
that you can find in Minecraft these

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
guys don't really do much but they are

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.940 
guys don't really do much but they are
invincible<00:05:41.720> and<00:05:42.200> they'll<00:05:42.380> follow<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.770> around

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
as long as you want them to as of now I

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.350 
as long as you want them to as of now I
don't<00:05:45.560> think<00:05:45.770> that<00:05:45.889> there's<00:05:45.979> a<00:05:46.100> way<00:05:46.340> to<00:05:46.400> get

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
don't think that there's a way to get

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.710 
don't think that there's a way to get
them<00:05:47.570> to<00:05:47.690> stop<00:05:48.050> following<00:05:48.470> you<00:05:49.389> but<00:05:50.389> you<00:05:50.600> know

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
them to stop following you but you know

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.300 
them to stop following you but you know

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
that's fine I don't really think that

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.279 
that's fine I don't really think that
