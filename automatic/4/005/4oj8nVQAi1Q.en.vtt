00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.819
 I am the only specialized gallery in a Paris street 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.669
 then art brut is a notion that was invented percent in the middle of 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.669
 40s by the French painter buffet people 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.700
 vicat the ifi 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.740
 vic% to an art that is made by people who are actually 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.419
 paz artists 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.769
 we can divide the ultra tree into three categories we have what we called 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.079
 still the late 19th and early 20th century the art of fools 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.060
 we have what is called 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.450
 later with the Surrealists the army of bnic 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.399
 which is an art made by people 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.579
 who thinks to be inspired by spirits and finally the third category c 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.250
 those to add to the buffet 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.210
 then to bring these three categories together in the rubric so the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.560
 third category of the buffet 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.090
 it's the one he called 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000
 the category of the common man 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.620
 For the time being it was used the work of the patients to be able to try to make of it 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.440
 a grid of pathological analysts 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.430
 and some psychiatrists it's May 10 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.100
 these are works that are of interest 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.659
 and percent they started writing to some men 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.400
 of books so some of these titles came in we were very experienced a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.190
 great importance in the history of modern art 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.680
 we speak for example when we can quote for example the December price it was 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.170
 psychiatrist at the clinic of berlin street in germany 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.800
 while one of the features in the art brut is 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.970
 given the personality of the creators years that one has to do these 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.440
 two meetings obviously a lot of effort 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.760
 often defends him 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.270
 which is the most conducive 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.400
 % the expression 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.810
 an emotion 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.460
 of a feeling 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.420
 and in e2 but raises 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.750
 nor wait 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.170
 a libya to acquire a technique so it's true that there was a lot of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.140
 drawing 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.010
 few people know 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.679
 that picasso key 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.040
 come dine ski 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.890
 closer to us and niki of saint phalle in e 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.700
 besides the elite championship and real art collectors 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.769
 and that some of his works have inspired them 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.309
 step by step 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:12.879
 art lovers 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.399
 we integrated you for some 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.379
 pieces of art in their collection because they were when 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.129
 same insight that we often had to deal with offers excessively 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.959
 strong who do not cheat 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.359
 the fresh offers 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.809
 it's by people 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.939
 that did not happen to sell them 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.919
 sometimes not even to show them 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.139
 but simply because he needed 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.139
 to create and its relationship to creation
