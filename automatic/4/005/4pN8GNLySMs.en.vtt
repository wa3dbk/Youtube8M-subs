00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.310
 Combine is not cheap, but to buy all the necessary equipment 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.990
 for the kitchen alone is not convenient. 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.759
 PANASONIC offers an affordable outlet, at least for 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.610
 two devices, fitting a blender in one device 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.679
 and juicer. 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.000
 What came out of it and how comfortable is it? 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.990
 Let's see now. 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.990
 Immediately note the compactness - no need to look in the kitchen 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.870
 place for juicers and blenders. 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.230
 The device is made as carefully as possible. 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.079
 It is easy to prepare for work. 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.420
 That's how we collect the juicer. 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.430
 We really liked the traditionally high quality of PANASONIC. 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.600
 All parts fit snugly together, juicer 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.609
 reliably fixed by these snaps. 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.690
 A big plus is a stainless steel centrifuge. 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.170
 The holes here are small, which allows you to get 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.170
 pure juice, without pulp. 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.020
 We tested the juicer by preparing an orange 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.560
 the juice. 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.009
 Just say about a small flaw - a small 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.009
 neck. 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.691
 Fruits need to be pre-cut into slices to 

00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:14.691
 they climbed inside. 

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:18.100
 Inconvenient and the fact that there is no capacity for juice. 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.250
 The device is controlled by these stylish buttons. 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.789
 To prepare the juice, click on this button. 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.950
 The juicer does not vibrate and does not spray anything. 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.500
 For squeezing delicate fruits, for example, strawberries, there are 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.509
 ripple mode. 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.869
 Juice is served constantly, and, as you can see, really 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:36.940
 without pulp. 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 The cake is collected in this container. 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.320
 After pressing the cake dry enough - juicer is good 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.930
 copes with its task. 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.520
 But we will not be content with banal orange 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 fresh juice 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.079
 The presence of the complete blender allows you to immediately cook 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.640
 a variety of cocktails. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.510
 Remove the skoyokomzhalku. 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.090
 Please note that the instrument case is absolutely 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 clean. 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.360
 Install the blender. 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.979
 Note that the manufacturers did not intend to save 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:03.979
 on the device. 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.109
 The blender bowl is made of glass, this can be seen 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.259
 mostly with expensive blender models. 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.290
 From above, it is tightly closed with a rubberized lid. 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.432
 If you need to add sugar or spices, there is a special 

00:02:16.432 --> 00:02:19.129
 cap, so as not to open the entire container. 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.120
 So, pour our fresh juice, add cream and mix. 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.510
 The blender has two speeds. 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.360
 The power of the motor is 230 W - this is quite enough to 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.230
 quickly beat our cocktail to the desired consistency. 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.500
 We have such a non-alcoholic version. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500
 Pina colada. 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.141
 As you can see, the combination of a juicer and a blender is very convenient. 

00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:43.980
 - you can quickly prepare cocktails with 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.410
 natural juice, while not limiting your 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.920
 fantasy and preferences. 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.269
 Of course, blender can be used not only 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.120
 for mixing cocktails. 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.160
 Motor power and quality knife is enough for 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.129
 grind coffee beans, ice, greens 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.530
 or just make yourself a fruit curd 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.629
 breakfast. 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.310
 I also want to add that all the details are very easy. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.209
 wash even in cold water. 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.230
 And for the centrifuge there is a special brush, so 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.430
 all small holes can be quickly and easily cleaned. 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.220
 So, we make a verdict to this device. 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.450
 The combination of juicer and blender is very convenient 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.150
 - and save space, and can significantly diversify 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.150
 cocktail diet. 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.830
 Both the juicer and blender are very high quality. 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.459
 and work for five plus. 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.280
 In short, the idea of ​​PANASONIC was a success.
