 you can put ltsu but I'm still 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.260
 find out at what distance steel 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.680
 opponent and calmly hang him 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.810
 hotshot then leave empty since 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.170
 muzzle brake and silencer will cut 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.060
