00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:10.069
 Meet the next speaker is 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.069
 Sergey Ballin mathematician game developer 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.690
 now now and people who are in this room 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.570
 drank tea 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:27.930
 find out that Sergei ball he wants to say 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.550
 they have enough for him to drink and there is time to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.340
 they have not started yet i something 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 I will say and then begin well, hello, I 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.500
 very glad to see you at all I wanted 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.190
 make a speech which was called 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.440
 about society like a salmon but I realized that 6 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 minutes a small enough time to something 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.190
 explain generally in principle therefore 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.399
 decided something earthly such a feeling to me 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.430
 I'm not really connected to a specialist there. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.440
 drugs and all such matters but i 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.149
 in short brought one thing cool and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.800
 now I really want to show him 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.020
 six minutes is too small to understand everything 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.339
 details so I will exaggerate too much 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.710
 that 's all 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.150
 too draw u then there is well then 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.220
 discuss after the time is over 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.799
 well, let's probably start so you 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 see here i drew a cup of coffee on 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.000
 in fact, it goes not only about tea 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 so about coffee and about mother and about 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.729
 many, many all sorts of drinks that you 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 see here they all contain caffeine 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.200
 there are whole industries that sell 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.759
 caffeine who you go to the supermarket 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.060
 a whole department with a cafe with new products 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.619
 why why it happened here I want 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 tell about it and want to tell 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.430
 why I refused it that is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.040
 I'm not drinking tea right now with 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.350
 August 2013 there was a big pause until 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.540
 July 2013 there were some pauses then 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.310
 I started to think about it 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.200
 for a number of reasons it happened that 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 as soon as i stopped drinking tea i 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.570
 stopped drinking tea well, somehow it happened 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.130
 that's why this happened to my life in 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.290
 specifically in my case first was 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.880
 such a problem when i go to bed me 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.159
 in my head there is such 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.259
 do you understand a lot of thoughts do not let me fall asleep 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.780
 something needs to be remembered 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.670
 write down and you need to invent something urgently 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.160
 I think many have come across this and this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.750
 the phenomenon has completely disappeared 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.960
 from my life as soon as i stopped it 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.170
 do here the second phenomenon back is 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.900
 morning when you wake up and you are not yet 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.970
 drank a cup of coffee here you feel 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.370
 something like this so many with this 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.810
 faced the feeling of such weakness 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.080
 also absolutely 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.230
 left me i'm happy about it now we 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.960
 go to the hero of the occasion that is 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.050
 who is responsible for all this this mr 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.780
 caffeine here it is depicted with such a gray 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.640
 raincoat and then find out why here at all 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.680
 saying this alien body for our 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.020
 this substance is not produced by the body 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.590
 us inside it is not something native 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.540
 but the native substance under which 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.330
 caffeine like is adenosine 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.910
 Here is such a kind guy who on you 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.470
 just says calm down his very 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.860
 the main goal is to relax all your 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.450
 cells to the brain to think slower 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.010
 and slower to calm down and 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.650
 finally fell asleep at night 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.420
 that is, he has to brake all day long 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.490
 so you braked braked braked and 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.910
 finally slept like this happens on 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.730
 the cell membrane is located receptor one 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.790
 big protein steep which is susceptible 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.190
 to gasoline and when it comes in contact with them 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:33.180
 cell hinders everything very simple here on 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.459
 in fact, these receptors are very important 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.780
 on nerve cells because that's it 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.110
 represented no cells see here 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.670
 three such buttons that one 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.730
 the mechanism is responsible for what we have 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.230
 wakefulness changes to sleep and well 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.090
 sometimes we cheerfully sometimes we are not cheerful 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.980
 because sometimes before nazin a lot sometimes 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.080
 before nazin little and now we find out that 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.220
 does treacherous caffeine he does very 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.510
 cool he closes this button so 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.510
 I can not see for adenosine 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.720
 that's why the effect is the following 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.690
 there is no button for this six more 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.560
 hours adenosine have nothing to do and buttons 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.180
 not pressed 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.220
 impulses are beginning to be more 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.709
 more and more porridge begins to boil 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.180
 the brain is very strong and very fast on it 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.070
 everything is looking at the brain department which 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.740
 called the pituitary gland and says damn me 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.460
 in the brain of accounting is probably a dog 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.600
 me running 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.580
 or death and urgently pours adrenaline into 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.620
 blood that's why you feel 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.110
 cheerfulness you have expanded veins there 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.730
 pupil expands everything cool world brighter 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.550
 it becomes you become like this 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.820
 superman and then there is a question like 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.410
 it would be cool to eat caffeine because 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.020
 you will be like that 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.150
 but in fact atanasyan is very mean 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.370
 he understands that it is impossible to leave it 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.100
 need to complain about who should and he 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.270
 starts complaining he takes his 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.220
 own micro molecular phone and 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.080
 calling brain says mons listen here 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.050
 such a thing I fit the cells there is not 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.910
 buttons miracle happens I do not understand 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.740
 do something the brain doesn't know what 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.020
 do and think damn well, just a few buttons 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.150
 release more buttons guys figure it out 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.310
 what happens here as a result 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
 the next nero who had small 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.720
 number of buttons 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.150
 now all strewn in the buttons now 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.340
 when caffeine comes there seems to be all 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.110
 ok there are free buttons but this 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.990
 means you need more caffeine now 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.030
 here and if you refuse it on caffeine 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.700
 adenosine will come on all the buttons will click and 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.800
 you will be very slow 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.900
 here it is displayed on this diagram that is 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.419
 Finnish discharge first feel 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.790
 ok in a cafe us cheerfully when you 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.919
 you constantly use it without 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.750
 caffeine feel broken on a with 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.919
 caffeine is normal and in order to 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.020
 feel vigorously you need 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.419
 increased dose 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.540
 everything seems to be clear but one question 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.669
 how did it happen that such a cool 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.240
 organism evolving all life 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.820
 I bought such a scheme , I think that somewhere 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.560
 in evolution there should have been a split and 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.540
 caffeine should have appeared 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.490
 man is it really just a couple there 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.020
 genes to change for this one 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.060
 the mechanism is a bit messed up and you were 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.660
 constantly vigorous really nothing 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.300
 Oslo 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.010
 wife but i think there is a reason number 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.110
 one why it did not work out first 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.490
 if you put a gun on you and charged 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.410
 and you know what he can do, we 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.780
 You never fall asleep in no way a 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.920
 adenosine will not let you do it well 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.440
 what are the real factors that 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.930
 make you be awake this from 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.150
 negative realms to example the second example 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.970
 from the positive realm there are other things 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.320
 which make you not sleep happens 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.870
 some of the things that you carry with 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.450
 full of enthusiasm and which you can 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.790
 yes for the very morning without caffeine 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.080
 without any substances just do do 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.170
 and do it because you are very 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.790
 interesting and I think that this is the main 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.200
 factors that allowed to do so 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.510
 that the caffeine man still did not survive 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:03.610
 a guilty person here he was a Christian 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.950
 for some reason in the end turned out to be wrong 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.030
 effective as a reasonable person 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.430
 I mean, I think that 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.740
 evolutionarily all the mechanisms are correct and 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.990
 we just treat him like that 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.910
 as if the coffee is invigorating but we saw that 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.830
 actually turns out some 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.810
 the substitution of classes I want you 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.940
 different attitude to lethargy lethargy 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.590
 it's cool if you sleep on pairs so 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.180
 go home at all sleep sleep at work 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.610
 quit such work 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.169
 see if you feel sluggish 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.630
 your body says it's not like you 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:42.340
 need somewhere and your source 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:46.810
 cheerfulness life this is life it is such 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:48.700
 and it has everything to be 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.320
 cool unnecessary deceive adoption 

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.210
 you need to feel a little more and you 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.620
 understand that there are all the mechanisms that 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.620
 let you be wide awake
