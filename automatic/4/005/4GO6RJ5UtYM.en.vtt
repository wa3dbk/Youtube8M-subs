just a daily makeup brush cleanser and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.650 
just a daily makeup brush cleanser and
basically<00:03:16.670> what<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:16.880> do<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.239> just<00:03:17.269> spray

basically what you do is you just spray

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.810 
basically what you do is you just spray
it<00:03:17.690> on<00:03:17.840> your<00:03:17.959> brushes<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.650> wipe<00:03:19.549> them<00:03:19.700> on
