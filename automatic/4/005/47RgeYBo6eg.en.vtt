00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.960 
put my thumbnail in there and I take a
pry<00:00:35.840> tool<00:00:35.870> something<00:00:36.680> like<00:00:36.860> this<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.610> knife

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
pry tool something like this and a knife

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.540 
pry tool something like this and a knife
works<00:00:38.239> good<00:00:38.570> if<00:00:38.719> you<00:00:38.870> it's<00:00:39.649> really<00:00:40.130> fine<00:00:40.399> to

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
works good if you it's really fine to

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.170 
works good if you it's really fine to
get<00:00:40.640> in<00:00:40.790> here

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
get in here

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.600 
get in here
anyways<00:00:41.600> if<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.100> pry<00:00:43.100> out<00:00:43.280> with<00:00:43.460> your

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
anyways if you pry out with your

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.419 
anyways if you pry out with your
thumbnail<00:00:44.230> get<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:45.440> thing<00:00:45.710> started<00:00:46.070> in

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
thumbnail get this thing started in

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.639 
thumbnail get this thing started in
there<00:00:48.039> then<00:00:49.690> you're<00:00:50.690> probably<00:00:50.960> able<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.440> hold

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
there then you're probably able to hold

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.099 
there then you're probably able to hold
it<00:00:51.769> until<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:52.160> get<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.370> pry<00:00:52.609> tool<00:00:52.809> like<00:00:53.809> this<00:00:54.079> a

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
it until you get a pry tool like this a

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
it until you get a pry tool like this a
little<00:00:54.379> plastic<00:00:54.620> pry<00:00:55.039> tool<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:56.499> then<00:01:00.129> once

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
little plastic pry tool and then once

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.210 
little plastic pry tool and then once
you're<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:01.370> there<00:01:03.550> your<00:01:04.550> fingernails<00:01:05.120> help

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
you're in there your fingernails help

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.970 
you're in there your fingernails help
then<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:07.250> just<00:01:07.550> kind<00:01:07.760> of<00:01:08.500> keep<00:01:09.500> working<00:01:09.860> it

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
then you just kind of keep working it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.490 
then you just kind of keep working it
down<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.340> side<00:01:10.900> then<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:11.990> would<00:01:12.110> recommend

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
down the side then I would recommend

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.280 
down the side then I would recommend
before<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:12.830> go<00:01:13.010> all<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.280> way<00:01:13.460> down<00:01:14.260> come<00:01:15.260> back

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
before you go all the way down come back

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.730 
before you go all the way down come back
up<00:01:15.470> here<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:18.800> bring<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.280> top<00:01:19.520> around<00:01:20.740> like

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
up here to bring the top around like

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
up here to bring the top around like
this<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:24.170> if<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:24.380> just<00:01:24.560> keep<00:01:24.770> sliding

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.090 

all<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.760> down<00:01:30.000> around<00:01:33.680> sometimes<00:01:34.680> using

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
all the way down around sometimes using

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.940 
all the way down around sometimes using
your<00:01:35.250> finger<00:01:36.980> nail<00:01:37.980> in<00:01:38.160> there<00:01:38.370> still<00:01:38.790> helps<00:01:39.950> as

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
your finger nail in there still helps as

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.610 
your finger nail in there still helps as
you<00:01:41.220> slide<00:01:41.550> down<00:01:41.580> through<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> can't

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
you slide down through there so I can't

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.460 
you slide down through there so I can't
show<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.010> best<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.370> my<00:01:47.520> camera<00:01:48.470> then

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
show it the best with my camera then

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.160 
show it the best with my camera then
just<00:01:49.920> bring<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.850> down<00:01:50.970> around<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.870> bottom

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
just bring it down around to the bottom

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.200 
just bring it down around to the bottom
there<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:57.980> to<00:01:58.980> put<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.250> back<00:01:59.430> cover<00:01:59.460> back<00:01:59.970> on

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
there this to put the back cover back on

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.540 
there this to put the back cover back on
I<00:02:01.369> would<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.520> set<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.940> on<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:04.250> then<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.430> can

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
I would just set it on here then you can

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.100 
I would just set it on here then you can
start<00:02:05.850> anywhere<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.479> start<00:02:06.720> at<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.840> top

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
start anywhere you can start at the top

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.850 
start anywhere you can start at the top
and<00:02:07.410> just<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.830> sure<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.040> it's<00:02:08.340> lined<00:02:08.580> up

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
and just make sure that it's lined up

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.030 
and just make sure that it's lined up
start<00:02:10.860> snapping<00:02:11.340> things<00:02:11.550> together<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:13.040> go

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
start snapping things together just go

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.740 
start snapping things together just go
down<00:02:14.280> around<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.730> side<00:02:15.920> keep<00:02:16.920> going<00:02:17.220> around
