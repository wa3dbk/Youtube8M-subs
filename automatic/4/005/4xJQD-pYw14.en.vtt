good match for my skin tone cuz it's a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.569 
good match for my skin tone cuz it's a
lot<00:00:29.670> peach<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.119> than<00:00:30.810> my<00:00:30.900> skin<00:00:31.170> tone<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:32.160> it

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

lot peach here than my skin tone but it
makes<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.210> good<00:00:33.559> under-eye<00:00:34.559> concealer

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
makes a really good under-eye concealer

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
makes a really good under-eye concealer
because<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.940> cancels<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.480> circles<00:00:37.050> really

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
because it cancels out circles really

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.979 
because it cancels out circles really
well<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.820> color<00:00:39.030> works<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
well so the color works for that it's a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.549 
well so the color works for that it's a
super<00:00:40.590> soft<00:00:40.920> pencil<00:00:41.640> one<00:00:42.390> concern<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.379> I

my creases right there so my feelings
about<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.970> concealer<00:01:39.510> are<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.370> it<00:01:41.370> has

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
about this concealer are that it has

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.380 
about this concealer are that it has
good<00:01:41.910> coverage<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.750> nice<00:01:43.400> but<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.520> have

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
good coverage it's nice but I do have

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.480 
good coverage it's nice but I do have
somewhat<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.140> problem<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.890> creasing

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
somewhat of a problem with it creasing

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.240 
somewhat of a problem with it creasing
and<00:01:47.670> settling<00:01:48.180> into<00:01:48.479> fine<00:01:48.510> lines<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:50.040> have

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
and settling into fine lines I just have

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.830 
and settling into fine lines I just have
to<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.460> careful<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.910> I<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.119> bring<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.720> out

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
to be careful that I don't bring it out

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.930 
to be careful that I don't bring it out
too<00:01:52.170> far<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.280> does<00:01:53.460> not<00:01:53.580> settle

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
too far this way so it does not settle

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.060 
too far this way so it does not settle
into<00:01:54.210> fine<00:01:54.240> lines<00:01:54.479> these<00:01:55.380> creases<00:01:55.740> right

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
into fine lines these creases right

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.219 
into fine lines these creases right
under<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> mean<00:01:57.060> most<00:01:57.360> concealers<00:01:57.869> settle

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
under here I mean most concealers settle

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.160 
under here I mean most concealers settle
into<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.700> area<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.330> best<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.720> just<00:02:00.810> kind

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
into that area so it's best to just kind

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.670 
into that area so it's best to just kind
of<00:02:01.229> blend<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.009> there<00:02:02.130> afterwards<00:02:03.680> with

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
of blend it out of there afterwards with

of blend it out of there afterwards with
this<00:02:04.830> concealer<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:05.820> best<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.180> just

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
