00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.159
 creating a new dwelling 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.820
 except disassembly and installation 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.200
 partitions usually includes 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.730
 replacing gender and in most cases 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.280
 laying a new polo lead in 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.789
 significantly less labor than 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.789
 expensive repair old 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.230
 after the construction of partitions and walls we 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.539
 we begin to level the regiment by pouring 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.920
 first and very responsible 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.999
 operation 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.020
 installation of guide beacons 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.760
 subsequently, it is on these guides 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.760
 and the floor will level out 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.240
 guides are installed 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.340
 along the room throughout the area 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.040
 the first beacon is set to 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.700
 distance 20 gray 30 millimeters from the wall 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.380
 second third and follow on 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.580
 distance thousand terry thousand composition 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.580
 millimeters from the last 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.360
 for installation 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.590
 we will need a thick cement or 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.020
 plaster solution which will 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 guide rails installed 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.690
 setting the beacons in place we start 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.840
 check horizontal and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.010
 rule and level in all directions 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.760
 checking and securing beacons in place give 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 they dry up 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.080
 if everything meets the standards 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.600
 we start the bay of the dome special 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 cement mortar 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.460
 mix according to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.210
 instructions manufacturers solution 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.530
 bringing it to creamy 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.040
 consistency and proceed pouring 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040
 sex 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.429
 pour the prepared mixture 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.999
 across the floor starting room corner failure 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.719
 carefully fills everything completely gap in 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.599
 avoid the appearance of irregularities 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.400
 start smoothing the solution 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.809
 on the surface 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.889
 perfectly straight edge rule should 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.279
 move along guide rails 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.279
 like a paris 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.939
 smooth out the first batch of solution 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.699
 get ready next and fill 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.649
 continuation of the first in this way 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.759
 poured all prepared 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.759
 surface 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.180
 smoothing by the rule we couldn't not 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.219
 connection of two batches of solution 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.409
 make sure not to form years 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.879
 wavy convex butt 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.879
 different consistency of the solution 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.199
 completely flooded the floor will dry out 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:15.119
 feedbacks up to 30 ti rk court 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:16.729
 then you can start
