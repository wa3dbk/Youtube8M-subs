four thirty inches off the floor which

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.749 
four thirty inches off the floor which
means<00:00:25.380> we're<00:00:25.800> not<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.250> able<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.520> tie

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
means we're not going to be able to tie

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.729 
means we're not going to be able to tie

the from the toilet or the bar sink or
our<00:00:36.690> bathroom<00:00:37.260> sink<00:00:37.500> we're<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
our bathroom sink we're going to have to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.329 
our bathroom sink we're going to have to
use<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> sewage<00:00:38.820> ejector<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:40.070> water<00:00:41.070> don't

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
use a sewage ejector because water don't

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.860 
use a sewage ejector because water don't
run<00:00:41.519> uphill<00:00:41.730> all<00:00:42.269> right<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.570> we're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.809> to

have to pump up into that line and we're
going<00:00:46.499> to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.649> using<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.280> sewage<00:00:47.609> ejector<00:00:48.440> let

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
going to be using the sewage ejector let

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.189 
going to be using the sewage ejector let
she'll<00:00:49.679> be<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.039> floor<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.019> see

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
comes with the sewage ejector pits and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.510 
comes with the sewage ejector pits and
if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> jump<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.330> over<00:01:12.479> top<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> pit

if you jump up over top of the pit
there's<00:01:14.520> where<00:01:14.759> we<00:01:14.850> Jack<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> floor<00:01:15.590> straight

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
there's where we Jack the floor straight

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.469 
there's where we Jack the floor straight
over<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.189> our<00:01:17.219> toilet<00:01:17.759> flange<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.329> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
over to our toilet flange which is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.880 
over to our toilet flange which is
turned<00:01:18.719> up<00:01:18.960> right<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> bathroom

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
turned up right there in the bathroom

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.219 
turned up right there in the bathroom
and<00:01:20.369> that's<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.700> three<00:01:21.090> inch<00:01:21.270> PVC<00:01:21.540> coming

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and that's all three inch PVC coming

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.120 
and that's all three inch PVC coming
down<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.539> right<00:01:24.539> inside<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.020> pit<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.950> right

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
down and right inside the pit all right

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.399 
down and right inside the pit all right
so<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.399> how<00:01:26.579> that<00:01:26.789> gets<00:01:27.000> set<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:28.399> and

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
so that's how that gets set up and

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.359 
so that's how that gets set up and
that's<00:01:31.409> how<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.560> Jack<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> floor<00:01:32.219> and

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
that's how we Jack the floor and

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.389 
that's how we Jack the floor and
get<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.060> under<00:01:35.360> underground<00:01:36.350> plumbing<00:01:36.979> under

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
get it under underground plumbing under

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.880 
get it under underground plumbing under
the<00:01:37.490> floor<00:01:37.759> plumbing<00:01:38.290> under<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.409> concrete

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
the floor plumbing under the concrete

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.760 
the floor plumbing under the concrete
slab<00:01:40.159> plumbing<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.030> pit<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:42.020> then<00:01:42.590> our

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
slab plumbing to the pit and then our

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.940 
slab plumbing to the pit and then our
sewage<00:01:43.070> ejector<00:01:44.049> grinder<00:01:45.049> pump<00:01:45.350> will<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.680> down

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
sewage ejector grinder pump will be down

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.480 
sewage ejector grinder pump will be down
in<00:01:46.220> there<00:01:46.430> in<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.939> bottom<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.329> that<00:01:47.390> pit<00:01:47.689> and

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
in there in the bottom of that pit and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.340 
in there in the bottom of that pit and
when<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.610> float<00:01:49.880> comes<00:01:50.210> up<00:01:50.450> inside<00:01:50.840> there<00:01:51.140> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
when the float comes up inside there and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.990 
when the float comes up inside there and
the<00:01:51.439> water<00:01:51.619> gets<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.039> certain<00:01:52.429> level<00:01:52.580> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the water gets to a certain level the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.330 
the water gets to a certain level the
sewage<00:01:53.780> ejector<00:01:53.840> motor<00:01:54.350> will<00:01:54.560> kick<00:01:54.799> on<00:01:55.009> and

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
sewage ejector motor will kick on and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.179 
sewage ejector motor will kick on and
we'll<00:01:56.330> pump<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.780> sewage<00:01:57.170> up<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:59.890> into<00:02:00.890> one<00:02:01.070> of

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
we'll pump the sewage up and into one of

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.620 
we'll pump the sewage up and into one of
these<00:02:01.280> three<00:02:01.549> inch<00:02:01.820> lines<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.539> you<00:02:02.600> see

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
these three inch lines that you see

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.090 
these three inch lines that you see
strapped<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.439> wall<00:02:03.590> here<00:02:03.799> from<00:02:04.009> the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
strapped to the wall here from the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.219 
strapped to the wall here from the
Builder<00:02:04.460> we're<00:02:05.210> going<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.420> tie<00:02:05.630> into<00:02:05.929> there

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
Builder we're going to tie into there

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.539 
Builder we're going to tie into there
and<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.899> pump<00:02:09.170> will<00:02:09.319> push<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.739> sewage<00:02:10.100> up<00:02:10.310> and

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
and the pump will push the sewage up and

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.490 
and the pump will push the sewage up and
into<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.150> pipe<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.660> then<00:02:11.840> it'll<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:12.319> take

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
into that pipe and then it'll just take

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.350 
into that pipe and then it'll just take
a<00:02:12.560> gravity<00:02:13.160> ride<00:02:13.370> right<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:13.880> out<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.150> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
a gravity ride right on out to the
