00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
sure this opening here stays in the

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:05.900 
sure this opening here stays in the
middle

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.100 

but<00:07:07.800> since<00:07:08.800> my<00:07:09.010> models<00:07:09.460> too<00:07:09.640> big<00:07:09.790> my<00:07:10.150> opening

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
but since my models too big my opening

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.810 
but since my models too big my opening
is<00:07:11.230> all<00:07:11.380> way<00:07:11.500> down<00:07:11.530> here<00:07:12.010> so<00:07:12.340> I'm<00:07:12.520> going<00:07:12.730> to

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
is all way down here so I'm going to

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:21.770 
is all way down here so I'm going to
take<00:07:13.030> that<00:07:13.090> off<00:07:14.550> and<00:07:15.550> now<00:07:16.210> you<00:07:16.240> take<00:07:16.390> the<00:07:16.780> meat

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.850 

and<00:07:23.220> this<00:07:24.220> may<00:07:24.370> be<00:07:24.430> a<00:07:24.580> long<00:07:24.730> process<00:07:24.970> but<00:07:25.860> it's

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:26.860 
and this may be a long process but it's

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.010 
and this may be a long process but it's
fun<00:07:27.190> and<00:07:27.490> can<00:07:28.150> do<00:07:28.270> it<00:07:28.390> with<00:07:28.510> a<00:07:28.540> lot<00:07:28.720> of<00:07:28.750> people

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
fun and can do it with a lot of people

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.780 
fun and can do it with a lot of people
and<00:07:30.060> it<00:07:31.060> is<00:07:31.240> good<00:07:31.450> so<00:07:32.340> then<00:07:33.340> I<00:07:33.430> guess<00:07:33.610> the<00:07:33.700> way

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:33.790 
and it is good so then I guess the way

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.380 
and it is good so then I guess the way
to<00:07:33.850> do<00:07:34.030> is<00:07:34.270> um<00:07:34.600> I<00:07:35.160> don't<00:07:36.160> next<00:07:36.460> coming<00:07:36.670> from<00:07:36.790> but

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.390 
to do is um I don't next coming from but

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.720 
to do is um I don't next coming from but
you<00:07:37.660> just<00:07:38.020> stuff<00:07:38.290> it<00:07:38.440> in<00:07:40.230> and<00:07:41.310> use<00:07:42.310> your<00:07:42.430> thumbs

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:42.730 
you just stuff it in and use your thumbs

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:49.710 
you just stuff it in and use your thumbs
to<00:07:42.940> just<00:07:43.510> push<00:07:43.810> it<00:07:43.840> in<00:07:44.170> some<00:07:45.210> just<00:07:48.390> some<00:07:49.390> people

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 
to just push it in some just some people

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.070 
to just push it in some just some people
don't<00:07:49.870> use<00:07:50.020> the<00:07:50.320> bottle<00:07:50.650> technique<00:07:51.370> but<00:07:52.080> it

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 
don't use the bottle technique but it

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.990 
don't use the bottle technique but it
does<00:07:53.380> make<00:07:53.530> it<00:07:53.710> easier<00:07:53.740> you<00:07:54.370> can<00:07:54.520> just<00:07:54.669> go<00:07:54.850> and

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 
does make it easier you can just go and

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.210 
does make it easier you can just go and
grab<00:07:55.180> piece<00:07:55.870> of<00:07:56.020> meat<00:07:56.200> and<00:07:58.560> grab<00:07:59.560> a<00:07:59.830> little<00:08:00.040> bit
