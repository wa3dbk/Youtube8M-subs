00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.620
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.599
 oriental as a tooth household if he 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.080
 Often the problem was not understood too 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.269
 become 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.550
 how do i explain my patient to her 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 and situation as documented and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 I visualize my work on 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.570
 The easiest way is to show a photo 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.490
 A picture is worth a thousand words 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.670
 Give me as well as if I were what you 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.340
 I understand it much better decide 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.469
 are picture quality and easy operation 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.700
 it would be nice on the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.640
 to press the trigger 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.750
 and you would have a perfect picture 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.500
 expect also from your holidays 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 Camera or and that goes with the you 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.329
 next from orange dental what the special 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.480
 I can not do that for you 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.480
 to explain 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 You must see that the handling is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 totally click once and the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 autofocus activates again longer 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.309
 click and voila 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.559
 Here is the first picture you have 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.510
 I saw the camera horizontally 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.000
 kept like a dental 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.310
 instrument and still an upright 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.869
 and times correct image get a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.820
 usual camera would have to be vertical 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.220
 hold for an upright image 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 to get 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.689
 with mandible recording it is still 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.110
 okay with upper jaw recordings will that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.960
 Handling already much more difficult 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.689
 in the page number range they would 91 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.210
 degree representatives get the picture 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 At first camera is unique to you 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.050
 as the only one has an automatic picture 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.960
 movement 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.120
 if you change from luca to the picture 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.770
 always upright and times right when 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.420
 they are in the page number range 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.640
 are always upright and sides 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.950
 real picture and even if they are from 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.750
 Cup is changing too little real that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.870
 picture still upright and show 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.120
 properly without any rework though we 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.790
 when photographing perspective and side 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.840
 have changed 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.670
 now your patients understand too 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.080
 easier because they want to show them 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.030
 and are not completely confused by 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.710
 constantly turning back and forth the pictures 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.330
 a great camera 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.660
 With that you can even have a look inside 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.380
 the root canal do not worry though 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.030
 You could 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:25.460
 I will demonstrate this briefly on one 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:27.380
 so lighter in a nutshell 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.780
 always upright in the picture by the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.600
 automatic picture rotation guaranteed 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.830
 sharp pictures thanks to autofocus and 250th 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.180
 fold magnification thanks 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.489
 high performance optics a picture with the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.010
 select shows more than 1000 advantages 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.030
 So what are you waiting for a solution 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.450
 from orange dental ergo fantastic 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.450
 drastically good
