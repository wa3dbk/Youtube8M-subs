00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.020
 frenkel percent 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.820
 today, fifa 13 against 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.820
 internal ensures fast 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.850
 Good day, ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.400
 welcome to us in the 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.320
 chip arena in a hard-hitting way 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.599
 Comparison test here are the two 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.840
 Greatest soccer games of your time 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.700
 on the one hand the current fifa 13 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.470
 and the challenger that is 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.430
 International soccer from the year 1983 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.019
 so now I 'm not so bothered anymore 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.220
 neat and therefore better to store 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.000
 as the beak has grown for me 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.000
 I would say yes 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.720
 worth mentioning to the international soccer 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.489
 maybe it's five yet 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.059
 for years on the c64 the non plus 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.199
 was under and only 88 of microsoft 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.390
 was replaced 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.220
 the game is going on a good land lord 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.670
 Colleague this game is running now 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.670
 also 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.770
 what's up times, first to graphics to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.480
 say clearly every cell phone one 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.100
 five-year-old has me better graphics 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.650
 nowadays as the house already on the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.570
 monitor expires but at that time that was 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.940
 great and we had nothing 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.410
 yes you may have to give here 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.820
 that the ball is not really round 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.560
 as it is called in old wisdom yes 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.090
 and the fact the round into the square 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.090
 but the square in the square 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:34.600
 and that he was a horny goal or 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.030
 good and now let's have a look 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.069
 fifa 13 I have not had a long time 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.189
 more football is seen a few 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.020
 years ago 23 so not since 1983 though 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.280
 but a few years and as me 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.929
 that I saw here now was me 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.149
 pretty nice of the socks 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.490
 how detailed that is and the 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.020
 great that looks in terms of 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.209
 love of detail only a small one 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.950
 example here the computer-controlled 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.329
 Players even ask for passports by asking 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.159
 thus gesturing the hands as sees 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.689
 Her skills are up there and around 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.340
 of course you can say now 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.520
 only small stuff of the sum does that 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.869
 a lot of atmosphere and that one 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.849
 the players can really recognize 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.430
 that is now standard 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.780
 yes what should I say in optics yet 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.780
 Variety is 1 0 in leadership 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.160
 international soccer the sound so the 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.720
 referee whistle is the hammer or 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.730
 so horny 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.470
 But you have to do a few small ones as well 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.250
 Weakening admitting the ball sounds 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.250
 rather after balloon 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.370
 and the youth after lavage or 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.370
 Tonstörung 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.000
 let's face our ears 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.890
 now on fifa 13 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.390
 just listen shortly before the end 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.920
 maybe the opportunity is there 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.800
 Last you can still play the game 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.970
 win 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.970
 great pass 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.920
 is that? 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.989
 I think there are slight advantages 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.400
 to recognize fifa 13 okay the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.599
 commentator also sometimes babbles 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.099
 a bit garbage but that 's it in the 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:11.790
 true life will soon be able to 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:14.389
 are you steven wonder but there is 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.389
 the white device 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.630
 two to zero for fifa it stands now and 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.069
 now comes back to the control what you 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.569
 at fifa so control technology 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.980
 can do so here for example so 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:30.250
 a small solo flat pass and flank 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.920
 header shot so that's it 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.770
 great for the generation with 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.760
 Commodore 64 is around 40 for us 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.410
 the control, of course 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.810
 at the same time the biggest weakness 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.850
 if I want to accuse now if 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.319
 I play a high pass the shallow 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.760
 fits if I want to shoot or if 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.769
 I just need to sprint for it 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.709
 five keys and that's really just 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.690
 the main features then at international 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.370
 soccer i need a button no matter 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.340
 If I am here now, for example, a corner 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.920
 Play if I shoot if I pass 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.010
 I throw a one button is all I need 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.010
 Not 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.190
 and still work right 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.100
 passstaffs if you have the time here 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.960
 looks just the left outside plays over 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.060
 to the right outside so the page changes 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.930
 the right outside back to 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.030
 leftmost 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.010
 the opponents are totally confused 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.950
 left outside back to the right outside and na 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.630
 well that was a bit bad luck 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.910
 Real players have a button 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.440
 shooting technique right tricks on it here 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.380
 for example, in slow motion is normal 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.540
 says Rector here because you can see it's that 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.370
 not there or here a trick one 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.290
 can hit the ball with the hoe on the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.300
 you can fly head and then head 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.790
 You can not do that at FIFA 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.590
 that's why international soccer stands 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.200
 only 2 1 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.330
 the point dramatics are very important for 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.500
 football and for example in fifa 13 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.500
 represented by injuries 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.849
 and that really says so has quite 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.599
 bad and important man 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.750
 or whatever he likes about drama 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.710
 arbitration decisions 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.710
 Danger 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.940
 and so an eleven-meter is of course 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.800
 that's what it's dramatic 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.130
 There is not international soccer there 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.130
 no eleven meters 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.250
 but there are plenty of others for that 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.390
 Watch out for dramatic moments 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.060
 your post shot 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.260
 the margin latte cross and also one 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.180
 kill and then the defender goes 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.190
 in between a second scene as 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.660
 voucher here keeps the goalkeeper and 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.040
 then comes the extra shot try mine 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.440
 trying to trick 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.880
 there stops with the foot and then would have 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.430
 several times until then finally the gate 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.620
 falls and so is a drama that exists 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.380
 in fifa by no means international 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.380
 soccer is surprisingly equal to 2 2 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.709
 the decision must be with the 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.079
 fifth evaluation criterion 

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:54.159
 and well international soccer you can 

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.659
 actually only friendlies 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.399
 against pals or against the 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.539
 computer and something like a league 

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.999
 You had to do it yourself 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.099
 zusammenzubasteln in terms of scope has the 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.869
 fifa 13 clearly the nose in front so 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.379
 certainly almost as extensive as pure 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:08.199
 calmund 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:10.329
 There are quite a few game modes 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.679
 it's all licensed indeed have here 

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:13.719
 the table of the bundesliga 

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:15.879
 even automatically calculates you like 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.989
 Hard to believe it as an old man yes and 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:19.389
 then we have player statistics here 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:21.929
 scorer hunter is market even 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.639
 do not take an end 

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:26.859
 fifa 13 brings the decisive 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.309
 third point and wins 3 2 just 

00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:32.379
 against international soccer 

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:34.419
 I hope and I am sure it has 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.589
 just as much fun as they did 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:40.089
 to watch this game 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:42.219
 my name is marie bäumer the days 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.379
 only my conclusion and that remains 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:46.569
 is fifa 13 is a damn 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:49.089
 football game also for people over 40 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:50.229
 and international soccer is clear 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:54.899
 the winner of hearts 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.899
 in this sense a nice life still
