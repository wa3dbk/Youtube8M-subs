right<00:01:51.679> there<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:52.429> want<00:01:52.639> to<00:01:52.700> go<00:01:52.759> ahead<00:01:52.789> and

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
right there and we want to go ahead and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.059 
right there and we want to go ahead and
pop<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.270> on<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.899> book<00:01:54.109> before<00:01:54.319> we<00:01:54.770> begin

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
pop that on to the book before we begin

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.160 
pop that on to the book before we begin
time<00:01:55.399> now<00:01:55.999> you<00:01:56.060> might<00:01:56.389> have<00:01:56.509> noticed<00:01:56.539> that<00:01:56.990> I'm

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
time now you might have noticed that I'm

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.649 
time now you might have noticed that I'm
using<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.740> cream<00:01:58.249> colored<00:01:58.700> tail<00:01:58.939> I'm<00:01:59.240> going<00:01:59.569> to

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
using a cream colored tail I'm going to

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.239 
using a cream colored tail I'm going to
tie<00:01:59.899> this<00:01:59.959> in<00:02:00.259> a<00:02:00.319> slightly<00:02:00.469> different<00:02:00.770> color

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
tie this in a slightly different color

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:02.800 
tie this in a slightly different color
just<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.789> shows<00:02:01.999> up<00:02:02.209> a<00:02:02.299> little<00:02:02.509> bit<00:02:02.630> better

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
just so it shows up a little bit better

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.469 
just so it shows up a little bit better
on<00:02:02.899> video<00:02:03.350> for<00:02:03.709> you<00:02:03.859> but<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.880> can<00:02:05.029> tie<00:02:05.209> this<00:02:05.270> a

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
on video for you but you can tie this a

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.969 
on video for you but you can tie this a
lot<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.899> different<00:02:06.200> colors<00:02:06.469> and<00:02:06.499> this<00:02:06.770> works

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
lot of different colors and this works

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.589 
lot of different colors and this works

just a couple of wraps to tie it off now
we<00:04:48.440> want<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.770> go<00:04:48.860> ahead<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:49.310> tie<00:04:49.820> in<00:04:50.030> some

we want to go ahead and tie in some

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.950 
we want to go ahead and tie in some
rubber<00:04:50.930> legs<00:04:51.139> in<00:04:51.440> this<00:04:52.100> case<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.840> could<00:04:53.840> be

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
rubber legs in this case I could be

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.500 
rubber legs in this case I could be
using<00:04:54.400> strands<00:04:55.400> from<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.699> spinner<00:04:55.940> baits<00:04:56.210> good

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
using strands from a spinner baits good

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.060 
using strands from a spinner baits good
and<00:04:56.690> that's<00:04:57.110> what<00:04:57.290> I<00:04:57.320> really<00:04:57.650> like<00:04:57.800> for<00:04:58.010> the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
and that's what I really like for the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.920 
and that's what I really like for the
black<00:04:58.310> version<00:04:58.550> as<00:04:58.880> you<00:04:59.000> see<00:04:59.210> here<00:04:59.510> that's

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
black version as you see here that's

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.230 
black version as you see here that's
black<00:05:00.350> and<00:05:00.380> blue<00:05:00.860> flake<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.729> is<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:01.940> color

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
black and blue flake and that is a color

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.689 
black and blue flake and that is a color
combination<00:05:02.870> that's<00:05:02.990> just<00:05:03.260> killer<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:04.550> tie

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
combination that's just killer to tie

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.100 
combination that's just killer to tie
this<00:05:04.760> particular<00:05:05.210> version<00:05:05.510> which<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.960> would

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
this particular version which I would

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.390 
this particular version which I would
use<00:05:06.260> later<00:05:06.530> on<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:06.949> year<00:05:06.979> because<00:05:07.220> it

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
use later on in the year because it

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.020 
use later on in the year because it
imitates<00:05:07.760> an<00:05:07.940> actual<00:05:09.669> crayfish<00:05:10.669> color<00:05:10.970> a

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
imitates an actual crayfish color a

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.159 
imitates an actual crayfish color a
little<00:05:11.150> bit<00:05:11.360> better<00:05:11.540> i'm<00:05:11.690> going<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:11.870> use<00:05:11.960> a

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
little bit better i'm going to use a

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.830 
little bit better i'm going to use a
pumpkin<00:05:12.800> flake<00:05:13.580> silly<00:05:14.150> leg<00:05:14.419> which<00:05:14.660> is<00:05:14.810> a

pumpkin flake silly leg which is a
software<00:05:15.290> material<00:05:15.800> i'm<00:05:16.250> just<00:05:16.370> going<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.610> take

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
software material i'm just going to take

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.409 
software material i'm just going to take
two<00:05:17.000> of<00:05:17.030> those<00:05:17.210> legs<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:17.690> cut<00:05:17.810> them<00:05:17.990> off<00:05:19.419> take

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419
