how you doing guys it is scanner back in
here<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.560> video<00:00:07.770> we're<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.220> to

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
here and in this video we're going to

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.900 
here and in this video we're going to
take<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.460> look<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:08.849> some<00:00:09.120> air<00:00:09.389> superiority<00:00:09.929> and

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
take a look at some air superiority and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.759 
take a look at some air superiority and
it's<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.059> mode<00:00:12.300> where<00:00:12.330> everybody<00:00:13.110> has<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> jet

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
it's a mode where everybody has a jet

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.279 
it's a mode where everybody has a jet
unlike<00:00:14.519> tank<00:00:14.849> superiority<00:00:15.660> which<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> mode

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
unlike tank superiority which is a mode

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.859 
unlike tank superiority which is a mode
where<00:00:16.320> some<00:00:16.920> people<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.430> tanks<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.090> so

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
where some people have tanks and so

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.840 
where some people have tanks and so
that's<00:00:18.990> definitely<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.500> step<00:00:19.920> up<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.340> design

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
that's definitely a step up in design

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.189 
that's definitely a step up in design
for<00:00:21.300> dice<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.430> welcome<00:00:23.430> change<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.910> DZ<00:00:24.330> kind

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199

flag and here's pretty already bought a
bit<00:00:39.719> gimmicky<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.320> fun<00:00:41.300> which<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.329> really<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
bit gimmicky but fun which is really the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.209 
bit gimmicky but fun which is really the
important<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.820> spoke<00:00:45.480> about

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
important thing and I spoke about

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.540 
important thing and I spoke about
capture<00:00:47.219> flag<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:48.410> my<00:00:49.410> earlier<00:00:49.829> video<00:00:50.190> today

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
capture flag in my earlier video today

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
capture flag in my earlier video today
and<00:00:50.960> air<00:00:51.960> superiority<00:00:52.760> feels<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:54.149> gimmicky

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and air superiority feels more gimmicky

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.619 
and air superiority feels more gimmicky
but<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.739> probably<00:00:56.399> gonna<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> longer<00:00:57.270> life

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
but is probably gonna have a longer life

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.549 
but is probably gonna have a longer life
and<00:00:59.300> for<00:01:00.300> certain<00:01:00.660> players<00:01:01.079> very

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and for certain players very

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
and for certain players very
specifically<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.789> players<00:01:03.000> who<00:01:03.090> are

specifically for players who are

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.320 
specifically for players who are
unsurprisingly<00:01:04.140> good<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.650> Jets<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:06.180> see

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
unsurprisingly good in Jets I can see

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
unsurprisingly good in Jets I can see
this<00:01:06.479> being<00:01:06.540> absolutely<00:01:07.380> epic<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:08.100> you've<00:01:08.460> got

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
this being absolutely epic if you've got

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
this being absolutely epic if you've got
a<00:01:08.790> full<00:01:09.180> team<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.840> both<00:01:10.140> sides<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.799> very

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.690 
a full team on both sides of very
skilled<00:01:11.909> pilots<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.220> actually<00:01:14.250> see

superiority<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.979> cannot<00:01:50.430> bail<00:01:50.729> out

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
superiority is that you cannot bail out

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.720 
like a ver mint reaction because I was
so<00:02:09.810> used<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.440> staying<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> gen<00:02:11.280> dying

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
so used to just staying in the gen dying

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.620 
so used to just staying in the gen dying
or<00:02:12.000> having<00:02:12.230> them

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
or having them

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.220 
or having them
a<00:02:13.660> jet<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.350> die<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.950> air<00:02:15.250> superiority<00:02:15.610> an

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
a jet to die in air superiority an

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.350 
a jet to die in air superiority an
absolutely<00:02:17.230> does<00:02:17.560> make<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.070> mold<00:02:18.360> infinitely

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
absolutely does make the mold infinitely

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.030 
absolutely does make the mold infinitely
worthwhile<00:02:19.870> because<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.470> people<00:02:20.650> could<00:02:20.980> just

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
worthwhile because if people could just

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.610 
worthwhile because if people could just
bail<00:02:21.490> out<00:02:21.670> at<00:02:21.730> any<00:02:22.120> given<00:02:22.420> opportunity<00:02:23.050> it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
bail out at any given opportunity it

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.830 
bail out at any given opportunity it
would<00:02:23.860> be<00:02:23.950> very<00:02:23.980> very<00:02:24.370> dull<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:25.360> know<00:02:25.450> nobody

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
would be very very dull you know nobody

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.980 
would be very very dull you know nobody
would<00:02:25.990> be<00:02:26.140> committing<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.890> their<00:02:27.010> actions<00:02:27.520> and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
would be committing to their actions and

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.170 
would be committing to their actions and
and<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.980> can<00:02:30.130> still<00:02:30.340> get<00:02:30.520> stuff<00:02:30.760> done<00:02:30.970> while

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
and you can still get stuff done while

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.730 
and you can still get stuff done while
you're<00:02:31.300> in<00:02:31.390> your<00:02:31.540> jail<00:02:31.780> I've<00:02:31.960> captured<00:02:32.260> flags

you're in your jail I've captured flags

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.650 
you're in your jail I've captured flags
in<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.100> jet<00:02:33.310> on<00:02:33.460> twelve<00:02:33.790> percent<00:02:34.150> health<00:02:34.420> and

in a jet on twelve percent health and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.480 
in a jet on twelve percent health and
then<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.780> died<00:02:34.960> because<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.920> even<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.460> know

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
then I died because not even you know

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.550 
then I died because not even you know
imminent<00:02:37.150> death<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.750> stop<00:02:37.780> me<00:02:38.170> Pete<00:02:38.380> Lea

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
imminent death can stop me Pete Lea

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.250 
imminent death can stop me Pete Lea
following<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:39.070> seems<00:02:40.680> 4am<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.160> it's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
following it seems 4am you know it's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.920 
following it seems 4am you know it's
it's<00:02:44.260> definitely<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.800> fun<00:02:45.040> mode<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.670> not<00:02:46.480> fun

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
it's definitely a fun mode and not fun

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.900 
it's definitely a fun mode and not fun
if<00:02:47.200> you're<00:02:47.470> not<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.680> good<00:02:47.890> pilot<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.460> was<00:02:48.670> playing

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
if you're not a good pilot I was playing

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.610 
if you're not a good pilot I was playing
with<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.090> few<00:02:49.300> buddies<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.110> know<00:02:50.230> one<00:02:50.500> or

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
with a few buddies and you know one or

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.760 
with a few buddies and you know one or
two<00:02:50.740> wouldn't<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.490> skilled<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.440> jets<00:02:53.440> and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
two wouldn't be so skilled in jets and

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.520 
two wouldn't be so skilled in jets and
they<00:02:53.800> were<00:02:54.220> definitely<00:02:54.550> suffering<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.530> their

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
they were definitely suffering and their

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.850 
they were definitely suffering and their
enjoyment<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.400> game<00:02:57.520> because<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:59.740> know

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
enjoyment of the game because you know

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.260 
enjoyment of the game because you know
it's<00:03:00.040> simply<00:03:00.340> not<00:03:00.490> something<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.060> they<00:03:01.180> were

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
it's simply not something that they were

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.760 
it's simply not something that they were
used<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.630> I'll<00:03:01.930> be<00:03:02.080> completely<00:03:02.500> honest

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
used to and I'll be completely honest

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.320 
used to and I'll be completely honest
this<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.160> not<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.610> place<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.850> were<00:03:04.120> going<00:03:04.300> to

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
this is not the place you were going to

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.810 
this is not the place you were going to
learn<00:03:04.450> how<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.750> fly<00:03:04.900> effectively<00:03:05.820> there's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
learn how to fly effectively there's

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.250 
learn how to fly effectively there's
just<00:03:07.060> too<00:03:07.240> many<00:03:07.390> enemies<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:08.050> can

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
just too many enemies that can

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.140 
just too many enemies that can
potentially<00:03:08.350> be<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.040> behind<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.580> or<00:03:09.730> lock<00:03:09.940> on

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
potentially be in behind you or lock on

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.170 
potentially be in behind you or lock on
to<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.390> at<00:03:10.510> any<00:03:10.570> given<00:03:10.930> moment<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.940> one<00:03:12.940> thing

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
to you at any given moment and one thing

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.370 
to you at any given moment and one thing
I<00:03:13.330> am<00:03:13.450> hoping<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:14.020> is<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.910> this<00:03:16.330> mode<00:03:16.660> kind

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
I am hoping for is that this mode kind

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.330 
I am hoping for is that this mode kind
of<00:03:17.530> drops<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.220> stigma<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:19.590> heat<00:03:20.590> seekers<00:03:21.040> and

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
of drops the stigma of heat seekers and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.150 
of drops the stigma of heat seekers and
and<00:03:22.300> people<00:03:22.960> just<00:03:23.110> embrace<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.890> valid

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
and people just embrace it as a valid

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.060 
and people just embrace it as a valid
tactic<00:03:24.700> because<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.390> was<00:03:26.110> mildly<00:03:26.380> pissed<00:03:26.740> off

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
tactic because I was mildly pissed off

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.790 
tactic because I was mildly pissed off
earlier<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.880> in<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.990> would<00:03:29.230> get<00:03:29.470> onto<00:03:29.770> a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
earlier and in that I would get onto a

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.070 
earlier and in that I would get onto a
guy<00:03:30.010> like<00:03:30.250> I'd<00:03:30.490> see<00:03:30.940> somebody<00:03:31.810> on<00:03:31.870> my<00:03:32.050> team

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
guy like I'd see somebody on my team

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.710 
guy like I'd see somebody on my team
following<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:33.010> guy<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.430> failing<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.210> kill<00:03:34.480> him

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
following a guy and failing to kill him

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.960 
following a guy and failing to kill him
so<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> would<00:03:35.740> drop<00:03:35.980> in<00:03:36.310> at<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.610> safe<00:03:36.940> distance

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
so I would drop in at a safe distance

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.660 
so I would drop in at a safe distance
lock<00:03:37.810> on<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.380> fire<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.510> Heatseeker<00:03:41.490> they<00:03:42.490> would

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
lock on and fire a Heatseeker they would

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.850 
lock on and fire a Heatseeker they would
flare<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:44.200> other<00:03:44.380> jet<00:03:44.590> with<00:03:44.740> you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
flare and the other jet with you

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.440 
flare and the other jet with you
absolutely<00:03:45.400> nothing<00:03:45.850> because<00:03:45.970> they<00:03:46.240> didn't

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
absolutely nothing because they didn't

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.900 
absolutely nothing because they didn't
have<00:03:46.510> heat<00:03:46.930> seekers<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:48.100> they<00:03:48.370> have<00:03:48.550> this<00:03:48.700> kind

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
have heat seekers so they have this kind

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.330 
have heat seekers so they have this kind
of<00:03:49.090> prior<00:03:49.390> element<00:03:49.900> oh<00:03:49.990> you<00:03:50.440> know<00:03:50.709> its<00:03:51.220> secrets

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
of prior element oh you know its secrets

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.330 
of prior element oh you know its secrets
are<00:03:51.610> for<00:03:51.760> noobs<00:03:51.910> or<00:03:52.150> whatever<00:03:52.390> yes<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.410> you

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
are for noobs or whatever yes but you

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.540 
are for noobs or whatever yes but you
use<00:03:54.610> them<00:03:54.880> until<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.540> can<00:03:55.959> kill<00:03:56.200> things

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
use them until you can kill things

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.660 
use them until you can kill things
quickly<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:57.970> efficiently<00:03:58.300> with<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.170> cannons

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
quickly and efficiently with the cannons

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.130 
quickly and efficiently with the cannons
you<00:04:00.670> know<00:04:00.790> that's<00:04:01.030> just<00:04:01.150> what<00:04:01.330> you<00:04:01.510> do<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.900> saw<00:04:02.110> a

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
you know that's just what you do I saw a

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.870 
you know that's just what you do I saw a

some stuff is effective and you use it

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.059 
some stuff is effective and you use it
where<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.930> would<00:04:28.020> be<00:04:28.110> effective<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.710> on<00:04:28.889> air

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
superiority heat seekers are effective

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.580 
superiority heat seekers are effective

dog fights and the conquest aspect of it

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.059 
dog fights and the conquest aspect of it
the<00:04:58.830> control<00:04:59.279> of<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.759> three<00:05:00.029> blimps<00:05:00.330> is<00:05:01.069> kind

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
the control of the three blimps is kind

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.269 
the control of the three blimps is kind
going<00:05:02.610> into<00:05:02.909> window<00:05:03.180> right<00:05:03.389> now<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:04.069> which<00:05:05.069> is

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:05.279 
going into window right now and which is

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.719 
going into window right now and which is
a<00:05:05.310> shame<00:05:05.810> but<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:07.020> is<00:05:07.289> definitely<00:05:07.560> a<00:05:07.919> fun<00:05:08.250> game

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
a shame but it is definitely a fun game

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.390 
a shame but it is definitely a fun game
mode<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.270> it<00:05:09.449> might<00:05:09.779> possibly<00:05:10.319> be<00:05:10.800> where<00:05:11.340> I

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
mode and it might possibly be where I

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.570 
mode and it might possibly be where I
learned<00:05:11.759> to<00:05:12.029> fly<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.930> PC<00:05:13.710> just<00:05:14.129> because<00:05:14.430> it's

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
learned to fly on PC just because it's

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.740 
learned to fly on PC just because it's
one<00:05:14.729> of<00:05:14.819> those<00:05:14.879> places<00:05:15.120> where<00:05:15.360> you'll<00:05:15.629> get

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
one of those places where you'll get

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.140 
one of those places where you'll get
pummeled<00:05:16.319> by<00:05:16.620> better<00:05:16.830> pilots<00:05:17.310> unless<00:05:17.729> you<00:05:17.939> can

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
pummeled by better pilots unless you can

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.040 
pummeled by better pilots unless you can
you<00:05:18.389> know<00:05:18.509> get<00:05:18.810> scaled<00:05:19.139> pretty<00:05:19.589> quick<00:05:19.969> so<00:05:20.969> I

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
you know get scaled pretty quick so I

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.839 
you know get scaled pretty quick so I
definitely<00:05:22.050> quite<00:05:22.379> a<00:05:22.439> bit<00:05:22.589> of<00:05:22.680> fun<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.099> it

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
definitely quite a bit of fun and it

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.170 
definitely quite a bit of fun and it
certainly<00:05:24.180> leads<00:05:24.719> to<00:05:25.080> some<00:05:25.319> epic<00:05:26.180> looking
