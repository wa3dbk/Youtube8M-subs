frying<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.140> some<00:01:22.350> absorbent<00:01:22.860> paper

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
frying is have some absorbent paper

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.389 
frying is have some absorbent paper
ready<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.970> taking<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> seafood<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.399> two

slightly under cook this oils about 180

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.300 
slightly under cook this oils about 180
degrees<00:01:32.929> so<00:01:33.929> the<00:01:33.960> crummy<00:01:34.289> mix<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.710> basically

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
degrees so the crummy mix is basically

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.740 
degrees so the crummy mix is basically
flour<00:01:35.850> egg<00:01:36.179> wash<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.450> bread<00:01:36.810> crumbs<00:01:38.750> you
