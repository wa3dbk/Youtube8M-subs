about three times over this piece of
tape<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.730> make<00:00:53.730> sure<00:00:53.989> that<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
tape and make sure that it's going to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.260 
tape and make sure that it's going to
cover<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.460> I'm<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> work

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
cover so I'm just going to kind of work

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.369 
cover so I'm just going to kind of work
this<00:00:57.480> into<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> circle<00:00:59.690> smash<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.020> till

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this into a circle smash it out till

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.130 
this into a circle smash it out till
it's<00:01:01.530> about<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:02.010> inch<00:01:02.190> thick<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.989> then<00:01:03.989> I'm

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's about an inch thick and then I'm

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
it's about an inch thick and then I'm
going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.350> set<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.860> edge<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.339> tape

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
going to set it at the edge of my tape

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.730 
going to set it at the edge of my tape
and<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.710> I'm<00:01:08.340> gonna<00:01:08.430> flip<00:01:08.790> -<00:01:09.090> flip

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
and so this is one I'm gonna flip - flip
three<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.520> came<00:01:11.880> over<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> edge

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

table you can do cornstarch if you want
I<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.960> find<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.290> when<00:01:37.829> you're<00:01:37.950> making<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I just find that when you're making a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
I just find that when you're making a
cake<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.880> tend<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.390> powdered<00:01:39.780> sugar<00:01:40.020> out

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
cake you tend to have powdered sugar out

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.410 
cake you tend to have powdered sugar out
for<00:01:40.439> other<00:01:40.590> reasons<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.790> already<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.390> on

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
for other reasons so it's already out on

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420 
for other reasons so it's already out on
your<00:01:42.780> counter<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.290> want<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> make<00:01:43.920> sure<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.310> my

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
I give it just a couple rolls and then a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.729 
I give it just a couple rolls and then a
nice<00:02:38.700> step<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.780> see<00:02:40.079> I've<00:02:40.200> got<00:02:40.379> a<00:02:40.409> spot

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
nice step I can see I've got a spot

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.080 
nice step I can see I've got a spot
there<00:02:40.980> that's<00:02:41.220> wanting<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.640> stick<00:02:41.909> a<00:02:41.970> little

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
there that's wanting to stick a little

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.819 
there that's wanting to stick a little
bit<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.690> I'm<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:42.930> gonna<00:02:43.049> make<00:02:43.260> sure<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.650> got

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
bit so I'm just gonna make sure it's got

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.039 
bit so I'm just gonna make sure it's got
enough<00:02:44.069> powdered<00:02:44.459> sugar<00:02:44.730> under<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.120> give<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.959> a

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
enough powdered sugar under it give it a

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.410 
enough powdered sugar under it give it a
couple<00:02:46.260> more<00:02:46.530> rolls<00:02:48.349> another<00:02:49.349> spin<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:51.090> this

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
couple more rolls another spin as this

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.420 
couple more rolls another spin as this
gets<00:02:51.720> bigger<00:02:52.049> your<00:02:52.470> fondant<00:02:52.980> gets<00:02:53.099> more

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
gets bigger your fondant gets more

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.789 
gets bigger your fondant gets more
fragile<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:54.510> actually<00:02:54.870> put<00:02:55.049> a<00:02:55.079> big<00:02:55.409> hole<00:02:55.739> in

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
fragile can actually put a big hole in

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.800 
fragile can actually put a big hole in
your<00:02:56.099> fondant<00:02:56.459> with<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:57.060> your<00:02:57.269> fingertip

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
your fondant with just your fingertip

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.410 
your fondant with just your fingertip
because<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.980> gets<00:02:59.280> stretched<00:02:59.879> out<00:03:00.150> and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
because it gets stretched out and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.940 
because it gets stretched out and
fragile<00:03:00.659> so<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.319> want<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> kind<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.739> bring

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
fragile so you want to kind of bring

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.619 
fragile so you want to kind of bring
your<00:03:02.129> fingers<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.909> guide<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.510> around

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
your fingers in and guide it around

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.199 
your fingers in and guide it around
rather<00:03:04.560> than<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:05.010> pull<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.430> from<00:03:05.700> one<00:03:05.940> edge

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
rather than to pull it from one edge

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.869 
rather than to pull it from one edge
once<00:03:06.659> it<00:03:06.870> gets<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.379> big<00:03:07.620> enough<00:03:07.829> size<00:03:08.129> okay

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
once it gets to a big enough size okay

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.030 
once it gets to a big enough size okay
so<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.750> enough<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.349> rolled<00:03:10.620> up<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:10.920> my

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
