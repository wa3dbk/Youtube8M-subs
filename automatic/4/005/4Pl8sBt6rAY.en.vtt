00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello my name is khan holstein me 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.380
 I am managing director of e bike store in 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hamburg 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.160
 I'll tell you a little something today 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.000
 about the three main types of drive 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.040
 of electric bicycles as the first 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.680
 most important engine today 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.109
 so-called mid-engine or bottom bracket 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.939
 engine here we have an example of 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.949
 bosch the engine is in the bottom bracket 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.830
 the power will be integrated in this case 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.519
 over the upper chainring in Wieck at 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.529
 transfer 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.500
 that is also the weak point 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.590
 namely the wear in the chain and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.840
 in chains puzzle in front and behind is 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.000
 for electric bicycles with reed bearings 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.920
 motors are relatively high they have to with it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.239
 expect them every two and a half to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.750
 3000 kilometers 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.160
 at least need a new chain 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.760
 probably also a new one 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.920
 number puzzle in front and in the case one 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.329
 cassette after about 3000 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.239
 kilometer is changed simply because 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.539
 the wear here is very very strong 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.510
 the bottom bracket motor usually has 250 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.869
 watt and transfers the power into the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.320
 Chain 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.729
 that is a very pleasant one 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.740
 Support the engine because the force 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.470
 is transferred one-to-one 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.659
 that feels like it's their own 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 power that gives the drive 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 Of course you have the chance to be up in the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.340
 display the power of the engine 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.619
 adjust 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.409
 usually weak in three stages 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.409
 medium and strong in addition to her 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.009
 own contracting force is connected to the power of 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.890
 to give motors the power of the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.229
 Motors will be measured at the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.220
 sensors of this wheel in the case 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.680
 bosch meanwhile three sensors that the force 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.540
 measure and motivate you 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.119
 in addition to their own power into 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.220
 system 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.780
 Next I'll show the rear engine of the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.040
 rear motor is now mainly in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.869
 rheder built the a bit 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.149
 should be faster or more dynamic 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.219
 in this case we have a 500 watt 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.979
 rear engine then the stroma then 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.040
 drives the rear engine with 500 means 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.619
 that the wheel is relative 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.750
 fast is over 25 km h but fast it 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.150
 There are also smaller rear engine with 250 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.930
 watt at the normal 25 km / h 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.190
 electric bicycles are installed 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.170
 the advantage is that these wheels are one 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.520
 a little bit more dynamic are usually one 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.620
 have higher torque 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.200
 the disadvantage of the hack engines 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.510
 that the tail motors usually something 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.400
 Consume more energy and weight 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.810
 the engine sits behind in the rear wheel 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.320
 imagine we have one 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.620
 plates 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.210
 then they build with that, so to speak 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.150
 Rear wheel at the same time the engine 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.260
 out to mend their sleep means 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.850
 not that you need additional tools 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.050
 but need as a rule, the whole 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.760
 just a bit heavier and 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.470
 this is the more cumbersome thing for them 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.410
 real disadvantage of the hack engines 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.240
 stern motors will be about 10% im 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.830
 moment in the electric bicycles installed 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.740
 most bicycles have as said 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.050
 in the bottom bracket to the risk like new 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.459
 equipped with a front motor one 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.920
 the few bicycles still with 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.720
 driving front engines today and engines 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.280
 are easy to retrofit on the wheels 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.100
 But always have the advantage that it 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.019
 a coaster brake gives the wheel 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.970
 The front engine drives relatively good-naturedly 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.330
 the front engine can not be helped 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.070
 steer too many sensors 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.920
 the weight is in the case on the 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.600
 Front wheel and important when driving 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.950
 that may be a disadvantage but you 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.790
 that can of course 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.670
 account 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.370
 When driving, weight must be on the front 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.290
 to be brought that is for petite 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.000
 Lady does not weigh enough 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.220
 Front wheels are not these wheels 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.870
 necessarily suitable 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.420
 as a conclusion, one can say that it is important 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.410
 is that you at your dealer 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.780
 try different engines 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.160
 And most customers drive that can 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.230
 you decide to say today today 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.970
 for the third league engines of bosch or 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.769
 from panasonic there are very good 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.290
 Choice also with different battery 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.660
 sizes but test them try them 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.390
 wants to go out and fix it for yourself 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.540
 with which engine you best 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.190
 cope 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.270
 Most customers in the bottom bracket 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.330
 engine because the power is the best there 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.070
 most direct opticat would transmit 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.010
 watch more videos now 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.800
 current e bikes as well videos with 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.870
 valuable tips for e bike all e 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.489
 of course you will find our bikes on our
