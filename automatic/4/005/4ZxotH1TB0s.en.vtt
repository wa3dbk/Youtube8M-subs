00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.920
 I'm on the computer that I always do 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.750
 tutorial videos 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.040
 this is an express video for the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.300
 people who simply want 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.840
 download the windows 7 list 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.849
 17 32 bits and 64 bits you can 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.629
 they will ask what is the fucking difference 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.460
 between 32 and 64 good that of 32 is 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.940
 recommended for computers that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.470
 they have less ram and this is in the range 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.579
 of 4 to less and others and those of 64 is 4 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:51.500
 to more gigas good and you say but 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.180

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.220

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.140
 8 are going to this equipment properties 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.610
 and here this ram 2 gb memory like 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 I have me and not like the previous one I had 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.160
 6 ram and an intel core 5 processor 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.220
 unfortunately that computer has 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.390
 passed to better life 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.760

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.810
 power 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.920
 this see if I save money and I buy 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.880
 another new 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.670
 well that would be all just for 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.060
 download will have to give in the image 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.070

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.950
 the system that you perceive them 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.579
 agree the 32 or 64 let's say I'm going 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.649
 to download 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.860
 obviously I would download the 32 in the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.860
 click 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.000

 automatically download I give it 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.900
 cancel the download because obviously 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.319
 I do not need this operating system 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.120
 and cancel 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.099
 and if they need to know how to activate it 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.420
 I already have two tutorial videos of two 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.430
 ways how to activate it 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.239

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.239
