also kind of has a rubber texture so

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.070 
also kind of has a rubber texture so
it's<00:01:23.680> not<00:01:23.740> slip<00:01:24.310> slippery<00:01:25.060> if<00:01:25.630> anybody's<00:01:26.020> ever

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
it's not slip slippery if anybody's ever

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.200 
it's not slip slippery if anybody's ever
held<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.500> q5<00:01:27.100> that's<00:01:27.370> this<00:01:27.520> kind<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.909> slippery

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
held the q5 that's this kind of slippery

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.390 
held the q5 that's this kind of slippery
back<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:28.870> one's<00:01:29.110> kind<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.380> got<00:01:29.500> matte<00:01:29.800> finish

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
back this one's kind of got matte finish

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.260 
back this one's kind of got matte finish
and<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> it's<00:01:34.300> not<00:01:34.480> too<00:01:34.720> slippy<00:01:35.250> phone<00:01:36.270> slips

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
and so it's not too slippy phone slips

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.230 
and so it's not too slippy phone slips
in<00:01:38.159> very<00:01:39.159> easily<00:01:39.490> comes<00:01:40.060> out<00:01:40.240> very<00:01:40.270> easily<00:01:42.240> but

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
in very easily comes out very easily but

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.290 
in very easily comes out very easily but
it<00:01:43.810> is<00:01:44.080> very<00:01:44.380> heavy<00:01:45.190> it's<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:45.610> chunky<00:01:45.909> case<00:01:46.120> in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
it is very heavy it's a chunky case in

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.190 
it is very heavy it's a chunky case in
itself<00:01:47.550> solid<00:01:48.870> so<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.420> quite<00:01:52.690> heavy<00:01:52.990> to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
itself solid so it is quite heavy to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.740 
itself solid so it is quite heavy to
carry<00:01:53.380> around<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.950> your<00:01:54.010> pocket<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.729> see<00:01:55.540> is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
carry around in your pocket and see is

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.899 
carry around in your pocket and see is
quite<00:01:56.080> chunky<00:01:56.409> just<00:01:57.159> going<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.460> compare<00:01:57.880> it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
quite chunky just going to compare it

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.320 
quite chunky just going to compare it
actually<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.290> leather<00:02:00.100> holster<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.880> z30

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
actually to the leather holster the z30

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.660 
actually to the leather holster the z30
leather<00:02:01.659> holster<00:02:03.210> same<00:02:04.210> size<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:05.049> course<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
leather holster same size of course you

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.229 
leather holster same size of course you
can<00:02:06.760> see<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.119> thickness<00:02:09.030> obviously<00:02:10.030> with<00:02:10.149> the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
can see the thickness obviously with the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.870 
can see the thickness obviously with the
leather<00:02:11.159> seems<00:02:12.159> slightly<00:02:12.430> thinner

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
leather seems slightly thinner

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.730 
leather seems slightly thinner
and<00:02:13.970> obviously<00:02:14.960> this<00:02:15.140> will<00:02:15.350> hold<00:02:15.530> its<00:02:15.680> shape

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
and obviously this will hold its shape

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.610 
and obviously this will hold its shape
because<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.250> hard<00:02:16.400> plastic<00:02:16.970> but<00:02:17.900> with<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
because it's hard plastic but with the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.140 
because it's hard plastic but with the
leather<00:02:19.250> pouch<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.270> do<00:02:21.200> find<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.460> device

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
leather pouch I do find that the device

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.360 
leather pouch I do find that the device
is<00:02:24.130> harder<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.160> slip<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:25.940> out<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.410> that's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
is harder to slip in and out so that's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.340 
is harder to slip in and out so that's
what<00:02:28.580> makes<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.270> one<00:02:29.540> quite<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.020> bit<00:02:30.200> more

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
what makes this one quite a bit more

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.800 
what makes this one quite a bit more
convenient<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.460> fact<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.330> it's<00:02:32.510> easier

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
convenient in the fact that it's easier

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.350 
convenient in the fact that it's easier
to<00:02:32.960> slip<00:02:33.140> out<00:02:33.290> your<00:02:33.500> z30<00:02:34.000> I've<00:02:35.000> been<00:02:35.180> using

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
to slip out your z30 I've been using

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.930 
to slip out your z30 I've been using
this<00:02:35.570> for<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.970> few<00:02:38.720> days<00:02:38.870> already<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:40.700> it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
this for a few days already I do like it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.690

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.140 
bit of creaking if you kind of squeeze
it<00:03:12.800> but<00:03:12.950> you're<00:03:13.040> not<00:03:13.070> going<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.370> be<00:03:13.700> doing<00:03:13.910> that

regularly anyway so all in all not at
not<00:03:19.070> over<00:03:19.400> just<00:03:19.850> put<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.030> in<00:03:20.270> upside<00:03:20.840> down

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
not over just put that in upside down

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.970 
not over just put that in upside down
not<00:03:22.010> bad<00:03:22.160> case<00:03:22.460> this<00:03:23.450> does<00:03:23.960> have<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.230> beta<00:03:24.530> level

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
not bad case this does have a beta level

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.730 
not bad case this does have a beta level
that<00:03:25.960> it's<00:03:26.960> a<00:03:27.340> label<00:03:28.340> on<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.780> obviously

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740

you've<00:03:31.130> got<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.520> you<00:03:31.700> can<00:03:31.850> see<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.210> LED

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
you've got the you can see the LED

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.850 
you've got the you can see the LED
notifications<00:03:33.170> at<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.320> top<00:03:33.500> there<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.800> only

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
notifications at the top there it only

notifications at the top there it only
it<00:03:34.220> only<00:03:34.370> goes<00:03:34.610> in<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:34.970> way<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.350> can<00:03:36.500> see

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
it only goes in that way so you can see

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.760 
it only goes in that way so you can see
notifications<00:03:37.840> as<00:03:38.840> well<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.370> yes<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:40.610> is<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
notifications as well so yes that is the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.590 
notifications as well so yes that is the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
said 30 and carbonate case I don't know

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.060 
said 30 and carbonate case I don't know
when<00:03:47.780> it's<00:03:47.930> going<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.170> become<00:03:48.320> available<00:03:48.740> if
