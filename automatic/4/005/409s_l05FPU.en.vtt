want to use the e grip up because there
is<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.269> tooth<00:00:30.599> back<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:32.369> what<00:00:32.579> hooks

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
is a tooth back there that's what hooks

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
is a tooth back there that's what hooks
in<00:00:34.100> with<00:00:35.100> these<00:00:35.309> teeth<00:00:36.180> right<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.630> okay

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
in with these teeth right here okay

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 
in with these teeth right here okay
so<00:00:38.210> basically<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.170> see<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> we

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so basically you you can see that we

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.959 
so basically you you can see that we
have<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:40.770> different<00:00:40.920> sizes<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:43.969> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
have two different sizes right here and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.660 
have two different sizes right here and
just<00:00:45.030> guesstimate<00:00:45.960> how<00:00:46.170> close<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.520> I'm

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
just guesstimate how close and then I'm

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.229 
just guesstimate how close and then I'm
gonna<00:00:47.879> screw<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:49.160> this<00:00:50.160> part<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.789> tighten<00:00:51.149> it

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
gonna screw in this part to tighten it

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.060 
gonna screw in this part to tighten it
down

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
down

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.299 
down
okay<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.420> how<00:00:54.570> well<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> works<00:00:55.309> just

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
okay and see how well that works just

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.000 
okay and see how well that works just
holds<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> probably<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.469> average

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
holds it this is probably your average

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.520 
holds it this is probably your average
size<00:00:59.309> bar<00:00:59.699> maybe<00:01:00.660> even<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.260> thicker

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
size bar maybe even a little thicker

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.219 
size bar maybe even a little thicker
than<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.920> average<00:01:02.039> size<00:01:02.340> bar<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.019> then<00:01:04.019> what

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
than your average size bar and then what

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.120 
than your average size bar and then what
we<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.530> down<00:01:04.830> below<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.439> thickest<00:01:10.860> it'll

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
we have down below is the thickest it'll

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310
