that are like double-a batteries that
you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.500> buy<00:01:43.680> there's<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> empty<00:01:45.030> space

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you can buy there's a lot of empty space

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.480 
you can buy there's a lot of empty space
in<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.500> space<00:01:46.799> thing<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.100> could<00:01:47.310> use

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
in there that space thing you could use

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.690 
in there that space thing you could use
for<00:01:47.700> storing<00:01:48.030> energy<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.350> by<00:01:49.500> creating

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
for storing energy and so by creating

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.039
