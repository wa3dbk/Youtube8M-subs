00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.090
 we speak to his heart 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.000
 me personally when I started graffiti I did not know what 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.899
 that's how it happens 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.899
 the subjects are in front of the school I was 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.609
 it's not at all in this spirit 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.689
 of conquering researcher territories 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.769
 the bomb and the hardest instrument at magny-course tonight 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.970
 but the shop 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.569
 ovations on the ground 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.569
 the violin and the piano know that the note is perfect 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.720
 and as for tennis it depends only on the distance of the speed 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.280
 and the declination of the bomb the pressure on the map of the sky but 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.390
 also in front of this art that immediately seduced me more 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.530
 risk taking and color 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.180
 which are two major missing elements unfortunately tremendously 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.440
 our society and our city today a normal act 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 % in the street there is always a risk it's clear 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.900
 however things necessarily vandal have sometimes done things 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.740
 so what 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.390
 but it's also the little side and magic 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.870
 if sometimes it can annoy 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.140
 but it's also surprising what I've always liked about graffiti 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 this is the expected success this side 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 and we see something incredible in the same place we want 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.079
 there are several collections from a particular collection 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.420
 she will even be keenly 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.990
 I have someone who touches me a lot because the support 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.040
 manifested a little 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.320
 the crazy oar the eccentric original 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.480
 the collection 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.300
 these extremely important opportunities dollars 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.940
 it is both 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.290
 the famous rapper ghannouchi 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.600
 this South African tent erected to dump the basketball with which he has 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.410
 lived 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.930
 a group of friends than that of Afrikaans thugs 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 in tribute to this thought 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.349
 this is the direction 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.119
 a few days before evolving 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:17.299
 the mixture of the huge load on the other supports is safe tonight at st 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.149
 chamond 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:20.329
 cissÃ© 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.699
 since a few months when we believe that this is it is already more 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:27.119
 rare 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.369
 and she superheroes of the city
