00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.569
 I greet you dear needlewomen 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.599
 today I want to tell you how 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.880
 correctly calculate the number of loops 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.160
 knitting 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.039
 I know that many beginners 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.789
 face this problem before 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.720
 guess the required number of loops 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.010
 necessary for knitting 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 they choose many times dissolve again 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.059
 recruit again dissolve was and I 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.270
 sometime exactly the same but after watching 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.600
 I hope this video has this problem. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.850
 you will fall away once and for all and so how 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.649
 calculate the number of loops 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:52.280
 Firstly, when buying yarn on a label 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.770
 always indicated approximately 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.039
 approximate density calculation before knitting 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.100
 let's say 10 centimeters 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 21 loops and indicated 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.939
 needles number needles that need 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.100
 knit which is suitable for knitting from 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.909
 let's say this yarn but with these 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.950
 calculations can not guess for the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.080
 for the simple reason that everyone has, let's say 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.229
 so peculiar knitting technique yes 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.680
 someone knits weakly someone knits the other way around 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.860
 very tight and recommended here 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.170
 Knit the pattern of the front satin 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.409
 again here, too, can be mistaken 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.860
 because when knitting the example of the openwork 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.590
 pattern so how elastic is he well 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.759
 that number of loops can be 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.280
 prove redundant 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.770
 and when knitting some dense 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.420
 relief pattern example if you 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.210
 use your knitting 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.570
 like some kind of bundles and to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.729
 some kind of interlacing then the pattern is the opposite 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.130
 tightened yes and the number of loops can 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.729
 it is not enough therefore it is best 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.210
 gain loops 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.080
 exactly 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:19.209
 rather, it is best to knit a pattern 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:25.000
 just exactly what you use 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.750
 when knitting and so for example we need 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.780
 to tie 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:36.000
 half-size like this we take 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:42.760
 centimeter and measure the circumference of the hips in 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.320
 I'm 32 centimeters 32 in half 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.650
 it turns out a total volume of 64 cm and so 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.290
 how do we knit in pieces up to back to 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.769
 there is no need to type a quantity 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:04.290
 loops which will correspond to 32 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:07.209
 centimeter we knit a pattern pattern and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.799
 measure how many loops we will have in 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.190
 ten centimeters like this 10 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.510
 centimeters count the number 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:24.790
 I made 26 loops 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:32.380
 what we do on 26 loops and 32 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:36.160
 we divide loops by 10 we get 3.2 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.070
 and multiply by 26 loops that is 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.510
 the number of loops that we have in ten 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.239
 centimeters in this case is obtained 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:52.480
 83 loops that is in order not to 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:56.140
 tie a half-half of this size to me 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.090
 you need to dial 83 loops well and plus 2 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.090
 Edging here is such a simple and 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.489
 simple calculation 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:12.390
 I think you will be right now 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:15.820
 count and not make mistakes when knitting 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.459
 if the information was useful to you, put 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.620
 Like do not forget to share with your 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.680
 maybe friends 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.449
 same need this information and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.199
 write comments if something was not 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.199
 it is clear to all until we meet again
