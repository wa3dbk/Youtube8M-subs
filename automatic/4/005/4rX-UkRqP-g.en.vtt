say<00:02:08.060> theoretically<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:09.200> case<00:02:09.380> there's<00:02:09.590> any

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
say theoretically in case there's any

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.850 
say theoretically in case there's any
law<00:02:10.880> enforcement<00:02:11.660> officials<00:02:12.140> watching<00:02:12.349> let's

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
law enforcement officials watching let's

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.339 
law enforcement officials watching let's
suppose<00:02:13.130> theoretically<00:02:13.489> I<00:02:14.180> might<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:14.690> gone

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
suppose theoretically I might have gone

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.700 
suppose theoretically I might have gone
over<00:02:15.800> those

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
over those

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.630 
over those
orange<00:02:17.580> plastic<00:02:18.150> dividers<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.960> divide<00:02:19.470> the

orange plastic dividers that divide the
express<00:02:20.640> lane<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.290> then<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.950> know<00:02:23.070> when<00:02:23.280> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
express lane and then you know when I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.640 
express lane and then you know when I
got<00:02:23.520> up<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.730> IV<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.570> know<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> cloverleaf

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
got up to IV you know the cloverleaf

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.620 
got up to IV you know the cloverleaf
interchange<00:02:26.250> might<00:02:26.490> have<00:02:26.610> gone<00:02:26.760> back<00:02:27.060> over<00:02:27.510> in

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
interchange might have gone back over in

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.310 
interchange might have gone back over in
the<00:02:27.720> other<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:28.080> still<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.220> turns<00:02:29.520> out<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:30.180> of

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
the other one still it turns out all of

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.350 
the other one still it turns out all of
i-95<00:02:31.320> was<00:02:31.620> closed<00:02:32.070> every<00:02:32.490> single<00:02:32.850> laid<00:02:33.030> lane
