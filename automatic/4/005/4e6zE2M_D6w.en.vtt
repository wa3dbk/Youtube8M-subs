very<00:02:47.580> hard<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.940> explain<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.600> customer

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
very hard to explain to a customer

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.580 
very hard to explain to a customer
whenever<00:02:49.800> he<00:02:49.950> comes<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.870> his<00:02:51.870> engines

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
whenever he comes in and his engines

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.330 
whenever he comes in and his engines
burned<00:02:52.950> up<00:02:53.100> because<00:02:54.140> he<00:02:55.140> let<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.530> let<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.220> go

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
burned up because he let the let it go

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.479

too<00:02:56.400> far<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.450> crank<00:02:57.870> seal<00:02:58.170> just

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
too far and the crank seal just

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.710 
too far and the crank seal just
disintegrated<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.790> he<00:02:59.850> just<00:03:00.000> kept<00:03:00.269> using<00:03:00.480> it

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
disintegrated and he just kept using it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.580 
disintegrated and he just kept using it
and<00:03:01.910> basically<00:03:02.910> burned<00:03:03.360> up<00:03:03.510> his<00:03:03.630> engine<00:03:03.860> but

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
and basically burned up his engine but

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.780 
and basically burned up his engine but
anybody<00:03:07.640> has<00:03:08.640> any<00:03:08.880> questions<00:03:09.420> about<00:03:10.340> why<00:03:11.340> two

think<00:03:21.030> what<00:03:21.300> happened<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:21.989> here's

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
think what happened to this one here's

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.199 
think what happened to this one here's
the<00:03:22.260> other<00:03:22.380> piece<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.860> ring<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:24.000> was

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
the other piece of that ring this was

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.880 
the other piece of that ring this was
actually<00:03:24.360> at<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.600> top<00:03:24.840> ring

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
actually at the top ring

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.920 
actually at the top ring
that<00:03:26.490> ring<00:03:26.760> got<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:27.450> thin<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.440> brittle<00:03:29.930> that

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
that ring got so thin and brittle that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.170 
that ring got so thin and brittle that
whenever<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.040> gap<00:03:32.340> got<00:03:32.640> wide<00:03:32.850> enough<00:03:33.120> that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
whenever that gap got wide enough that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.140 
whenever that gap got wide enough that
got<00:03:33.510> hung<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.530> one<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> ports<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.910> on

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
got hung in one of the ports on the on

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.320 
got hung in one of the ports on the on
the<00:03:36.330> cylinder<00:03:36.600> head<00:03:36.980> but<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.760> broke

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
the cylinder head but and broke

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.000 
the cylinder head but and broke
so<00:03:39.600> whenever<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.140> ring<00:03:40.350> came<00:03:40.860> on<00:03:41.100> around<00:03:41.600> it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
so whenever the ring came on around it

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.400 
so whenever the ring came on around it
caught<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.040> exhaust<00:03:44.490> port<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.000> bam<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.990> just

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
caught the exhaust port and bam it just

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.080 
caught the exhaust port and bam it just
broke<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.860> you<00:03:47.490> can<00:03:47.640> actually<00:03:47.790> see<00:03:49.040> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
broke it you can actually see the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.310 
broke it you can actually see the
indention<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.390> top<00:03:51.570> of<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> piston<00:03:51.959> right

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
indention in the top of the piston right

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.180 
indention in the top of the piston right
there<00:03:52.820> where<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.910> kind<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.180> messed<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.570> up<00:03:55.190> what

talking about the nickel SIL piston kit

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.620 
talking about the nickel SIL piston kit
that<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.300> can<00:04:06.540> order<00:04:07.850> aftermarket<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.000> think

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
that you can order aftermarket I think

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.770 
that you can order aftermarket I think
the<00:04:10.160> dealer<00:04:11.160> cost<00:04:11.459> on<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.970> piston<00:04:12.660> and
