dodging<00:00:34.530> using<00:00:34.860> his<00:00:34.980> stupid<00:00:35.340> little

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
dodging using his stupid little

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
dodging using his stupid little
techniques<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.210> loop<00:00:36.690> he<00:00:36.840> almost<00:00:37.050> had<00:00:37.290> him

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
techniques and loop he almost had him

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.280 
techniques and loop he almost had him
and<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:38.760> annoyed<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.870> Monet

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and I was really annoyed when Monet

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200 
and I was really annoyed when Monet
jumped<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.890> threw<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> other<00:00:41.280> shield<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
jumped in and threw the other shield and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.540 
jumped in and threw the other shield and
I<00:00:42.989> got<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> feeling<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.590> Monet<00:00:44.129> there's<00:00:44.430> gonna

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
I got a feeling that Monet there's gonna

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.190 
I got a feeling that Monet there's gonna
be<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> lot<00:00:44.940> more<00:00:45.210> depth<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.719> character

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
be a lot more depth to this character

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
be a lot more depth to this character
after<00:00:46.320> reading<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.890> chapter<00:00:46.980> because<00:00:47.750> when

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
after reading this chapter because when

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.709 
after reading this chapter because when
Monet<00:00:49.079> protects<00:00:49.590> CC<00:00:50.280> she<00:00:50.579> says<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.120> final

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
Monet protects CC she says all final

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
Monet protects CC she says all final
protect<00:00:52.170> master<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.710> will<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.100> killed<00:00:53.370> by<00:00:53.550> Joker

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
protect master I will be killed by Joker

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
protect master I will be killed by Joker
and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:54.960> Lupe's<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.309> bird

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and then Lupe's like all that that bird

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.939 
and then Lupe's like all that that bird
guy<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.750> he<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.079> something<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
guy what is he about something like that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.970 
guy what is he about something like that
and<00:00:59.510> automatically<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.989> Monet<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and automatically I think that Monet is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
and automatically I think that Monet is
probably<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> sleep<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.239> guy<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
probably like a sleep to this guy and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600 
probably like a sleep to this guy and
we're<00:01:04.290> gonna<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> back<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.519> her

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
we're gonna get a lot of back so for her

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.390 
we're gonna get a lot of back so for her
and<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.390> also<00:01:06.659> leaves<00:01:06.960> potential<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:08.220> her

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and this also leaves potential to her

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100 
and this also leaves potential to her
joining<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> straw<00:01:09.270> hats<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> know

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
joining the straw hats because you know

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.469 
joining the straw hats because you know
the<00:01:10.650> straw<00:01:11.010> hats<00:01:11.159> usually<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> really<00:01:12.030> sad

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the straw hats usually have a really sad

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510 
the straw hats usually have a really sad
pass<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.470> definitely<00:01:14.070> opens<00:01:14.400> up

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
pass and this definitely opens up

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
pass and this definitely opens up
possibilities<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:15.509> her<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.409> know

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
possibilities for her to have you know

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.780 
possibilities for her to have you know
one<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.740> those<00:01:16.860> paths<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.670> gonna

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
one of those paths that is really gonna

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.109 
one of those paths that is really gonna
make<00:01:18.000> us<00:01:18.380> feel<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.799> character<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
make us feel for the character and you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.789 
make us feel for the character and you
know<00:01:21.180> feel<00:01:21.600> bad<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.900> her<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.110> understand<00:01:22.650> her

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
know feel bad for her and understand her

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.469 
know feel bad for her and understand her
a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.330> right

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
a little bit more because as of right

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.080 
a little bit more because as of right
now<00:01:24.540> she's<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.409> weird<00:01:26.070> bird<00:01:26.430> lady<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
now she's just a weird bird lady that is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.899 
now she's just a weird bird lady that is
working<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.479> CC<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.829> after<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.759> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
working for CC but after this have to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
working for CC but after this have to
definitely<00:01:30.299> led<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.290> new<00:01:31.680> possibilities

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
definitely led to new possibilities

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.580 
definitely led to new possibilities
because<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.180> she's<00:01:33.479> been<00:01:33.689> working<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.079> Joker

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
because if she's been working for Joker

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.679 
because if she's been working for Joker
maybe<00:01:34.770> she's<00:01:35.009> asleep<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.420> know<00:01:36.540> maybe

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
maybe she's asleep and you know maybe

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.510 
maybe she's asleep and you know maybe
she<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.229> bad<00:01:37.470> pass<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> we're

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
she has a really bad pass and we're

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
she has a really bad pass and we're
gonna<00:01:38.610> finally<00:01:39.090> find<00:01:39.119> out<00:01:39.509> about<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.840> soon<00:01:40.049> so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
gonna finally find out about it soon so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
gonna finally find out about it soon so
I<00:01:41.130> definitely<00:01:41.670> said<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> big

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
I definitely said this is a big

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.149 
I definitely said this is a big
possibility<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.560> she<00:01:43.710> could<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> new

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
possibility that she could be a new

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
possibility that she could be a new
straw<00:01:44.399> hat<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.329> mean<00:01:45.600> you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
straw hat because of that I mean you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.210 
straw hat because of that I mean you
know<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.020> probably<00:01:46.140> very<00:01:46.320> big<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.070> like

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
know it's probably very big and like

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.770 
know it's probably very big and like
very<00:01:47.549> small<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.240> where<00:01:48.450> are<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.570> getting

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
very small like where are you getting

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
very small like where are you getting
that<00:01:48.899> from<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.729> judging<00:01:50.729> from<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that from but judging from that it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.580 
that from but judging from that it
definitely<00:01:52.380> adds<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.950> lot<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.450> interesting

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
definitely adds a lot of interesting

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.679 
definitely adds a lot of interesting
elements<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> her<00:01:55.950> because<00:01:56.549> before<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.420> didn't

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
elements to her because before we didn't

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.359 
elements to her because before we didn't
know<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.469> working<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.860> CC<00:01:59.219> what

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
know you know I see working with CC what

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.280 
know you know I see working with CC what
was<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> point<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.509> now<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.899> seems<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
was the point but now it seems that

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.709 
was the point but now it seems that
she's<00:02:01.649> forced<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.070> work<00:02:02.219> with<00:02:02.430> CC<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.210> don't

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
she's forced to work with CC so I don't

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.120 
she's forced to work with CC so I don't
even<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.049> she<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.320> cares<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.680> CC<00:02:05.040> if

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
even think she really cares for CC if

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.380 
even think she really cares for CC if
that's<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> case<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:05.759> she's<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that's the case because she's like you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.680 
that's the case because she's like you
know<00:02:06.560> she<00:02:07.560> has<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.829> not<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.399> she<00:02:08.580> wants<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> so

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
know she has to not that she wants to so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.029 
know she has to not that she wants to so
that<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:09.929> very<00:02:09.959> interesting<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> find<00:02:10.709> out

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that was very interesting to find out

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.949 
that was very interesting to find out
then<00:02:11.910> another<00:02:12.180> thing<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.629> going<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.900> in

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
then another thing that was going on in

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.760 
then another thing that was going on in
Chapter<00:02:13.500> 1

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
Chapter 1

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.630 
Chapter 1
go<00:02:13.950> back<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.310> Sanji<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.000> Virgo<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.610> Virgo<00:02:17.610> I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
go back to Sanji and Virgo and Virgo I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.310 
go back to Sanji and Virgo and Virgo I
guess<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.090> find<00:02:18.300> out<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.600> his<00:02:18.840> double<00:02:19.170> for

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
guess we find out that his double for

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.230 
guess we find out that his double for
powers<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.770> he's<00:02:19.980> like<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> big<00:02:20.520> thing<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.880> Steel

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
powers I he's like a big thing of Steel

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.700 
powers I he's like a big thing of Steel
because<00:02:21.480> he<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:21.870> gets<00:02:22.050> knocked<00:02:22.350> through<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
because he just gets knocked through the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.830 
because he just gets knocked through the
frickin<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.550> steel<00:02:24.120> wall<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.660> it's<00:02:24.780> like

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
frickin like a steel wall and it's like

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.540 
frickin like a steel wall and it's like
nothing<00:02:25.110> he's<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> thing<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.920> iron<00:02:26.280> or

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
nothing he's like a thing of iron or

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.220 
nothing he's like a thing of iron or
something<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.150> that's<00:02:27.660> really<00:02:28.020> interesting

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
something so that's really interesting

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.070 
something so that's really interesting
but<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:29.670> doesn't<00:02:29.730> explain<00:02:30.240> exactly<00:02:30.720> what's

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
but it doesn't explain exactly what's

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.780 
but it doesn't explain exactly what's
went<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.380> with<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.650> whole<00:02:31.830> thing<00:02:32.070> about<00:02:32.340> like

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
went on with that whole thing about like

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.980 
went on with that whole thing about like
stuff<00:02:33.090> sticking<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.630> his<00:02:33.720> face<00:02:33.960> and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
stuff sticking to his face and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
stuff sticking to his face and
everything<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.470> don't<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.710> if<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:34.920> just

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
everything I don't know if it's just

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.490 
everything I don't know if it's just
that<00:02:35.280> he's<00:02:35.760> an<00:02:35.940> idiot<00:02:36.090> once<00:02:36.570> again<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.230> what

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that he's an idiot once again or what

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
that he's an idiot once again or what
because<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.280> way<00:02:38.400> stars<00:02:38.700> use<00:02:38.910> probably<00:02:39.240> is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
because the way stars use probably is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.600 
because the way stars use probably is
like<00:02:39.390> he<00:02:40.020> seems<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.530> though<00:02:40.710> he's<00:02:40.890> an<00:02:41.040> iron<00:02:41.310> guy

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
like he seems as though he's an iron guy

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.150 
like he seems as though he's an iron guy
so<00:02:42.030> why<00:02:42.510> would<00:02:42.810> he<00:02:42.960> be<00:02:43.140> sticking<00:02:43.620> unless<00:02:43.860> I

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
so why would he be sticking unless I

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.860 
so why would he be sticking unless I
don't<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.820> don't<00:02:44.880> know<00:02:45.090> too<00:02:45.150> much<00:02:45.390> about<00:02:45.450> iron

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
don't I don't know too much about iron

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.900 
don't I don't know too much about iron
so<00:02:46.200> maybe<00:02:46.680> there's<00:02:46.980> something<00:02:47.190> there<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
so maybe there's something there to it

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.050 
so maybe there's something there to it
but<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:49.500> Sanji<00:02:50.160> versus<00:02:50.460> burger<00:02:50.730> fight<00:02:50.940> I

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
but the Sanji versus burger fight I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.550 
but the Sanji versus burger fight I
can't<00:02:51.270> wait<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.510> see<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.810> keep<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.470> because

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
can't wait to see it keep going because

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.830 
can't wait to see it keep going because
it's<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.940> looks<00:02:54.210> like<00:02:54.390> science<00:02:54.750> he's

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it's like it looks like science he's

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.150 
it's like it looks like science he's
gonna<00:02:54.960> have<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> lot<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.470> trouble<00:02:55.770> because<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
gonna have a lot of trouble because the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.920 
gonna have a lot of trouble because the
Virgo<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.850> like<00:02:56.970> some<00:02:57.150> iron<00:02:57.390> guy<00:02:57.630> then

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
Virgo is just like some iron guy then

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.360 
Virgo is just like some iron guy then
signs<00:02:58.380> he's<00:02:58.560> not<00:02:58.680> gonna<00:02:58.860> be<00:02:58.950> able<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.190> deal

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
signs he's not gonna be able to deal

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.810 
signs he's not gonna be able to deal
with<00:02:59.550> him<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.970> know<00:03:00.210> easily<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.610> that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
with him you know easily and I like that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.280 
with him you know easily and I like that
the<00:03:03.060> way<00:03:03.090> he<00:03:03.210> finds<00:03:03.480> he<00:03:03.570> describes<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.140> a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
the way he finds he describes to a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.110 
the way he finds he describes to a
burger<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:04.860> like<00:03:05.040> you're<00:03:05.430> somebody<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
burger that like you're somebody that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.880 
burger that like you're somebody that
our<00:03:06.480> boss<00:03:06.810> hates<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.350> most<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.770> know<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
our boss hates the most you know the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.800 
our boss hates the most you know the
type<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.100> person<00:03:08.310> he<00:03:08.820> hates<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.210> most<00:03:09.360> because

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
type of person he hates the most because

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.430 
type of person he hates the most because
Virgo<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.740> just<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:12.000> men<00:03:12.390> behind<00:03:12.900> burger

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
Virgo is just like the men behind burger

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.560 
Virgo is just like the men behind burger
just<00:03:13.710> keep<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.100> they're<00:03:14.310> more<00:03:14.760> curious<00:03:15.240> every

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
just keep on they're more curious every

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.780 
just keep on they're more curious every
chapter<00:03:15.930> like<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.440> know<00:03:16.500> why<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.010> he<00:03:17.490> doing

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
chapter like you know why is he doing

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.340 
chapter like you know why is he doing
this<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.330> not<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.690> road<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.050> we<00:03:19.170> know

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
this this is not the road but we know

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.600 
this this is not the road but we know
and<00:03:19.730> it's<00:03:20.730> seemingly<00:03:21.390> possible<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.460> way

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
and it's seemingly possible and the way

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.100 
and it's seemingly possible and the way
Virgo<00:03:24.000> said<00:03:24.210> that<00:03:24.330> this<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.600> an<00:03:24.720> internal

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
Virgo said that this is an internal

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.710 
Virgo said that this is an internal
matter<00:03:25.230> or<00:03:25.890> an<00:03:26.550> internal<00:03:26.910> affairs<00:03:27.390> money

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
matter or an internal affairs money

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.080 
matter or an internal affairs money
business<00:03:28.230> maybe<00:03:28.740> there<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.550> some<00:03:29.790> depth<00:03:30.030> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
business maybe there is some depth to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.430 
business maybe there is some depth to
Virgo<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.140> he<00:03:31.260> was<00:03:31.350> a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
Virgo and it's not just that he was a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.860 
Virgo and it's not just that he was a
trader<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.920> whole<00:03:32.070> time<00:03:32.250> maybe<00:03:32.720> some<00:03:33.720> of

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
trader this whole time maybe some of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.620 
trader this whole time maybe some of
what<00:03:34.260> he<00:03:34.470> was<00:03:34.740> to<00:03:35.100> these<00:03:35.280> people<00:03:35.730> was<00:03:35.940> real<00:03:36.330> and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
what he was to these people was real and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.810 
what he was to these people was real and
maybe<00:03:37.200> he<00:03:37.410> turned<00:03:37.650> his<00:03:37.800> back<00:03:37.980> on<00:03:38.220> them<00:03:38.340> after<00:03:38.790> a

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
maybe he turned his back on them after a

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.660 
maybe he turned his back on them after a
certain<00:03:39.030> point<00:03:39.330> that's<00:03:40.050> what<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.260> was<00:03:40.440> like

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
certain point that's what I was like

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.550 
certain point that's what I was like
starting<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.850> see<00:03:42.360> maybe<00:03:42.600> possibly<00:03:43.230> after

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
starting to see maybe possibly after

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.080 
starting to see maybe possibly after
this<00:03:43.680> chapter<00:03:44.070> because<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.700> way<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:44.910> said

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
this chapter because the way you said

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.700 
this chapter because the way you said
that<00:03:45.240> this<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:45.750> an<00:03:45.870> internal<00:03:46.290> matter<00:03:46.440> and

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
that this is an internal matter and

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.580 
that this is an internal matter and
stuff<00:03:46.920> maybe<00:03:47.430> that's<00:03:47.700> what<00:03:47.850> he<00:03:47.910> meant<00:03:48.060> that

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
stuff maybe that's what he meant that

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.440 
stuff maybe that's what he meant that
knows<00:03:49.590> more<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.370> than<00:03:50.670> what<00:03:51.000> meets<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.300> eye

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
knows more to it than what meets the eye

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.510 
knows more to it than what meets the eye
so<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.140> thought<00:03:52.710> that<00:03:52.830> was<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.980> real<00:03:53.100> interesting

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
so I thought that was a real interesting

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.010 
so I thought that was a real interesting
and<00:03:53.730> then<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.940> end<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.330> chapter<00:03:54.570> is<00:03:54.870> like

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
and then the end of the chapter is like

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.650 
and then the end of the chapter is like
law<00:03:55.710> that<00:03:56.040> sneaky<00:03:56.550> bastard<00:03:57.180> we<00:03:57.300> start<00:03:57.540> to

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
law that sneaky bastard we start to

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.510 
law that sneaky bastard we start to
learn<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.840> little<00:03:57.990> bit<00:03:58.140> more<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.590> he<00:03:59.220> wanted

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
learn a little bit more that he wanted

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.390 
learn a little bit more that he wanted
to<00:03:59.670> get<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.820> this<00:04:00.060> room<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.890> apparently<00:04:01.890> as<00:04:02.010> a

thing<00:04:33.189> I<00:04:33.280> could<00:04:33.430> think<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.759> was<00:04:33.939> maybe<00:04:34.629> a

00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:34.749 
thing I could think of was maybe a

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:36.360 
thing I could think of was maybe a
weapon<00:04:35.289> of<00:04:35.379> mass<00:04:35.409> destruction<00:04:35.770> because<00:04:36.219> it

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
weapon of mass destruction because it

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.550 
weapon of mass destruction because it
was<00:04:36.460> like<00:04:36.550> he<00:04:37.389> wants<00:04:37.629> to<00:04:37.719> leave<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:38.110> mess<00:04:38.319> in<00:04:38.469> the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
was like he wants to leave a mess in the

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.260 
was like he wants to leave a mess in the
New<00:04:38.710> World<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.069> then<00:04:39.219> law<00:04:39.430> has<00:04:39.639> like<00:04:39.789> a<00:04:39.819> smile

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
New World and then law has like a smile

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.909 
New World and then law has like a smile
at<00:04:40.509> the<00:04:40.659> end<00:04:40.689> maybe<00:04:41.379> there's<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.740> possibility

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
at the end maybe there's a possibility

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.070 
at the end maybe there's a possibility
whatever<00:04:42.610> is<00:04:42.729> in<00:04:42.849> that<00:04:42.969> room<00:04:43.210> is<00:04:43.419> gonna<00:04:43.810> knock
