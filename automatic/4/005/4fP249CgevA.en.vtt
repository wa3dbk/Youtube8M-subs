we<00:00:13.230> look<00:00:13.410> decent<00:00:13.740> even<00:00:14.670> if<00:00:14.789> we<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.150> much<00:00:15.480> more

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
we look decent even if we have much more

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.130 
we look decent even if we have much more
to<00:00:15.959> go<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.470> absolutely<00:00:16.830> sure<00:00:17.869> in<00:00:18.869> both

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
to go on I'm absolutely sure in both

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.010 
to go on I'm absolutely sure in both
games<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.849> had<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.270> possession<00:00:21.900> but

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
games we had a lot of possession but

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.319 
games we had a lot of possession but
didn't<00:00:22.289> create<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.070> enough<00:00:23.550> chances<00:00:24.119> but

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
didn't create the enough chances but

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.229 
didn't create the enough chances but
that<00:00:24.869> would<00:00:25.050> come<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.680> very<00:00:26.250> strong<00:00:26.849> first<00:00:27.119> half

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
that would come a very strong first half

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.329 
that would come a very strong first half
it's<00:00:27.720> only<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.110> last<00:00:28.560> five<00:00:28.800> minutes<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
it's only the last five minutes in the

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.640 
it's only the last five minutes in the
first<00:00:29.519> half<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.509> was<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:30.929> bit<00:00:31.140> sloppy

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
first half it was a little bit sloppy

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560 
first half it was a little bit sloppy
but<00:00:31.830> otherwise<00:00:32.220> it<00:00:32.550> looked<00:00:32.759> very<00:00:32.850> song<00:00:33.390> with

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
but otherwise it looked very song with

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.960 
but otherwise it looked very song with
the<00:00:33.690> first<00:00:33.900> 40<00:00:34.290> minutes<00:00:34.650> and<00:00:34.860> then<00:00:35.010> second

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
the first 40 minutes and then second

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.180 
the first 40 minutes and then second
half<00:00:36.120> also<00:00:36.629> tired<00:00:36.930> players<00:00:37.290> too<00:00:37.980> many

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
half also tired players too many

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790 
half also tired players too many
unforced<00:00:38.400> errors<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.110> normal<00:00:40.350> it's

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
unforced errors but that is normal it's

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
unforced errors but that is normal it's
with<00:00:41.070> anyhow<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.699> is<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> kind<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.329> fitness

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
with anyhow this is the kind of fitness

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.920 
with anyhow this is the kind of fitness
we<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.440> thought<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.489> did<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.940> good<00:00:45.210> first

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
we need I thought we did a good first

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.689 
we need I thought we did a good first
half<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.469> had<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> lot<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> possession<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
half we had a lot of possession and I

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.150 
half we had a lot of possession and I
think<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.059> agree<00:00:48.690> i'm<00:00:49.140> doing<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> same<00:00:49.890> thing

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
think we agree i'm doing the same thing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.979 
think we agree i'm doing the same thing
in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.309> second<00:00:50.609> half<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.000> suddenly<00:00:51.510> got<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
in the second half but suddenly got a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
in the second half but suddenly got a
little<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.379> hard<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.680> us<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.129> they<00:00:53.850> came<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
little bit hard for us we they came a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
little bit hard for us we they came a
little<00:00:54.270> bit<00:00:54.449> higher<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.170> managed<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.949> we

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
little bit higher and they managed to we

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.490 
little bit higher and they managed to we
did<00:00:56.730> some<00:00:56.760> easy<00:00:57.090> mistakes<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.899> they

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
did some easy mistakes and they

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.349 
did some easy mistakes and they
counter-attacked<00:00:58.890> us<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.730> couple<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.180> times

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
counter-attacked us to a couple of times

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
counter-attacked us to a couple of times
and<00:01:00.859> they<00:01:01.859> made<00:01:02.070> gold<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.519> cross<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:04.160> i'm<00:01:05.160> not

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and they made gold on a cross so i'm not

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490 
and they made gold on a cross so i'm not
very<00:01:05.550> very<00:01:06.000> happy<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.509> game<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:06.990> i

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
very very happy with the game but i

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.380 
very very happy with the game but i
think<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.160> first<00:01:08.369> half<00:01:08.550> was<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.910> good<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
think the first half was very good you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.080 
think the first half was very good you
can<00:01:09.539> see<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.899> you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.410> position<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
can see that you know the position is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.050 
can see that you know the position is
extremely<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> high<00:01:13.320> quality<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.820> fact

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
extremely at the high quality the fact

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.790 
extremely at the high quality the fact
that<00:01:15.179> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.539> it's<00:01:15.750> kind<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.050> hot<00:01:16.289> down<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
that you know it's kind of hot down in

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.650 
that you know it's kind of hot down in
Florida<00:01:17.310> maybe<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:18.060> why<00:01:18.209> the<00:01:18.270> widowed

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
Florida maybe that's why the widowed

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.839 
Florida maybe that's why the widowed
mother<00:01:18.899> wouldn't<00:01:19.709> wasn't<00:01:20.220> fast<00:01:20.580> but

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:20.849 
mother wouldn't wasn't fast but

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.580 
mother wouldn't wasn't fast but
technically<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.720> way<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.959> possess<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.440> ball

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
technically the way we possess the ball

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.130 
technically the way we possess the ball
I'm<00:01:22.920> very<00:01:23.160> pleased<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.399> it

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.920 

and<00:01:28.070> that's<00:01:28.280> very<00:01:28.850> big<00:01:29.090> fan<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.300> losing<00:01:29.750> game

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930

just it is a great favor of getting a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.510 
just it is a great favor of getting a
draw<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:41.390> kind<00:01:42.229> of<00:01:42.320> know<00:01:42.710> Papa<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.310> type<00:01:43.490> of

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
draw I kind of know Papa of the type of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.550 
draw I kind of know Papa of the type of
plays<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:43.850> normally<00:01:44.750> with<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.930> left<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.410> way

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
plays and normally with the left the way

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.230 
plays and normally with the left the way
he<00:01:45.680> was<00:01:45.770> positioning<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.759> it's<00:01:46.940> gonna<00:01:47.060> be

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
he was positioning is but it's gonna be

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.890 
he was positioning is but it's gonna be
so<00:01:47.390> difficult<00:01:47.600> for<00:01:47.840> hitting<00:01:48.830> on<00:01:48.890> my<00:01:49.600> right<00:01:50.600> and

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
so difficult for hitting on my right and

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.690 
so difficult for hitting on my right and
I<00:01:51.440> think<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:51.800> I<00:01:52.070> was<00:01:52.190> going<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.369> go<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.550> my

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
I think like I was going to go to my

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.719 
I think like I was going to go to my
right<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.690> know<00:01:53.780> maybe<00:01:54.110> made<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.770> mistake

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
right but you know maybe made a mistake

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.100 
right but you know maybe made a mistake
and<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:55.909> was<00:01:56.060> lucky<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.420> get<00:01:56.509> on<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.780> left<00:01:56.960> side

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
and I was lucky to get on the left side

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.590 
and I was lucky to get on the left side
I<00:01:57.350> don't<00:01:58.040> care<00:01:58.250> about<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.670> results<00:01:59.180> I<00:01:59.300> like<00:01:59.450> to
