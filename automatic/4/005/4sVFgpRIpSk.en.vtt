00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.570
 and with friends missing 90 apps in this 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.820
 we will be a game that the truth 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.320
 This game is very good, it's called skiing 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.590
 safari and he sent it to his friend john 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.330
 valencia and well let's check this 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.180
 I play a bit the truth I do not recommend it 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.520
 and it is very very good I enjoyed it with 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.070
 this kind of games that I like 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.740
 A lot are simple but they bring many 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.899
 many hours of fun to show a 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.899
 little how it works here we have 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.929
 but what are these the records that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.269
 we have done it works as you can see with 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:46.320
 game center that wants to add my game 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:49.620
 center is' the lack 90 and good here is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.979
 to see how to play it to the art world 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.530
 as you can see it jumps yes and if we are 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.920
 be in the air and leave a presenter 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.019
 still this a flipe back and good 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.989
 here to get the coins this 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.289
 we can not upload this character 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.880
 is to be able to go faster than the 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.960
 interface is very simple only to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 give ski 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.080
 we see that there is an avalanche in this 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.800
 it consists and good comes what this 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.680
 character 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.080
 he goes out of his house shot 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.200
 has about can not ski ie 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.390
 in case in these jumping stones and 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.430
 pass over or inside the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.050
 houses and as you will see that flame went up a 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.740
 penguin which makes it a bit more 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.290
 fast and the afternoon of falling with see you 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.140
 in the air trying to fall this is from a 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.990
 shape 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 This we will not fall because 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.800
 avalanche comes back from us not 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.050
 we have to try not to reach us 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.360
 the moment you fall, it is 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.400
 the option to give so quickly to him 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.650
 that recovers faster and can 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.479
 continue to advance the truth is a game 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.640
 very good this thanks to our friend 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.800
 who sent it to us and to be able to recommend 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.860
 those of you who obviate the skin 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.020
 big 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.070
 and well I'm going to fall to see this 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.690
 how is it when you fall 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.800
 there comes the avalanche and I have to 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.630
 recover me giving you are fast 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.940
 and he wants to go back up we go to 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.960
 give a backward climate I think to put 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.370
 it can not 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.410
 he has to lie down to be able to give 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.410
 the flip there is lying down already 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.599
 Y 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.760
 It really is a game that is very good 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.950
 this I've been playing in the last 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.560
 days I really liked the gameplay is 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.330
 very good and good those who have game 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.160
 center can you add me to 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.190
 check the records here I went up to 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.250
 something I think is an eagle which you 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.480
 allows this to go flying and good 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.180
 as they advance they go unblocking 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.950
 more things and here 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.420
 good that more things as they go 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.909
 advancing in the game is a game that the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.980
 it's really good and I recommend it 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.260
 I'm not going to leave much 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.480
 I will not let you win 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.430
 to finish this example and not do it 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.689
 so long for you since you 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.810
 they will have the opportunity to be able 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.519
 play it and there comes the avalanche as 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.760
 you can see here either start to put more 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.930
 big that circle of weapons and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.159
 ready we saw until here we arrived at 32 thousand 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.040
 score 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.959
 and well I think my record is 99 thousand 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.299

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.950
