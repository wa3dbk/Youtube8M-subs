it's<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.410> right<00:02:31.560> way<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:31.950> now<00:02:32.400> some

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it's the right way like now some

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.479 
it's the right way like now some

me the top teams in this tournament our
alliance<00:04:36.449> and<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:37.680> thought<00:04:38.129> Navi<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.729> mean<00:04:38.879> I

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
alliance and I thought Navi I mean I

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.399 
alliance and I thought Navi I mean I
still<00:04:39.150> think<00:04:39.240> Navi<00:04:39.569> but<00:04:39.720> honestly<00:04:39.960> DK<00:04:40.259> has

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
still think Navi but honestly DK has

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:41.750 
still think Navi but honestly DK has
been<00:04:40.560> impressive

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
been impressive

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.230 
been impressive
yeah<00:04:42.480> I<00:04:42.600> think<00:04:43.410> they<00:04:43.620> just<00:04:43.650> picked<00:04:44.520> their

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
yeah I think they just picked their

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.490 
yeah I think they just picked their
opponents<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:45.900> far<00:04:46.080> like<00:04:46.170> I<00:04:46.260> mean<00:04:46.380> for<00:04:46.410> example

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
opponents so far like I mean for example

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.700 
opponents so far like I mean for example
the<00:04:46.770> games<00:04:46.920> against<00:04:47.130> liquid<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:48.690> don't<00:04:49.440> see<00:04:49.590> any

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
the games against liquid I don't see any

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.110 
the games against liquid I don't see any
team<00:04:49.950> winning<00:04:50.190> with<00:04:50.340> this<00:04:50.460> draft<00:04:50.700> against<00:04:50.970> DK

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
team winning with this draft against DK

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.880 
team winning with this draft against DK
so<00:04:51.300> I'm<00:04:51.660> not<00:04:51.810> sure<00:04:51.930> it's<00:04:52.050> liquids<00:04:52.470> fault<00:04:52.710> I

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
so I'm not sure it's liquids fault I

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.770 
so I'm not sure it's liquids fault I
think<00:04:53.100> or<00:04:53.370> DK<00:04:54.030> played<00:04:54.210> really<00:04:54.450> solid<00:04:54.690> of

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
think or DK played really solid of

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.720 
think or DK played really solid of
course<00:04:54.840> with<00:04:55.080> every<00:04:55.290> team<00:04:55.470> here<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.770> insanely

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
course with every team here is insanely

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.270 
course with every team here is insanely
good<00:04:56.880> so<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.510> want<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.320> see<00:04:58.470> more<00:04:58.590> from<00:04:58.650> DK<00:04:59.040> but<00:04:59.160> I
