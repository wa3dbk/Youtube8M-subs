years<00:02:04.350> old<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:04.680> very<00:02:05.009> hard<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> believe<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
years old now very hard to believe I

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.339 
years old now very hard to believe I
think<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.390> timeless<00:02:06.630> design<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.170> see

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
think it's a timeless design you can see

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.320 
think it's a timeless design you can see
the<00:02:10.470> shape<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.830> perfect<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.700> exactly<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.270> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the shape is perfect just exactly what a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.740 
the shape is perfect just exactly what a
dunk<00:02:12.540> high<00:02:12.780> should<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.230> looking<00:02:13.440> like

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
dunk high should be looking like

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.180 
dunk high should be looking like
no<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.580> 2000<00:02:16.240> white<00:02:16.570> obsidian<00:02:17.200> nike<00:02:17.920> dunk

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
a pair of 1997 neons so basically the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.210 
a pair of 1997 neons so basically the
og's<00:02:45.340> came<00:02:45.580> out<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:46.380> 95<00:02:47.380> right<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.860> first<00:02:48.070> air

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
og's came out in 95 right the first air

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.580 
og's came out in 95 right the first air
max<00:02:48.430> 95<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.150> then<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:49.720> was<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.020> next<00:02:50.200> time

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
max 95 and then this was the next time

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.530 
max 95 and then this was the next time
that<00:02:50.800> they<00:02:50.890> released<00:02:51.160> these<00:02:51.280> was<00:02:51.580> 1997<00:02:52.420> and

believe the second release ride from 97

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.320 
believe the second release ride from 97
on<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.410> bottom<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.160> still<00:03:03.430> says<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.880> know<00:03:04.000> 20

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
on the bottom it still says you know 20

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.240 
on the bottom it still says you know 20
25<00:03:04.989> psi<00:03:07.110> okay<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.290> newer<00:03:08.470> pairs<00:03:08.770> don't<00:03:09.040> list

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
25 psi okay like newer pairs don't list

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.010 
25 psi okay like newer pairs don't list
the<00:03:09.310> PSI<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.000> there<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.239> no<00:03:10.360> pressure<00:03:10.750> per

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
the PSI that there is no pressure per

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.860 
the PSI that there is no pressure per
square<00:03:11.050> inch<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.860> in<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.280> air<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.750> not

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
square inch in the in the air it's not

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.240 
square inch in the in the air it's not
actually<00:03:14.140> functional<00:03:14.530> air<00:03:14.650> units<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.100> these

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
actually functional air units on these

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.460 
actually functional air units on these
are<00:03:15.400> functional<00:03:15.850> um<00:03:19.080> another<00:03:20.080> thing<00:03:20.200> to

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
are functional um another thing to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.850 
are functional um another thing to
notice<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.890> makes<00:03:21.100> these<00:03:21.280> different<00:03:21.760> from

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
notice that makes these different from

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.199 
notice that makes these different from
the<00:03:23.860> newer<00:03:24.070> pairs<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.700> see<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.060> newer

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
the newer pairs that you see the newer

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.320 
the newer pairs that you see the newer
retros<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.900> uh<00:03:26.380> aside<00:03:27.100> from<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> shape<00:03:27.610> what

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
retros is uh aside from the shape what

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.150 
retros is uh aside from the shape what
you<00:03:28.450> will<00:03:28.570> see<00:03:28.720> wrong<00:03:28.930> with<00:03:29.080> these<00:03:29.170> is<00:03:29.350> that<00:03:29.380> on

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
you will see wrong with these is that on

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.070 
you will see wrong with these is that on
this<00:03:30.310> pair<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:31.269> part<00:03:31.570> right<00:03:31.600> here<00:03:31.720> is

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
this pair this part right here is

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.140 
this pair this part right here is
actually<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.310> grade<00:03:33.580> these<00:03:34.030> are

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
actually like a grade these are

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.910 
actually like a grade these are
different<00:03:34.330> shades<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.810> gray<00:03:35.049> on<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.769> newer

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
different shades of gray on the newer

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.770 
different shades of gray on the newer
pairs<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.580> part<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:36.880> completely<00:03:37.330> black<00:03:37.540> now

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
pairs this part is completely black now

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.539 
pairs this part is completely black now
that's<00:03:37.959> wrong<00:03:38.230> that's<00:03:38.650> not<00:03:38.860> it's<00:03:39.130> not<00:03:39.220> correct

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
that's wrong that's not it's not correct

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.569 
that's wrong that's not it's not correct
in<00:03:39.760> any<00:03:39.880> way<00:03:40.260> alright<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:43.299> we<00:03:43.360> got<00:03:43.390> 97<00:03:44.170> neons

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
in any way alright so we got 97 neons

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.750 
in any way alright so we got 97 neons
very<00:03:45.579> hard<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.880> find<00:03:46.120> obviously<00:03:46.720> from<00:03:46.870> 97

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
very hard to find obviously from 97

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.130 
very hard to find obviously from 97
you'd<00:03:48.760> you'd<00:03:48.910> be<00:03:49.030> hard-pressed<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.810> find<00:03:49.900> a

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
you'd you'd be hard-pressed to find a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.610 
you'd you'd be hard-pressed to find a
pair<00:03:50.320> of<00:03:50.380> 2,000<00:03:50.890> threes<00:03:51.100> at<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.370> point<00:03:51.610> but

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
pair of 2,000 threes at this point but

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.860 
pair of 2,000 threes at this point but
to<00:03:53.620> make<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:53.829> even<00:03:54.040> better<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.660> got<00:03:55.660> another

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
to make this even better I got another

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.890 
to make this even better I got another
pair<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.170> these<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.440> got<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:58.510> one<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.780> my

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
pair of these I got to this one is my
