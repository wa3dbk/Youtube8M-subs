downstream and you might not be the

first to want to paddle that rapid so

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.570

first person to run that rapid is going
to<00:00:18.890> have<00:00:19.039> you<00:00:19.250> already<00:00:19.520> ready<00:00:20.350> but<00:00:21.350> there's

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
not much use in having a throw rope if

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.519 
not much use in having a throw rope if
you<00:00:23.300> don't<00:00:23.480> know<00:00:23.539> how<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:23.720> use<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:25.750> these<00:00:26.750> throw

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
you don't know how to use it these throw

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.740 
you don't know how to use it these throw
bags<00:00:27.800> are<00:00:28.160> really<00:00:28.580> simple<00:00:28.820> to<00:00:29.029> use<00:00:29.090> they're

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
bags are really simple to use they're

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.660 
bags are really simple to use they're
small<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.350> compact<00:00:30.800> they<00:00:31.039> hold<00:00:31.220> a<00:00:31.310> lot<00:00:31.519> of

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
small that compact they hold a lot of

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.280 
small that compact they hold a lot of
rope<00:00:31.849> what<00:00:32.599> you<00:00:32.720> do<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.080> take<00:00:33.230> your

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
rope what you do is you take your

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.430 
rope what you do is you take your
carabiner<00:00:33.860> off<00:00:34.479> you<00:00:35.479> open<00:00:35.839> up<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.110> end<00:00:36.260> of<00:00:36.350> the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
carabiner off you open up the end of the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.219 
carabiner off you open up the end of the
bag<00:00:37.180> just<00:00:38.180> enough<00:00:38.449> so<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.809> rope<00:00:38.989> will

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:39.229 
bag just enough so that the rope will

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.950 
bag just enough so that the rope will
flow<00:00:39.710> through<00:00:39.739> freely<00:00:40.460> then<00:00:41.420> you<00:00:41.540> take<00:00:41.720> out<00:00:41.930> a

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
flow through freely then you take out a

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.990 
flow through freely then you take out a
bite<00:00:42.199> of<00:00:42.229> rope

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
bite of rope

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.160 
bite of rope
now<00:00:44.000> I've<00:00:44.210> gotta<00:00:44.420> know<00:00:44.600> if<00:00:44.659> this<00:00:44.930> throwback

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
now I've gotta know if this throwback

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.899 
now I've gotta know if this throwback
gonna<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:45.769> some<00:00:45.949> momentum<00:00:46.370> when<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.519> let<00:00:46.790> it

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
gonna have some momentum when I let it

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.360 
gonna have some momentum when I let it
go<00:00:47.409> anytime<00:00:48.409> you're<00:00:48.589> setting<00:00:48.890> safe<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.280> to

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
go anytime you're setting safe to you to

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.950 
go anytime you're setting safe to you to
wrap<00:00:49.549> it<00:00:49.760> it's<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:49.970> good<00:00:50.089> idea<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.510> plan<00:00:50.720> what's

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
wrap it it's a good idea to plan what's

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.700 
wrap it it's a good idea to plan what's
about<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.199> happen

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
about to happen

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.399 
about to happen
at<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.159> spot<00:00:52.430> like<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:52.750> I'm<00:00:53.750> pretty<00:00:54.049> sure<00:00:54.229> the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
at a spot like this I'm pretty sure the

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:55.810 
at a spot like this I'm pretty sure the
swimmer<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.830> going<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.010> submerge<00:00:55.339> in<00:00:55.549> the<00:00:55.640> hole

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
swimmer is going to submerge in the hole

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.049 
swimmer is going to submerge in the hole
and<00:00:56.089> pop<00:00:56.510> up<00:00:56.780> moving<00:00:57.140> downstream<00:00:57.530> fast

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
and pop up moving downstream fast

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.119 
and pop up moving downstream fast
therefore<00:00:59.059> I'm<00:00:59.750> gonna<00:00:59.900> find<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.320> spot<00:01:00.440> where<00:01:01.100> I

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
therefore I'm gonna find a spot where I

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.799 
therefore I'm gonna find a spot where I
can<00:01:01.220> anchor<00:01:01.549> myself<00:01:02.089> against<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.600> pool

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
can anchor myself against the pool

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.680 
can anchor myself against the pool
that's<00:01:03.049> about<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.409> happen<00:01:03.760> instead<00:01:04.760> of<00:01:04.970> coming

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
that's about to happen instead of coming

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.810 
that's about to happen instead of coming
down<00:01:05.720> here<00:01:06.290> where<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.710> rocks<00:01:07.039> are<00:01:07.219> slick<00:01:07.520> and

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
down here where the rocks are slick and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.389 
down here where the rocks are slick and
angled<00:01:08.359> towards<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.719> river<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:09.289> might<00:01:10.130> be<00:01:10.310> able

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
angled towards the river I might be able

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.160 
angled towards the river I might be able
to<00:01:10.520> catch<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.880> swimmer<00:01:11.149> there<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:11.899> he<00:01:11.990> might

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
to catch the swimmer there but he might

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.230 
to catch the swimmer there but he might
pull<00:01:12.380> me<00:01:12.560> in<00:01:12.710> instead<00:01:13.640> I'm<00:01:13.820> gonna<00:01:13.969> find

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
pull me in instead I'm gonna find

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.999 
pull me in instead I'm gonna find
somewhere<00:01:14.570> where<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.869> rocks<00:01:15.109> I'm<00:01:15.619> projecting

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
somewhere where the rocks I'm projecting

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.429 
somewhere where the rocks I'm projecting
up<00:01:16.579> are<00:01:17.149> possibly<00:01:17.539> where<00:01:17.810> there's<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.049> tree<00:01:18.259> to

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
up are possibly where there's a tree to

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.770 
up are possibly where there's a tree to
get<00:01:18.560> behind<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.310> I'm<00:01:19.820> gonna<00:01:19.939> set<00:01:20.210> myself<00:01:20.390> up

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
get behind and I'm gonna set myself up

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.709 
get behind and I'm gonna set myself up
where<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.560> can<00:01:21.740> take<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.979> seat<00:01:22.310> or<00:01:22.880> lean<00:01:23.119> back<00:01:23.390> and

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
where I can take a seat or lean back and

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.950 
where I can take a seat or lean back and
have<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.229> really<00:01:24.500> good<00:01:24.740> foothold<00:01:25.189> to<00:01:25.549> pull<00:01:25.759> on

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
have a really good foothold to pull on

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.450 
have a really good foothold to pull on
then<00:01:26.960> I'm<00:01:27.289> going<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.829> wrap<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.159> rope<00:01:28.310> around

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
then I'm going to wrap the rope around

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:39.100 
then I'm going to wrap the rope around
my<00:01:28.789> waist<00:01:29.000> once<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:32.409> pull<00:01:33.409> all<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.740> slack<00:01:33.859> out

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.620 

this<00:01:39.800> way<00:01:39.980> I've<00:01:40.160> got<00:01:40.190> a<00:01:40.400> free<00:01:40.730> throwing<00:01:41.270> arm

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
this way I've got a free throwing arm

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.510 
this way I've got a free throwing arm
and<00:01:41.930> yet<00:01:42.470> I'm<00:01:42.620> not<00:01:42.650> going<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.040> drop<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.370> rope

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
and yet I'm not going to drop the rope

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.480 
and yet I'm not going to drop the rope
with<00:01:43.700> either<00:01:43.880> hands<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.570> one<00:01:45.560> hand<00:01:45.860> if<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.310> pool

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
with either hands a one hand if the pool

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.250 
with either hands a one hand if the pool
is<00:01:46.520> too<00:01:46.790> hard<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.330> might<00:01:47.570> pull<00:01:47.870> me<00:01:47.990> into<00:01:48.140> the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
is too hard it might pull me into the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.290 
is too hard it might pull me into the
water<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.070> I'm<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.280> lot<00:01:49.460> less<00:01:49.640> likely<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.150> get

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
water but I'm a lot less likely to get

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.000 
water but I'm a lot less likely to get
the<00:01:50.450> rope<00:01:50.630> burn<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:51.020> my<00:01:51.170> hands<00:01:51.590> which<00:01:51.770> might

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
the rope burn on my hands which might

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.270 
the rope burn on my hands which might
cause<00:01:52.250> me<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.550> let<00:01:52.760> go<00:01:53.000> or<00:01:53.330> fall<00:01:53.900> forwards<00:01:54.470> so

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
cause me to let go or fall forwards so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.190 
cause me to let go or fall forwards so
in<00:01:55.370> this<00:01:55.490> way<00:01:55.670> I'm<00:01:56.330> going<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.660> throw<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.050> rope

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
in this way I'm going to throw the rope

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.410 
in this way I'm going to throw the rope
and<00:01:58.040> as<00:01:58.220> soon<00:01:58.430> as<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:58.700> rope<00:01:58.910> is<00:01:59.120> headed

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
and as soon as that rope is headed

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.940 
and as soon as that rope is headed
towards<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.810> swimmer<00:02:00.080> I'm<00:02:00.440> gonna<00:02:00.680> sit<00:02:00.920> down

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
towards the swimmer I'm gonna sit down

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.740 
towards the swimmer I'm gonna sit down
and<00:02:01.310> brace<00:02:01.490> myself<00:02:01.760> for<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.390> pool<00:02:02.570> that's

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
and brace myself for the pool that's

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.090 
and brace myself for the pool that's
about<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.110> happen<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.170> good<00:02:09.320> idea<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.860> lead

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
about to happen it's a good idea to lead

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.840 
about to happen it's a good idea to lead
the<00:02:10.310> swimmer<00:02:10.640> just<00:02:11.060> slightly<00:02:11.390> over<00:02:12.130> shot<00:02:13.130> like

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the swimmer just slightly over shot like

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.430 
the swimmer just slightly over shot like
if<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.090> swimmers<00:02:14.420> coming<00:02:14.570> down<00:02:14.840> here<00:02:15.110> I'll

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
if the swimmers coming down here I'll

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.460 
if the swimmers coming down here I'll
aim<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:16.370> behind<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.910> swimmer<00:02:17.470> downstream

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
aim just behind the swimmer downstream

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.070 
aim just behind the swimmer downstream
and<00:02:18.739> across<00:02:19.040> him<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.880> way<00:02:20.120> as<00:02:20.390> they<00:02:20.900> go

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
and across him that way as they go

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.890 
and across him that way as they go
downstream<00:02:21.500> fast<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.790> rope<00:02:23.090> starts

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
downstream fast and that rope starts

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.840 
downstream fast and that rope starts
just<00:02:24.200> play<00:02:24.500> out<00:02:24.709> they're<00:02:25.220> gonna<00:02:25.340> run<00:02:25.640> right

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
just play out they're gonna run right

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.650 
just play out they're gonna run right
into<00:02:26.360> it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
into it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.870 
into it
the<00:02:27.050> other<00:02:27.290> idea<00:02:27.530> some<00:02:28.340> people<00:02:28.610> like<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.760> just

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
the other idea some people like to just

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.610 
the other idea some people like to just
aim<00:02:29.300> straight<00:02:29.600> for<00:02:29.720> their<00:02:29.989> head<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.350> hit<00:02:30.500> them

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
aim straight for their head and hit them

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.590 
aim straight for their head and hit them
with<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.860> bag<00:02:31.040> but<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.120> case<00:02:32.270> like<00:02:32.540> this

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
with the bag but in a case like this

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.240 
with the bag but in a case like this
where<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> swimmer<00:02:33.500> could<00:02:33.709> be<00:02:33.830> underwater

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
where the swimmer could be underwater

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.310 
where the swimmer could be underwater
for<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.610> period<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.060> time<00:02:35.239> there's<00:02:35.870> really<00:02:35.959> not

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
for a period of time there's really not

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.560 
for a period of time there's really not
much<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.590> aim<00:02:36.890> for<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.790> always<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.300> just

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
much to aim for so always in just

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.960 
much to aim for so always in just
slightly<00:02:38.870> downstream<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.830> across<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.790> path

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
slightly downstream and across the path

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.850 
slightly downstream and across the path
of<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.270> swimmer<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.810> they'll<00:02:42.260> end<00:02:42.500> up<00:02:42.620> at<00:02:42.770> the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
of the swimmer and they'll end up at the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.360 
of the swimmer and they'll end up at the
rope<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.900> always<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.260> good<00:02:45.500> idea<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.830> practice

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
rope it's always a good idea to practice

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.070 
rope it's always a good idea to practice
with<00:02:46.580> your<00:02:46.700> throw<00:02:47.000> rope<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.750> know<00:02:47.900> how

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
with your throw rope so you know how

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.320 
with your throw rope so you know how
long<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:48.560> bag<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.400> then<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.910> can<00:02:50.060> plan

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
long this bag is and then you can plan

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.390 
long this bag is and then you can plan
ahead<00:02:50.360> for<00:02:51.080> where<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.769> rope<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.190> going<00:02:52.340> to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
ahead for where that rope is going to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.670 
ahead for where that rope is going to
pull<00:02:52.610> somebody<00:02:53.260> another<00:02:54.260> thing<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.650> remember

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
pull somebody another thing to remember

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.120 
pull somebody another thing to remember
is<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.340> grab<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.730> rope<00:02:55.970> not<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.930> bag<00:02:57.140> these

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
is to grab the rope not the bag these

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.009 
is to grab the rope not the bag these
bags<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.670> 60<00:02:59.060> feet<00:02:59.239> of<00:02:59.360> rope<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.690> them<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
bags have 60 feet of rope in them and

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.990 
bags have 60 feet of rope in them and
you<00:03:00.530> don't<00:03:00.680> want<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> go<00:03:00.980> 60<00:03:01.340> feet<00:03:01.489> downstream

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
you don't want to go 60 feet downstream

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.720 
you don't want to go 60 feet downstream
before<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.420> pulls<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.840> safety<00:03:03.580> we<00:03:04.580> say

I just made that throw and I missed the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.830 
I just made that throw and I missed the
swimmer<00:03:07.160> but<00:03:07.970> they're<00:03:08.120> still<00:03:08.299> in<00:03:08.360> need<00:03:08.600> of<00:03:08.660> my

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
the added weight of the water will allow

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.150 
the added weight of the water will allow
that<00:03:32.120> bag<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.660> travel<00:03:32.990> just<00:03:33.050> as<00:03:33.350> this<00:03:33.500> if<00:03:33.890> it

that bag to travel just as this if it

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.450 
that bag to travel just as this if it
was<00:03:34.310> full<00:03:35.110> after<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.260> incident<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.770> over<00:03:37.130> it's

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
was full after the incident is over it's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.890 
was full after the incident is over it's
always<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.730> good<00:03:37.880> idea<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.210> stuff<00:03:38.540> your<00:03:38.690> throw

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
always a good idea to stuff your throw

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.770 
always a good idea to stuff your throw
bag<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.650> easiest<00:03:40.130> way<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.310> do<00:03:40.550> this<00:03:40.580> is<00:03:41.060> open

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
bag the easiest way to do this is open

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.410 
bag the easiest way to do this is open
