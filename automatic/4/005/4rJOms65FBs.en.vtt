but<00:02:34.320> it'd<00:02:34.560> still<00:02:34.620> be<00:02:34.890> there<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:36.600> that's<00:02:36.780> why<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
but it'd still be there so that's why I

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.020 
but it'd still be there so that's why I
have<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.290> there<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.650> man<00:02:38.520> keep<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.910> there

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
have it on there I man keep it on there

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.370 
have it on there I man keep it on there
a<00:02:39.060> little<00:02:39.180> bit<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.540> unless<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.080> starts

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
a little bit and unless it starts

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.400 
a little bit and unless it starts
getting<00:02:40.740> annoying<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.420> still<00:02:43.140> thought<00:02:43.290> was

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
getting annoying but I still thought was

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.220 
getting annoying but I still thought was
a<00:02:43.440> pretty<00:02:43.590> good<00:02:43.710> idea<00:02:44.810> let's<00:02:45.810> get<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
a pretty good idea let's get to the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.890 
a pretty good idea let's get to the
knife<00:02:46.410> then<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:47.790> does<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.120> fr<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.600> handles

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
knife then it does have fr and handles

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.310 
knife then it does have fr and handles
here<00:02:49.080> has<00:02:49.440> kind<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:50.030> it's<00:02:51.030> not<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.420> volcano

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
here has kind of it's not the volcano

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.610 
here has kind of it's not the volcano
texturing<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.670> delica<00:02:54.120> has<00:02:54.410> it's<00:02:55.410> kind

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
texturing like the delica has it's kind

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.110 
texturing like the delica has it's kind
of<00:02:55.650> almost<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.160> golf<00:02:56.370> ball<00:02:56.520> dimple

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
of almost like a golf ball dimple

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.870 
of almost like a golf ball dimple
texturing<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:59.100> worked<00:02:59.310> really<00:02:59.460> well<00:02:59.550> when

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
texturing and it worked really well when

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.970 
texturing and it worked really well when
it<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.000> wet<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:00.600> had<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.960> perfect<00:03:01.380> grip<00:03:01.590> wasn't

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it was wet I had a perfect grip wasn't

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.000 
it was wet I had a perfect grip wasn't
slipping<00:03:02.130> at<00:03:02.400> all<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:04.170> really<00:03:04.650> does<00:03:04.980> uh

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
slipping at all so that really does uh

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.910 
slipping at all so that really does uh
does<00:03:05.490> help<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.200> can<00:03:07.350> see<00:03:07.530> there<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.890> a

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
does help and you can see there is a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.100 
does help and you can see there is a
little<00:03:08.190> lane<00:03:08.700> hole<00:03:08.940> back<00:03:09.120> here<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.660> 550

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
little lane hole back here that the 550

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.820 
little lane hole back here that the 550
cord<00:03:10.260> fits<00:03:10.590> too<00:03:10.710> perfectly<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> problem<00:03:12.830> on

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
cord fits too perfectly not a problem on

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.400 
cord fits too perfectly not a problem on
the<00:03:14.580> back<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.660> pocket<00:03:16.320> clip<00:03:16.880> nice<00:03:17.880> black

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
the back is the pocket clip nice black

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.180 
the back is the pocket clip nice black
powder<00:03:19.410> clip<00:03:20.120> very<00:03:21.120> easily<00:03:21.600> get<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:22.170> off<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.860> I

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
powder clip very easily get on off the I

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.740 
powder clip very easily get on off the I
think<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.670> tension<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.150> perfect<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.600> this

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
think the tension is perfect on this

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.170 
think the tension is perfect on this
clip<00:03:24.960> it's<00:03:25.110> not<00:03:25.290> too<00:03:25.440> much<00:03:25.700> but<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.820> stays<00:03:27.000> in

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
clip it's not too much but it stays in

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.180 
clip it's not too much but it stays in
your<00:03:27.240> pocket<00:03:27.300> nice<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.960> secure<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:29.010> could

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
your pocket nice and secure you could

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.520 
your pocket nice and secure you could
swap<00:03:29.400> lists<00:03:29.850> off<00:03:30.060> inside<00:03:30.420> if<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.600> want<00:03:30.900> but

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
swap lists off inside if you want but

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.700 
swap lists off inside if you want but
this<00:03:31.710> is<00:03:31.860> only<00:03:32.070> tip<00:03:32.700> up<00:03:32.880> carry<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.810> can't<00:03:34.050> put

with<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> riveted<00:04:08.640> ones<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.400> little

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
with the riveted ones so just a little

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.560 
with the riveted ones so just a little
thought<00:04:11.780> there<00:04:14.180> when<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.240> open<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.450> knife

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
thought there when you open the knife

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.530 
thought there when you open the knife
comes<00:04:16.230> out<00:04:16.380> nice<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.530> fast<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.130> can<00:04:17.419> flick<00:04:18.419> it

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
comes out nice and fast you can flick it

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.800 
comes out nice and fast you can flick it
out<00:04:18.630> or<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.440> can<00:04:19.500> just<00:04:19.799> go<00:04:19.919> nice<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.130> slow<00:04:20.489> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
out or you can just go nice and slow and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.670 
out or you can just go nice and slow and
open<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:21.870> up<00:04:21.959> either<00:04:22.230> way

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
open it up either way

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.570 
open it up either way
it's<00:04:23.100> nice<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.580> smooth<00:04:23.820> opening<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:26.250> can<00:04:26.280> see

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
it's nice and smooth opening you can see

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.770 
it's nice and smooth opening you can see
here<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.120> got<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.480> 3/4<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:29.220> serrated<00:04:29.880> edge<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.600> a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
here I got a 3/4 a serrated edge and a

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.610 
here I got a 3/4 a serrated edge and a
little<00:04:31.169> plain<00:04:31.800> edge<00:04:31.980> tip<00:04:32.310> here<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.930> figured<00:04:33.930> if

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
little plain edge tip here I figured if

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.740 
little plain edge tip here I figured if
I'm<00:04:35.070> on<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.610> water<00:04:35.790> I'm<00:04:36.030> more<00:04:36.240> likely<00:04:36.570> need<00:04:36.720> to

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
I'm on the water I'm more likely need to

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.950 
I'm on the water I'm more likely need to
cut<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.260> know<00:04:37.350> rope<00:04:37.650> or<00:04:38.040> whatever<00:04:38.960> and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
cut you know rope or whatever and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.530 
cut you know rope or whatever and
serrations<00:04:40.680> you're<00:04:40.800> gonna<00:04:41.090> you<00:04:42.090> know<00:04:42.150> go
