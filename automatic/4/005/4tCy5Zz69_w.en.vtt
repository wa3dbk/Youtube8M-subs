just<00:00:31.109> clarity<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.489> understand<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.360> what

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
just clarity to understand kind of what

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.060 
just clarity to understand kind of what
we're<00:00:33.690> talking<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.559> makes<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
we're talking about and what makes it so

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.150 
we're talking about and what makes it so
good<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> name<00:00:36.780> implies<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.920> is

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
good so as the name implies it is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.639 
good so as the name implies it is
literally<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.059> oil<00:00:39.329> made<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> spores

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
literally the oil made from the spores

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.310 
literally the oil made from the spores
of<00:00:40.950> reishi<00:00:41.340> mushroom<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
of reishi mushroom so what is that and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.770 
of reishi mushroom so what is that and
what<00:00:43.410> does<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.590> mean<00:00:44.010> well<00:00:44.910> basically<00:00:45.270> what

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
what does that mean well basically what

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.500 
what does that mean well basically what
happens<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.530> when<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.219> reishi<00:00:47.430> mushroom<00:00:48.239> or

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
happens is when the reishi mushroom or

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.709 
happens is when the reishi mushroom or
the<00:00:48.660> fruiting<00:00:49.140> body<00:00:49.820> reaches<00:00:50.820> maturity<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the fruiting body reaches maturity it

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.560 
the fruiting body reaches maturity it
then<00:00:52.020> releases<00:00:52.559> its<00:00:52.800> spores<00:00:53.360> which<00:00:54.360> usually

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
then releases its spores which usually

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.229 
then releases its spores which usually
form<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.860> brownish<00:00:56.160> golden<00:00:56.850> dust

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
form as kind of a brownish golden dust

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
form as kind of a brownish golden dust
on<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> mushroom<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
on top of the mushroom and then is

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
on top of the mushroom and then is
released<00:00:59.280> into<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> atmosphere<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
released into the atmosphere and in the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.889 
released into the atmosphere and in the
environment<00:01:01.800> around<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:03.090> mushroom<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
environment around the mushroom so it

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.530 
environment around the mushroom so it
can<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.199> reproduce<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.549> effectively<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.390> is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
can then reproduce so effectively it is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.230 
can then reproduce so effectively it is
the<00:01:06.780> reproductive<00:01:07.530> essence<00:01:08.070> or<00:01:08.220> seed<00:01:08.790> or

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the reproductive essence or seed or

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.240 
the reproductive essence or seed or
sperm<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.799> reishi<00:01:10.979> mushroom<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:12.090> such<00:01:12.900> is

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
sperm of the reishi mushroom as such is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.090 
sperm of the reishi mushroom as such is
extremely<00:01:14.250> concentrated<00:01:14.750> with<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
extremely concentrated with all of the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.740 
extremely concentrated with all of the
genetic<00:01:17.430> information<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:18.180> reishi<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
genetic information of reishi to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
genetic information of reishi to
basically<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.619> reproduce<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
basically go out and reproduce the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030 
basically go out and reproduce the
organism<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.479> from<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.290> chemical<00:01:22.680> standpoint

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
organism and from a chemical standpoint

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.390

where<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:49.770> got<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> stuff<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.610> an

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
where they got the stuff what an

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.330 
where they got the stuff what an
analysis<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:52.079> effectively<00:01:52.530> three<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.130> four

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

chemicals<00:01:55.590> which<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.430> pretty<00:01:56.700> amazing<00:01:57.149> stuff

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
chemicals which is pretty amazing stuff

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.679 
chemicals which is pretty amazing stuff
and<00:01:58.219> really<00:01:59.219> when<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.700> look<00:01:59.969> at<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.270> forest

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and really when we look at this forest

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.719 
and really when we look at this forest
we<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.229> when<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.860> start<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
we can see when we start to get to the

we can see when we start to get to the
Spore<00:02:03.140> we<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.920> high<00:02:05.159> levels<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.880> the

Spore we get really high levels of the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.440 
Spore we get really high levels of the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
essential oils that the mushroom has so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.270 
essential oils that the mushroom has so
since<00:02:12.599> we<00:02:12.780> take<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.349> spores<00:02:13.739> or<00:02:14.099> the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
since we take the spores or the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.880 
since we take the spores or the
reproductive<00:02:14.519> essence<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.440> mushroom

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
reproductive essence of the mushroom

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.160 
reproductive essence of the mushroom
really<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:18.000> their<00:02:18.180> raw<00:02:18.420> state<00:02:18.810> they're<00:02:19.019> not

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
really in their raw state they're not

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.559 
really in their raw state they're not
that<00:02:19.410> ideal<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.519> consumption<00:02:21.090> because<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
that ideal for consumption because the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.400 
that ideal for consumption because the
cell<00:02:21.810> wall<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.790> pretty<00:02:23.790> hard<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.540> not

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
cell wall is pretty hard and not

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.170 
cell wall is pretty hard and not
something<00:02:25.620> our<00:02:25.830> body<00:02:26.010> can<00:02:26.190> really<00:02:26.340> crack<00:02:26.760> open

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
something our body can really crack open

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.970 
something our body can really crack open
and<00:02:27.300> break<00:02:27.480> down<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.380> digestive<00:02:28.410> system

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
and break down in the digestive system

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.850 
and break down in the digestive system
so<00:02:29.910> then<00:02:30.090> basically<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.989> cell<00:02:31.290> wall<00:02:31.560> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
so then basically the cell wall is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.309 
so then basically the cell wall is
cracked<00:02:32.849> open<00:02:33.299> through<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.569> special<00:02:33.959> process

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
cracked open through a special process

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.830 
cracked open through a special process
that<00:02:35.280> doesn't<00:02:35.549> use<00:02:35.640> any<00:02:35.879> heat<00:02:36.120> or<00:02:36.330> chemicals

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
that doesn't use any heat or chemicals

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.059 
that doesn't use any heat or chemicals
or<00:02:36.989> solvents<00:02:37.410> or<00:02:37.530> anything<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:38.010> that

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
or solvents or anything like that

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.240 
or solvents or anything like that
basically<00:02:38.910> uses<00:02:39.480> pressure<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:40.920> from

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
basically uses pressure and then from

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.660 
basically uses pressure and then from
there<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.610> cracked<00:02:42.000> cell<00:02:42.330> spores<00:02:43.049> are<00:02:43.380> then

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
there the cracked cell spores are then

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.729 
there the cracked cell spores are then
processed<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:44.940> supercritical<00:02:45.739> extraction

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
processed with supercritical extraction

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.069 
processed with supercritical extraction
which<00:02:47.190> again<00:02:47.459> doesn't<00:02:47.730> use<00:02:47.940> any<00:02:48.150> heat<00:02:48.420> no

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
which again doesn't use any heat no

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.110 
which again doesn't use any heat no
chemicals<00:02:49.709> there's<00:02:49.920> no<00:02:50.040> oxidation<00:02:50.519> no

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
chemicals there's no oxidation no

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.630 
chemicals there's no oxidation no
solvents<00:02:51.840> or<00:02:51.959> anything<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.470> used<00:02:52.920> it's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
solvents or anything like that used it's

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.539 
solvents or anything like that used it's
basically<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.030> process<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:55.170> done<00:02:56.130> cold

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
basically a process that is done cold

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.400 
basically a process that is done cold
and<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:56.970> able<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.390> preserve<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.959> full<00:02:58.170> matrix

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
and is able to preserve the full matrix

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.339 
and is able to preserve the full matrix
of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.670> nutritional<00:03:00.150> profile<00:03:00.599> because<00:03:01.260> when

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
of the nutritional profile because when

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.130 
of the nutritional profile because when
we're<00:03:01.500> talking<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:01.950> oils<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:03.599> usually<00:03:03.930> want

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
we're talking about oils we usually want

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.199 
we're talking about oils we usually want
to<00:03:04.200> avoid<00:03:04.590> heat<00:03:05.069> if<00:03:05.310> possible<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.120> we

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
to avoid heat if possible because we

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.839 
to avoid heat if possible because we
don't<00:03:06.360> want<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.540> oxidize<00:03:07.140> or<00:03:07.500> denature<00:03:08.340> those

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
don't want to oxidize or denature those

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.509 
don't want to oxidize or denature those
oils<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:10.440> especially<00:03:10.739> when<00:03:11.100> there<00:03:11.280> are<00:03:11.370> very

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
oils and especially when there are very

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.270 
oils and especially when there are very
sensitive<00:03:12.000> oils<00:03:12.389> or<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.500> unsaturated

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
sensitive oils or you know unsaturated

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.250 
sensitive oils or you know unsaturated
oils<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:14.940> are<00:03:15.120> found<00:03:15.359> in<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.690> sport<00:03:15.959> oils

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
oils like are found in the sport oils

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.199 
oils like are found in the sport oils
and<00:03:16.650> all<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.220> different<00:03:17.370> tried<00:03:17.639> terpenes<00:03:18.090> and

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
and all the different tried terpenes and

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.699 
and all the different tried terpenes and
gain<00:03:18.329> of<00:03:18.420> dark<00:03:18.630> acids<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.139> are<00:03:19.230> found<00:03:19.290> in

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
gain of dark acids that are found in

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.370 
gain of dark acids that are found in
that<00:03:19.829> whole<00:03:20.069> matrix<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:21.540> then<00:03:21.690> at<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.049> point

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
that whole matrix so then at that point

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.729 
that whole matrix so then at that point
it<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.549> then<00:03:23.730> immediately<00:03:24.540> encapsulated<00:03:25.500> so

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
it is then immediately encapsulated so

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.710 
it is then immediately encapsulated so
that<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.250> preserved<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.910> not<00:03:27.120> prone<00:03:27.510> to

harvest<00:04:06.000> all<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.810> obvious<00:04:07.079> variables<00:04:08.090> you

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
harvest all the obvious variables you

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
can get one kilo for oil so it's

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.309 
can get one kilo for oil so it's
basically<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.340> thousand<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.180> one<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.780> then<00:04:13.169> a

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889

almost<00:04:33.349> 40%<00:04:34.060> tried<00:04:35.060> terpenes<00:04:35.509> so<00:04:36.169> that<00:04:36.289> means

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
almost 40% tried terpenes so that means

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.409 
almost 40% tried terpenes so that means

if you take a 500 milligram capsule
you're<00:04:39.050> getting<00:04:39.349> almost<00:04:40.270> 150<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.360> 200

I've<00:04:42.919> tried<00:04:43.190> terpenes<00:04:43.669> per<00:04:44.240> capsule<00:04:44.620> which<00:04:45.620> is

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
I've tried terpenes per capsule which is

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.710 
I've tried terpenes per capsule which is
pretty<00:04:45.979> amazing<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.699> pretty<00:04:46.910> strong<00:04:47.330> stuff

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
pretty amazing and pretty strong stuff

pretty amazing and pretty strong stuff
and<00:04:48.650> for<00:04:49.340> me<00:04:49.490> what<00:04:49.639> I<00:04:49.669> usually<00:04:50.000> like<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.389> is

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
and for me what I usually like to do is

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.020 
and for me what I usually like to do is
just<00:04:50.720> take<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.110> capsules<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:51.800> pop<00:04:52.490> one<00:04:52.729> open

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
just take the capsules and pop one open

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.730 
just take the capsules and pop one open
and<00:04:53.060> suck<00:04:53.419> out<00:04:53.599> the<00:04:53.750> liquid<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.229> spit<00:04:54.530> out<00:04:54.590> the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
and suck out the liquid and spit out the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.620 
and suck out the liquid and spit out the
capsule<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.520> it's<00:04:55.880> sort<00:04:56.030> of<00:04:56.090> just<00:04:56.150> swish<00:04:56.449> the

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
capsule and it's sort of just swish the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.999 
capsule and it's sort of just swish the
oil<00:04:56.780> around<00:04:57.020> my<00:04:57.169> mouth<00:04:57.289> and<00:04:57.560> sort<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.830> get

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
oil around my mouth and sort of get

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.969 
oil around my mouth and sort of get
quicker<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:58.970> faster<00:04:59.030> uptake<00:04:59.780> now<00:05:00.470> personally

I like the flavor most the people that

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.089 
I like the flavor most the people that
take<00:05:04.460> herbs<00:05:04.930> enjoy<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.110> flavor<00:05:06.349> there's

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099

always the people who don't like the

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.529 
always the people who don't like the
flavor<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.280> just<00:05:10.430> want<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.729> you<00:05:11.240> know<00:05:11.270> take

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
take a capsule and that's fine also

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.430 
take a capsule and that's fine also
really<00:05:14.240> both<00:05:14.419> are<00:05:14.660> great<00:05:14.870> both<00:05:15.110> are<00:05:15.259> great

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
really both are great both are great

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.650 
really both are great both are great
options<00:05:15.620> it's<00:05:15.979> really<00:05:16.190> just<00:05:16.370> a<00:05:16.610> matter<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.330> a

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
options it's really just a matter of a

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.930 
options it's really just a matter of a
personal<00:05:18.110> preference<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:19.550> hopefully<00:05:19.849> that

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
personal preference so hopefully that

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.399 
personal preference so hopefully that
gives<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.240> good<00:05:20.330> idea<00:05:20.599> for<00:05:20.840> what's<00:05:21.169> port

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
gives you a good idea for what's port

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.710 
gives you a good idea for what's port
oil<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.830> how<00:05:22.490> it's<00:05:22.729> made<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:23.120> why<00:05:23.330> it's<00:05:23.509> so

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
oil is how it's made and why it's so

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.960
