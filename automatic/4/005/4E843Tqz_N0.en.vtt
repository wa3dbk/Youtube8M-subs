different it's clear that the big
difference<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.570> how<00:01:06.570> much<00:01:06.810> further

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
difference here is how much further

relative to the bottom bracket compared

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
relative to the bottom bracket compared
with<00:01:14.340> old<00:01:14.520> position<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.810> rotating

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
with old position so this is rotating

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.300 
with old position so this is rotating
his<00:01:16.770> his<00:01:17.580> torso<00:01:18.439> forward<00:01:19.759> it's<00:01:20.759> rotating<00:01:21.450> his

his his torso forward it's rotating his
his<00:01:23.310> head<00:01:23.640> down<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.990> he

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
his head down so we can see that as he

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.749 
his head down so we can see that as he
pivots<00:01:28.409> over<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> bottom<00:01:29.220> bracket<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
position relative to his back see that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.310 
position relative to his back see that
the<00:01:46.729> that<00:01:47.729> he<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.240> doesn't<00:01:49.020> look<00:01:49.079> like

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the that he really doesn't look like

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.460 
the that he really doesn't look like
he's<00:01:49.970> increased<00:01:50.970> his<00:01:51.119> drop<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> whole<00:01:51.930> much<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
he's increased his drop a whole much a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.190 
he's increased his drop a whole much a
whole<00:01:53.030> lot<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.270> than<00:01:54.329> where<00:01:54.780> he<00:01:54.810> had<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
whole lot more than where he had it in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.090 
whole lot more than where he had it in
that<00:01:55.380> previous<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> 2008<00:01:57.270> picture<00:01:58.009> if<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that previous in the 2008 picture if you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.950 
that previous in the 2008 picture if you
can<00:01:59.159> look<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.610> look<00:01:59.969> at<00:02:00.090> these<00:02:00.240> lines<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.810> he

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
can look at look at these lines here he

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.780 
can look at look at these lines here he
may<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.170> down<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> centimeter<00:02:02.130> or<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.689> but<00:02:04.790> you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
may be down a centimeter or so but you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.180 
may be down a centimeter or so but you
see<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.119> he's<00:02:06.210> now<00:02:06.390> better<00:02:06.630> shoulders<00:02:07.190> more

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
see that he's now better shoulders more

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.040 
see that he's now better shoulders more
on<00:02:08.340> top<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.729> his<00:02:08.849> elbows<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> nearly

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
on top of his elbows with the nearly

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.490 
on top of his elbows with the nearly
vertical

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
vertical

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.180 
vertical
arms<00:02:15.960> I've<00:02:16.960> seen<00:02:17.230> even<00:02:17.470> more<00:02:17.500> dramatic

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
arms I've seen even more dramatic

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.190 
arms I've seen even more dramatic
difference<00:02:18.520> if<00:02:18.640> we<00:02:18.730> look<00:02:18.940> at<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.720> position<00:02:19.870> he

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
difference if we look at the position he

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.860 
difference if we look at the position he
was<00:02:20.320> riding<00:02:20.560> at<00:02:20.860> around<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.000> time<00:02:22.060> last<00:02:22.660> year

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
was riding at around this time last year

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.860 
was riding at around this time last year
I<00:02:23.410> think<00:02:24.130> he<00:02:24.250> went<00:02:24.400> underwent<00:02:25.180> some<00:02:25.360> changes

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
I think he went underwent some changes

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.160 
I think he went underwent some changes
during<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.200> course<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.830> year<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:28.209> this

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
during the course of the year but this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.990 
during the course of the year but this
position<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:29.890> where<00:02:30.040> he<00:02:30.430> was<00:02:30.550> experimenting

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
position is where he was experimenting

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.510 
position is where he was experimenting
with<00:02:31.300> relatively<00:02:32.020> small<00:02:32.709> amount<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.280> drop

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
with relatively small amount of drop

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.330

has pulled himself forward on the saddle
a<00:02:41.680> bit<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.130> he's<00:02:42.970> pulled<00:02:43.450> himself<00:02:43.600> up<00:02:43.989> to

a bit so he's pulled himself up to

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
this position here we can see the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.240 
this position here we can see the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
rotating his body forward which allows

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.539 
rotating his body forward which allows
him<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:21.420> flatten<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.540> torso<00:03:23.400> compared<00:03:24.400> to

in<00:03:40.780> comparison<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:43.450> see<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.810> change<00:03:44.230> in

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
in comparison you can see the change in

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
certainly what one of the things that

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.199 
certainly what one of the things that

allowed him to obtain this position is

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.870 
allowed him to obtain this position is
the<00:04:19.209> Adamo<00:04:19.810> saddle<00:04:20.410> which<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.739> can<00:04:20.919> see<00:04:21.190> in

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
the Adamo saddle which we can see in

this picture
Damo<00:04:24.070> road<00:04:24.460> version<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.740> blog<00:04:27.010> will<00:04:27.250> go<00:04:27.400> a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
Damo road version and the blog will go a

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.900 
Damo road version and the blog will go a
little<00:04:27.669> further<00:04:27.910> into<00:04:28.650> into<00:04:29.650> why<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.340> is<00:04:30.520> but

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
little further into into why that is but

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.990 
little further into into why that is but
essentially<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:32.470> Adamo<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.669> missing

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
essentially the Adamo is missing

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.850 
essentially the Adamo is missing
approximately<00:04:34.630> five<00:04:34.930> centimeters<00:04:35.229> of<00:04:35.680> nose

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
approximately five centimeters of nose

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.360 
approximately five centimeters of nose
and<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:37.479> we're<00:04:38.169> subject<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.860> UCI<00:04:39.280> rules

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
and so we're subject to the UCI rules

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.550 
and so we're subject to the UCI rules
where<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.240> nose<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.870> saddle<00:04:41.229> must<00:04:41.380> be<00:04:41.500> at

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
where the nose of the saddle must be at

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.200 
where the nose of the saddle must be at
least<00:04:41.740> five<00:04:42.010> senators<00:04:42.460> behind<00:04:42.789> a<00:04:42.910> bottom

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
least five senators behind a bottom

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.529 
least five senators behind a bottom
bracket<00:04:43.680> using<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.800> damo<00:04:45.250> allows<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.210> rider<00:04:46.360> to

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
bracket using a damo allows the rider to

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.140 
bracket using a damo allows the rider to
essentially<00:04:47.050> recreate<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.160> position<00:04:48.789> of

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
essentially recreate the position of

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.469 
essentially recreate the position of
having<00:04:49.449> a<00:04:49.690> normal<00:04:49.900> saddle<00:04:50.560> with<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.860> nose

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
having a normal saddle with the nose

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.080 
having a normal saddle with the nose
directly<00:04:52.479> over<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.169> bottom<00:04:53.470> bracket<00:04:54.090> so

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
directly over the bottom bracket so

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.790 
directly over the bottom bracket so
therefore<00:04:55.510> they<00:04:55.600> can<00:04:55.750> achieve<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:56.410> forward

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
therefore they can achieve this forward

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.820 
therefore they can achieve this forward
position<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:58.139> typically<00:04:59.139> a<00:04:59.229> lower<00:04:59.500> position

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
position and typically a lower position

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.290 
position and typically a lower position
in<00:05:00.190> front<00:05:01.440> because<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.820> more<00:05:03.820> open<00:05:04.150> hip

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
in front because of the more open hip

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.320
