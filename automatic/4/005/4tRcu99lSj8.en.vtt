00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:14.059
 amazon lets try to hide -15 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:17.420
 and cabin day that comes tomorrow to live 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.840
 a girl for a knife advances 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:27.850
 time I'm advancing tells me that 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.850
 try to change my high camera 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.280
 it took time to take it 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.190
 hello all youtube 2 friends and fans of 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.350
 Adventure time as you will see this is my 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.089
 first video loquendo and I will talk about the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.100
 most moving episode of the fifth 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.710
 season that we were all waiting for 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.380
 and it is the simon in ivory as you will see 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.980
 this episode was leaked from the 21 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.100
 March 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.430
 2013 but at the official premiere in the USA 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.350
 was on March 25 of the same year only 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.480
 that there was a half hour special 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.950
 along with the air episode member 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.380
 view good let's start at the beginning of 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.600
 chapter are related to the king jake 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.960
 ice cream and marcelino playing basketball 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.670
 and apparently marceline is very good 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.770
 after the last play the king 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.320
 ice cream goes for some refreshing drinks 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.530
 and in that order and jake they ask 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.370
 marcelino because he invited the ice king 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.370
 then I quote textually 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.700
 and it should go better 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.429
 apparently if marcelino and the ice king 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.040
 they had known each other since the war of 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.740
 mushrooms and they were living together 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.660
 for a long time let's suppose that the 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.820
 war was a thousand years ago and in the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.070
 program says that the memory that counts 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.380
 marcelino was nine hundred ninety and 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.330
 six years for what we do accounts 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.370
 marcelino and the frozen king lived 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.670
 approximately three to five years 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.980
 together after marceline tells one of 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.470
 the many adventures he lived with 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.480
 Simon at the beginning of the story 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.700
 Simon and Martin are roaming the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.520
 remains of the world that was affected by the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.890
 mushroom war apparently 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.920
 they are exploring and find a ribbon 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.590
 vhs this reminds me of the holy chapter 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.990
 holy secret's where they find 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.420
 the secret videos of the journey 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.850
 then simon and ivory in that it approaches 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.190
 something mysterious and it's just a deer that 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.890
 has a great resemblance to the episode nobody 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.140
 he listens to you then simon tries 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.420
 defend Marc and he puts on his crown and 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.510
 he says he's not going to scare a man anymore 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.270
 47 years old and a little girl of 7 who 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.460
 it seems it's your age at that moment 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.440
 it is also seen that every time Simon is 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.470
 puts the crown his transformation is 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.800
 accelerates and loses the sanity since martí 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.800
 He says 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 Y 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.250
 apparently Simon never knew how to handle 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.010
 a motorcycle since it ends 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.840
 destroying them when they go to the 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.629
 city for chicken soup 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.819
 simon lyrics to a song to martín and 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.980
 apparently he likes it a lot because it tells him 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.049
 that his songs are very good 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.450
 maybe Simon had already written several 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.310
 songs like the courtesy song 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.739
 that sings at the end and the air 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.900
 member since we all know so 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.120
 Simon has great musical talent and 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.060
 this seems to arouse the interest of 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.579
 marcelino for the music apparently the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.590
 zombies are really people or 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.200
 animals that were exposed 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.180
 too much time to a very radiation 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.880
 high caused by nuclear bombs 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.729
 and that are mutating to transform 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.160
 in the creatures of the world debut at 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.680
 Looks like Simon does not realize he is 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.430
 immortal since he says to martín 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.430
 what i am 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.350
 Apparently Simon and Martin are 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.020
 in the state of usa 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.780
 since the ambulance has the plates 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.060
 of the state of good what may be a 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.940
 fictional town as I had never heard 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.550
 a word like that the mutants do 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.850
 reference to the North American series of 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.010
 val quin dea is also seen that simon al 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.380
 put on the crown for the last time 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.030
 it has a greater similarity to the filling 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.160
 time he missed two more 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.140
 transformations to make him king 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.240
 ice cream but maybe they take it out in another 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.040
 chapter where you see how they separate 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.860
 simon and marceline and the last 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.320
 transformation of the ice king when 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.330
 Simon finds the chicken soup looks 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.220
 a face in the gum maybe 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.380
 be a distant relative of sweet 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.650
 princess and in that place the 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.870
 Sweet kingdom when they hug Simon 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.730
 says to Martin Luther perhaps for the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.130
 effects of the crown and if it is related 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.440
 since in the newspaper of Marcelino del 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.270
 chapter the closet of Marcelino is seen in 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.610
 the cover of the newspaper says winter 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.440
 apparently the frozen king still does not 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.420
 remember nothing since at the end of 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.520
 story tells marcelino that the 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.520
 distract to write down more baskets 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.580
 the truth I had made several theories 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.979
 about this chapter and I was going to do a 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.139
 video but they beat me since they had 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.689
 leaked the episode so I'll put 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.199
 some but taking into account that only 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:07.750
 are simple theories I thought that in 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.969
 this chapter was going to look like simon and 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.889
 martín and they will see how the last one fell 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.259
 bomb the biggest and most destructive of 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.659
 all so maybe it has relationship 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.030
 with the human end chapter where the 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.430
 alternate simon risks his life for 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.819
 stop the bomb but instead that 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.949
 pass 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.810
 martinez has a simon since if 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.259
 I risked stopping the bomb 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.389
 would be alone because simon would die another 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.729
 chapter theory is that you thought 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.889
 see the birth of the bug from 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.169
 the last bomb so Simon is 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.000
 I would risk fighting this theory with him 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.310
 is somewhat heroic since it has 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.590
 relationship with the jake chapter of 2 where 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.990
 alternate jake becomes the new 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.330
 beach and fight with the alternate end that in 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.490
 that moment is in the process of 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.000
 become the new ice king by 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.000
 what he fights 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.500
 another theory as I said before 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.840
 we thought that in this chapter you would see 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.850
 the last transformation of simon and 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.680
 you would also see how they would separate 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.930
 Simon and Mars 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.360
 Take it into account are simple theories 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.550
 but still one that would be 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.979
 the one of the last transformation of simon 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.630
 and how they separated but maybe this is 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:21.880
 premiere in another chapter where 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.949
 marcheline tell another story or like 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.289
 a simple flashback 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.449
 well this is all to something else too 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:30.729
 this was the last episode in which 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:33.280
 work cardigan play those who do not know 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.050
 who is she good cardigan sugar worked 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.150
 in the adventure wave storyboard 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.850
 besides composing almost all 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.919
 songs left now from adventure to 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.979
 from this episode to work in 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:47.680
 your personal project now I say goodbye 

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:50.440
 If you liked this video subscribe and give 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.570
 of like do not forget to comment and share 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.270
 so that more people see it and so 

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.190
 I will have more desire to make more videos not 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.650
 only of adventure time also of 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.910
 other cartoons video games and some 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:05.670
 tutorials 

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.670
 well this is all greetings
