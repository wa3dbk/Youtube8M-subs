00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.340
 we do not know it's not my pharma to say 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.629
 so forced me I just prefer 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.190
 work be a little more textbook then 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.140
 In addition, we learn straightforwardly faster 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.120
 in which not know much so 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.280
 the bike level so everything is 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.510
 technique and it's thanks to the alternation 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.760
 basically I was able to learn a lot of 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.010
 things is very very fast before you 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.440
 go back to school 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.670
 so the cnpc 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.680
 well I already knew a lot of things 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.399
 so it's really a big advantage 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.399
 for me I think 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.650
 I'm really passionate about 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.930
 bike is my really my biggest 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.570
 passion it's been almost 5 6 years 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.460
 I practice cycling I love everything 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.040
 is strong so that it goes from the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.810
 downhill at bmx even the cross country or 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.790
 the java route is really something 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.470
 something that is important to me 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.940
 so necessarily to be able to do my 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 job is just a dream so 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.650
 inevitably I prefer and continue 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.650
 thereupon 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.370
 I'm just cnpc because 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.680
 basically it's really the only school 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.630
 who proposed this format there we leave in 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.910
 alternation simply because in 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.040
 big otherwise it may have passed to another 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.030
 thing finally to be technicians as well 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.130
 that I could have gone from 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.460
 diplomas but it's still difficult to 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.410
 find 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.540
 to stop expensive is a lot 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.250
 more and more we are working every 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.050
 speakers who came with us 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.370
 they know their business 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.930
 hold shops or 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.520
 things like that so they know 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.990
 really the bike world no longer have 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 to really teach us everything he 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.320
 needed to know 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.430
 the different periods when we do 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.220
 so is to the company so I was 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.600
 haunted the regional and padua on 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.760
 so was to pau so the cnpc to do 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.319
 our courses and keita to learn so 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.080
 basically we made periods of one 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.360
 month two months it depends on the times 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.430
 pass left and maybe me so 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.120
 in our region within 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.700
 the company after a month within 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.700
 poles simply more is 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.010
 that suddenly the cnpc and decathlon us 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.319
 provide housing so cottages 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.940
 or for a little tail we will say that 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.940
 it's not bad we do not complain 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.180
 more of that is that I could 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.380
 discover a bit south 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.180
 meet new people and 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.780
 to meet people 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.780
 really a thing at sight
