that<00:02:40.020> Twilight<00:02:40.260> goes<00:02:40.650> through<00:02:41.010> everything

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
that Twilight goes through everything

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.670 
that Twilight goes through everything
she<00:02:41.790> would<00:02:41.910> try<00:02:42.090> something<00:02:42.390> fail<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.320> walk

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
she would try something fail and walk

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.920 
she would try something fail and walk

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.720 
away if she truly wants to help wrap up
winter<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:46.530> she<00:02:46.680> shouldn't<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.250> give<00:02:47.520> up

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
winter then she shouldn't just give up

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
when she wakes up the animals I think

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.190 
when she wakes up the animals I think
she<00:02:53.160> did<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> great<00:02:53.640> job<00:02:53.670> for<00:02:54.570> different<00:02:54.989> types

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
she did a great job for different types

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.860 
she did a great job for different types

of animals woken up in about 31 seconds
I'd<00:02:58.050> say<00:02:58.440> that's<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.770> new<00:02:58.890> record<00:02:59.070> looking<00:02:59.580> at

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
I'd say that's a new record looking at

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.890 
I'd say that's a new record looking at
