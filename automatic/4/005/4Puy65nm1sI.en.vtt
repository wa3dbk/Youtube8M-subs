00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.660 
just absorbing the struggle I'm letting
that<00:02:15.090> be<00:02:15.269> part<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.630> journey<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.489> have<00:02:17.489> to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
that be part of the journey you have to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.830 
that be part of the journey you have to
go<00:02:18.060> with<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.330> flow<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:20.540> we've<00:02:21.540> replaced

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
go with the flow and we've replaced

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.800 
go with the flow and we've replaced
about<00:02:22.110> five<00:02:22.500> guides<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> last<00:02:23.640> week<00:02:24.000> so

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
about five guides in the last week so

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.620 
about five guides in the last week so
that's<00:02:24.989> been<00:02:25.230> interesting<00:02:25.500> too<00:02:28.549> but<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.880> think

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
that's been interesting too but I think

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.589 
that's been interesting too but I think
at<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.739> end<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> day<00:02:32.510> everything<00:02:33.510> will

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
at the end of the day everything will

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:41.199 
at the end of the day everything will
just<00:02:33.750> work<00:02:33.870> itself<00:02:34.290> out<00:02:36.980> that's<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.130> plan

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.240
