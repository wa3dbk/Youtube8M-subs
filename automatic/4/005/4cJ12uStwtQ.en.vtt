episode<00:00:02.399> number<00:00:02.550> 83<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:03.959> week<00:00:04.200> I'm<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.529> to

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
episode number 83 this week I'm going to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.829 
episode number 83 this week I'm going to
be<00:00:04.680> talking<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.160> how<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.690> can<00:00:06.690> improve

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
be talking about how you can improve

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.900 
be talking about how you can improve
your<00:00:07.109> light<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:07.980> laser<00:00:08.099> sensor<00:00:08.670> for<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
your light and laser sensor for the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.600 
your light and laser sensor for the
camera<00:00:09.269> acts<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> use<00:00:10.800> your<00:00:10.889> typical<00:00:11.280> light

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
camera acts so use your typical light

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.049 
camera acts so use your typical light
sensor<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.269> your<00:00:12.389> typical<00:00:12.660> laser<00:00:13.019> sensor<00:00:13.620> and

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
sensor and your typical laser sensor and

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.450 
sensor and your typical laser sensor and
you<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.179> these<00:00:15.900> are<00:00:15.960> really<00:00:16.590> great<00:00:16.859> sensors

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
you know these are really great sensors

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.630 
you know these are really great sensors
and<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:19.380> lot<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.560> people<00:00:19.830> use<00:00:20.430> them

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and a lot of people use them

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.099 
and a lot of people use them
successfully<00:00:21.359> including<00:00:21.810> myself<00:00:22.010> but<00:00:24.109> sorta

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
successfully including myself but sorta

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.810 
successfully including myself but sorta
there's<00:00:25.470> there's<00:00:25.740> three<00:00:26.070> issues<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.699> I've

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
there's there's three issues that I've

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.089 
there's there's three issues that I've
noticed<00:00:27.029> when<00:00:27.590> configuring<00:00:28.590> these<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
noticed when configuring these as a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.769 
noticed when configuring these as a
laser<00:00:29.429> trigger<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.000> basically<00:00:30.330> when<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> say

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
laser trigger and basically when I say

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.400 
laser trigger and basically when I say
laser<00:00:31.080> trigger<00:00:31.410> what<00:00:31.619> I'm<00:00:31.710> talking<00:00:32.040> about<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
laser trigger what I'm talking about is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.860 
laser trigger what I'm talking about is
the<00:00:34.410> laser<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.370> shining<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> light<00:00:36.390> sensor

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the laser is shining on the light sensor

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.490 
the laser is shining on the light sensor
and<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> light<00:00:39.180> sensor<00:00:39.570> detects<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.140> bright

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and so the light sensor detects a bright

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
and so the light sensor detects a bright
light<00:00:40.710> constantly<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:42.030> something

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
light constantly and then when something

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
light constantly and then when something
moves<00:00:42.629> between<00:00:42.899> them<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.219> look<00:00:44.640> bright

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
moves between them that look bright

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
moves between them that look bright
light<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.420> blocked<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.500> use<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
light is blocked and you can use that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.299 
light is blocked and you can use that
drop<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.090> light<00:00:48.329> levels<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> camera

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
drop in the light levels on the camera

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.510 
drop in the light levels on the camera
acts<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.789> take<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> photograph<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
acts to take a photograph and a lot of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.010 
acts to take a photograph and a lot of
times<00:00:53.730> people<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.149> doing<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> work

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
times people are doing that kind of work

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.660 
times people are doing that kind of work
outside<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.780> typically<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.980> enclose

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
outside so you typically want to enclose

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.639 
outside so you typically want to enclose
these<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.449> something<00:01:01.050> that's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.320> little<00:01:01.469> more

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
these in something that's a little more

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.990 
these in something that's a little more
water<00:01:02.219> resistant<00:01:03.000> or<00:01:03.270> weather<00:01:03.600> resistant<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
water resistant or weather resistant and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
water resistant or weather resistant and
you<00:01:06.000> also<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:06.930> find<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.610> getting

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you also will find that you know getting

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.310 
you also will find that you know getting
these<00:01:10.939> sensors<00:01:11.939> exactly<00:01:12.630> aligned<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
these sensors exactly aligned so the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
these sensors exactly aligned so the
light<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.369> laser<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> shining<00:01:15.240> directly<00:01:15.390> on

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
light the laser is shining directly on

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.800 
light the laser is shining directly on
this<00:01:15.930> light<00:01:16.490> sensor<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> little

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
this light sensor can be a little

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.550 
this light sensor can be a little
difficult<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.369> sort<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.820> lastly<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
difficult and sort of lastly you have to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.929 
difficult and sort of lastly you have to
come<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.220> kind<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.490> clamping

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
come up with some kind of clamping

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.390 
come up with some kind of clamping
mechanism<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.570> hold<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.140> things<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.950> place

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
mechanism to hold these things in place

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
mechanism to hold these things in place
so<00:01:29.060> we're<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> talk<00:01:30.570> about<00:01:30.780> some<00:01:31.259> ways

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
so we're going to talk about some ways

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.690 
so we're going to talk about some ways
to<00:01:31.860> improve<00:01:32.189> these<00:01:32.460> things<00:01:32.820> yourself<00:01:34.159> using<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
to improve these things yourself using a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.030 
to improve these things yourself using a
few<00:01:36.180> dollars<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.720> parts<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.619> hardware

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
few dollars in parts from the hardware

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.609 
few dollars in parts from the hardware
store<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> first<00:01:39.689> off<00:01:39.869> I'll<00:01:40.049> talk<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
store so first off I'll talk about the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.280 
store so first off I'll talk about the
parts<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.009> I'm<00:01:41.159> using<00:01:41.369> today<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.899> just

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
parts that I'm using today this is just

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.940 
parts that I'm using today this is just
one<00:01:43.680> inch<00:01:43.890> PVC<00:01:44.220> piping<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.439> I've<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.619> an<00:01:46.770> end

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
one inch PVC piping and I've got an end

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.240 
one inch PVC piping and I've got an end
cap<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.840> for<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:48.960> inch<00:01:49.110> PVC<00:01:49.350> pipe<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.100> with

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
cap here for one inch PVC pipe in with

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.109 
cap here for one inch PVC pipe in with
the<00:01:50.399> hole<00:01:51.149> drilled<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.159> these<00:01:53.159> pieces<00:01:53.670> here

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the hole drilled in it these pieces here

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.580 
the hole drilled in it these pieces here
just<00:01:54.450> cut<00:01:55.409> off<00:01:55.619> 1-inch<00:01:56.399> pieces<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.509> PVC<00:01:57.750> piping

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
just cut off 1-inch pieces of PVC piping

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.209 
just cut off 1-inch pieces of PVC piping
and<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.079> inch<00:02:01.290> PVC<00:02:01.560> piping

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
and this is a one inch PVC piping

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.179 
and this is a one inch PVC piping
coupler<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.869> reason<00:02:04.170> there's<00:02:04.350> black<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.950> here

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
coupler the reason there's black in here

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.449 
coupler the reason there's black in here
is<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.880> wanted<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> reduce<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
is because I wanted to reduce the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.410 
is because I wanted to reduce the
reflectivity<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.970> inside<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:11.420> these

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
reflectivity of the inside of these

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
reflectivity of the inside of these
pipes<00:02:12.870> when

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
pipes when

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.650 
pipes when
I'm<00:02:13.770> using<00:02:14.160> them<00:02:14.460> with<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.880> light<00:02:15.150> sensor

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
I'm using them with the light sensor

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.040 
I'm using them with the light sensor
I've<00:02:16.080> got<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> plastic<00:02:17.040> bag<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.750> got<00:02:18.960> to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
I've got a plastic bag and a it's got to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.550 
I've got a plastic bag and a it's got to
be<00:02:19.140> clear<00:02:19.440> plastic<00:02:19.710> bag<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.420> rubber<00:02:21.420> band<00:02:21.750> so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
be clear plastic bag and rubber band so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.590 
be clear plastic bag and rubber band so
that's<00:02:22.800> all<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.280> parts<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.060> using<00:02:24.480> today

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
that's all the parts will be using today

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.620 
that's all the parts will be using today
it's<00:02:24.930> maybe<00:02:25.710> two<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:26.610> three<00:02:26.790> dollars<00:02:27.120> from

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
it's maybe two or three dollars from

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.680 
it's maybe two or three dollars from
your<00:02:28.080> local<00:02:28.500> hardware<00:02:28.920> store<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> for<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
your local hardware store so for the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.500 
your local hardware store so for the
laser<00:02:30.900> sensor<00:02:31.470> all<00:02:31.770> I'm<00:02:31.950> going<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
laser sensor all I'm going to do is the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.040 
laser sensor all I'm going to do is the
hole<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.320> end<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.770> end<00:02:35.040> cap<00:02:35.370> is

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
hole in the end of this end cap is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.820 
hole in the end of this end cap is
drilled<00:02:37.400> for<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.490> right<00:02:38.670> size<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.990> sort<00:02:40.740> of

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
drilled for the right size to sort of

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.520 
drilled for the right size to sort of
fit<00:02:41.010> snugly<00:02:41.550> with<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.240> cables<00:02:42.840> that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
fit snugly with one of the cables that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.170 
fit snugly with one of the cables that
comes<00:02:43.770> with<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> laser<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.610> light<00:02:44.760> sensor

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
comes with the laser and light sensor

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.550 
comes with the laser and light sensor
and<00:02:45.450> then<00:02:46.200> basically<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.370> plug<00:02:47.910> now<00:02:48.210> is<00:02:48.560> kind

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and then basically this plug now is kind

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.080 
and then basically this plug now is kind
of<00:02:49.650> connected<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.310> could<00:02:50.460> glue<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.910> here

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
of connected you could glue it in here

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.190 
of connected you could glue it in here
if<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.300> want<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:51.870> not<00:02:51.960> really

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
if you want but it's not really

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.440 
if you want but it's not really
necessary<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.950> really<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> tight<00:02:53.850> fit<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.330> you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
necessary it's really a tight fit if you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.170 
necessary it's really a tight fit if you
draw<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.690> right<00:02:54.870> size<00:02:55.080> hole<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:57.030> just

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
draw the right size hole then I can just

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.130 
draw the right size hole then I can just
plug<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:59.160> laser<00:03:00.090> sensor<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:02.960> plug<00:03:03.960> this

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
plug in the laser sensor and plug this

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.190 
plug in the laser sensor and plug this
in<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.350> you've<00:03:04.560> got<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.820> laser<00:03:06.180> sensor<00:03:06.870> on

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
in and you've got the laser sensor on

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.280 
in and you've got the laser sensor on
the<00:03:07.560> inside<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.690> for<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.020> one<00:03:10.260> you

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
the inside of this and for this one you

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020 
the inside of this and for this one you
don't<00:03:10.410> really<00:03:10.710> need<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> black<00:03:11.430> paint<00:03:11.730> at<00:03:11.940> all

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
don't really need the black paint at all

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.800 
don't really need the black paint at all
i<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.330> have<00:03:13.280> painted<00:03:14.280> these<00:03:14.460> already<00:03:15.270> so<00:03:15.660> I'm

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
i just have painted these already so I'm

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.240 
i just have painted these already so I'm
sort<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.170> showing<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.560> with<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.710> black<00:03:16.950> paint

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
sort of showing it with a black paint

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.940 
sort of showing it with a black paint
but<00:03:17.550> then<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.510> take<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.410> plastic<00:03:19.920> bag

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
but then I just take the the plastic bag

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.250 
but then I just take the the plastic bag
like<00:03:20.460> this<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:23.150> put<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.360> rubber<00:03:24.720> band<00:03:24.990> on<00:03:25.230> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
like this and put the rubber band on it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.500 
like this and put the rubber band on it
a<00:03:25.440> few<00:03:25.620> times<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.190> that'll<00:03:26.460> sort<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.150> keep<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
a few times and that'll sort of keep the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.510 
a few times and that'll sort of keep the
water<00:03:27.690> out<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:29.810> at<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.990> point<00:03:31.260> we've<00:03:32.250> got<00:03:32.490> a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
water out and at this point we've got a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.910 
water out and at this point we've got a
laser<00:03:34.520> sensor<00:03:35.520> that's<00:03:35.930> fairly<00:03:36.930> weather

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
laser sensor that's fairly weather

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.620 
laser sensor that's fairly weather
resistant<00:03:39.650> ok<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.710> for<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> light<00:03:42.000> sensor<00:03:42.450> we

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
resistant ok so for the light sensor we

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.760 
resistant ok so for the light sensor we
do<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> same<00:03:43.170> trick<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.100> end<00:03:44.400> cap<00:03:45.180> here

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
do the same trick with the end cap here

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.970 
do the same trick with the end cap here
and<00:03:48.320> once<00:03:49.320> that's<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.890> snugly<00:03:50.990> we<00:03:51.990> can<00:03:52.260> attach

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
and once that's in snugly we can attach

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.740 
and once that's in snugly we can attach
the<00:03:53.550> light<00:03:54.180> sensor<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:56.910> didn't<00:03:57.600> mention

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
the light sensor and I didn't mention

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.720 
the light sensor and I didn't mention
this<00:03:58.050> earlier<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:58.710> basically<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.250> put<00:03:59.490> a<00:03:59.520> piece

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
this earlier but basically I put a piece

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.550 
this earlier but basically I put a piece
of<00:03:59.760> translucent<00:04:00.410> clear<00:04:01.410> plastic<00:04:01.740> on<00:04:03.440> one<00:04:04.440> of

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
of translucent clear plastic on one of

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.130 
of translucent clear plastic on one of
the<00:04:04.650> ends<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.250> plastic<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.270> that's

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
the ends of the plastic and that's

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.370 
the ends of the plastic and that's
basically<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:08.010> diffuse<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:09.000> light<00:04:09.350> so<00:04:10.350> that

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
basically to diffuse the light so that

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.210 
basically to diffuse the light so that
when<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.890> light<00:04:11.100> shines<00:04:11.370> through<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.810> tube

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
when the light shines through this tube

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.729 
when the light shines through this tube
hits<00:04:14.220> this<00:04:14.430> trends<00:04:14.990> though<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.260> laser<00:04:16.470> will

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
hits this trends though the laser will

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.539 
hits this trends though the laser will
shine<00:04:16.980> through<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:17.340> tube<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:18.049> hit<00:04:19.049> that

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
shine through this tube and hit that

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.940 
shine through this tube and hit that
translucent<00:04:20.549> plastic<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:21.570> basically

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
translucent plastic and it basically

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.560 
translucent plastic and it basically
diffuses<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:22.979> laser<00:04:23.280> light<00:04:23.640> over<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.060> larger

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
diffuses the laser light over a larger

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.660 
diffuses the laser light over a larger
area<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.650> don't<00:04:25.950> have<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.370> hit

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
area so you don't have to hit

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.800 
area so you don't have to hit
this<00:04:27.240> exact<00:04:28.040> tip<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:30.090> sensor<00:04:30.570> with

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
this exact tip of the the sensor with

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.110 
this exact tip of the the sensor with
the<00:04:30.930> laser<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:31.710> basically<00:04:32.070> can<00:04:32.400> hit<00:04:32.550> anywhere

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
the laser you basically can hit anywhere

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.900 
the laser you basically can hit anywhere
inside<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.380> tube<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.190> then<00:04:35.640> it<00:04:35.700> gets

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
inside this tube and then it gets

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.210 
inside this tube and then it gets
diffused<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.840> then<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.200> laser<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:38.070> light

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
diffused and then the laser the light

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.520 
diffused and then the laser the light
sensor<00:04:38.550> can<00:04:38.700> pick<00:04:38.880> up<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.900> laser<00:04:40.140> light

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
sensor can pick up the the laser light

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:48.850 
sensor can pick up the the laser light
that<00:04:41.250> way<00:04:43.190> so<00:04:44.190> then<00:04:44.450> basically<00:04:45.450> we<00:04:45.990> put<00:04:47.180> this

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
that way so then basically we put this

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.000 
that way so then basically we put this
one<00:04:49.860> inch<00:04:50.070> PVC<00:04:50.460> tubing<00:04:51.210> there<00:04:51.450> like<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.080> we

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
one inch PVC tubing there like that we

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.390 
one inch PVC tubing there like that we
put<00:04:53.250> on<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.430> coupler<00:04:54.500> we<00:04:55.500> put<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.860> diffuser<00:04:56.190> I

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
put on the coupler we put the diffuser I

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.060 
put on the coupler we put the diffuser I
put<00:04:56.640> the<00:04:56.760> diffuser<00:04:58.100> in<00:04:59.100> words<00:05:00.110> like<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.320> and

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
put the diffuser in words like that and

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.600 
put the diffuser in words like that and
I<00:05:03.000> got<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.480> plastic<00:05:03.690> bag<00:05:03.990> again<00:05:04.650> which<00:05:05.430> I

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
I got the plastic bag again which I

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.970 
I got the plastic bag again which I
would<00:05:05.790> just<00:05:05.970> put<00:05:06.180> on<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.750> sort<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.170> help<00:05:07.650> keep

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
would just put on to sort of help keep

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:18.080 
would just put on to sort of help keep
the<00:05:08.130> water<00:05:08.310> out<00:05:11.660> and<00:05:14.390> now<00:05:15.390> we've<00:05:15.600> got<00:05:15.840> a<00:05:17.090> light

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
the water out and now we've got a light

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.960 
the water out and now we've got a light
sensor<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:18.690> I<00:05:19.230> realized<00:05:19.800> one<00:05:20.430> thing<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.700> didn't

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
sensor and I realized one thing I didn't

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.450 
sensor and I realized one thing I didn't
mention<00:05:21.000> before<00:05:21.390> but<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:21.900> drilled<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.800> quarter

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
mention before but I drilled a quarter

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.080 
mention before but I drilled a quarter
inch<00:05:24.620> or<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.980> smaller<00:05:26.310> than<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.610> quarter<00:05:26.910> inch

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
inch or a smaller than a quarter inch

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.560 
inch or a smaller than a quarter inch
hole<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.630> then<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:28.020> put<00:05:28.260> a<00:05:28.290> quarter<00:05:29.190> inch<00:05:29.400> by<00:05:30.090> 20

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
hole and then I put a quarter inch by 20

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.860 
hole and then I put a quarter inch by 20
thread<00:05:31.820> die<00:05:32.820> bit<00:05:33.150> through<00:05:33.450> here<00:05:33.690> so<00:05:33.810> I

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
thread die bit through here so I

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.770 
thread die bit through here so I
basically<00:05:34.020> threaded<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.860> plastic<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:36.330> the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
basically threaded the plastic so the

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.610 
basically threaded the plastic so the
reason<00:05:37.530> to<00:05:37.830> do<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:38.040> is<00:05:38.640> so<00:05:39.450> you<00:05:39.810> can<00:05:40.140> attack<00:05:40.500> I

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
reason to do that is so you can attack I

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.960 
reason to do that is so you can attack I
mean<00:05:40.770> these<00:05:40.890> are<00:05:41.100> just<00:05:41.250> these<00:05:41.520> little

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
mean these are just these little

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.820 
mean these are just these little
tabletop<00:05:44.720> tripods<00:05:45.720> but<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:46.410> could<00:05:46.560> attach

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
tabletop tripods but you could attach

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.910 
tabletop tripods but you could attach
any<00:05:47.070> kind<00:05:47.400> of<00:05:47.520> tripod<00:05:47.910> you<00:05:48.120> want<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.720> the<00:05:49.650> idea

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
any kind of tripod you want and the idea

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.050 
any kind of tripod you want and the idea
is<00:05:49.980> now<00:05:50.280> you<00:05:51.030> can<00:05:51.300> use<00:05:52.290> your<00:05:52.440> tripod<00:05:52.920> to<00:05:53.790> hold

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
is now you can use your tripod to hold

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.360 
is now you can use your tripod to hold
up<00:05:54.380> these<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:56.520> laser<00:05:57.000> and<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.540> light<00:05:57.720> sensor

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
up these the laser and the light sensor

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.360 
up these the laser and the light sensor
so<00:05:59.370> here's<00:05:59.670> the<00:05:59.850> setup<00:06:00.090> now<00:06:00.930> with<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.650> this<00:06:02.190> is

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
so here's the setup now with the this is

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.220 
so here's the setup now with the this is
the<00:06:02.520> laser<00:06:02.760> sensor<00:06:03.300> over<00:06:03.510> on<00:06:03.630> this<00:06:03.750> side<00:06:03.810> it's

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
the laser sensor over on this side it's

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.460 
the laser sensor over on this side it's
emitting<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.800> laser<00:06:05.610> beam<00:06:06.000> over<00:06:06.300> here<00:06:06.960> to<00:06:07.200> the

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
emitting a laser beam over here to the

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.980 
emitting a laser beam over here to the
light<00:06:07.710> sensor<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.550> you<00:06:09.300> can<00:06:09.480> see<00:06:09.660> that<00:06:09.690> red

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
light sensor and you can see that red

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.140 
light sensor and you can see that red
dot<00:06:10.200> is<00:06:10.440> just<00:06:10.650> where<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:11.010> laser<00:06:11.430> is<00:06:11.640> hitting

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
dot is just where the laser is hitting

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.750 
dot is just where the laser is hitting
and<00:06:12.360> it's<00:06:12.540> really<00:06:13.320> easy<00:06:13.650> to<00:06:13.860> align<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.520> laser

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
and it's really easy to align the laser

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.090 
and it's really easy to align the laser
and<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.900> light<00:06:16.080> sensor<00:06:16.440> now<00:06:16.590> because<00:06:16.890> all<00:06:16.980> you

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
and the light sensor now because all you

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.090 
and the light sensor now because all you
have<00:06:17.220> to<00:06:17.340> do<00:06:17.460> is<00:06:17.580> hit<00:06:17.610> that<00:06:18.260> one<00:06:19.260> inch<00:06:19.470> circle

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
have to do is hit that one inch circle

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.900 
have to do is hit that one inch circle
and<00:06:20.310> then<00:06:21.060> it<00:06:21.270> gets<00:06:21.420> diffused<00:06:22.110> and<00:06:22.700> we'll<00:06:23.700> hit

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
and then it gets diffused and we'll hit

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.700 
and then it gets diffused and we'll hit
the<00:06:24.120> laser<00:06:24.810> sensor<00:06:25.440> no<00:06:25.590> matter<00:06:25.770> where<00:06:26.040> it<00:06:26.190> is

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
the laser sensor no matter where it is

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.970 
the laser sensor no matter where it is
so<00:06:29.630> alignments<00:06:30.630> really<00:06:30.900> easy<00:06:31.140> these<00:06:31.560> sensors

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
so alignments really easy these sensors

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.490 
so alignments really easy these sensors
are<00:06:32.160> you<00:06:32.400> know<00:06:32.520> somewhat<00:06:33.210> water<00:06:33.480> and<00:06:33.780> weather

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
are you know somewhat water and weather

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.000 
are you know somewhat water and weather
resistant<00:06:35.720> if<00:06:36.720> we<00:06:37.170> look<00:06:37.350> at<00:06:37.500> the<00:06:37.680> actual

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
resistant if we look at the actual

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.279 
resistant if we look at the actual
camera<00:06:38.640> acts

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
camera acts

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.980 
camera acts
so<00:06:40.860> one<00:06:41.249> difference<00:06:41.729> is<00:06:41.969> you<00:06:42.389> can<00:06:42.539> sort<00:06:42.749> of<00:06:42.839> see

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
so one difference is you can sort of see

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.350 
so one difference is you can sort of see
that<00:06:43.139> 540<00:06:43.830> number<00:06:44.399> is<00:06:44.669> the<00:06:44.819> value<00:06:45.180> it's

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
that 540 number is the value it's

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.749 
that 540 number is the value it's
currently<00:06:45.749> sensing<00:06:46.229> if<00:06:46.379> you<00:06:46.889> don't<00:06:47.099> use<00:06:47.399> all

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
currently sensing if you don't use all

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.739 
currently sensing if you don't use all
of<00:06:47.969> this<00:06:48.119> diffuser<00:06:49.460> if<00:06:50.460> you<00:06:51.270> don't<00:06:51.419> use<00:06:51.599> the

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:51.749 
of this diffuser if you don't use the

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:53.600 
of this diffuser if you don't use the
diffuser<00:06:52.319> and<00:06:52.529> you<00:06:52.710> actually<00:06:53.159> hit<00:06:53.279> the<00:06:53.399> light

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
diffuser and you actually hit the light

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.989 
diffuser and you actually hit the light
sensor<00:06:54.059> directly<00:06:54.689> that<00:06:55.169> value<00:06:55.559> would<00:06:55.680> be<00:06:55.710> a

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:55.999 
sensor directly that value would be a

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:00.260 
sensor directly that value would be a
999<00:06:56.999> backs<00:06:57.599> mit<00:06:58.490> basically<00:06:59.490> max<00:06:59.759> out<00:06:59.999> the

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
999 backs mit basically max out the

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:06.769 
999 backs mit basically max out the
light<00:07:00.449> sensor<00:07:00.949> however<00:07:03.439> the<00:07:04.439> diffuser<00:07:05.779> makes

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:06.779 
light sensor however the diffuser makes

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:09.230 
light sensor however the diffuser makes
it<00:07:06.960> much<00:07:07.139> easier<00:07:07.349> to<00:07:07.710> align<00:07:08.189> the<00:07:08.610> sensor<00:07:08.999> so<00:07:09.210> I

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 
it much easier to align the sensor so I

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.359 
it much easier to align the sensor so I
kind<00:07:09.689> of<00:07:09.779> think<00:07:09.930> it's<00:07:10.110> worth<00:07:10.289> it<00:07:10.499> and<00:07:10.740> the

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:11.369 
kind of think it's worth it and the

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:13.999 
kind of think it's worth it and the
camera<00:07:11.699> acts<00:07:11.849> can<00:07:12.089> be<00:07:12.409> programmed<00:07:13.409> to<00:07:13.740> trigger

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
camera acts can be programmed to trigger

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.760 
camera acts can be programmed to trigger
it<00:07:14.099> any<00:07:14.309> different<00:07:14.729> values<00:07:15.209> so<00:07:15.479> in<00:07:16.259> this<00:07:16.469> case

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
it any different values so in this case

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.329 
it any different values so in this case
when<00:07:17.699> the<00:07:17.909> laser<00:07:18.119> beam<00:07:18.449> is<00:07:18.689> blocked<00:07:19.099> you<00:07:20.099> can

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:20.339 
when the laser beam is blocked you can

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.369 
when the laser beam is blocked you can
see<00:07:20.639> that<00:07:20.969> it<00:07:21.119> drops<00:07:21.300> down<00:07:21.479> to<00:07:21.629> single<00:07:22.229> digits

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:22.379 
see that it drops down to single digits

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:25.699 
see that it drops down to single digits
so<00:07:22.800> I'd<00:07:22.889> probably<00:07:23.099> set<00:07:24.029> the<00:07:24.300> trigger<00:07:25.050> value<00:07:25.559> to

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:25.709 
so I'd probably set the trigger value to

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:27.799 
so I'd probably set the trigger value to
maybe<00:07:25.889> something<00:07:26.399> like<00:07:26.550> 50<00:07:27.119> or<00:07:27.149> something<00:07:27.659> in

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:27.809 
maybe something like 50 or something in

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:30.199 
maybe something like 50 or something in
this<00:07:27.959> case<00:07:28.229> and<00:07:28.499> then<00:07:29.039> when<00:07:29.369> i<00:07:29.399> unblock<00:07:30.180> it

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:30.209 
this case and then when i unblock it

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:33.350 
this case and then when i unblock it
jumps<00:07:30.719> way<00:07:30.899> back<00:07:31.199> up<00:07:31.469> so<00:07:31.999> there's<00:07:32.999> a<00:07:33.089> huge

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 
jumps way back up so there's a huge

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.939 
jumps way back up so there's a huge
range<00:07:33.719> where<00:07:34.050> you<00:07:34.169> could<00:07:35.419> detect<00:07:36.419> the<00:07:36.949> laser

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:37.949 
range where you could detect the laser

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:40.309 
range where you could detect the laser
beam<00:07:38.309> and<00:07:38.669> because<00:07:39.149> of<00:07:39.180> all<00:07:39.389> that<00:07:39.419> black<00:07:39.869> paint

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 
beam and because of all that black paint

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:44.779 
beam and because of all that black paint
and<00:07:40.619> this<00:07:41.459> tube<00:07:42.800> really<00:07:43.800> not<00:07:43.979> much<00:07:44.189> ambient

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:44.789 
and this tube really not much ambient

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:46.369 
and this tube really not much ambient
light<00:07:45.029> gets<00:07:45.269> in<00:07:45.419> there<00:07:45.629> so<00:07:45.779> you<00:07:45.870> don't<00:07:45.899> have<00:07:46.199> to

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:46.379 
light gets in there so you don't have to

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:48.110 
light gets in there so you don't have to
worry<00:07:46.559> about<00:07:46.680> sunlight<00:07:47.129> triggering<00:07:47.789> it<00:07:47.939> and

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 
worry about sunlight triggering it and

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.209 
worry about sunlight triggering it and
things<00:07:48.539> like<00:07:48.719> that<00:07:48.779> as<00:07:49.589> long<00:07:49.769> as<00:07:49.860> you<00:07:50.039> don't

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:50.219 
things like that as long as you don't

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:52.820 
things like that as long as you don't
point<00:07:50.519> it<00:07:50.639> directly<00:07:50.849> at<00:07:51.479> the<00:07:51.689> Sun<00:07:51.740> so<00:07:52.740> I'm

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830 
point it directly at the Sun so I'm

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.600 
point it directly at the Sun so I'm
pretty<00:07:52.979> happy<00:07:53.099> with<00:07:53.430> the<00:07:54.059> results<00:07:54.599> here<00:07:54.930> and

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.610 
pretty happy with the results here and

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.820 
pretty happy with the results here and
maybe<00:07:56.610> I'll<00:07:56.789> set<00:07:57.059> this<00:07:57.209> up<00:07:57.389> outside<00:07:58.289> sometime

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:58.830 
maybe I'll set this up outside sometime

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.389 
maybe I'll set this up outside sometime
to<00:07:59.099> take<00:07:59.849> some<00:08:00.180> wildlife<00:08:01.050> photography<00:08:01.769> shots

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:02.399 
to take some wildlife photography shots

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.719 
to take some wildlife photography shots
with<00:08:02.759> the<00:08:02.879> camera<00:08:03.180> axe<00:08:03.360> now<00:08:03.599> I<00:08:04.409> hope<00:08:05.370> this<00:08:05.580> was

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:05.729 
with the camera axe now I hope this was

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:08.329 
with the camera axe now I hope this was
helpful<00:08:05.759> to<00:08:06.180> other<00:08:06.419> people<00:08:06.870> and<00:08:07.219> thanks<00:08:08.219> for

00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:08.339 
helpful to other people and thanks for

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:10.669 
helpful to other people and thanks for
