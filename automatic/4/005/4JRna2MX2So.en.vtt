00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.920
 hello god and welcome to conrad 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.050
 This week's beer will be one 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.820
 Styrian beer from a whole 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.010
 secret Styrian brewery in the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.830
 near hartberg the brewery scratch 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.840
 has been around for over ten years and there as 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.150
 Scratch is one of the young wild ones 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.090
 Austrian scene and has its 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.920
 Beers with the Styrian name 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.370
 in this case, it is the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.090
 hermann sees a bearded beer 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.940
 brown bear decorates the label and the beer 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.870
 itself is also a dark lager beer 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.710
 if we give it then we'll see 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.830
 it flows in a very nice way 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:13.270
 Maroon in the grass again one 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:14.979
 strong shivers so far aware 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.760
 not entirely because then comes 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:22.870
 the roma smell very nice at that time 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:28.110
 the nose is out first time you smell 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.110
 maybe a little cocoa chocolate 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.689
 and all that is still coming 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.719
 now a hefty roast we taste 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.640
 have a little something that makes us think of one 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:49.250
 reminds chocolate cake and this one 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.649
 Round effect a bit sweet 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.319
 a bit bitter very little hop 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:02.500
 character there we actually have 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:04.579
 a typical Bavarian dark 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.929
 Interestingly , and this is empire 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:11.390
 style has you always been the noble beer 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.650
 always has the dark lager beer in it 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.099
 nineteenth century especially 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.769
 appreciated in this case we are at 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.720
 a relatively high seasoning are almost 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:27.019
 in the strength of a bock beer so about 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.670
 scarce 16 degrees wort and thus is 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.819
 the game also with well over 6 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.549
 percent a very strong representative 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.170
 his blow smell once again 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.180
 Now get where to drink 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:45.410
 have even more of these chocolates 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.660
 tones get the fullness of this 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.109
 beer has and this fullness of this 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.870
 round character of the back then straight 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.889
 dry enough , that closes you still lust 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.690
 has to keep pushing 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.430
 that has this beer at the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.430
 state championship of the house and small 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.680
 breweries in 2012 in braunau den 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.900
 First place among the dark lager beer 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.750
 registered very well deserved 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.700
 and so zambia so that whole 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.350
 wonderful to all sorts of dark ones 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.959
 meat dishes may happen 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.940
 too wild so i can already 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.630
 Imagine that you are very happy with this picture 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.389
 very well 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.430
 all the autumn and winter weeks with 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.930
 spend your delicious food 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.510
 Of course you can do it the way you do 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.549
 may be deliberately simple and I say 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.230
 looking forward to the next beer of the 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.230
 week please be back
