00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.180
 how about youtube friends i am your 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.960
 review and today we have a guest 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.560
 my best friend is home night 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.239
 Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you as well as 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.009
 I had said my best friend is man 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:27.210
 Canary 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:31.239
 I hope they visit my book and as now 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.360
 Pablo Town told us that he 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.579
 they showed their territorial how to spend in 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.949
 the underworld the blades 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.649
 ok well below we present you 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.909
 the tutorial we ordered our 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.879
 friend pablo álvarez 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.789
 then we present them good 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.649
 ok we need to go through the temple first 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.710
 of Pandora and one other known by 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.729
 there good we get to the underworld we 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.729
 we found here in the blades 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.830
 to begin with I would recommend that you 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.620
 stop a little bit more because that's the way 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.620
 a little easier to pass it and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.010
 good 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.930
 my friend was referring to that to be 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.250
 make the journey easier to wait for 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 have yourselves as is the case right now 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.170
 it's not much science just this see the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.590
 point at which the blades will 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.430
 He stopped to wait tantito I tell them is not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.650
 great science just about measure it 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.240
 many times yes it does not get confused 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.460
 with the time 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.649
 with the scythes, but I say no 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.869
 there's a lot of science behind it just 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.869
 we must wait until they have good 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.380
 1 if not the last sixth ok if it is not 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.649
 Well, more than anything 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.750
 It is a matter of skill as you have 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.299
 well we call and we have 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.340
 Passed the game several times and then no 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.079
 it means a lot to us but 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.970
 then to those who start with the 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.280
 game in case it's going to cost you a little 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.619
 of work but then I tell them there is no 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.100
 great science behind how to pass these 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.509
 things 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.420
 [Music] 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.430
 and here more or less we're going to finish the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.640
 travel in the last part them 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.940
 I recommend that they use 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.230
 the master's technique losses that we 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.650
 grant before 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.650
 a point of the game so that if you win 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.810
 to the two enemies that we have to 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.750
 murder and that at some point then we 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.220
 they can make you fall not but ok ok here 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.760
 we already passed the first part 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.760
 let's save 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.940
 and here I had to erase one of my 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.360
 Olympic games to do the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.360
 tutorial 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.209
 in order to please the friends how many 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:05.500
 and if pablo net you made me lose a 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.140
 departure from olympus to be the least 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.420
 easily recover if this is the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.939
 experience tell them what counts and 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.260
 Well I assure you that right now 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.870
 friend pablo álvarez 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.760
 he is a beginner but soon he can 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.349
 this one is better and make your own 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.260
 tutorials on how to hack into play 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.870
 watch my channel on youtube go direct 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.299
 to my channel my account and you will find 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.650
 with a video on how to have the most 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.470
 infinite in everything playing 1 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.110
 like having infinite red order in the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.180
 I keep a box and one or another 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.629
 video out there how to hack is delegated 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.430
 2 play 2 to skip levels 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:49.349
 good is that they will also meet 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.090
 tutorials on how to get one that 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.610
 another trophy that are very difficult in 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.140
 the ford war 3 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.910
 soon we will be making videos 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.680
 sparta ghost software and war grade 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.409
 limbo challenges 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.439
 Well, from a visit to the canal 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.930
 from my friend they harbor my channel to their king 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.420
 Mass and put in your YouTube search engine 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.880
 well, there's no great science behind 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.310
 all that 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.320
 and I say this is a very simple tutorial 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.210
 but here is our friend Pablo 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.890
 álvarez with always visiting our 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.520
 videos answers like all the time 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.730
 because I did not have no more or less one 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.070
 clear video about something interesting and 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.780
 Well, I'm telling you, I'm very easy 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.370
 try to answer our friend 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.760
 Pablo Álvarez 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.290
 but what good 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.120
 exactly the blades that you 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.280
 Our same Pablo Álvarez was not 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.020
 we are very sure we do not know if they are 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.979
 the past ones or these but good we are going them 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.979
 to teach to move on 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.750
 ok well here I tell them no no there's a lot 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.230
 science just do not try to climb 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:08.090
 fast here is slow 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:13.160
 do not hurry take it with saved 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:16.729
 just look just look at how 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.030
 go the blades are you because then they go 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:23.210
 very separated then they go very close but 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.680
 look there this one has to be calm was 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.680
 it was very clear together 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.680
 take it easy 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.420
 and this tomato all laya before playing 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.030
 at some point you will be able to achieve it and you 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.620
 I say there is no great science behind this 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.919
 just this calmly go through 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.470
 I calm down with patience because if you are 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.900
 beginner or many times you go 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.590
 to fail 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.590
 just lack experience 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.770
 it is not very difficult 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.889
