00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
buying process right let's talk first

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.600 
buying process right let's talk first
about<00:01:24.320> balance<00:01:25.320> right<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.130> when<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.340> look<00:01:26.490> at

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
about balance right so when you look at

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.330 
about balance right so when you look at
the<00:01:26.759> willow<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:28.050> and<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.130> how<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the willow right and you see how the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.249 
the willow right and you see how the
weight<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.819> distributed<00:01:30.000> evenly<00:01:30.479> throughout

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
weight is distributed evenly throughout

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.070 
weight is distributed evenly throughout
the<00:01:31.440> profile<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.789> nowadays<00:01:33.569> there<00:01:34.020> are

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
the profile you know nowadays there are

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.169 
the profile you know nowadays there are
many<00:01:34.229> designs<00:01:34.649> which<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.069> very<00:01:35.550> heavy<00:01:35.850> here

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
many designs which are very heavy here

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.930 
many designs which are very heavy here
but<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:37.080> so<00:01:37.289> much<00:01:37.440> here<00:01:37.679> I<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.490> thing<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
but not so much here I think the thing I

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.969 
but not so much here I think the thing I
like<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.479> willow<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.830> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
like about this willow is that the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.949 
like about this willow is that the
profile<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.399> very<00:01:41.759> even<00:01:42.240> right<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> balance

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
profile is very even right the balance

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.710 
profile is very even right the balance
as<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.550> weight<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.000> evenly

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
as you would see in the weight is evenly

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.169 
as you would see in the weight is evenly
distributed<00:01:46.069> let's<00:01:47.069> check<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.610> weight<00:01:47.789> I

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
distributed let's check out the weight I

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.090 
distributed let's check out the weight I
think<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.080> actual<00:01:49.410> weight<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.860> bat<00:01:50.069> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
think the actual weight of this bat is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.020 
think the actual weight of this bat is
probably<00:01:50.550> close<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.789> two<00:01:51.060> nine<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:53.030> what

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
probably close to two nine right what

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
probably close to two nine right what
matters<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.660> a<00:01:54.690> batsman<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> pickup

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
matters to a batsman is the pickup

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.279 
matters to a batsman is the pickup
weight<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.640> that's<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.360> how<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
weight because that's really how it

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.260 
weight because that's really how it
impacts<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.740> timing<00:01:59.160> in<00:01:59.280> over<00:01:59.459> and<00:01:59.940> I<00:02:00.060> think

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
impacts your timing in over and I think

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.400 
impacts your timing in over and I think
there<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.509> definitely<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:01.050> ounce<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
there is definitely an ounce of

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.680 
there is definitely an ounce of
difference<00:02:01.800> between<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.789> actual<00:02:03.240> weight<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
difference between the actual weight and

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.270 
difference between the actual weight and
the<00:02:03.810> pickup<00:02:04.050> weight<00:02:04.289> meaning<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.979> pickup

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the pickup weight meaning the pickup

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.160 
the pickup weight meaning the pickup
weight<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.550> slightly<00:02:05.850> lighter<00:02:06.179> just<00:02:06.929> because

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
weight is slightly lighter just because

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.400 
weight is slightly lighter just because
of<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.380> unique<00:02:07.709> profile<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.880> bat<00:02:09.030> right<00:02:09.410> I

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
of the unique profile of the bat right I

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.460 
of the unique profile of the bat right I

sharing more about what the uniqueness

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.000 
sharing more about what the uniqueness
is<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:15.870> we'll<00:02:16.020> get<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.800> minute

uniqueness<00:03:10.099> now<00:03:11.099> notice<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.879> okay

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.510 

there<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:25.790> dual<00:03:26.150> spine<00:03:26.630> in<00:03:26.960> this<00:03:27.200> bat<00:03:27.520> right

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
there is a dual spine in this bat right

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.700 
there is a dual spine in this bat right
as<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:29.030> would<00:03:29.570> see<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.990> most<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.440> Willows

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
as you would see in most of the Willows

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.220 
as you would see in most of the Willows
the<00:03:30.890> spine<00:03:31.160> is<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.430> single<00:03:31.880> spine<00:03:32.150> shaping<00:03:33.020> up

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
the spine is a single spine shaping up

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.400 
the spine is a single spine shaping up
this<00:03:33.830> way<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.790> bat<00:03:35.000> has<00:03:35.210> a<00:03:35.240> dual<00:03:35.510> spine<00:03:35.930> right

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
this way this bat has a dual spine right

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.280 
this way this bat has a dual spine right
as<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.770> can<00:03:36.920> see<00:03:37.100> very<00:03:37.910> unique<00:03:38.300> concept<00:03:38.570> right

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
as you can see very unique concept right

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.400 
as you can see very unique concept right
and<00:03:39.560> one<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.730> has<00:03:40.880> been<00:03:41.030> tried<00:03:41.360> by<00:03:42.050> various

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
and one that has been tried by various

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.590 
and one that has been tried by various
manufacturers<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.310> different<00:03:43.700> ways<00:03:43.850> however

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
manufacturers in different ways however

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.630 
manufacturers in different ways however
I<00:03:44.630> like<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:45.260> most<00:03:45.440> there<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.430> still<00:03:46.610> a

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
I like this the most there is still a

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.630 
I like this the most there is still a
spine<00:03:46.970> okay<00:03:47.890> right<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.100> fact<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.550> is

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
spine okay right the fact that it is

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.360 
spine okay right the fact that it is
dual<00:03:50.030> doesn't<00:03:50.630> take<00:03:50.870> anything<00:03:51.290> away<00:03:51.470> from<00:03:52.190> the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
dual doesn't take anything away from the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.390 
dual doesn't take anything away from the
actual<00:03:52.780> effectiveness<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.260> bat<00:03:54.980> that's

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
actual effectiveness of the bat that's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.780 
actual effectiveness of the bat that's
what<00:03:55.580> I<00:03:55.610> like<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.880> most<00:03:56.030> right<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:58.730> is

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
what I like the most right so this is

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.870 
what I like the most right so this is
one<00:03:59.090> dimension<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.840> uniqueness<00:04:00.140> I<00:04:00.470> think

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
one dimension of the uniqueness I think

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.230 
one dimension of the uniqueness I think
it<00:04:01.880> shaves<00:04:02.590> weight<00:04:03.590> off<00:04:03.890> but<00:04:04.190> it<00:04:04.730> continues<00:04:05.180> to

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
it shaves weight off but it continues to

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.550 
it shaves weight off but it continues to
give<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.720> sweet<00:04:05.900> spot<00:04:06.170> that's<00:04:06.350> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
give you the sweet spot that's the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.720 
give you the sweet spot that's the
beauty<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.070> think<00:04:07.310> that's<00:04:07.459> what<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
beauty and I think that's what the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.760 
beauty and I think that's what the
manufacturer<00:04:08.270> intended<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.900> do<00:04:09.020> and<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.590> think

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
manufacturer intended to do and I think

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.050 
manufacturer intended to do and I think
they<00:04:09.830> have<00:04:09.920> done<00:04:10.040> justice<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.580> it<00:04:10.700> from<00:04:10.880> what<00:04:11.030> I

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
they have done justice to it from what I

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.090 
they have done justice to it from what I
can<00:04:11.180> see<00:04:11.360> what<00:04:12.020> you<00:04:12.140> do<00:04:12.290> get<00:04:12.530> with<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.950> dual

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
can see what you do get with the dual

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.650 
can see what you do get with the dual
spine<00:04:13.459> because<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.940> weight<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:14.120> shaved<00:04:14.480> off

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
spine because the weight is shaved off

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.720 
spine because the weight is shaved off
here<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.050> get<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.530> slightly<00:04:15.950> heavier<00:04:16.340> bottom

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
here you get a slightly heavier bottom

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:25.480 
here you get a slightly heavier bottom
as<00:04:16.880> well

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.850 

as<00:04:26.000> well<00:04:26.270> which<00:04:26.810> is<00:04:26.840> also<00:04:27.110> very<00:04:27.229> unique<00:04:27.710> and

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
as well which is also very unique and

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.730 
as well which is also very unique and
very<00:04:27.919> helpful<00:04:28.250> for<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.639> batsman<00:04:28.990> okay<00:04:29.990> step

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
very helpful for a batsman okay step

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.589 
very helpful for a batsman okay step
about<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.069> second<00:04:31.400> dimension<00:04:31.520> right<00:04:32.330> when

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
about the second dimension right when

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.260 
about the second dimension right when

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:46.350 
you would hold this bat you are going to
feel<00:04:35.479> something<00:04:35.840> unique<00:04:36.110> about<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.530> handle

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.870 

and<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.540> actually<00:04:47.720> gets<00:04:48.100> it's<00:04:49.100> driven<00:04:49.430> by<00:04:49.580> this

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
and it actually gets it's driven by this

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.500 
and it actually gets it's driven by this
hex<00:04:50.300> shape<00:04:50.950> handle<00:04:51.950> right<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:53.150> notice

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
hex shape handle right and you notice

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.660 
hex shape handle right and you notice
the<00:04:53.660> hollowness<00:04:54.200> in<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.340> handle

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
the hollowness in the in the handle

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.850 
the hollowness in the in the handle
right<00:04:56.270> from<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:56.960> manufacturing<00:04:57.590> standpoint

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
right from the manufacturing standpoint

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.190 
right from the manufacturing standpoint
this<00:04:58.220> is<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.400> very<00:04:58.610> unique<00:04:58.940> approach<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.720> the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
this is a very unique approach to the

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.500 
this is a very unique approach to the
creation<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.890> batch<00:05:01.040> right<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.420> think

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
creation of the batch right and I think

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.300 
creation of the batch right and I think
from<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.900> end-user<00:05:03.140> without<00:05:03.830> going<00:05:04.130> too<00:05:04.280> much

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
from the end-user without going too much

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.880 
from the end-user without going too much
into<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.760> technicality<00:05:05.480> of<00:05:05.510> this<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.960> when

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
into the technicality of this is when

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.070 
into the technicality of this is when
you<00:05:06.920> are<00:05:07.190> holding<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.670> bat<00:05:07.820> you<00:05:08.540> will<00:05:08.750> find

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
you are holding the bat you will find

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
you are holding the bat you will find
the<00:05:10.120> handle<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.840> be<00:05:11.870> responsive<00:05:12.620> to<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.860> grip

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
the handle to be responsive to the grip

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:23.290 
the handle to be responsive to the grip
right<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.550> think<00:05:13.730> that's<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.240> beauty

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.320 

what<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.330> can<00:05:24.599> feel<00:05:24.780> in<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:25.319> bag<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:27.090> know<00:05:27.180> and

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
what I can feel in this bag you know and

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.110 
what I can feel in this bag you know and
that<00:05:27.479> is<00:05:27.509> unique<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.460> apart<00:05:29.460> from<00:05:29.520> that

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
that is unique to this apart from that

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.510 
that is unique to this apart from that
sets<00:05:30.360> it<00:05:30.509> apart<00:05:30.629> effectively<00:05:31.379> right<00:05:31.530> is<00:05:31.740> the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
sets it apart effectively right is the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.520 
sets it apart effectively right is the
the<00:05:32.699> fact<00:05:32.849> that<00:05:33.060> I<00:05:33.270> feel<00:05:33.810> like<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:34.169> handle<00:05:34.409> is

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
the fact that I feel like the handle is

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.469 
the fact that I feel like the handle is
working<00:05:34.889> with<00:05:35.039> me<00:05:35.220> right<00:05:35.520> I<00:05:35.759> don't<00:05:36.240> know<00:05:36.330> how

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
working with me right I don't know how

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.760 
working with me right I don't know how
they<00:05:36.659> have<00:05:36.750> done<00:05:36.900> it<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.169> that's<00:05:37.349> what<00:05:37.500> I<00:05:37.530> feel

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
they have done it but that's what I feel

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.950 
they have done it but that's what I feel
and<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:37.979> sort<00:05:38.340> I<00:05:38.400> think<00:05:38.430> is<00:05:38.699> real<00:05:38.909> that<00:05:39.750> comes

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
and that sort I think is real that comes

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.899 
and that sort I think is real that comes
about<00:05:40.080> with<00:05:40.470> this<00:05:40.650> uniqueness<00:05:41.039> right<00:05:41.370> so

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
about with this uniqueness right so

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.249 
about with this uniqueness right so
there<00:05:42.090> those<00:05:42.300> are<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.509> two<00:05:42.659> dimension<00:05:43.110> that

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
there those are the two dimension that

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.230 
there those are the two dimension that
kind<00:05:43.530> of<00:05:43.620> addresses<00:05:44.099> this<00:05:44.250> Veloz<00:05:44.610> uniqueness

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
kind of addresses this Veloz uniqueness

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240 
kind of addresses this Veloz uniqueness
let's<00:05:45.810> talk<00:05:46.020> about<00:05:46.139> the<00:05:46.440> genetic<00:05:46.830> stuff<00:05:47.069> now

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
let's talk about the genetic stuff now

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.550 
let's talk about the genetic stuff now
right<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:47.909> I<00:05:48.539> already<00:05:48.870> touched<00:05:49.050> about<00:05:49.229> it

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
right and I already touched about it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.480 
right and I already touched about it
right

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
right

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.670 
right
the<00:05:50.729> balance<00:05:51.120> is<00:05:51.210> even<00:05:51.629> you<00:05:52.110> can<00:05:52.259> look<00:05:52.440> at<00:05:52.560> the

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
the balance is even you can look at the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.129 
the balance is even you can look at the
edges<00:05:53.009> right<00:05:53.220> very<00:05:54.180> thick<00:05:54.449> right<00:05:54.960> it

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
edges right very thick right it

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.050 
edges right very thick right it
addresses<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:55.889> current<00:05:56.250> trend<00:05:56.490> of<00:05:56.610> Willow

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
addresses to the current trend of Willow

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.270 
addresses to the current trend of Willow
right<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:58.199> think<00:05:58.380> as<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.500> batsman<00:05:58.740> you

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
right and I think as a batsman you

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.930 
right and I think as a batsman you
should<00:05:59.460> be<00:05:59.580> very<00:05:59.759> impressed<00:06:00.150> with<00:06:00.780> this

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
should be very impressed with this

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.879 
should be very impressed with this
coming<00:06:02.940> on<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.360> greens<00:06:03.630> right<00:06:04.409> this

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
coming on to the greens right this

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.219 
coming on to the greens right this
particular<00:06:05.430> willow<00:06:05.669> has<00:06:05.819> ten<00:06:06.240> grains<00:06:06.509> pretty

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
particular willow has ten grains pretty

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.110 
particular willow has ten grains pretty
straight<00:06:07.590> again<00:06:08.250> it's<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.490> great<00:06:08.610> tool<00:06:08.940> below

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
straight again it's a great tool below

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.210 
straight again it's a great tool below
right<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.840> I<00:06:10.199> think<00:06:10.289> it<00:06:10.530> does<00:06:10.710> justice<00:06:11.190> to

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
right and I think it does justice to

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.409 
right and I think it does justice to
that<00:06:11.520> aspect<00:06:12.389> of<00:06:12.539> it<00:06:12.690> very<00:06:12.870> well<00:06:13.139> right<00:06:13.409> now

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
that aspect of it very well right now

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.230 
that aspect of it very well right now
when<00:06:15.419> you<00:06:15.509> look<00:06:15.630> at<00:06:15.780> the<00:06:16.469> bat<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.979> think<00:06:17.639> the<00:06:18.120> way

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
when you look at the bat I think the way

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.820 
when you look at the bat I think the way
the<00:06:18.270> manufacturers<00:06:18.990> are<00:06:19.139> going<00:06:19.169> about<00:06:19.620> this

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
the manufacturers are going about this

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.790 
the manufacturers are going about this
process<00:06:20.130> is<00:06:20.430> they're<00:06:20.580> trying<00:06:20.759> to<00:06:21.000> be<00:06:21.150> very

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
process is they're trying to be very

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.980 
process is they're trying to be very
consistent<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:24.090> would<00:06:24.479> say<00:06:24.599> there<00:06:24.750> are<00:06:24.840> not

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
consistent and I would say there are not

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.439 
consistent and I would say there are not
many<00:06:25.319> who<00:06:25.469> are<00:06:25.770> doing<00:06:26.009> a<00:06:26.129> good<00:06:26.250> job<00:06:26.310> at<00:06:26.669> it<00:06:26.789> but

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
many who are doing a good job at it but

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:28.610 
many who are doing a good job at it but
you<00:06:27.569> would<00:06:27.719> see<00:06:27.870> from<00:06:28.050> the<00:06:28.169> aesthetics

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
you would see from the aesthetics

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.980 
you would see from the aesthetics
perspective<00:06:29.250> right<00:06:29.580> this<00:06:30.150> bat<00:06:30.389> has<00:06:30.750> done

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
perspective right this bat has done

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.010 
perspective right this bat has done
pretty<00:06:31.650> well<00:06:31.800> right<00:06:32.310> meaning<00:06:32.909> it<00:06:33.569> sticks<00:06:33.870> to

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
pretty well right meaning it sticks to

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.589 
pretty well right meaning it sticks to
the<00:06:34.050> black<00:06:34.349> and<00:06:34.590> white<00:06:34.770> team<00:06:35.099> right<00:06:35.669> you<00:06:36.419> can

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
the black and white team right you can

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.269 
the black and white team right you can
see<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:36.870> authenticity<00:06:37.139> of<00:06:37.590> them<00:06:37.830> brand<00:06:38.009> in

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279 
see the authenticity of them brand in

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.629 
see the authenticity of them brand in
the<00:06:39.120> top<00:06:39.150> right<00:06:39.930> you<00:06:40.590> can<00:06:40.620> validate<00:06:41.250> the<00:06:41.430> shape

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
the top right you can validate the shape
