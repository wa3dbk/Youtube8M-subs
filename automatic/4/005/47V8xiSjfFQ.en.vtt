Packer<00:02:59.849> back<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.359> like<00:03:00.689> I<00:03:00.810> started<00:03:01.139> out<00:03:01.230> with

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
Packer back on like I started out with

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.659 
Packer back on like I started out with
hacker<00:03:01.500> then<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:01.829> decided<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.189> was<00:03:02.310> running<00:03:02.579> too

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
hacker then I decided I was running too

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.789 
hacker then I decided I was running too
slow<00:03:02.790> i<00:03:02.909> really<00:03:03.359> needed<00:03:03.719> the<00:03:03.870> agility<00:03:04.139> to<00:03:04.680> get

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
slow i really needed the agility to get

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.439 
slow i really needed the agility to get
around<00:03:04.949> those<00:03:05.129> corners<00:03:05.579> it<00:03:05.730> should<00:03:05.909> just<00:03:06.000> run

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
around those corners it should just run

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.059 
around those corners it should just run
faster<00:03:07.019> away<00:03:07.230> from<00:03:07.409> those<00:03:07.500> enemies<00:03:07.829> because<00:03:08.010> i

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
faster away from those enemies because i

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.319 
faster away from those enemies because i
