00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you how you make them first you mix up a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
you how you make them first you mix up a
batch<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.570> peanut<00:00:27.990> butter<00:00:28.080> cookies<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.890> just

batch of peanut butter cookies I just

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.269 
batch of peanut butter cookies I just
have<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> little<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:30.000> left<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.420> there

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
have a little bit left right there

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.680 
have a little bit left right there
then<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> chill<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
then what you do is you have to chill it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.630 
then what you do is you have to chill it
for<00:00:33.930> 3<00:00:34.469> hours<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.160> doesn't<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.460> make

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
for 3 hours but it doesn't really make

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.860 
for 3 hours but it doesn't really make
that<00:00:35.760> much<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> difference<00:00:36.210> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that much of a difference if you do it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.709 
that much of a difference if you do it
for<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.280> at<00:00:38.280> least<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> half<00:00:39.300> hours

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
for just at least one and a half hours

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.490 
for just at least one and a half hours
it's<00:00:40.590> basically<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> same<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.350> anyway<00:00:43.350> then

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it's basically the same but anyway then

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
it's basically the same but anyway then
what<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.309> put<00:00:45.149> them<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.300> little

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
what you do is you put them in little

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.290 
what you do is you put them in little
balls<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:46.050> some<00:00:46.289> parchment<00:00:46.620> paper<00:00:47.149> you<00:00:48.149> don't

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
balls on some parchment paper you don't

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.670 
balls on some parchment paper you don't
have<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> use<00:00:48.629> parchment<00:00:48.899> paper<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.620> do

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
have to use parchment paper but I do

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.760 
have to use parchment paper but I do
highly<00:00:50.070> recommend<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:52.559> want

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
highly recommend it and you don't want

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.990

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that because then they'll get

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.610

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.290 
so there's your eyes and then what you
do<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.870> you<00:02:08.080> bake<00:02:08.350> them<00:02:08.560> at<00:02:08.740> 375<00:02:09.070> for<00:02:09.610> about<00:02:09.910> 10

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
do is you bake them at 375 for about 10

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.940 
do is you bake them at 375 for about 10
minutes

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
minutes

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.560 
minutes
you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.160> bake<00:02:12.400> them<00:02:12.550> for<00:02:12.700> nine<00:02:12.880> minutes<00:02:13.150> -<00:02:13.330> but

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
you can bake them for nine minutes - but

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.030 
you can bake them for nine minutes - but
I<00:02:13.600> like<00:02:13.780> mine<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:13.990> little<00:02:14.170> bit<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.470> Brown<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
I like mine a little bit more Brown so I

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.030 
I like mine a little bit more Brown so I
bake<00:02:15.280> them<00:02:15.370> at<00:02:15.520> ten<00:02:15.700> minutes<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:17.830> once

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
bake them at ten minutes and then once

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.340 
bake them at ten minutes and then once
they<00:02:18.220> come<00:02:18.400> out<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.640> oven<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:19.000> take<00:02:19.360> red

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
they come out of the oven you take red

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.870 
they come out of the oven you take red
M&amp;M<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.950> put<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.280> right<00:02:21.310> here<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
M&amp;M and you put it right here in the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.720 
M&amp;M and you put it right here in the
center<00:02:22.470> blow<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.620> eyes<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.310> once<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.670> take

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
center blow the eyes and once you take

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.180 
center blow the eyes and once you take
them<00:02:24.910> out<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> oven<00:02:25.770> they<00:02:26.770> look<00:02:27.070> exactly

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
them out of the oven they look exactly

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.690 
them out of the oven they look exactly
like<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.830> want<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.040> put<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> M&amp;M

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
like this and you want to put the M&amp;M

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.520 
like this and you want to put the M&amp;M
and<00:02:30.970> right<00:02:31.540> after<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> take<00:02:31.990> out<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.350> oven

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and right after you take out of the oven

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.150 
and right after you take out of the oven
because<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.870> bake<00:02:35.800> them<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.070> oven

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
because if you bake them in the oven

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.550 
because if you bake them in the oven
with<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.550> M&amp;M<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.240> then<00:02:37.480> basically<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
with the M&amp;M on it then basically the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.050 
with the M&amp;M on it then basically the
collar<00:02:38.800> will<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.220> melt<00:02:39.430> right<00:02:39.490> off<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.790> them

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
collar will just melt right off of them

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.830 
collar will just melt right off of them
onto<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.450> cookie<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.700> also<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.940> M&amp;Ms<00:02:43.660> will

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
onto the cookie and also the M&amp;Ms will

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.590 
onto the cookie and also the M&amp;Ms will
tend<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.110> crack<00:02:44.410> when<00:02:44.560> they're<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.890> oven

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
tend to crack when they're in the oven

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.970 
tend to crack when they're in the oven
so<00:02:46.600> that's<00:02:46.810> why<00:02:46.990> it's<00:02:47.170> best<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.470> wait<00:02:47.650> until

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
so that's why it's best to wait until

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.020 
so that's why it's best to wait until
after<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.060> take<00:02:49.240> them<00:02:49.390> out<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.940> once<00:02:51.940> you

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
after you take them out and once you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.720 
after you take them out and once you
take<00:02:52.090> them<00:02:52.300> out<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:53.130> like<00:02:54.130> it's<00:02:54.280> best<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.580> do

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
take them out then like it's best to do

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.190 
take them out then like it's best to do
it<00:02:54.760> right<00:02:54.970> when<00:02:55.090> they<00:02:55.180> come<00:02:55.360> out<00:02:55.510> because<00:02:55.570> that

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
it right when they come out because that

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.350 
it right when they come out because that
way<00:02:56.350> they're<00:02:56.530> still<00:02:56.740> soft<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.240> can

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
way they're still soft and you can

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.720 
way they're still soft and you can
actually<00:02:58.510> push<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.170> M&amp;Ms<00:02:59.890> down<00:03:00.100> inside<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
actually push the M&amp;Ms down inside of it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.600 
actually push the M&amp;Ms down inside of it
but<00:03:01.770> yeah<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.100> what<00:03:03.220> they<00:03:03.340> should<00:03:03.370> look

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
but yeah this is what they should look

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.480 
but yeah this is what they should look
like<00:03:03.640> when<00:03:03.880> they<00:03:03.940> come<00:03:04.120> out<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:05.250> yeah<00:03:06.250> they're

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
like when they come out and yeah they're

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.979 
like when they come out and yeah they're
