 to install the drivers for our 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.670

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.429
 moment to connect it to our pc in 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.530
 Sometimes they do not detect them, they do not install us 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.140
 correctly our drivers 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.830

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.290
 when we want to be where we should 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.169
 appear on this side of here in it with 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.030

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.880

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.890

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.890
