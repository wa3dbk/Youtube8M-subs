00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.000
 every cell has inside 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.130
 different compartments that one 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.810
 plastic reticulum or in short he is 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.990
 such an important reaction 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.669
 eukaryotes speak animal and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.349
 Plant cells of the cell nucleus stands 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.560
 in direct connection with him over 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.750
 its nuclear envelope and its core pores 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.710
 Here, the membrane decides directly 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:44.940
 its over pipes and bubbles hold 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.809
 this one and also includes high ceilings 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.190
 that a plastic regulation is 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.500
 so a branched tube system 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.530
 which is characterized by the bulk of the tito 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.420
 placements the cell pulls doing 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.000
 It is about half of the total membrane 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.030
 Crowd of a chaotic cell from it 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.800
 There are two types of him on the one hand 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.330
 the rough and the smooth one 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.920
 pragmatic reticulum which 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.960
 to perform different tasks 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.200
 the rough a pragmatic reticulum 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 carries ribosomes at the membrane dna 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.810
 Copies so-called mrs will be out 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 transports the kernel cytoplasm 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.880
 subsequently with the aid of ribosomes in the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.579
 room to be transported 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.530
 They become critical proteins 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.450
 educated 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.729
 this requires the protein chain ins 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.799
 Inner endoplasmic reticulum 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.079
 it will be infiltrated and will be there 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.299
 the template folded correctly mature 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.520
 proteins subsequently leave him 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.890
 about huge at first the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.070
 compartments golgi apparatus 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.070
 to be transported 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.630
 depending on which tissue or 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.969
 Organs are the cell component 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.320
 the composition of space and smooth 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.450
 be very different 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.520
 For example, the kidneys count 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.289
 or the liver or the primary 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.909
 genitals very much smooth he 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.479
 because it performs different tasks than 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.829
 the rough he 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:13.260
 so for example with the help of 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:15.450
 Smooth first formed steroid hormones and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.470
 vital lipids synthesized 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.819
 rather 10 , the smooth he is important for 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.819
 the carbohydrate metabolism over 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.310
 glycogen 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.760
 and in addition there are poisons and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.760
 medications degraded 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.099
 we will not become the muscle cells either 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.200
 millions saved by their 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.939
 The muscle contraction is released 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.209
 Yes it is then initiated 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.209
