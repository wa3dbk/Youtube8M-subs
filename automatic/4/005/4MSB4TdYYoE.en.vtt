00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.280

oh man this is a good fight actually I'm

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:53.149 
oh man this is a good fight actually I'm
pretty<00:01:22.510> happy<00:01:22.690> it's<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.350> close

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.710 

like<00:01:54.159> how<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.700> matched<00:01:55.060> still<00:01:55.299> not<00:01:55.420> over<00:01:57.720> we

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
like how is it matched still not over we

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.649 
like how is it matched still not over we
have<00:01:58.960> more<00:01:59.200> kills

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
have more kills

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
have more kills
huh<00:02:02.659> is<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.020> over<00:02:04.409> time<00:02:04.909> for<00:02:05.909> whatever

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
huh is this like over time for whatever

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.029 
huh is this like over time for whatever
reason<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.780> cuz<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.109> close<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.770> think

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
reason is it cuz it's so close I think

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.479 
reason is it cuz it's so close I think
it's<00:02:08.190> because<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.550> still<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.360> close<00:02:09.509> and

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
it's because it's still really close and

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.650 
it's because it's still really close and
there's<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> threshold<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.299> needs<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
there's like a threshold that needs to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:24.399 
there's like a threshold that needs to
be<00:02:12.690> crossed<00:02:13.019> before

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.780 

this<00:02:25.409> is<00:02:25.530> gonna<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:26.040> literally<00:02:26.459> go<00:02:26.760> on

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
this is gonna like literally go on

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:52.910 
this is gonna like literally go on
forever

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.009 

this<00:02:53.920> isn't<00:02:54.250> gonna<00:02:54.370> end<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:55.569> isn't<00:02:55.900> gonna

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
this isn't gonna end this isn't gonna

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.410 
this isn't gonna end this isn't gonna
end<00:02:56.129> we're<00:02:57.129> just<00:02:57.159> gonna<00:02:57.579> keep<00:02:57.819> on<00:02:58.030> fighting

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
end we're just gonna keep on fighting

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.929 
end we're just gonna keep on fighting
because<00:02:58.689> even<00:02:59.170> though<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.439> timer's<00:02:59.890> up<00:03:00.129> we

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
because even though the timer's up we

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.699 
because even though the timer's up we
still<00:03:01.659> need<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:02.110> still<00:03:02.349> have<00:03:02.439> a<00:03:02.470> kill

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
still need that we still have a kill

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.199 
still need that we still have a kill
threshold<00:03:03.189> to<00:03:03.310> meet<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.700> we're<00:03:04.360> not<00:03:04.480> gonna

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
threshold to meet and we're not gonna

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:15.089 
threshold to meet and we're not gonna
I'm<00:03:07.209> gonna<00:03:07.420> be<00:03:07.540> stuck<00:03:07.750> here<00:03:07.780> forever
