00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.629
 I missed the time when it was possible 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.180
 find a less dangerous road but to 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.540
 Sorry someone already ordered places 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.379
 on me and all that I had children and 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.199
 go for a call I forgot my sins 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.390
 didn't move forward 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.949
 I fill the chest of the mist country I tried 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 look through this veil 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.979
 to find the right direction but its not 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.080
 was and go on 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.479
 cheering myself though gradually could 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.720
 I probably would have absorbed people 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.170
 scared man st gone but i was not afraid 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570
 of this 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.750
 and continue 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.750
 squeezing 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.579
 on the lake thousands of sparks stretching to 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.789
 setting sun 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:30.090
 the sight was amazing but not beauty 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.729
 the lake is not the bright colors of the sky not even 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.729
 the shadows looming on the city did not worry 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.000
 his jack was standing on the observation deck and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.219
 nervously smoked he came to this resort 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.709
 town with his son on 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.469
 short vacation leave failed 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.520
 the city was completely empty around 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.369
 ruin reigned 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.750
 but they kept going and stopped 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.659
 only at a cheap hotel 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.360
 I wish I didn’t do this 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.090
 blame yourself miserable father inside too 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.329
 there was no one all the phones were silent 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.039
 centimeter layers in the rooms were like 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.009
 as if nobody has been here for many years 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 the night came into its own and they had to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.250
 spend the night in that hotel and the next morning jack 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.470
 found a note dad i walk a little 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.160
 don't worry come back in an hour 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.500
 chris and he didn't worry his son was 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.109
 adult independent person but 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.060
 when it was half past ten 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.690
 acres has not returned jack could not 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.560
 wait more 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.310
 he left a response note chris I left 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.260
 look for you 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.300
 if you come back before me wait here 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.390
 do not go anywhere 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.060
 well that Mary did not go with us to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.580
 relief muttered jack thing 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.290
 how even to have heard that they 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.060
 gathered instead of an expensive resort 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.580
 go to a quiet town 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.320
 even with a good view of the lake that 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.010
 flatly refused to let go with them 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.810
 children but Chris supported the opinion of the father and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.230
 in defiance of the mother went with him and here 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.960
 little mari I didn't probably lie 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.680
 yourself now basking in the sun and I 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.680
 stuck here 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.530
 damn it pulled me here and where 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.750
 now the rats budget finished smoking 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.240
 crusts to the nearest urn and went to 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.230
 direction of the hotel for the day he walked 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.300
 almost the whole town 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.150
 several times returned to the hotel 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.760
 did the son check but didn’t 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.790
 there were now apartments in which 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.710
 they stopped were empty only here 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.000
 a note that a caring father left 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.210
 did not have 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.730
 chris called his son's father no answer 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.950
 followed he walked on empty 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.770
 rooms and in one of them found 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.989
 backpack of rice he used to be here but 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.900
 now it has been opened content 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.120
 scattered around the room who was here at 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.700
 the rats probably wouldn't go away again 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.459
 for no reason means either something happened 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.850
 either there was someone else you need something 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.010
 do 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.189
 jack went to his room 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.709
 pulled out a suitcase and began to live with things here 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.840
 he came from the depths of a suitcase 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.629
 marching lantern on the street already quite 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.959
 all dark lake began to pull languages 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.269
 mist the air became gray probably worth it 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.530
 grab the hill where are you cross 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.299
 from time to time his cries in the name of his son 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.780
 jack kept walking through thick fog 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.419
 where could you even go when he 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.240
 rummaged in the pockets a small brochure in 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.720
 hands told about all 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.180
 small sights 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.520
 town and on the front page adorned 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.800
 photos of the historical society these brochures 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.229
 they took from the kiosk at the entrance when 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.030
 only arrived in salt hill said 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.580
 that it will be necessary to go there 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.310
 there may be other ideas he was not 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.020
 had these what happened here 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.350
 why all the people left 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.120
 ahead heard the steps of chris is you 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.550
 no answer 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.639
 cross steps in the fog became audible 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.949
 clearer walking was approaching eyes 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.139
 involuntarily tensed trying 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.900
 drill tamara heart wildly 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.470
 beat when this thing came out 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.430
 what the hell come on move like lame 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.430
 on both legs 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.650
 lightly clawed creature on asphalt 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.110
 there was no hands and no face monster 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.740
 moved by a clear threat aiming at 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.780
 dtsat take him man do not come 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.300
 people stood still and being 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.060
 pursed her legs and in one leap overtook 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.250
 the claws dug into the chest, but the gift 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.990
 the land deprived of consciousness further only 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.760
 darkness 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.730
 Awakening was not a pleasant head 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.190
 the remnants of fear memory was sick in the soul 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.560
 vaguely waking up looked at 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.350
 night and fog 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.200
 next was a flashlight in his 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.170
 the light was a pool of blood and evenly divided 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.900
 the blood was black 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.000
 old but quite reliable to become 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.670
 turned hard dull pain in the head 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.510
 it was given the head and fought from inside to 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.000
 skull wall 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.580
 the shirt and jacket were soaked in blood 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.610
 then a reminder came that 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.880
 happened me someone saved korres 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.160
 it was you why you leave again what 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.770
 hell is darkness going on here 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.680
 the cities no longer scared the opposite 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.530
 monella wander the streets listening attentively to 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.840
 jack sounds raised a flashlight dedicated to 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.410
 to the sides but there was nothing else around 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.920
 empty street nothing and no one perhaps 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.930
 it was more important I think it will come in handy 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.760
 ax found new owner door 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.000
 Historical Society was opened 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.790
 inside it was dark and quiet not to go 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.190
 but I had shreds on the walls 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.030
 mildew smell rot put on 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.370
 exhausted brain 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.560
 causing him to draw pictures and 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.300
 slowly and silently wandering in the dark 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.520
 dead before 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.560
 hands are trembling and their muscles can again 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.050
 prove to be paralyzed by fear the most 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.270
 inopportune moment jed went on gave 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.090
 wait for the building turning from one 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.520
 corridor to another called son but no one 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.289
 did not respond can you not here 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.199
 there was no hope left 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:10.169
 he was going to leave but suddenly somewhere 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:12.569
 near the door slammed chris is 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:15.720
 you are careful walking down the hall 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:17.610
 putting out the ax for hitting jack continued 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.819
 convince yourself that everything will be fine but 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.479
 his hopes did not come true he entered 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:26.009
 at the open door and saw how his son 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:30.240
 bent over the lifeless body on the floor 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:33.169
 coming closer jack realized what was looking at 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.169
 your own corpse
