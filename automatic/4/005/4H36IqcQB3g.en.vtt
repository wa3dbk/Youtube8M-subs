she<00:00:00.240> sort<00:00:00.420> of<00:00:00.510> questions<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.230> idea<00:00:01.589> that<00:00:01.650> why

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
she sort of questions this idea that why

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.940 
she sort of questions this idea that why
is<00:00:02.070> it<00:00:02.340> that<00:00:02.370> only<00:00:02.520> designers<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.950> architects

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
is it that only designers and architects

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.460 
is it that only designers and architects
get<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.089> learn<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.960> how<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.200> become

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.950 
get to learn about how to become
creative<00:00:08.010> problem<00:00:08.490> solvers<00:00:08.970> there's<00:00:09.750> this

creative problem solvers there's this

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.339 
creative problem solvers there's this
there's<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.410> certain<00:00:10.679> toolkit<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:12.540> everyone

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
there's a certain toolkit that everyone

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.660 
there's a certain toolkit that everyone
should<00:00:13.559> learn<00:00:13.769> especially<00:00:14.250> when<00:00:14.549> they're

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
should learn especially when they're

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.359 
should learn especially when they're
young<00:00:14.910> about<00:00:15.690> how<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.960> see<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> problem<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.190> how

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
young about how to see a problem and how

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.220 
young about how to see a problem and how
to<00:00:17.430> figure<00:00:17.910> out<00:00:18.060> what<00:00:18.270> solutions<00:00:18.840> might<00:00:19.020> look

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
to figure out what solutions might look

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.279 
to figure out what solutions might look
like<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.680> then<00:00:19.770> how<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.840> sort<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.930> design

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
like and then how to sort of design

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.570 
like and then how to sort of design
those<00:00:22.560> solutions<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.310> then<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.550> to

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
those solutions and then how to

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.660 
those solutions and then how to
implement<00:00:24.000> those<00:00:24.330> solutions<00:00:25.369> she<00:00:26.369> thought

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
implement those solutions she thought

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.820 
implement those solutions she thought
you<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:27.810> someone<00:00:28.230> ever<00:00:28.320> gives<00:00:28.590> me<00:00:28.710> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the six i'm adequately so yeah so six

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.520 
the six i'm adequately so yeah so six
sides<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:27.150> designer<00:01:27.390> coordinate<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
sides of designer coordinate so one of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.780 
sides of designer coordinate so one of
the<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> things<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.400> they<00:01:29.579> teach

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the one of the things that they teach

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
the one of the things that they teach
the<00:01:30.000> kids<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> class<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> film<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the kids in the class in the film is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.530 
the kids in the class in the film is
that<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:33.619> there<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.770> six<00:01:35.189> steps<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:36.090> design

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that that there are six steps of design

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
that that there are six steps of design
thinking<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.590> then<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.829> these<00:01:38.130> six

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
thinking and that then that these six

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
thinking and that then that these six
steps<00:01:38.640> could<00:01:39.119> help<00:01:39.540> anyone<00:01:39.869> no<00:01:39.990> matter<00:01:40.020> what

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
steps could help anyone no matter what

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.630 
steps could help anyone no matter what
no<00:01:40.590> matter<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.860> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.040> work<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
no matter what kind of work they do and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.530 
no matter what kind of work they do and
the<00:01:42.270> six<00:01:42.570> steps<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:44.990> research<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.790> then<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.030> d8

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the six steps are research and then I d8

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
the six steps are research and then I d8
or<00:01:48.869> that's<00:01:49.799> basically<00:01:50.220> throwing<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.700> bunch<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
or that's basically throwing a bunch of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.249 
or that's basically throwing a bunch of

Lord<00:01:52.530> post-it<00:01:53.520> notes<00:01:55.070> develop<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> take

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
Lord post-it notes develop so you take

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
Lord post-it notes develop so you take
all<00:01:57.210> those<00:01:57.360> ideas<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.350> kind<00:01:58.920> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
all those ideas and then you kind of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
all those ideas and then you kind of
zero<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.149> couple<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.659> them<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.140> figure

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
zero in on a couple of them and figure

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.429 
zero in on a couple of them and figure
out<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.490> might<00:02:02.700> might<00:02:03.000> look<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.439> as

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
out what they might might look like as

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.130 
out what they might might look like as
you<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.890> develop<00:02:05.130> them<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:06.390> your

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you as you develop them and then your

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.479 
you as you develop them and then your
next<00:02:07.409> step<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.250> prototype<00:02:09.179> something<00:02:10.489> in

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
next step is to prototype something in

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.339 
next step is to prototype something in
many<00:02:12.030> cases<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.599> means<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:12.930> building<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
many cases that means like building a

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.890 
many cases that means like building a
little<00:02:13.470> mom

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
little mom

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.600 
little mom
of<00:02:14.079> something<00:02:14.530> or<00:02:14.769> doing<00:02:15.129> like<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.400> more

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
of something or doing like a more

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.420 
of something or doing like a more
fleshed<00:02:15.909> out<00:02:16.060> drawing<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.159> has

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
fleshed out drawing and then that has

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.729 
fleshed out drawing and then that has
gotten<00:02:18.819> prototyping<00:02:19.599> has<00:02:19.989> gotten<00:02:20.349> way<00:02:20.500> less

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
gotten prototyping has gotten way less

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.309 
gotten prototyping has gotten way less
expensive<00:02:21.400> absolutely<00:02:22.299> that's<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.720> 3d

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
expensive absolutely that's the 3d

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.729

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
printing revolution absolutely the fifth

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.240 
printing revolution absolutely the fifth
step<00:02:27.189> is<00:02:27.599> refining<00:02:28.599> so<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.290> take<00:02:29.620> your<00:02:29.829> model

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
step is refining so you take your model

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.059 
step is refining so you take your model
or<00:02:30.519> your<00:02:30.730> your<00:02:31.569> first<00:02:31.840> attempt<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.620> kind

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
or your your first attempt and you kind

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.890 
or your your first attempt and you kind
of<00:02:33.129> rework<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.700> oftentimes<00:02:34.269> throw<00:02:34.689> it<00:02:34.810> away

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
of rework it oftentimes throw it away

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.319 
of rework it oftentimes throw it away
and<00:02:35.019> start<00:02:35.170> over<00:02:35.470> again<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.819> once<00:02:37.150> you've

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
and start over again and once you've

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.929 
and start over again and once you've
gone<00:02:37.569> through<00:02:37.629> all<00:02:37.959> five<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.739> those<00:02:39.159> steps<00:02:39.579> and

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
gone through all five of those steps and

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.910 
gone through all five of those steps and
those<00:02:40.629> steps<00:02:40.900> by<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.140> way<00:02:41.319> sometimes<00:02:41.709> good

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
those steps by the way sometimes good

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.800 
those steps by the way sometimes good
you<00:02:42.310> sometimes<00:02:42.730> go<00:02:42.819> back<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> step<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.659> then

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
you sometimes go back a step and then

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.000 
you sometimes go back a step and then
forward<00:02:44.109> a<00:02:44.230> step<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:44.560> then<00:02:44.620> back<00:02:44.799> another

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
forward a step and then back another

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.729 
forward a step and then back another
step<00:02:45.310> it's<00:02:45.700> sort<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.150> circular<00:02:46.690> process<00:02:47.200> if

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
step it's sort of a circular process if

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.920 
step it's sort of a circular process if
you<00:02:47.829> will<00:02:48.010> but<00:02:48.639> the<00:02:48.790> final<00:02:49.180> step<00:02:49.389> is<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.690> build

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
you will but the final step is to build

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.099 
you will but the final step is to build
it<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.379> and<00:02:51.250> what<00:02:51.579> matt<00:02:51.879> says<00:02:52.299> matt<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.079> the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
it and and what matt says matt is the

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.319 
it and and what matt says matt is the
other<00:02:53.379> teacher<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.099> film<00:02:54.370> Emily's

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
other teacher in the film Emily's

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.289 
other teacher in the film Emily's
partner<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.989> what<00:02:56.829> he<00:02:57.069> says<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.120> film

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
partner and what he says in the film

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.740 
partner and what he says in the film
which<00:02:58.480> just<00:02:58.750> really<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.409> just<00:02:59.709> sticks<00:03:00.220> with<00:03:00.340> me

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
which just really it just sticks with me

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.080 
which just really it just sticks with me
that<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.769> best<00:03:03.010> design<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.730> world

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
that the best design in the world

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.410 
that the best design in the world
doesn't<00:03:04.540> mean<00:03:04.840> anything<00:03:05.849> until<00:03:06.849> you've<00:03:07.060> built

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
doesn't mean anything until you've built

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.050 
doesn't mean anything until you've built
it<00:03:07.629> and<00:03:07.810> you've<00:03:08.530> put<00:03:08.889> it<00:03:09.010> out<00:03:09.129> there<00:03:09.459> yep<00:03:09.879> and

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
it and you've put it out there yep and

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.830 
it and you've put it out there yep and
see<00:03:10.659> if<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.870> works<00:03:11.109> or<00:03:11.260> not<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.909> I<00:03:12.909> think<00:03:13.569> that

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
see if it works or not and I think that

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.440 
see if it works or not and I think that
that's<00:03:14.189> where<00:03:15.189> the<00:03:15.280> real<00:03:15.310> value<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.299> this

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
that's where the real value is in this

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.289 
that's where the real value is in this
kind<00:03:16.689> of<00:03:16.750> an<00:03:16.870> education<00:03:17.699> so<00:03:18.699> whether<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
kind of an education so whether it's the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.069 
kind of an education so whether it's the
makers<00:03:19.599> movement<00:03:20.139> or<00:03:20.349> STEM<00:03:20.799> education<00:03:22.079> stem
