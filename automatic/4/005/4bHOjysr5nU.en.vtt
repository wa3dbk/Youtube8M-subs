now if you don't know how to get the
dryer<00:00:22.849> down<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:23.330> point<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:23.749> just<00:00:23.960> made<00:00:24.079> a

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
dryer down to this point I just made a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.489 
dryer down to this point I just made a
video<00:00:24.289> on<00:00:24.769> how<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.810> you<00:00:26.810> know<00:00:26.839> basically<00:00:27.320> break

once<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.230> get<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:34.250> dryer<00:00:34.490> taken<00:00:34.820> apart<00:00:35.060> and

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
once you get the dryer taken apart and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.480 
once you get the dryer taken apart and
after<00:00:36.650> you've<00:00:36.770> discovered<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:37.310> have<00:00:37.430> a

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
after you've discovered you have a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.310 
after you've discovered you have a
broken<00:00:37.760> belt<00:00:38.000> there's<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.870> few<00:00:39.020> things<00:00:39.200> you

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
broken belt there's a few things you

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.570 
broken belt there's a few things you
want<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:39.530> check<00:00:39.710> because<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.040> might<00:00:40.190> might

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
want to check because it might might

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.680 
want to check because it might might
have<00:00:40.670> been<00:00:40.790> something<00:00:41.030> inside<00:00:41.330> the<00:00:41.450> dryer

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
have been something inside the dryer

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.690 
have been something inside the dryer
that<00:00:41.900> caused<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.290> belt<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:42.560> break<00:00:42.740> so<00:00:43.610> the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
that caused the belt to break so the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.580 
that caused the belt to break so the
first<00:00:43.880> thing<00:00:44.030> we're<00:00:44.150> going<00:00:44.240> to<00:00:44.300> check<00:00:44.540> are<00:00:45.140> the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
first thing we're going to check are the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.710 
first thing we're going to check are the
rollers<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.220> that's<00:00:46.940> these<00:00:47.240> things<00:00:47.540> on<00:00:47.660> the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
rollers and that's these things on the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.340 
rollers and that's these things on the
back<00:00:47.900> here<00:00:48.170> that<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.040> tub<00:00:49.220> rides<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:50.350> the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
back here that the tub rides on the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.590 
back here that the tub rides on the
nation's<00:00:51.680> been<00:00:51.970> pretty<00:00:52.970> freely<00:00:53.240> now<00:00:53.480> these

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
nation's been pretty freely now these

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.670 
nation's been pretty freely now these
are<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:53.810> little<00:00:53.930> stiff<00:00:54.260> because<00:00:54.500> they're

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
are a little stiff because they're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.610 
are a little stiff because they're
rusted<00:00:55.490> this<00:00:55.670> was<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.880> flooded<00:00:56.810> dryer<00:00:57.080> so<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:57.440> had

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
rusted this was a flooded dryer so I had

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.720 
rusted this was a flooded dryer so I had
to<00:00:57.710> break<00:00:57.860> those<00:00:58.070> free<00:00:58.340> with<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.520> pair<00:00:58.700> of

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
to break those free with a pair of

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.500 
to break those free with a pair of
pliers<00:00:58.880> but<00:00:59.620> they<00:01:00.620> would<00:01:00.800> need<00:01:00.980> replace<00:01:01.510> these

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
pliers but they would need replace these

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.689 
pliers but they would need replace these
should<00:01:02.690> spin<00:01:02.960> on<00:01:03.080> their<00:01:03.200> own<00:01:03.610> for<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.670> couple

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
should spin on their own for a couple

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.940 
should spin on their own for a couple
turns<00:01:05.439> and<00:01:06.439> that's<00:01:06.560> how<00:01:06.679> you<00:01:06.740> know<00:01:06.859> they're

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
turns and that's how you know they're

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.099 
turns and that's how you know they're
good<00:01:07.159> if<00:01:07.789> they're<00:01:08.210> pretty<00:01:08.359> stiff<00:01:08.749> like<00:01:08.929> these

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
good if they're pretty stiff like these

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.580 
good if they're pretty stiff like these
ones<00:01:09.320> are<00:01:09.759> that'll<00:01:10.759> cause<00:01:10.909> extra<00:01:11.270> friction<00:01:11.590> on

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
ones are that'll cause extra friction on

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.830 
ones are that'll cause extra friction on
the<00:01:12.799> belt<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.189> cause<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.670> belt<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:14.090> basically

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
the belt and cause the belt to basically

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.050 
the belt and cause the belt to basically
wear<00:01:15.020> out<00:01:15.170> before<00:01:15.499> it<00:01:15.590> needs<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:16.060> another

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
wear out before it needs to another

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.289 
wear out before it needs to another
common<00:01:17.509> one<00:01:17.689> is<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.350> idler<00:01:18.679> pulley<00:01:18.939> and<00:01:19.939> it

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
common one is the idler pulley and it

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.800 
common one is the idler pulley and it
should<00:01:20.420> also<00:01:20.689> spin<00:01:20.990> freely<00:01:22.359> with<00:01:23.359> the<00:01:23.390> turn<00:01:23.659> of

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
should also spin freely with the turn of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.239 
should also spin freely with the turn of
the<00:01:23.869> finger<00:01:24.229> now<00:01:24.619> when<00:01:24.770> there's<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:25.009> little

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
the finger now when there's a little

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.399 
the finger now when there's a little
stiff<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:25.789> you<00:01:26.479> would<00:01:26.630> want<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:26.899> replace<00:01:26.990> that

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
stiff so you would want to replace that

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.870 
stiff so you would want to replace that
one<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:27.619> should<00:01:27.799> do<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.979> couple<00:01:28.310> turns<00:01:28.460> on<00:01:28.729> its

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
one I should do a couple turns on its

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.020 
one I should do a couple turns on its
own<00:01:29.770> when<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:30.920> miss<00:01:31.700> penny

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
own when you miss penny

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.370 
own when you miss penny
you<00:01:32.270> can<00:01:32.389> try<00:01:32.569> cleaning<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.990> lint<00:01:33.170> out<00:01:33.319> of

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
you can try cleaning the lint out of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.950 
you can try cleaning the lint out of
them<00:01:33.770> sometimes<00:01:34.549> that<00:01:34.759> works<00:01:34.969> and<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:35.929> know

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
them sometimes that works and you know

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.069 
them sometimes that works and you know
prolongs<00:01:36.469> your<00:01:36.590> life<00:01:36.829> a<00:01:37.009> little<00:01:37.159> bit<00:01:37.369> but

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
prolongs your life a little bit but

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.239 
prolongs your life a little bit but
those<00:01:39.079> are<00:01:39.229> major<00:01:39.409> things<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.859> want<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.069> check

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
those are major things you want to check

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.969 
those are major things you want to check
right<00:01:40.429> there<00:01:40.670> or<00:01:41.359> you<00:01:42.079> know<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.409> some<00:01:42.619> cases

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
right there or you know in some cases

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
right over top - this is gonna go around

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.700 
right over top - this is gonna go around
one<00:04:47.400> side<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.930> is<00:04:49.050> going<00:04:49.199> to<00:04:49.259> go<00:04:49.379> around<00:04:49.470> the

one side this is going to go around the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.770 
one side this is going to go around the
other<00:04:49.849> and<00:04:50.849> that's<00:04:51.300> what<00:04:51.449> its<00:04:51.599> gonna<00:04:51.690> look

like when it's up top this is going up

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.379 
like when it's up top this is going up
one<00:04:53.849> side<00:04:54.560> that's<00:04:55.560> going<00:04:55.740> up<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.979> other<00:04:56.099> side
