 shooting goods on the road and wella 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.360

 Hello, another package from China 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.200
 This package should be robots in fish 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.480
 sharks in the amount of four pieces on 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.320
 time of order is not worth 410 rubles 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.010
 the parcel went 24 days 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.010
 let's open and watch 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:57.790
 the seller as we see took care of 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 packaged everything well enough 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.870
 pimply film 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.130
 See even a screwdriver in the kit. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.630
 I already ordered similar fisherman 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.620
 about six months ago probably there 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.320
 what else is there in my opinion but the previous time 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.510
 no hard glasses included 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.870
 but there were spare batteries here 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:52.130
 as we see spare batteries there is no sleep 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:57.940
 shark gray red and green like that 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.650
 fish now take batteries put and 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:07.119
 then it will be possible to test by 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.119
 My battery here is generally looking 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.300
 let's sort one thing out there 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.300
 inside 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:22.940
 yes indeed there are no batteries 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.519
 Only contacts and some kind of sinker apparently 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.959
 can be adjusted to 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.730
 the fish swam on the bottom or on the surface 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.640
 I'll go buy batteries and then 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.750
 continue went to the store took 20 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.239
 battery powered 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.130
 we sell these batteries for 5 rubles each 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.870
 a piece 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.590
 Respectively for 20 batteries I gave 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.380
 100 rubles 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.160
 took a bit of margin because from 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.260
 two batteries 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.959
 one fish can swim somewhere 2-3 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.330
 hours then the batteries run out of them 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.140
 it is necessary to change therefore I took with 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.390
 stock note that everyone has 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.360
 there are fish in the battery compartment 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.950
 such a silicone gasket so that 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.570
 water inside the idea should not fall 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.370
 I will install now 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.799
 batteries and after that we can 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.239
 to test 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.970
 when installing batteries no 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.470
 Difficulties did not arise in every fish I 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.920
 put on two batteries plus to the top 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:32.630
 closed their lids 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:44.310
 and twisted the bandages all the fish turned out 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:48.440
 working blue red gray green out 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.019
 gray and green I took out these weights 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.360
 to compare how fish with weights 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.430
 will swim without them for 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.459
 investing i'm taking advantage of the sink 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.700
 with water first run what with 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.690
 weights they are supposed to swim 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:17.910
 somewhere near the bottom and now I run a folder 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:20.489
 from which I took out the weights in my opinion 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.380
 in the sink sharks without weights swim 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.240
 much more interesting to repel with 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.370
 weights probably have all the same 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:35.700
 fill important here so how will 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.900
 swim in the bathtub without those who Guzik 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.680
 naturally float on the surface 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.640
 full with weights 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.060
 scratch somewhere under the feet previous time 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.919
 I took here such fish principle works 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.190
 absolutely the same 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.550
 the only thing that these fish do not have 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.789
 weights that is they swim mostly 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.100
 on the price surface and legs are very 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:07.050
 Liked so I decided to order more 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.210
 I will test passed successfully sharks 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.880
 turned out to be a working link to the seller 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.130
 as usual in the video description on this 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.250
 all like it subscribe to
