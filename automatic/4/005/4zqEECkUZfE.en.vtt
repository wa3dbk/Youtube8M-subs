00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.540
 democratic suffocation is fantastic and 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.710
 we participate in the first team we count here we have to collect 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.129
 we are here either 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.219
 the fantastic idea room and gather all the breeding programs 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:16.419
 what is the future 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.729
 DodÃ´ livestock work is the genetic evaluation 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 I discovered the performance we can improve 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.890
 includes several races giving 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.769
 and it's very important 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.170
 important is also to urge them to exchange ideas with you spoke with several 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.510
 producers of teams behind the country bringing information 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.999
 What's going on right now? 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.820
 from the summary of bulls information 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.330
 of the shock farms that are happening them every year 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.310
 and finally to be here and saw the animal of our 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.930
 who participates in the breeding program 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.700
 But it has to be 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.650
 participated 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.650
 if by the goal of the first cd lagoon was featured 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.370
 what proves here 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.510
 the animal 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.590
 I did not schedule the workers 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.850
 everywhere 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.460
 will show 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.040
 the grandmother of the animal that left the house next door 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.060
 participated in the seven 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.510
 The reason was because I was here. 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.660
 and today is here in uberaba 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.130
 on the berber track 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 showing all evolution 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.730
 in 18 months already had leaked and today before the 36 months already have products 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.730
 in four months dinaci in the property 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.900
 edgar if we work for grandson we believe this 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.970
 So this year we will be here for three years. 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.100
 and the result of this is a product like the emperor 13 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.840
 it leaves the program a great job 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.530
 our planning 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 go to a test 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.899
 is featured 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.509
 already producing progeny 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.219
 at new age with no age 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.219
 this accelerates the selection process if we 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:22.149
 early is so discovering which are the best animals that are 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.129
 giving result is being we have to believe a work of improvement 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.409
 much less probable 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.689
 and optimize 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.769
 It's the animals or whatever. 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.209
 avoiding also isolating the youngest animals and the sooner 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.229
 in recent years the bun 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.109
 It's when this animal 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.109
 It's Aunt confirming this, we're already 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.340
 looking with the animals that this one is already already part of our work
