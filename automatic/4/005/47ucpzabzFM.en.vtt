climate change theory and they do this

anything<00:01:31.670> else<00:01:31.909> they<00:01:32.090> turn<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.630> claim<00:01:33.049> it's

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
anything else they turn and claim it's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.490 
anything else they turn and claim it's
caused<00:01:33.500> by<00:01:33.909> temperature<00:01:35.140> rising<00:01:36.140> when<00:01:36.350> it's

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
caused by temperature rising when it's

caused by temperature rising when it's
not<00:01:38.170> now<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:40.189> most<00:01:40.399> recent<00:01:40.820> event<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.210> the

not now the most recent event in the

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.160 
not now the most recent event in the
Arctic<00:01:41.719> was<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:43.450> large<00:01:44.450> area<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:47.170> low

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
Arctic was this large area of low

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.529 
Arctic was this large area of low
pressure<00:01:48.200> which<00:01:49.100> they<00:01:49.280> call<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.670> storm<00:01:50.270> but

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
pressure which they call the storm but

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.060 
pressure which they call the storm but
it<00:01:50.600> wasn't<00:01:50.990> really<00:01:51.170> it's<00:01:51.469> something<00:01:51.710> much

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
it wasn't really it's something much

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.340 
it wasn't really it's something much
bigger<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.789> it's<00:01:53.270> about<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.689> change<00:01:54.049> in

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
bigger and it's about to change in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.529 
bigger and it's about to change in
circulation<00:01:54.859> pattern<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:55.850> when<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.180> happened

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
circulation pattern so when it happened

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.959 
circulation pattern so when it happened
we<00:01:56.719> said<00:01:57.049> this<00:01:57.619> was<00:01:57.859> an<00:01:58.009> indicator<00:01:58.549> of<00:01:58.700> a

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
we said this was an indicator of a

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.539 
we said this was an indicator of a
general<00:01:59.359> circulation<00:01:59.570> change<00:02:00.380> which<00:02:01.070> is

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
general circulation change which is

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.219 
general circulation change which is
happening<00:02:02.240> as<00:02:02.439> part<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.590> our<00:02:03.770> prediction<00:02:04.429> of

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
happening as part of our prediction of

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.779 
happening as part of our prediction of
shifting<00:02:06.229> towards<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.799> little<00:02:07.070> ice<00:02:07.219> age<00:02:07.490> and

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
shifting towards a little ice age and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.570 
shifting towards a little ice age and
specifically<00:02:08.570> would<00:02:09.170> result<00:02:09.530> or<00:02:09.890> go<00:02:10.310> along

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
specifically would result or go along

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.990 
specifically would result or go along
with<00:02:10.789> Jetstream<00:02:11.510> going<00:02:11.900> further<00:02:12.200> south<00:02:13.000> what

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
with Jetstream going further south what

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.809 
with Jetstream going further south what
we<00:02:14.120> said<00:02:14.270> about<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.630> Jetstream<00:02:15.050> going<00:02:15.260> first

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
we said about the Jetstream going first

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.429 
we said about the Jetstream going first
was<00:02:16.599> confirmed<00:02:17.709> now<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.090> warmest<00:02:19.959> then<00:02:20.170> say

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
was confirmed now the warmest then say

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.110 
was confirmed now the warmest then say
oh<00:02:20.469> yeah<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.189> is<00:02:21.249> all<00:02:21.459> part<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.819> global

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
oh yeah this is all part of global

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.119 
oh yeah this is all part of global
warming<00:02:22.299> but<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:23.079> course<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.709> complete

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
warming but of course that is complete

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.309 
warming but of course that is complete
nonsense<00:02:24.370> because<00:02:24.819> their<00:02:25.269> own<00:02:25.420> textbooks<00:02:26.079> say

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
nonsense because their own textbooks say

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.429 
nonsense because their own textbooks say
that<00:02:26.950> jet<00:02:27.340> stream<00:02:27.730> moving<00:02:28.060> south<00:02:28.599> in<00:02:29.319> the

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
that jet stream moving south in the

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.490 
that jet stream moving south in the
northern<00:02:29.739> hemisphere<00:02:30.030> means<00:02:31.030> cooling<00:02:32.019> it<00:02:32.319> can

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
northern hemisphere means cooling it can

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.800 
northern hemisphere means cooling it can
mean<00:02:32.709> nothing<00:02:33.129> else<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:34.090> their<00:02:34.329> propaganda

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
mean nothing else so their propaganda

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.759 
mean nothing else so their propaganda

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
says warming is cooling this is absurd

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.309 
says warming is cooling this is absurd
right<00:02:41.769> now<00:02:42.959> let's<00:02:43.959> have<00:02:44.169> a<00:02:44.230> look<00:02:44.500> at<00:02:45.310> the

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
right now let's have a look at the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.500 
right now let's have a look at the
claims<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.799> detail<00:02:48.219> and<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:49.450> actual<00:02:50.049> facts

claims in detail and the actual facts

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.250 
claims in detail and the actual facts
they<00:02:52.510> claimed<00:02:52.989> that<00:02:53.859> now<00:02:54.419> we<00:02:55.419> had<00:02:55.659> less<00:02:55.989> ice

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
they claimed that now we had less ice

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.860 
they claimed that now we had less ice
than<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:58.319> records<00:02:59.319> over<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.620> last<00:02:59.859> 30<00:03:00.430> years

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.720 
than in records over the last 30 years
and<00:03:01.870> they<00:03:02.590> claimed<00:03:02.949> this<00:03:03.189> is<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.519> do<00:03:03.699> with

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
and they claimed this is to do with

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.920 
and they claimed this is to do with
man-made<00:03:04.569> carbon<00:03:04.900> dioxide<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:08.290> facts<00:03:08.829> are

man-made carbon dioxide the facts are

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.259 
man-made carbon dioxide the facts are
first<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.139> all<00:03:11.260> there's<00:03:12.040> actually<00:03:12.519> more<00:03:12.849> ice

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
first of all there's actually more ice

now according to the NOAA record system

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.009 
now according to the NOAA record system
US<00:03:17.230> official<00:03:17.799> records<00:03:18.189> more<00:03:18.760> ice<00:03:19.090> now<00:03:19.510> than

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
there was at the minimum of 2007 this is

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.770 
there was at the minimum of 2007 this is
what's<00:03:25.090> happening<00:03:25.389> now

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
what's happening now

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.569 
what's happening now
records<00:03:26.739> show<00:03:26.949> and<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.280> can<00:03:27.340> get<00:03:27.489> the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
records show and you can get the

than<00:03:31.659> 2007<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.949> claim<00:03:33.220> was<00:03:33.400> actually

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
than 2007 so the claim was actually

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.770 
than 2007 so the claim was actually
false<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.290> other<00:03:35.500> thing

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
false the other thing

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.530 
false the other thing
they<00:03:37.560> didn't<00:03:37.890> tell<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:40.459> this

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
they didn't tell you is that this

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.650 
they didn't tell you is that this
low-pressure<00:03:42.540> area<00:03:43.190> with<00:03:44.190> winds<00:03:44.610> on<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
low-pressure area with winds on the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.510 
low-pressure area with winds on the
surface<00:03:46.250> causes<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.459> ice<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.790> break<00:03:48.720> up<00:03:49.520> that

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
surface causes the ice to break up that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.470 
surface causes the ice to break up that
means<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.910> satellites<00:03:51.480> cannot<00:03:52.140> measure<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
means the satellites cannot measure the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.270 
means the satellites cannot measure the
ice<00:03:54.480> as<00:03:54.870> well<00:03:55.020> as<00:03:55.080> they<00:03:55.290> could<00:03:55.500> before<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
ice as well as they could before so the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.490 
ice as well as they could before so the
satellites<00:03:56.790> think<00:03:57.150> there's<00:03:57.660> less<00:03:57.870> ice<00:03:58.140> and

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
satellites think there's less ice and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.220 
satellites think there's less ice and
that<00:03:58.590> actually<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.970> their<00:04:00.480> records<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.140> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
that actually is so their records of the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.620 
that actually is so their records of the
arthur<00:04:01.590> map<00:04:01.739> anyway<00:04:02.459> are<00:04:02.760> false<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:05.630> when

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
arthur map anyway are false and when

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.900 
arthur map anyway are false and when
this<00:04:06.959> low<00:04:07.650> pressure<00:04:07.920> declines<00:04:08.520> they'll

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
this low pressure declines they'll

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.790 
this low pressure declines they'll
certainly<00:04:09.420> find<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.019> ice<00:04:10.170> sticking<00:04:10.650> back

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
certainly find the ice sticking back

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.920 
certainly find the ice sticking back
together<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.970> satellites<00:04:12.420> will<00:04:12.570> report

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
together and the satellites will report

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:21.159 
together and the satellites will report
more<00:04:13.440> ice<00:04:17.090> third<00:04:18.090> fact<00:04:19.220> they<00:04:20.220> claim<00:04:20.489> this

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
more ice third fact they claim this

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.130 
more ice third fact they claim this
low-pressure<00:04:22.169> area<00:04:22.770> is<00:04:23.160> is<00:04:23.640> somehow

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
low-pressure area is is somehow

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.830 
low-pressure area is is somehow
associated<00:04:25.280> with<00:04:26.280> warming<00:04:26.760> but<00:04:27.390> look<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.780> is

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
associated with warming but look this is

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.290
