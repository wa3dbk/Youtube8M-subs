 long and wide up to 180 and we 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.740
 it interests that they work as for 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.520
 propose dynamics instead of having 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.740
 a value as an object design itself 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.420

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.679
 the possibilities up to here 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.850
 they are simple and very practical designs and 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.160
 as well as this space serves for many 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.670
 things these structures can be 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.460
 banks or tables according to the occasion because 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.440
 other things can be done here to 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.300

 on Sundays we really do not have a 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.660
 filter rather than being viable and who 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.700
 you can do something here 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.250
 his philosophy is that establishments 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.250
 commercial should also work as 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.850
 public space and contribute something to the neighborhood 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.890
 where they are 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.810
 they look for places that go beyond what 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.270
 obvious this is a barragán building 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.070
 that was his first works in the 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.810
 Mexico City and it was all the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.060
 facade painted as purple with 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.370
 michoacana lyrics and we achieved with 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.680
 help from the owner of the building how 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.590
 restore the facade and repaint it 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.660
 and recover the original orange stone 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.020
 of the facade you are very interested in 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.080
 work with the neighborhood instead of with my 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.880
 friends our acquaintances or as some 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.500
 strategy of how relationships 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.500
 peaceful to pull people 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.040
