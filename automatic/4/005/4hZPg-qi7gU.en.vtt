give you a better sense of scale and it
looks<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.280> could<00:01:32.460> take<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:32.790> drill<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
looks like you could take that drill and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.020 
looks like you could take that drill and
almost<00:01:34.380> drill<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> hole<00:01:34.979> through<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.490> zero<00:01:35.760> in

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
almost drill a hole through the zero in

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.140 
almost drill a hole through the zero in
the<00:01:36.180> date<00:01:36.530> if<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.770> were<00:01:37.950> inclined<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.580> do<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the date if you were inclined to do that

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.680 
the date if you were inclined to do that
okay<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> digital<00:01:41.130> micrometer<00:01:42.090> set<00:01:42.540> up

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
okay I have a digital micrometer set up

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.280 
okay I have a digital micrometer set up
here<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> reads<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:45.020> units<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.229> ten

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
here and it reads in units of ten

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.160 
here and it reads in units of ten
thousandths<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> an<00:01:47.369> inch<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.880> last<00:01:48.170> zero

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
thousandths of an inch so this last zero

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.679 
thousandths of an inch so this last zero
here<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:50.130> ten<00:01:50.580> thousandths<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.270> an<00:01:51.390> inch

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
here is ten thousandths of an inch

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
here is ten thousandths of an inch
this<00:01:52.170> third<00:01:52.530> digit<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.040> thousandths<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.970> an

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
this third digit is thousandths of an

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.240 
this third digit is thousandths of an
inch<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.080> take<00:01:55.320> our<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.619> number<00:01:56.040> eighty

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
inch so I take our little number eighty

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.840 
inch so I take our little number eighty
drill<00:01:56.640> bit<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.920> put<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> anvil<00:01:59.460> here

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
drill bit and put it in the anvil here

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.179 
drill bit and put it in the anvil here
and<00:02:00.119> tighten<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.570> down<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.950> reads

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and tighten it down you can see it reads

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.760 
and tighten it down you can see it reads
just<00:02:02.490> about<00:02:02.869> thirteen<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.080> half<00:02:04.140> thousand

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just about thirteen and a half thousand

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
just about thirteen and a half thousand
s<00:02:04.830> which<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.040> its<00:02:05.490> nominal<00:02:05.939> size<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:08.750> when<00:02:09.750> we

s which is its nominal size so when we

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.830 
s which is its nominal size so when we
talking<00:02:10.319> about<00:02:10.439> a<00:02:11.299> thousandth<00:02:12.299> of<00:02:12.389> an<00:02:12.510> inch<00:02:12.599> on

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
talking about a thousandth of an inch on

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.379 
talking about a thousandth of an inch on
the<00:02:12.959> mini<00:02:13.169> lathe<00:02:13.439> we're<00:02:14.279> talking<00:02:14.700> about<00:02:14.849> one

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:15.389 
the mini lathe we're talking about one

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.890 
the mini lathe we're talking about one
thirteenth<00:02:16.049> of<00:02:16.319> that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
thirteenth of that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.750 
thirteenth of that
diameter<00:02:17.079> now<00:02:18.010> let's<00:02:18.220> take<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.459> piece<00:02:18.730> of

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
diameter now let's take a piece of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.539 
diameter now let's take a piece of
ordinary<00:02:19.269> household<00:02:19.810> aluminum<00:02:20.590> foil<00:02:20.920> kitchen

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
ordinary household aluminum foil kitchen

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.020 
ordinary household aluminum foil kitchen
foil<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.750> we'll<00:02:22.870> put<00:02:23.049> that<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.439> here<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:24.849> can

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
foil and we'll put that in here you can

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.440 
foil and we'll put that in here you can
see<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.450> measure<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.319> thickness<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:27.450> about

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
see that measure is a thickness of about

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.660 
see that measure is a thickness of about
eight<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.260> half<00:02:29.290> ten<00:02:29.860> thousandths<00:02:30.579> a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
eight and a half ten thousandths a

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.220 
eight and a half ten thousandths a
little<00:02:30.879> less<00:02:31.030> than<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.390> thousandth<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.959> an<00:02:32.079> inch

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
little less than a thousandth of an inch

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.860 
little less than a thousandth of an inch
so<00:02:33.159> these<00:02:33.730> are<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:33.970> kind<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.269> tolerances

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
so these are the kind of tolerances

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.720 
so these are the kind of tolerances
we're<00:02:35.019> talking<00:02:35.709> about<00:02:35.799> on<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.250> mini<00:02:36.430> label

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
we're talking about on the mini label

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.849 
we're talking about on the mini label
when<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:36.939> remove<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.599> thousandth<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.620> an<00:02:38.769> inch

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
when you remove a thousandth of an inch

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.710 
when you remove a thousandth of an inch
of<00:02:39.250> metal<00:02:39.870> that's<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.200> approximate<00:02:41.890> amount

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
of metal that's the approximate amount

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.300 
of metal that's the approximate amount
the<00:02:43.720> thickness<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.200> you're<00:02:44.650> talking<00:02:45.040> about

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the thickness that you're talking about

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.009 
the thickness that you're talking about
so<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.090> hope<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.390> gives<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.659> a<00:02:46.750> better<00:02:46.930> sense

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
so I hope that gives you a better sense

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.039 
so I hope that gives you a better sense
of<00:02:47.409> scale<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:49.150> precision<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> mini

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
lathe I have here a little workpiece I

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.789 
lathe I have here a little workpiece I
made<00:02:54.099> as<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.540> demonstration<00:02:55.540> in<00:02:55.959> another<00:02:56.409> video

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
made as a demonstration in another video

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.420 
made as a demonstration in another video
and<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:58.060> dimension<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.440> smaller

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
and the dimension of the smaller

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.339 
and the dimension of the smaller
diameter<00:03:00.670> here<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.269> supposed<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.629> be<00:03:01.810> 0.5<00:03:02.319> Oh

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
diameter here is supposed to be 0.5 Oh

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.520 
diameter here is supposed to be 0.5 Oh
according<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.370> my<00:03:03.519> plan<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.180> we'll<00:03:05.139> put<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.409> in

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
according to my plan and we'll put it in

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.619 
according to my plan and we'll put it in
the<00:03:05.739> micrometer<00:03:06.250> here<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.909> see<00:03:07.359> what<00:03:07.510> we

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
the micrometer here and see what we

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.599 
the micrometer here and see what we
measure<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:11.170> can<00:03:11.349> see<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:11.680> about<00:03:11.950> three<00:03:12.579> and

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
measure you can see it's about three and

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.319 
measure you can see it's about three and
a<00:03:12.790> half<00:03:12.819> ten<00:03:13.420> thousandths<00:03:14.049> over<00:03:14.349> this<00:03:15.329> last

a half ten thousandths over this last
digit<00:03:16.599> here<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:16.959> ten<00:03:17.260> thousandths<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.129> it's

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
digit here is ten thousandths so it's

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.900 
digit here is ten thousandths so it's
point<00:03:19.000> five<00:03:19.299> zero<00:03:19.569> three<00:03:19.780> five<00:03:20.639> about<00:03:21.639> three

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
half a thousandth so and this was not

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.900 
half a thousandth so and this was not
the<00:03:28.150> most<00:03:28.329> careful<00:03:28.810> work<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.709> can<00:03:30.010> do<00:03:30.190> it

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
the most careful work that I can do it

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.599 
the most careful work that I can do it
was<00:03:31.120> done<00:03:31.569> carefully<00:03:31.870> but<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:33.400> just

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
was done carefully but they just

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.259 
was done carefully but they just
retighten<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.299> anvil<00:03:34.629> there<00:03:34.780> now<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:36.269> five

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
retighten the anvil there now the five

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.849 
retighten the anvil there now the five
hundred<00:03:37.599> thousandths<00:03:38.109> there's<00:03:38.290> dropped<00:03:38.650> off

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
hundred thousandths there's dropped off

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.610 
hundred thousandths there's dropped off
but<00:03:39.159> you<00:03:39.699> can<00:03:39.879> see<00:03:40.060> it's<00:03:40.239> very<00:03:40.750> very<00:03:41.079> close<00:03:41.319> to

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
but you can see it's very very close to

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.530 
but you can see it's very very close to
within<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.280> tolerance<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.819> I<00:03:42.970> wanted<00:03:43.359> and
