release of Windows NT I think this is

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.210 
release of Windows NT I think this is

in fact we've overflowed the capacity of

the Moscone Center Windows NT is a very

the Moscone Center Windows NT is a very

safe set for the MIS community that is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.190 
safe set for the MIS community that is
because<00:04:46.190> it's<00:04:46.370> not<00:04:46.580> tied<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:47.750> any<00:04:47.900> particular

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
system that has the high-end features

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.830 
system that has the high-end features
they<00:05:46.310> need<00:05:46.520> as<00:05:46.760> well<00:05:47.270> as<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.510> wealth<00:05:47.690> of

they need as well as the wealth of
application<00:05:48.440> software<00:05:48.700> we've<00:05:49.700> really<00:05:50.240> built

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
application software we've really built

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.140 
application software we've really built
in<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:50.870> network<00:05:51.230> capability<00:05:52.130> into<00:05:52.400> NT

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
in the network capability into NT

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.200 
in the network capability into NT
interoperability<00:05:53.870> with<00:05:54.260> other<00:05:54.290> systems

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
interoperability with other systems

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.610 
interoperability with other systems
other<00:05:56.210> PC<00:05:56.750> networks<00:05:57.730> unique<00:05:58.730> systems<00:05:59.620> even

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
other PC networks unique systems even

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.320 
other PC networks unique systems even
connections<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:01.400> mainframes<00:06:01.850> and<00:06:02.000> whatever

connections to mainframes and whatever

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.360

so it's a system that will be able to

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.390 
so it's a system that will be able to
