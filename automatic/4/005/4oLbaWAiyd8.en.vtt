00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.039
 and in a new game mode that's what it's called 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.199
 the s the race is a war in general 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.699
 it's called stock car or something like that and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.740
 basically they tell us it's a new 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.930
 model that they have made and I do not know exactly 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.369
 how you play one at the moment it is 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.769
 doing well I think here jumping like 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.020
 carer who will be starting in 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.280
 administrative catch the point there is already a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.420
 increase the first thing is simply there 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.579
 to go catching as the points are 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.739
 here is how I had a madness 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.000
 no but it's not like chaos we're like 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.620
 next to someone he put rockets there 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.899
 everywhere and basically eye where 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.010
 I pick up here to serve so he called 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.410
 sixth we turn around here 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.150
 and we took the tour seen there was 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.940
 as first 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.730
 It seems easy but it is complicated but eye 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.750
 bus 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.750
 those strings say they have done 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.680
 in another point and eye because service 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.040
 vitality and how are you going to come out I think that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.810
 now you have to get out of the car or not 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.049
 I know for sure 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.060
 but as I've seen I think that if we go back 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.110
 to try to arrive running the goal that 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.750
 what you have thanks to this new 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.450
 career they have created to see the best 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.250
 around here quickly to see if he gives us 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.990
 time to arrive 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 without being killed and today I think there 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.830
 to leave here but I do not know why 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.150
 where I do not have even pajolera idea of 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.360
 where to go 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.130
 It will be me that I know 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.140
 around here to the best 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.689
 the clairvoyant account worker had 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.710
 the game really stand stand by me me 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.210
 precisely because I'm not sure if here 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.520
 is the little door to go out I say no 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.500
 you pass by here guys so ok and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.600
 now he hopes that because yes 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.600
 do not stay with your uncle car 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.090
 we have to get there running and eye 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.150
 because here you can roll brown here 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.130
 was rolling brown is far not the goal 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.880
 I know I do not have to run much much 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.360
 a lot of work but it's the skill of 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.250
 put clear traffic activated 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.870
 these points are even more five points 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.480
 more should have traffic activated 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.370
 guys is something that I forget and not 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800
 you can forget but well if now 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.140
 come on come on come on let's go here a good 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.670
 walk this boy that we have always 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.950
 ridden the car in the end I know what god 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.560
 We will raise the cholesterol both 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.860
 both be sitting and do not accept from 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.160
 army although they say that driving 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.010
 This exercise 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.700
 here 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.760
 there are 4 control points missing 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.739
 they are around here we are going to take 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.099
 the fast cameras and hours that fast 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.099
 this is done 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.750
 more ethical I just fell and it's that clear 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.410
 if I get a point and I appear I appear 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:25.630
 with the coach 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:28.310
 there is the delay the delay we have 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.760
 dreams 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.500
 the goal is to enter with style there 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.510
 well a proposal the favorite team for 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:44.440
 this one for this race is the truth 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.440
 when I play in a different new
