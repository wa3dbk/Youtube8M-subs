this<00:04:01.470> house<00:04:01.709> roughly<00:04:02.100> between<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.520> two

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
this house roughly between the two

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.610 
this house roughly between the two
installs<00:04:03.090> we've<00:04:03.330> got<00:04:03.450> somewhere<00:04:03.780> between<00:04:03.930> 500

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
installs we've got somewhere between 500

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.500 
installs we've got somewhere between 500
and<00:04:04.650> 600<00:04:04.950> feet<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.520> 2<00:04:05.670> inch<00:04:05.850> piping<00:04:06.270> in<00:04:06.390> this

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
and 600 feet of 2 inch piping in this

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.060 
and 600 feet of 2 inch piping in this
home<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.020> there's<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.260> second<00:04:07.650> tank<00:04:07.830> here<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
home so there's a second tank here a

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.979 
home so there's a second tank here a
second<00:04:08.760> tank<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.060> here<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.360> it's<00:04:09.450> inside<00:04:09.810> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
second tank in here and it's inside the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.630 
second tank in here and it's inside the
shell<00:04:10.200> all<00:04:10.650> right<00:04:10.770> so<00:04:10.950> we<00:04:11.040> get<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.250> second

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
shell all right so we get the second

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.490 
shell all right so we get the second
tank<00:04:11.820> it's<00:04:12.090> actually<00:04:12.450> built<00:04:12.750> into<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.110> shower

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
tank it's actually built into a shower

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.650 
tank it's actually built into a shower
here<00:04:13.920> right<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:14.790> correct<00:04:14.880> Ryan<00:04:15.450> it's

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
here right that is correct Ryan it's

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.970 
here right that is correct Ryan it's
building<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.049> shower<00:04:16.320> when<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.680> client

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
building the shower when the client

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.470 
building the shower when the client
first<00:04:17.100> came<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.580> us<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.910> concept

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
first came to us with the concept

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.390 
first came to us with the concept
talking<00:04:19.320> about<00:04:19.500> building<00:04:19.799> an<00:04:19.890> aquarium<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
talking about building an aquarium in a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.020 
talking about building an aquarium in a
shower

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
shower

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.700 
shower
we've<00:04:21.419> done<00:04:21.630> one<00:04:21.810> before<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.260> we<00:04:22.350> looked<00:04:22.560> at

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
we've done one before and we looked at

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.560 
we've done one before and we looked at
it<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.280> thought<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:23.910> ourselves<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.450> can

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
it and I thought to ourselves it can

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.000 
it and I thought to ourselves it can
definitely<00:04:24.720> be<00:04:24.960> done<00:04:25.200> but<00:04:25.380> they<00:04:25.500> really<00:04:25.830> upped

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
definitely be done but they really upped

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.800 
definitely be done but they really upped
the<00:04:26.130> ante<00:04:26.460> by<00:04:26.640> having<00:04:27.419> an<00:04:27.510> act

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
the ante by having an act

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.100 
the ante by having an act
the<00:04:27.990> inside<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.770> shower<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.940> our<00:04:30.600> concern<00:04:30.930> was

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
the inside the shower so our concern was

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.600 
the inside the shower so our concern was
obviously<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.680> first<00:04:31.860> thing<00:04:32.130> is<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.520> know

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
obviously the first thing is you know

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.090 
obviously the first thing is you know
water<00:04:32.820> dripping<00:04:33.210> into<00:04:33.450> it<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.200> actually

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
water dripping into it and and actually

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.560 
water dripping into it and and actually
the<00:04:35.190> heat<00:04:35.400> problems<00:04:35.820> from<00:04:36.000> having<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.330> steam

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
the heat problems from having a steam

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.590 
the heat problems from having a steam
shower<00:04:36.870> inside<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.440> aquarium<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:39.330> way<00:04:39.450> we

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
shower inside the aquarium so the way we

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.450 
shower inside the aquarium so the way we
looked<00:04:39.780> at<00:04:39.900> it<00:04:40.110> is<00:04:40.260> we<00:04:40.530> oversize<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.190> chiller

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
looked at it is we oversize the chiller

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.040 
looked at it is we oversize the chiller
we<00:04:41.940> put<00:04:42.120> all<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.330> filtration<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:42.990> the

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
we put all the filtration in the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.930 
we put all the filtration in the
basement<00:04:43.530> we<00:04:44.190> made<00:04:44.340> sure<00:04:44.460> this<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:44.820> all

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
basement we made sure this is all

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.460 
basement we made sure this is all
watertight<00:04:45.300> in<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> rain<00:04:46.050> heads<00:04:46.320> were

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
watertight in it the rain heads were

let's<00:05:57.270> take<00:05:57.389> a<00:05:57.450> look<00:05:57.600> at<00:05:57.690> a<00:05:57.780> couple<00:05:57.960> of<00:05:58.260> the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
let's take a look at a couple of the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.350 
let's take a look at a couple of the
filtration<00:05:58.950> systems<00:05:59.520> you<00:05:59.580> got<00:05:59.700> downstairs<00:06:00.060> I

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
filtration systems you got downstairs I

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.700 
filtration systems you got downstairs I
know<00:06:00.450> they're<00:06:00.570> not<00:06:00.600> complete<00:06:01.200> but<00:06:01.380> we<00:06:01.440> can<00:06:01.620> get

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
know they're not complete but we can get

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.680 
know they're not complete but we can get
an<00:06:01.800> idea<00:06:02.130> where<00:06:02.400> they<00:06:02.490> absolutely<00:06:02.910> absolute

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
an idea where they absolutely absolute

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.960 
an idea where they absolutely absolute
let's<00:06:03.840> go<00:06:03.990> we<00:06:04.560> have<00:06:04.590> here<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:05.100> filtration<00:06:05.700> for

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
let's go we have here the filtration for

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.690 
let's go we have here the filtration for
the<00:06:06.090> 225<00:06:06.750> gallons<00:06:06.990> shower<00:06:07.410> tank<00:06:07.770> so<00:06:08.490> what<00:06:08.610> we

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
the 225 gallons shower tank so what we

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.690 
the 225 gallons shower tank so what we
have<00:06:08.910> here<00:06:08.940> is<00:06:09.450> a<00:06:09.510> 125<00:06:09.930> gallon<00:06:10.710> sump<00:06:10.950> with<00:06:11.250> k1
