start to finish

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.369 
start to finish
because<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.350> thing<00:00:46.620> moves<00:00:47.870> quite<00:00:48.870> neatly<00:00:49.170> I

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
because the thing moves quite neatly I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.369 
because the thing moves quite neatly I
think<00:00:49.710> from<00:00:50.579> talking<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> rule<00:00:52.050> set

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
think from talking about the rule set

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.770 
think from talking about the rule set
the<00:00:52.739> standard<00:00:53.160> will<00:00:53.309> set<00:00:53.550> these<00:00:53.730> days<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the standard will set these days all the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
the standard will set these days all the
way<00:00:54.870> through<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.860> mid<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> end<00:00:56.610> game

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
way through to the mid to end game

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.099 
way through to the mid to end game
transition<00:00:57.770> now<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> clarify<00:00:59.730> then<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
transition now just to clarify then the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.009 
transition now just to clarify then the
first<00:01:01.440> video<00:01:02.010> after<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.780> we'll<00:01:03.780> just

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
first video after this one we'll just

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
first video after this one we'll just
talk<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:05.010> seems<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> standard

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
talk about what seems to be the standard

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.520 
talk about what seems to be the standard
rules<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.110> there's<00:01:07.380> so

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
rules because as you know there's so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.000 
rules because as you know there's so
many<00:01:07.680> different<00:01:07.799> ways<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.520> playing<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.360> game

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
many different ways of playing this game

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.830 
many different ways of playing this game
it<00:01:11.010> doesn't<00:01:11.340> explain<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> play<00:01:12.540> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it doesn't explain how to play it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
it doesn't explain how to play it
assumes<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.619> how<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> play<00:01:14.220> we'll<00:01:14.850> just

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
assumes you know how to play we'll just

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.530 
assumes you know how to play we'll just
get<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.409> rule<00:01:16.619> set<00:01:17.060> then<00:01:18.060> after<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
get on with the rule set then after that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320 
get on with the rule set then after that
I<00:01:18.600> talked<00:01:18.990> about<00:01:19.020> an<00:01:19.700> opening<00:01:20.700> strategy

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I talked about an opening strategy

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
I talked about an opening strategy
before<00:01:22.200> you've<00:01:22.320> even<00:01:22.409> started<00:01:22.560> playing<00:01:23.159> the

before you've even started playing the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
before you've even started playing the
game<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> select<00:01:25.409> which

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
game which is how to select which

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.410 
game which is how to select which
continents<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.060> select<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> why<00:01:29.119> also<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
continents to select and why also if you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
continents to select and why also if you
don't<00:01:30.570> want<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.930> play<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:31.979> possible

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
don't want to play or it's not possible

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.030

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to play a continent based strategy at

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
to play a continent based strategy at
least<00:01:35.220> at<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> start<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> game<00:01:36.210> how<00:01:36.930> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
least at the start of the game how you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.149 
least at the start of the game how you
go<00:01:37.200> about<00:01:37.320> doing<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.540> still<00:01:39.540> prosper

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
go about doing that and still prosper

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.950 
go about doing that and still prosper
then<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.090> third<00:01:42.360> video<00:01:42.680> after<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:43.860> is

then the third video after this one is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.950 
then the third video after this one is

opening strategies per se with regards
to<00:01:49.020> diplomacy<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.750> also<00:01:51.750> start<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> talk<00:01:52.439> about

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
to diplomacy I also start to talk about

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.350 
to diplomacy I also start to talk about
probability<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.159> assessing<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:57.000> attacking

sorts of games so that you can see that

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.520 
sorts of games so that you can see that
you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.850> borrow<00:02:03.149> from<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:04.049> knowledge<00:02:04.259> of

you can borrow from your knowledge of
other<00:02:04.680> games<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.549> risk<00:02:06.090> after<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:07.649> get

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
other games in risk after that we get

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.600 
other games in risk after that we get
down<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> specifics<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:11.039> dice<00:02:11.310> odds

I consider to be the most important part
of<00:02:59.460> playing<00:02:59.970> risk<00:03:00.210> once<00:03:00.570> you've<00:03:00.780> got<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> basic

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
of playing risk once you've got a basic

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.190 
of playing risk once you've got a basic
feel<00:03:02.910> for<00:03:03.240> attacking<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.840> odds<00:03:04.020> and

feel for attacking on odds and

feel for attacking on odds and
everything<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:05.100> diplomacy<00:03:06.350> how<00:03:07.350> do

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
everything and that is diplomacy how do

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
you manipulate is too strong a word but

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.060 
you manipulate is too strong a word but
