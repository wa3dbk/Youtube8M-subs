00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.380
 a fly line gets dirty like any other 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.880
 something else must be urgently cleaned 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.250
 after some time 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 there are three stages you should 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.630
 do to keep the fault line in 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.210
 your highest level of performance 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.579
 extend your life first stage of 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 cleaning the manif should be done more 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.210
 often every two fisheries 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.460
 more or less 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.219
 is really important if you fish in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.100
 saltwater or on the bank of a lake or 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.219
 a river where there is plenty of mud and dirt 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 lines that are used in labeled 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.440
 are also more susceptible to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.809
 and accumulate dirt in the process 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.749
 the lines can get dirty just by the fact 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.670
 being in the water and particles and seeing 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.530
 dissolved in the water were readily 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.180
 attaching the fly line layer and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.850
 decrease your performance 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.240
 the stage of cleaning up the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.220
 line is to remove dirt 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.380
 although it is not essential to use two 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.710
 for this stage and this reduces the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.740
 chance of wigs stage 1 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.660
 to start stage 1 in x 5 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.760
 centimeters of warm water in both 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.020
 buckets 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.240
 add a little neutral detergent 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.290
 dishwasher in one of the buckets and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.290
 mix with your hand 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.410
 just the brake on your island career and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.560
 begin to draw the line into the 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.690
 bucket with soap as much as line 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.420
 You decide to take away the clean of losing. 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.770
 line as you do not use regularly 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.900
 There is nothing wrong with money until the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.020
 beque but most of the time is not 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.020
 required 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.160
 with the row total removed 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.100
 carefully dive everything into the water 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.640
 careful not to move much in line 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.130
 because it will cause us five minutes of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.260
 enough sauce but if it is 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.260
 visually so long as it stays for 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.540
 half an hour since the line was 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.660
 soak a towel to remove the thick 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.520
 of dirt bends acting around the line 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.380
 and understanding of your index finger 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.660
 pull line into bucket of water 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.540
 clean to remove all residue from 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.130
 safety soap and put the line in the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.690
 bucket with the end attached to the first bec 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.890
 reposition the towel regularly to 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.940
 that the line passes through a 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.940
 clean and dry 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.930
 when you get to the tip of the leader of the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.300
 Remove the soap line from the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.090
 first bucket with the first bucket and 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.760
 the line by the leading edge and 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.980
 goes through history again when 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.750
 finish the leader's tip is in the bottom 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.750
 of this stage with every line was by 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.010
 Above her and the tip of the bec will be ready. 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.830
 to be withdrawn into the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.660
 canteen when you are picking up the 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.910
 line perceiving that peace passes a 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.000
 feeling of being clean different from 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.580
 when removed for cleaning again 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.170
 do this every two times you fish and 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.350
 you will be very satisfied with the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.350
 results 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.989
