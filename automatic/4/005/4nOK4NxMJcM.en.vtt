4<00:01:07.290> inches<00:01:07.520> some<00:01:08.520> websites<00:01:08.970> actually<00:01:09.479> says

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
4 inches some websites actually says

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.730 
4 inches some websites actually says
it's<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.400> it's<00:01:11.400> three<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.299> 15th<00:01:12.750> 16th<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.530> an

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it's a it's three and a 15th 16th of an

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.730 
it's a it's three and a 15th 16th of an
inch<00:01:14.180> let's<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:16.020> measuring<00:01:16.470> tape

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
inch let's see what don't measuring tape

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.469 
inch let's see what don't measuring tape
actually<00:01:17.250> says<00:01:21.409> it's<00:01:22.490> it's<00:01:23.490> four<00:01:23.820> inches<00:01:24.210> if

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
actually says it's it's four inches if

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.660 
actually says it's it's four inches if
you<00:01:24.659> measure<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> bottom<00:01:25.670> originally

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you measure from the bottom originally

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
you measure from the bottom originally
you<00:01:26.820> should<00:01:27.090> measure<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:28.020> blade<00:01:28.259> length<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you should measure the blade length I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.289 
you should measure the blade length I
think<00:01:29.130> by<00:01:29.250> law<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.549> measure<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
think by law you measure from the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.690 
think by law you measure from the
highest<00:01:31.020> point<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.439> handle<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.549> would

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
highest point of the handle which would

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.160 
highest point of the handle which would
make<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.350> blade<00:01:34.350> length<00:01:35.390> about<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
make the blade length about just a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
make the blade length about just a
little<00:01:37.409> over<00:01:37.590> three<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.950> half<00:01:37.979> inches<00:01:38.390> but

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
little over three and a half inches but

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
little over three and a half inches but
you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.290> four<00:01:40.680> inches<00:01:40.950> cutting

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you know it's a it's four inches cutting

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.880 
you know it's a it's four inches cutting
edge<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:43.110> how<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.619> guy

factory<00:02:38.370> second<00:02:38.730> blade<00:02:38.879> the<00:02:39.780> difference<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.379> I

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
factory second blade the difference on I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.440 
factory second blade the difference on I
guess<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.010> reason<00:02:41.189> why<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.970> factory

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
guess the reason why it is factory

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.000 
guess the reason why it is factory
second<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.140> see<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.500> different<00:02:43.829> shades

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010

second but you see the different shades
of<00:02:44.129> black<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.870> think<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.989> guess<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:46.530> should

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
of black I think I guess they should

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.619 
of black I think I guess they should
have<00:02:46.950> been<00:02:46.980> same<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.909> is<00:02:48.030> more<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.480> regular

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
clip isn't an issue which is perfect you

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.200 
clip isn't an issue which is perfect you
need<00:04:43.920> a<00:04:43.950> little<00:04:44.160> bit<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.370> flick<00:04:44.730> with<00:04:45.090> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
need a little bit of flick with the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.350 
need a little bit of flick with the
flipper<00:04:46.100> however<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:47.340> don't<00:04:47.370> need<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:48.060> flick

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
flipper however you don't need to flick

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.570 
flipper however you don't need to flick
your<00:04:48.540> hand<00:04:48.840> with<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.680> thumb<00:04:49.710> stat<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.490> you

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
your hand with the thumb stat and you

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.290 
your hand with the thumb stat and you
also<00:04:51.420> don't<00:04:52.110> need<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.440> flick<00:04:52.880> reduce<00:04:53.880> nothing

also don't need to flick reduce nothing

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.880 
also don't need to flick reduce nothing
when<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:54.780> use<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.350> gravity<00:04:55.940> yeah<00:04:56.940> I<00:04:57.270> hope<00:04:58.110> if

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
when you use the gravity yeah I hope if

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.130 
when you use the gravity yeah I hope if
if<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.730> ever<00:04:59.880> happens<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.570> caps<00:05:00.810> check

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
if that ever happens and the caps check

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.310 
if that ever happens and the caps check
me<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:02.040> blade<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.430> legal<00:05:02.820> but<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:04.080> should

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
me the blade is legal but this should

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.070 
me the blade is legal but this should
maybe<00:05:04.530> consider<00:05:05.370> as<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:05.880> gravity<00:05:06.450> knife<00:05:06.660> I

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
maybe consider as a gravity knife I

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.200 
maybe consider as a gravity knife I
don't<00:05:07.710> know<00:05:07.770> how<00:05:07.920> they<00:05:08.100> look<00:05:08.340> at<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.520> i<00:05:08.640> hope<00:05:09.060> i

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
don't know how they look at it i hope i

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.790 
don't know how they look at it i hope i
don't<00:05:09.480> get<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.780> trouble<00:05:10.140> because<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.590> that

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
don't get to trouble because of that

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.870 
don't get to trouble because of that
ever<00:05:11.070> but<00:05:11.880> it's<00:05:12.630> it's<00:05:13.350> we'd<00:05:13.740> played<00:05:14.010> really

good looking blade this is the knife you

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.070 
good looking blade this is the knife you
know<00:05:19.410> nada<00:05:20.160> EDC<00:05:20.790> they<00:05:21.210> still<00:05:21.480> gonna<00:05:21.630> carry<00:05:21.870> it

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.020 
know shit hit the fan so beautiful knife
beautiful<00:05:40.860> knife<00:05:41.040> and<00:05:41.720> like<00:05:42.720> i<00:05:42.750> said<00:05:44.030> compared

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
beautiful knife and like i said compared

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.470 
beautiful knife and like i said compared
to<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.330> CT<00:05:45.720> 350<00:05:46.380> grade<00:05:46.710> grade<00:05:47.220> blade<00:05:47.520> also<00:05:47.970> but

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
to the CT 350 grade grade blade also but

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.930 
to the CT 350 grade grade blade also but
it<00:05:48.630> just<00:05:48.810> dominates<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.590> just<00:05:50.340> dominates<00:05:50.790> it

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
it just dominates it just dominates it

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.090 
it just dominates it just dominates it
and<00:05:51.180> it's<00:05:51.300> it's<00:05:51.840> worth<00:05:52.110> every<00:05:52.560> single<00:05:52.770> ounce

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
and it's it's worth every single ounce

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.550 
and it's it's worth every single ounce
this<00:05:53.760> guy's<00:05:53.970> heavier<00:05:54.510> it's<00:05:54.900> worth<00:05:55.200> every

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
this guy's heavier it's worth every

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.880 
this guy's heavier it's worth every
single<00:05:55.740> one<00:05:56.040> of<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.220> bit<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.550> it<00:05:57.290> for<00:05:58.290> example

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
single one of a bit of it for example

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.190 
single one of a bit of it for example
since<00:05:59.850> we<00:06:00.030> have<00:06:00.210> that<00:06:00.360> scale<00:06:00.660> you<00:06:00.930> know<00:06:03.200> this

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
since we have that scale you know this

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.550 
since we have that scale you know this
guy<00:06:06.830> is<00:06:07.830> five<00:06:08.340> point<00:06:08.700> eight<00:06:08.970> ounces<00:06:09.600> and<00:06:09.930> this

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
guy is five point eight ounces and this

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:19.160 
guy is five point eight ounces and this
was<00:06:11.060> 795<00:06:12.060> now<00:06:15.140> 785<00:06:16.140> year<00:06:16.380> so<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.430> is<00:06:18.170> obviously

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
was 795 now 785 year so it is obviously

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.230 
was 795 now 785 year so it is obviously
heavier<00:06:19.770> but<00:06:20.760> if<00:06:21.720> you<00:06:21.870> check<00:06:22.110> that<00:06:22.170> size<00:06:23.240> there

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
heavier but if you check that size there

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.540 
heavier but if you check that size there
is<00:06:24.390> there<00:06:24.840> is<00:06:24.870> no<00:06:25.050> comparison<00:06:25.530> it<00:06:26.280> just<00:06:27.290> and

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
is there is no comparison it just and

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.610 
is there is no comparison it just and
none<00:06:29.550> of<00:06:29.580> none<00:06:30.150> of<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.480> nice<00:06:30.660> i<00:06:30.870> have<00:06:31.080> fit<00:06:31.440> in

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
none of none of the nice i have fit in

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.730 
none of none of the nice i have fit in
the<00:06:31.770> hand<00:06:32.010> like<00:06:32.730> this<00:06:32.790> guy<00:06:33.210> does<00:06:33.780> it's<00:06:34.320> just

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
the hand like this guy does it's just

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.010 
the hand like this guy does it's just
it's<00:06:35.100> built<00:06:35.430> for<00:06:35.490> hand<00:06:35.880> and<00:06:36.030> i'm<00:06:36.480> pretty<00:06:36.690> sure

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
it's built for hand and i'm pretty sure

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.879 
it's built for hand and i'm pretty sure
it<00:06:37.290> fits<00:06:37.650> same<00:06:38.100> in<00:06:38.340> everybody's<00:06:39.300> hand

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:39.889 
it fits same in everybody's hand

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.999 
it fits same in everybody's hand
it's<00:06:40.639> just<00:06:40.939> so<00:06:41.090> anatomic<00:06:41.930> it's<00:06:42.319> designed<00:06:42.830> by

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
it's just so anatomic it's designed by

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.850 
it's just so anatomic it's designed by
Ken<00:06:43.280> Onion<00:06:43.490> he's<00:06:44.419> well<00:06:44.629> known<00:06:44.659> for<00:06:45.050> his<00:06:45.110> you

Ken Onion he's well known for his you

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.610 
Ken Onion he's well known for his you
know<00:06:45.889> that<00:06:46.310> curved<00:06:47.030> blades<00:06:47.360> they<00:06:48.229> are<00:06:48.349> little

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
know that curved blades they are little

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.959 
know that curved blades they are little
hard<00:06:48.860> and<00:06:49.069> harder<00:06:49.550> to<00:06:49.669> sharpen<00:06:50.180> but<00:06:51.050> it's<00:06:51.439> it's

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:51.969 
hard and harder to sharpen but it's it's

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.659 
hard and harder to sharpen but it's it's
you<00:06:52.969> can<00:06:53.150> do<00:06:53.300> it<00:06:53.449> pretty<00:06:53.659> easy<00:06:54.020> I<00:06:54.379> actually<00:06:55.249> use

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
you can do it pretty easy I actually use

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.689 
you can do it pretty easy I actually use
the<00:06:55.999> 30<00:06:56.810> degrees<00:06:57.289> and<00:06:57.499> on<00:06:57.650> my<00:06:57.830> char<00:06:58.099> maker<00:06:58.340> and

00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:58.699 
the 30 degrees and on my char maker and

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.570 
the 30 degrees and on my char maker and
it<00:06:59.389> works<00:06:59.719> out<00:06:59.960> perfect<00:07:00.469> its<00:07:00.710> razor-sharp

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
it works out perfect its razor-sharp

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.749 
it works out perfect its razor-sharp
hose<00:07:02.569> the<00:07:03.080> whole<00:07:03.259> stage<00:07:03.529> pretty<00:07:03.979> pretty<00:07:04.490> good

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 
hose the whole stage pretty pretty good

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:09.610 
hose the whole stage pretty pretty good
I<00:07:04.969> mean<00:07:05.689> really<00:07:05.930> good<00:07:06.259> actually<00:07:06.439> and<00:07:08.199> good<00:07:09.199> it

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
I mean really good actually and good it

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.189 
I mean really good actually and good it
