nice celebration or some nice boot
because<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.780> remember<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.170> FIFA<00:01:40.439> 12<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.100> have

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
because I remember on FIFA 12 you have

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
because I remember on FIFA 12 you have
to<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.610> certain<00:01:41.909> accomplishments<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.689> earn

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
to do certain accomplishments to earn

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
to do certain accomplishments to earn
your<00:01:42.990> boots<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.409> are<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.189> didn't<00:01:44.430> mind

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
your boots which are so as I didn't mind

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.969 
your boots which are so as I didn't mind
but<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.270> ways<00:01:45.420> better<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
but I think it's ways better because you

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.499 
but I think it's ways better because you
can<00:01:47.130> buy<00:01:47.549> exactly<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.210> want<00:01:48.360> rather

can buy exactly what you want rather

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719 
can buy exactly what you want rather
