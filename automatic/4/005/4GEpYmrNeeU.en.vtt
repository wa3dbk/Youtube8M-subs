00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello here and there through live.com bands and 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.509
 in today's video I'll talk a little 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.000
 on white wine 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.000
 He's white, does not even leave. 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.970
 well I do not know who created the term wine 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.949
 white but started looking at wine for 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 know that he is not white in the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.990
 truth is a translucent liquid 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.609
 Yellow straw yellow but anyway the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.880
 people have already gotten used to this term 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.649
 let's go to white wine white wine is 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.420
 any wine that does not have the color 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.070
 reddish 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.800
 the wine and turns into white river of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.430
 two forms the first it can be 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.890
 made from white grapes that in the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.940
 The truth is not white either. 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.850
 green 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 sometimes finally to a golden yellow 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.160
 second way to make white wine is 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.430
 make grapes with grapes that same grapes 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.149
 I will explain why the juice of the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.180
 grapes is exactly the same as the south of 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.060
 grapes but what gives the coloration to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.549
 to wine is the pigmentation of grape bark 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.799
 then to make white wine with grapes 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.290
 paints are used only grape juice 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.040
 removing the bark to avoid passing the color 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.590
 for wine 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.530
 but in practice or with white wines 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.990
 are made from red grapes the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 RosÃ© champagne is an exception but we 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.549
 will see this in an upcoming video and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.790
 usually white wine is consumed 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.490
 As an aperitif is this dinner party. 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.729
 but it is also a great choice for 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.680
 summer when the weather gets very hot 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.630
