the<00:00:06.000> question<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.779> one<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.259> them<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:08.250> book

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
the question is in one of them my book

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.839 
the question is in one of them my book
and<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.330> many<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.660> my<00:00:09.690> videos<00:00:10.070> and<00:00:11.070> even<00:00:11.519> in

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
and in many of my videos and even in

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.520 
and in many of my videos and even in
this<00:00:12.000> presentation<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.960> may<00:00:13.080> have<00:00:13.200> missed<00:00:13.410> it

this presentation you may have missed it

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.250 
this presentation you may have missed it
but<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.679> expect<00:00:14.340> deflation<00:00:15.150> before<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> big

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
but I expect deflation before a big

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.300 
but I expect deflation before a big
inflation<00:00:16.650> or<00:00:16.920> hyperinflation<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:18.570> proper

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
inflation or hyperinflation the proper

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.859 
inflation or hyperinflation the proper
definitions<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.460> inflation<00:00:21.180> deflation<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
definitions of inflation deflation is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.359 
definitions of inflation deflation is
expansion<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.619> contraction<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
expansion and contraction of the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.820 
expansion and contraction of the
currency<00:00:23.820> supply<00:00:23.970> prices<00:00:24.570> are<00:00:24.840> rising<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
currency supply prices are rising and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.980 
currency supply prices are rising and
falling<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> symptom<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.990> monetary

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
falling or the symptom of monetary

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.030 
falling or the symptom of monetary
inflation<00:00:28.500> or<00:00:29.099> deflation<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:31.230> Fed<00:00:31.529> can

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
inflation or deflation and the Fed can

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.310 
inflation or deflation and the Fed can
only<00:00:32.250> control<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.910> 6%<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> currency

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
only control that 6% of the currency

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
only control that 6% of the currency
supply<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.950> they<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.250> influence<00:00:36.090> over<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
supply and they have influence over the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.170 
supply and they have influence over the
other<00:00:36.980> 94<00:00:37.980> percent<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:38.879> not

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
other 94 percent but they do not

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.900 
other 94 percent but they do not
directly<00:00:39.420> control<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.370> control<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
directly control it you and I control it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.000 
directly control it you and I control it
and<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.780> controlled<00:00:42.989> by<00:00:43.260> our<00:00:43.500> mood<00:00:43.739> if

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and it's all controlled by our mood if

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
and it's all controlled by our mood if
we<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.370> scared<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.000> stop<00:00:45.239> borrowing<00:00:45.539> more

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
we get scared and we stop borrowing more

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930 
we get scared and we stop borrowing more
currency<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.649> existence<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.760> we're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
currency into existence then we're

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
currency into existence then we're
extinguishing<00:00:48.660> by<00:00:49.050> saving<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.680> paying

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
extinguishing by saving up and paying

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.880 
extinguishing by saving up and paying
down<00:00:50.160> debt<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.390> whole<00:00:51.600> thing<00:00:51.870> collapses<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
down debt the whole thing collapses that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.240 
down debt the whole thing collapses that
is<00:00:53.160> true<00:00:53.640> deflation<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.500> prices<00:00:55.890> will

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
is true deflation not all prices will

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.939 
is true deflation not all prices will
follow<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.239> most<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.289> should<00:00:58.530> go<00:00:58.680> into<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
follow but but most we should go into a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
follow but but most we should go into a
big<00:00:59.219> deflationary<00:00:59.879> dip<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.329> believe<00:01:00.600> it's

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
big deflationary dip I believe it's

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.700 
big deflationary dip I believe it's
starting<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.260> now

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
starting right now

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.270 
starting right now
gold<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> silver<00:01:02.489> seem<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:04.100> going<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
gold and silver seem to be going that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
gold and silver seem to be going that
direction<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.630> believe<00:01:06.900> there's

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
direction right now I do believe there's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
direction right now I do believe there's
a<00:01:07.229> big<00:01:07.380> buying<00:01:07.590> opportunity<00:01:08.280> coming<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.700> for

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
a big buying opportunity coming up for

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760 
a big buying opportunity coming up for
silver<00:01:09.180> by<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.140> believe<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
silver by the way and I do believe that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
silver by the way and I do believe that
you're<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.850> shortages<00:01:12.360> develop<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you're going to see shortages develop in

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
you're going to see shortages develop in
the<00:01:13.049> physical<00:01:13.470> gold<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.890> silver<00:01:14.250> market<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the physical gold and silver market just

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.499 
the physical gold and silver market just
as<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.299> did<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.860> 2008<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> 2009<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.299> last

time<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.930> had<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> big<00:01:19.350> pullback<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.909> paper

gold and silver rise when everybody

when you see it on TV you see it in the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.780 
when you see it on TV you see it in the
newspaper<00:01:59.310> price<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.729> gold<00:01:59.850> went<00:02:00.030> down<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
2008 and 9 that

like<00:02:07.130> below<00:02:07.810> ten<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.140> think<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.649> bottom<00:02:09.800> was

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
like below ten I think the bottom was

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.240 
like below ten I think the bottom was
874<00:02:11.030> but<00:02:11.209> if<00:02:11.300> he<00:02:11.390> went<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.720> ebay<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.980> day

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
874 but if he went to ebay on that day

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.930 
874 but if he went to ebay on that day
silver<00:02:14.060> eagles<00:02:14.360> were<00:02:14.480> 36<00:02:15.319> bucks<00:02:15.620> apiece<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
silver eagles were 36 bucks apiece the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.880

premium<00:02:17.420> was<00:02:17.630> huge<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.140> was<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> hundreds

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890

premium was huge it was in the hundreds
of<00:02:19.099> percent<00:02:19.610> but<00:02:20.540> anyway<00:02:21.040> deflation<00:02:22.040> before
