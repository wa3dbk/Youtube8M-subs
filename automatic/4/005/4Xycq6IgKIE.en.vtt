00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.020
 hello everybody welcome to the board, let's go 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.380
 start the construction study 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.330
 geometric images for the lens 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.439
 Let's start our study. 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.590
 considering that it is divergent and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.520
 our object in these classes will be a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.470
 candle 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.619
 you already know some points that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.830
 are on the main axis of the lens 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.040
 in the case of the lens that is divergent 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.309
 first point we have is the point is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.120
 thinner that is the focus image of this lens 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.020
 and this second point is the object focus of the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 lens 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.270
 the point of intersection between the lens 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.270
 main axis is the optical center is a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.809
 marketing on the main axis two 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.510
 points that you do not even know these 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.090
 points I'll call point to the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.969
 line and dot ap 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.350
 they receive the name of points before 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.360
 main 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.540
 they will even be used as a 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 reference for the study of the formation of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 images in lenses ok for construction 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 geometric images 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.479
 we will consider that the two means 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.700
 external to the lens are identical 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.780
 considering the distance between the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.020
 center and the focus image is equal to the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.150
 distance between the optical center and the focus 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.100
 object of this lens 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.380
 then we can consider that the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 daughter segments and fc are equal 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.210
 already the segment that goes from otto to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.880
 point is equal to two 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.250
 f times the segment and the segment 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.700
 my nickname is equal to twice the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.670
 segment the fmi line we can 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.880
 consider these relations also for the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.519
 Converging lenses ok let's position 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.579
 the sail on the main axis 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.520
 Let's call the end where it ends. 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:17.250
 the candle flame from a and the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.120
 candle playing more main duty 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.909
 I already know 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.549
 that the first ohio radius incident 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:26.220
 about the optical center of this lens 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.890
 we saw that this ray when crossing the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.080
 lens is not deflected 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.170
 I'll give you the second ray now. 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.739
 parallel to the main axis of the lens 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.489
 in the case of diverging lens that ohio 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.459
 emerge when an incident radius 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.049
 parallel to the main axis is medium 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.739
 direction in such a way that its 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.349
 prolongation passes over the focus image 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.220
 Andretti, then you realize that 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.950
 in this case the emerging light rays do not 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.680
 meet but if I do the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.959
 prolongation of these rays 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.720
 the extension of this dotted line 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.879
 here you do not come because the line 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.819
 even passes over the 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.700
 trajectory of the incident ray 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.180
 you may realize that there is a point 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.970
 where they are intercepted and is 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.090
 precisely at this point that the image will be 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.180
 formed as the incident light rays 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.639
 from this point where the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.160
 rays are intercepted is precisely the 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.919
 end of the candle flame we go 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.970
 call it the line the point that is 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:41.760
 on the axis then the point b line as 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.400
 Do you describe that first picture? 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.819
 characteristic of it is that it was 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.209
 formed by the prolongations of the rays 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.829
 that is an image 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.099
 virtual 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:04:00.359
 The second characteristic is that it is 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.760
 in the same position as the candle, ie 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.489
 is direct and would even be the last 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.060
 characteristic that you can perceive 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.699
 it has a smaller size than the object 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.790
 for divergent lenses 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:18.019
 independent of the position of the object on 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.199
 the main axis the image will always be 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.050
 virtual and minor in the next class 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.110
 we will go to the geometric construction of 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.710
 images for non-converging lenses 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.710
 lose
