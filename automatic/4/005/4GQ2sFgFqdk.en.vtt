00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.050 
that's super cute I actually thought I
could<00:01:25.439> hang<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.680> picture<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.100> wall<00:01:26.310> or

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
could hang a picture on the wall or

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460 
could hang a picture on the wall or
something<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.600> when<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.810> realized<00:01:28.320> how

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
something but then when I realized how

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.649 
something but then when I realized how
blank<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.979> portion<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> screen<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
blank that portion of the screen was I

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
blank that portion of the screen was I
thought<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.380> perfect

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
thought that it's perfect

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.270 
thought that it's perfect
so<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:33.000> I'm<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> glue<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.409> so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so what I'm gonna do is glue it down so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830 
so what I'm gonna do is glue it down so
