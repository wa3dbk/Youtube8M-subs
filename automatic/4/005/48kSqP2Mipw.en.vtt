when<00:00:02.190> you<00:00:02.310> hand<00:00:02.669> rake<00:00:02.939> while<00:00:03.449> blueberries<00:00:04.200> you

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
when you hand rake while blueberries you

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.889 
when you hand rake while blueberries you
get<00:00:05.400> an<00:00:05.520> awful<00:00:05.819> lot<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.940> leaves<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.629> sticks

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
get an awful lot of leaves and sticks

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.490 
get an awful lot of leaves and sticks
and<00:00:07.460> it<00:00:08.460> can<00:00:08.580> take<00:00:08.760> just<00:00:08.790> as<00:00:09.120> long<00:00:09.360> as<00:00:09.690> did<00:00:10.260> for

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and it can take just as long as did for

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.650 
and it can take just as long as did for
you<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> pick<00:00:10.860> them<00:00:11.070> maybe<00:00:11.400> even<00:00:11.700> longer<00:00:11.910> just

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
you to pick them maybe even longer just

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.279 
you to pick them maybe even longer just
pick<00:00:12.809> through<00:00:13.019> them<00:00:13.170> again<00:00:14.120> but<00:00:15.120> if<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.389> use<00:00:15.599> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
pick through them again but if you use a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.340 
pick through them again but if you use a
series<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.920> methods<00:00:17.369> such<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.539> blowing<00:00:18.930> up<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
series of methods such as blowing up the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.710 
series of methods such as blowing up the
leaves<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.949> floating<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.060> ripe<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> unripe

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
leaves and floating out ripe and unripe

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.200 
leaves and floating out ripe and unripe
berries<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:23.160> save<00:00:23.369> yourself<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.789> lot<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:23.970> time

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
berries and save yourself a lot of time

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.920 
berries and save yourself a lot of time
this<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.380> step<00:00:25.680> one<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.359> basically<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.779> get

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
this is step one and basically just get

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.169 
this is step one and basically just get
a<00:00:27.960> high-powered<00:00:28.470> fan<00:00:28.730> tape<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> piece<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
a high-powered fan tape a piece of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.870 
a high-powered fan tape a piece of
bristol<00:00:30.510> board<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.669> cut<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> little

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
bristol board to it and cut a little

00:00:32.880 --> 00:01:20.609 
bristol board to it and cut a little
opening<00:00:33.360> down

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.590 

so<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.780> get<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.140> odd<00:01:23.289> leaf<00:01:23.969> that<00:01:24.969> falls<00:01:25.030> into

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
so you get the odd leaf that falls into

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.419 
so you get the odd leaf that falls into
it<00:01:25.719> but<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:26.289> just<00:01:26.439> do<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.710> more<00:01:26.859> than<00:01:26.890> just

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
it but you just do it more than just

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:58.630 
it but you just do it more than just
keep<00:01:27.579> doing<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:29.039> three<00:01:30.039> times

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.880 

so<00:01:59.640> stage<00:01:59.910> 2<00:01:59.940> of<00:02:00.240> sorting<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.080> berries<00:02:01.440> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
so stage 2 of sorting the berries and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.240 
so stage 2 of sorting the berries and
get<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> large<00:02:03.170> wine<00:02:04.170> from<00:02:04.470> fermentation

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
get a large wine from fermentation

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.030 
get a large wine from fermentation
bucket<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:06.050> you<00:02:07.050> pour<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.350> berries<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
bucket and you pour the berries in the

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.669 
bucket and you pour the berries in the
liquid<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.910> we've<00:02:09.869> already<00:02:10.110> we've<00:02:10.500> already

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
liquid and we've already we've already

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.220 
liquid and we've already we've already
taken<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.250> top<00:02:11.730> side<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:13.050> bucket<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:15.230> see

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
taken the top side this bucket and see

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.270 
taken the top side this bucket and see
there's<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.530> good<00:02:17.070> layer<00:02:17.310> forming<00:02:18.650> ripe<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.040> on

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
there's a good layer forming ripe and on

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.490 
there's a good layer forming ripe and on
non<00:02:21.060> green<00:02:21.630> blue<00:02:22.340> berries<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:25.200> branch

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
non green blue berries and the branch

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.670 
non green blue berries and the branch
branches<00:02:26.459> also<00:02:26.670> float<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.450> it'll<00:02:27.660> gets<00:02:27.810> sorted

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
branches also float so it'll gets sorted

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.420 
branches also float so it'll gets sorted
out<00:02:28.850> into<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.940> refuse<00:02:30.330> berries<00:02:31.130> last<00:02:32.130> year<00:02:32.340> we

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
out into the refuse berries last year we

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.560 
out into the refuse berries last year we
did<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.790> had<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> lot<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.209> green<00:02:33.360> ones

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
did this we had a lot of green ones

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.240 
did this we had a lot of green ones
could<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:33.780> picked<00:02:34.440> quite<00:02:34.800> early<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
could be picked quite early in the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.850 
could be picked quite early in the
season<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:36.510> year<00:02:36.840> there's<00:02:37.320> not<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.740> many

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
season this year there's not that many

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.650 
season this year there's not that many
green<00:02:38.160> ones<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.670> we've<00:02:38.820> actually<00:02:39.000> got<00:02:39.330> quite<00:02:39.570> a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
green ones so we've actually got quite a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.720 
green ones so we've actually got quite a
few<00:02:39.930> refuse<00:02:40.680> at<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.040> point<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:41.490> we're<00:02:41.640> gonna

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
few refuse at this point but we're gonna

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.800 
few refuse at this point but we're gonna
float<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.150> more<00:02:42.330> than<00:02:42.450> one

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
float the more than one

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.870 
float the more than one
so<00:02:42.959> once<00:02:43.560> we've<00:02:43.770> floated<00:02:44.160> all<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.340> berries

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
so once we've floated all the berries

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.790 
so once we've floated all the berries
and<00:02:45.209> taking<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> tops<00:02:45.930> or<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.380> take<00:02:46.560> all<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and taking the tops or I take all the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.590 
and taking the tops or I take all the
tops<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.340> put<00:02:47.490> them<00:02:47.610> back<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.209> see<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.480> we

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
tops and put them back in and see if we

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.680 
tops and put them back in and see if we
can<00:02:48.780> get<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.680> bit<00:02:49.830> more<00:02:50.010> yield<00:02:50.450> from<00:02:51.450> our

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
can get a little bit more yield from our

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:09.899 
can get a little bit more yield from our
berries<00:02:53.480> alright<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:55.230> those<00:02:55.410> inhaler

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.809 

it's<00:03:10.909> bit<00:03:11.060> easier<00:03:11.329> to<00:03:11.390> see<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:11.870> but<00:03:12.819> mostly

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
it's bit easier to see here but mostly

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.929 
it's bit easier to see here but mostly
the<00:03:14.000> ones<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.359> float<00:03:14.799> our<00:03:15.799> green<00:03:16.099> unripened

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
the ones that float our green unripened

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.690 
the ones that float our green unripened
berries<00:03:20.769> gonna<00:03:21.769> let<00:03:21.980> me<00:03:22.040> push<00:03:22.219> around<00:03:22.519> they're

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
berries gonna let me push around they're

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.990 
berries gonna let me push around they're
gonna<00:03:22.819> float<00:03:23.060> them<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.420> ones<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:24.349> then

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
gonna float them on the ones and then

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:43.020 
gonna float them on the ones and then
scoop<00:03:26.000> them<00:03:26.180> out

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.470 

just<00:03:43.540> keep<00:03:43.690> doing<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:45.340> repeat<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.030> so

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
just keep doing this we repeat it so

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.130 
just keep doing this we repeat it so
take<00:03:46.810> all<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.170> all<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.220> refuse<00:03:48.610> berries<00:03:49.140> and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
take all the all the refuse berries and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.010 
take all the all the refuse berries and
float<00:03:50.500> them<00:03:50.680> again<00:03:51.480> let's<00:03:52.480> try<00:03:52.569> to<00:03:52.690> get<00:03:52.870> better

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
float them again let's try to get better

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.210 
float them again let's try to get better
yield<00:03:54.030> then<00:03:55.030> what<00:03:55.360> you<00:03:55.480> can<00:03:55.720> do<00:03:55.959> or<00:03:56.709> what<00:03:56.830> we<00:03:57.040> do

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
yield then what you can do or what we do

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.890 
yield then what you can do or what we do
with<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.700> refuse<00:03:58.120> berry<00:03:58.390> since<00:03:58.720> there's

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
with the refuse berry since there's
