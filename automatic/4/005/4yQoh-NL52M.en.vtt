00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
a little bit were there are estimates

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.550 
a little bit were there are estimates
now<00:03:26.150> how<00:03:26.329> much<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.750> recoverable<00:03:27.230> I

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
now how much of this is recoverable I

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.020 
now how much of this is recoverable I
don't<00:03:27.799> know<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.480> 900<00:03:29.480> billion<00:03:30.639> pega<00:03:31.639> pardon

don't know the 900 billion pega pardon

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.280 
don't know the 900 billion pega pardon

yeah 900 million reserves at Eagle Ford

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.009 
yeah 900 million reserves at Eagle Ford
Shale<00:03:36.650> at<00:03:36.859> least<00:03:37.160> it's<00:03:38.150> all<00:03:38.269> about<00:03:38.480> Barkin

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
Shale at least it's all about Barkin

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.050 
Shale at least it's all about Barkin
same<00:03:39.380> kind<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.680> numbers<00:03:39.980> see<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:40.400> 900<00:03:40.880> million

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060

same kind of numbers see it 900 million
is<00:03:41.209> nothing<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.019> world<00:03:42.290> uses<00:03:42.950> 86<00:03:43.850> million

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
is nothing the world uses 86 million

is nothing the world uses 86 million
barrels<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.900> oil<00:03:45.079> every<00:03:45.350> day<00:03:45.950> every<00:03:46.790> day

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
barrels of oil every day every day

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.740 
barrels of oil every day every day
that's<00:03:47.470> 365<00:03:48.470> days<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.340> year<00:03:49.489> do<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.569> arithmetic

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
that's 365 days a year do the arithmetic

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.259 
that's 365 days a year do the arithmetic
we<00:03:51.650> found<00:03:51.889> some<00:03:52.099> big<00:03:52.280> fields<00:03:52.730> off<00:03:52.849> the<00:03:53.030> coast

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
we found some big fields off the coast

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.180 
we found some big fields off the coast
of<00:03:53.389> Brazil<00:03:53.720> we<00:03:53.930> think<00:03:54.200> they<00:03:54.380> say<00:03:54.590> they<00:03:54.829> we<00:03:55.010> have

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
of Brazil we think they say they we have

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.479 
of Brazil we think they say they we have
anyway<00:03:55.639> let's<00:03:56.329> say<00:03:56.599> that<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.959> wildest<00:03:57.769> bald

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
anyway let's say that the wildest bald

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.180 
anyway let's say that the wildest bald
estimate<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.299> correct<00:03:59.349> it<00:04:00.349> adds<00:04:00.620> less<00:04:00.950> than

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
estimate is correct it adds less than

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.370 
estimate is correct it adds less than
two<00:04:01.400> years<00:04:01.430> reserves<00:04:02.299> to<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.690> world<00:04:02.959> without

two years reserves to the world without

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.960 
two years reserves to the world without
me<00:04:03.859> okay<00:04:04.099> i<00:04:04.130> mean<00:04:04.310> i<00:04:04.430> think<00:04:04.639> they<00:04:04.730> talking

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
me okay i mean i think they talking

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.599 
me okay i mean i think they talking
about<00:04:05.230> 2.5<00:04:06.230> billion<00:04:06.680> barrels<00:04:06.859> of<00:04:07.130> total<00:04:07.519> or

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
about 2.5 billion barrels of total or

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
about proven all reserves as well that's

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.180 
about proven all reserves as well that's
even<00:04:11.690> without<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.139> most<00:04:12.349> recent<00:04:12.769> estimates

with<00:04:18.680> we're<00:04:19.039> talking<00:04:19.789> about

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
with we're talking about

with we're talking about
get<00:04:21.269> my<00:04:21.389> trillions<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.079> billions<00:04:23.070> right<00:04:23.430> but

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
get my trillions and billions right but

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.400 
get my trillions and billions right but
I<00:04:23.700> mean<00:04:23.910> base<00:04:24.450> i<00:04:24.630> think<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.870> was<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:24.990> one

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
I mean base i think it was like one

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.360 
I mean base i think it was like one
point<00:04:26.010> one<00:04:27.000> thousand<00:04:27.630> billion<00:04:28.410> barrels<00:04:28.830> left

one point three thousand billion barrels
left<00:04:32.370> i<00:04:32.490> mean<00:04:32.639> they<00:04:32.700> were<00:04:32.790> told<00:04:32.910> me<00:04:33.060> that's<00:04:33.330> 40

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600
