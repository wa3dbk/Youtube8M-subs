00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.130
 Ruben Chess hear what we stand for or a match if they are the ones 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.710
 was played this afternoon 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.069
 throwing the deloitte can regroup 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.509
 it was also like ecolo I think when you get there it was seen 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 I can't say you lost everything in those ten days, but you have to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.230
 have another in your pocket 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.230
 paler wants donner anyway he just got these minutes 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.079
 tomorrow nice at training camp and then we can continue to work ready to steam 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.279
 in front of 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.689
 it says from second team he saw that everyone started a nice song 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.270
 the new year on it was one 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.320
 whatever for the public there is not really a nice competition there I have 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.320
 completely agree it was the level less sloppiness 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.340
 and to little sharpness 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 There are these competitions for a one get a few more and it should be 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.900
 you nevertheless arise when the 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.900
 the two part of the competition starts and that she and pieter out 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.720
 well at training camp no this ditze therefore indicates that it is desperately needed 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.440
 is 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.000
 to work at the bottom or aow or is it always if you only have two days and weeks in it 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.390
 preparation and beer tap would be difficult 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.610
 no it is normal, of course 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.220
 Sometimes it's okay today is no longer with it and also to do with the fact 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.840
 that he 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.070
 in the formation plays with other guys who have joined with 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.200
 all respect that I just did well 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.370
 they don't give it to the regular, then you shouldn't have known some guys that well 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.270
 that is all part of it and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.040
 the one has enough parties on hem 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.720
 watch the video being in shape and that 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.570
 it allowed to show second half 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.149
 so ad today 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.920
 in addition, you are already full of supporters of your nice cilic in four via twitter 

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:36.770
 came the message about July goalkeeper what that pretty badly injured 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.899
 you can play his role how does something like this happen within the player group? 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.700
 that kind of panic is therefore also becoming known to me very quickly 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.890
 actually plays 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.870
 we have it very quickly what is really going on yes 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.880
 Wilders was reviewed very quickly and 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.939
 it has been found that there is no break so that is fine so he 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.330
 also just goes to training camp and 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.070
 this match only came too early and why would you take such a risk 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.130
 match that's it more so it is 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.360
 actually be extinguished a little after a small fire 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.970
 it was also a special tournament this scenario than to see the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.549
 cockpit so that is there 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.629
 a lot of money was collected 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.769
 yes that was what it was all about in the end and you can see this very nice club and a 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.369
 fantastic supporters who always play us 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.849
 and even during such an action again in the cold, animals are simply braving 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:22.889
 so that 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.889
 I don't think it will come much in that regard 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.819
 it is of course fantastic to be able to make less of this 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.069
 nice club of course something everyone can support on the everyone unfortunately 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.389
 in his life r somehow encountered yes unfortunately unfortunately 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.479
 prosperous city in groups on this title too 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.419
 also pays a moment to think about it and especially the people we experience close by 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.199
 so have 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.479
 in short, just very good colorful perspective
