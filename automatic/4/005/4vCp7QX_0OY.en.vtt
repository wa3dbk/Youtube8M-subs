00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
I've personally enjoyed a great deal

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.440 
I've personally enjoyed a great deal
still<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> point<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.700> kind<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:02.969> system

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
still to the point what kind of system

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.149 
still to the point what kind of system
wallet<00:02:03.780> use<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> camping<00:02:04.799> if<00:02:04.950> they

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
wallet use for the camping if they

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.130 
wallet use for the camping if they
actually<00:02:05.369> introduce<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.149> or<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.600> campaigns

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
actually introduce one or the campaigns

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.770 
actually introduce one or the campaigns
well<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.280> personally<00:02:08.910> hope<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:09.660> it's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
well I personally hope and I think it's

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.530 
well I personally hope and I think it's
reasonable<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.229> ask<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:11.069> from<00:02:11.370> EA<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:12.300> they

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
reasonable to ask this from EA that they

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.320 
reasonable to ask this from EA that they
in<00:02:12.599> true<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
in true that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.700

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
campaigns at once if you so desire I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.610 
campaigns at once if you so desire I
think<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.720> would<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.050> good<00:02:38.230> system

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
think that that would be a good system

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.320 
think that that would be a good system
might<00:02:38.770> be<00:02:38.950> willing<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.310> spend<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.700> know<00:02:39.760> thirty

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
might be willing to spend I know thirty

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.160 
might be willing to spend I know thirty
dollars<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:41.290> all<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.830> campaigns<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.430> think

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
dollars for all the campaigns I think

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.080 
dollars for all the campaigns I think
more<00:02:44.170> even<00:02:44.500> maybe<00:02:44.740> forty<00:02:45.340> dollars<00:02:45.730> i<00:02:45.850> think

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
more even maybe forty dollars i think

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.380 
more even maybe forty dollars i think
that<00:02:46.540> would<00:02:46.690> be<00:02:47.100> relatively<00:02:48.100> ok<00:02:48.550> i<00:02:48.790> wouldn't

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
that would be relatively ok i wouldn't

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.030 
that would be relatively ok i wouldn't
be<00:02:49.480> very<00:02:49.720> happy<00:02:49.990> about<00:02:50.230> spending<00:02:50.620> forty

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
be very happy about spending forty

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.490 
be very happy about spending forty
dollars<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.640> what<00:02:52.030> 40<00:02:52.450> missions<00:02:52.660> or<00:02:53.260> perhaps

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
dollars on what 40 missions or perhaps

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.310 
dollars on what 40 missions or perhaps
more<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.300> add<00:02:55.870> accepted<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:59.020> yeah<00:02:59.140> that's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
more but I add accepted so yeah that's

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.770 
more but I add accepted so yeah that's
how<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.830> personally<00:03:00.580> would<00:03:00.940> want<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.570> system

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
how I personally would want the system

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.100 
how I personally would want the system
to<00:03:01.990> be<00:03:02.170> made<00:03:02.350> or<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:03.330> best<00:03:04.330> solution<00:03:04.900> though<00:03:05.080> I

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
to be made or the best solution though I

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.190 
to be made or the best solution though I
think<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.730> perhaps<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:07.150> bit<00:03:07.390> one<00:03:07.660> reasonable

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
think it's perhaps a bit one reasonable

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.720 
think it's perhaps a bit one reasonable
is<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.620> they<00:03:08.890> give<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.130> all<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.459> missions

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
is that they give you all the missions

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.810 
is that they give you all the missions
for<00:03:09.880> free<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.420> just<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:11.260> buy<00:03:11.440> skins<00:03:11.890> for

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
for free and you just can buy skins for

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.810 
for free and you just can buy skins for
your<00:03:13.120> units<00:03:13.510> or<00:03:13.750> your<00:03:14.320> faction<00:03:14.920> or<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.700> know

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
your units or your faction or you know

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.970 
your units or your faction or you know
the<00:03:16.420> faction<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.110> skins<00:03:17.380> were<00:03:17.530> fat<00:03:17.800> the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
the faction the skins were fat the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.340 
the faction the skins were fat the
faction<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.550> scan<00:03:18.760> for<00:03:19.000> units<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.019> think<00:03:20.230> that

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
faction and scan for units I think that

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.210 
faction and scan for units I think that
would<00:03:20.470> be<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:21.730> very<00:03:22.510> very<00:03:22.810> good<00:03:23.590> system<00:03:23.860> for<00:03:24.070> the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
would be a very very good system for the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.009 
would be a very very good system for the
consumer<00:03:24.790> but<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.269> know<00:03:25.360> there<00:03:25.600> are<00:03:25.630> things

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
consumer but you know there are things

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.560 
consumer but you know there are things
you<00:03:26.709> can<00:03:26.920> reasonably<00:03:27.489> expect<00:03:27.640> from<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.300> company

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
you can reasonably expect from a company

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.390 
you can reasonably expect from a company
and<00:03:28.810> things<00:03:29.050> that<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.350> can't<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.070> think

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
and things that you can't and I think

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.100 
and things that you can't and I think
it's<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.910> bit<00:03:31.060> too<00:03:31.090> much<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.570> ask<00:03:31.600> them<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.989> give

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
it's a bit too much to ask them to give

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.020 
it's a bit too much to ask them to give
you<00:03:32.260> all<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.530> missions<00:03:32.830> for<00:03:32.980> free<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.459> then

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
you all the missions for free and then

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.540 
you all the missions for free and then
add<00:03:34.269> skins<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.810> think<00:03:35.500> they<00:03:35.620> will<00:03:35.890> add<00:03:36.100> skins

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
add skins I think they will add skins

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.250 
add skins I think they will add skins
and<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.150> think<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.510> you'll<00:03:37.630> be<00:03:37.810> able<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.140> get

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
and I think that you'll be able to get

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.720 
and I think that you'll be able to get
them<00:03:38.440> for<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.620> campaign<00:03:39.070> but<00:03:39.370> you'll

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
them for the campaign but you'll

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.400 
them for the campaign but you'll
probably<00:03:40.030> also<00:03:40.239> have<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:41.050> buy<00:03:41.170> each

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
probably also have to buy each

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.940 
probably also have to buy each
individual<00:03:42.070> mission<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.560> said<00:03:44.800> I'm<00:03:44.920> fine

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
individual mission as I said I'm fine

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.530 
individual mission as I said I'm fine

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
with that the worst system they could do

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.360 
with that the worst system they could do
is<00:03:49.750> make<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.200> similar<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.680> tiberian<00:03:51.340> twilight
