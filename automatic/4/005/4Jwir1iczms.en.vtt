00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
4 amps for the fastest charge so on 4

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.810 
4 amps for the fastest charge so on 4
amps<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.030> will<00:00:45.210> charge<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:46.140> 7<00:00:46.739> cell<00:00:46.950> look

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
amps this will charge a 7 cell look

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.110 
amps this will charge a 7 cell look
metal<00:00:48.059> hydride<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.129> 40<00:00:50.129> about<00:00:50.610> 40<00:00:50.940> minutes

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
metal hydride and 40 about 40 minutes

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.189 
metal hydride and 40 about 40 minutes
it'll<00:00:52.079> charge<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.680> 6<00:00:52.920> cell<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:54.360> half<00:00:55.079> an

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
it'll charge a 6 cell in about half an

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.310 
it'll charge a 6 cell in about half an
hour<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.730> fast<00:00:56.969> charger<00:00:57.480> but

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
hour so it's a really fast charger but

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.479 
hour so it's a really fast charger but
one<00:00:58.530> thing<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> note<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.969> does<00:01:00.180> come<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
one thing to note it does come with the

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
one thing to note it does come with the
tamia<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:03.030> molex<00:01:04.670> charging<00:01:05.670> head<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
tamia or molex charging head so you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.219 
tamia or molex charging head so you
you're<00:01:08.280> either<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.119> cut<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.510> off<00:01:09.720> or

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you're either have to cut that off or

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
you're either have to cut that off or
buy<00:01:10.860> an<00:01:11.010> adapter

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
buy an adapter

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
buy an adapter
tami<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.840> female<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:15.080> Traxxas<00:01:16.080> male<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
tami a female to Traxxas male then you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
tami a female to Traxxas male then you
plug<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.500> that<00:01:20.659> will<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.780> trick

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
plug that in and that will do the trick

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.429 
plug that in and that will do the trick
for<00:01:22.890> charging<00:01:23.369> Traxxas<00:01:23.790> batteries<00:01:24.439> other

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
for charging Traxxas batteries other

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.840 
for charging Traxxas batteries other
than<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.040> i<00:01:26.070> said<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.580> cut

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
than that like i said you can just cut

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
than that like i said you can just cut
it<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.280> won't<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.610> able<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it off but then you won't be able to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.499 
it off but then you won't be able to
adapt<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> whatever<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> choose<00:01:32.509> whatever

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
adapt so whatever you choose whatever

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.870 
adapt so whatever you choose whatever
night<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.579> good<00:01:35.579> charger<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.960> has<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.880> cord

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
night for you good charger it has a cord

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.319 
night for you good charger it has a cord
which<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.340> wrap<00:01:41.340> around<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.939> shorten<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
which you can wrap around to shorten it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.319 
which you can wrap around to shorten it
or<00:01:42.450> unwrap<00:01:42.960> around<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.500> lengthen<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.329> plugs

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
or unwrap around to lengthen it plugs

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.249 
or unwrap around to lengthen it plugs
into<00:01:45.509> normal<00:01:46.200> well<00:01:46.380> american<00:01:46.979> connector<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
into normal well american connector and

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.480 
into normal well american connector and
it<00:01:49.259> costs<00:01:49.740> $40<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.720> $40<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.439> get<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> high

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it costs $40 so for $40 you get a high

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.859 
it costs $40 so for $40 you get a high
