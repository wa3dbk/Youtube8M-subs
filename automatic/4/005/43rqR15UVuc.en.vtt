00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
know I'm not sure that's gonna be a big

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.940 
know I'm not sure that's gonna be a big
production<00:00:46.300> out<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.630> them<00:00:46.840> aging<00:00:47.500> Ray<00:00:47.620> Allen

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
production out of them aging Ray Allen

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.940 
production out of them aging Ray Allen
they're<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.780> big<00:00:50.080> fan<00:00:50.260> of<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.470> coach<00:00:50.680> now

they're not a big fan of the coach now
in<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:52.000> situation<00:00:52.060> I<00:00:52.870> think<00:00:53.050> it's<00:00:53.380> gonna<00:00:53.500> be

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
in this situation I think it's gonna be

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.140 
in this situation I think it's gonna be
harder<00:00:53.860> than<00:00:53.890> ever<00:00:54.190> to<00:00:54.280> motivate<00:00:54.820> these<00:00:54.940> guys

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
harder than ever to motivate these guys

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.240 
harder than ever to motivate these guys
during<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.900> season<00:00:56.260> this<00:00:56.590> might<00:00:56.860> be<00:00:56.950> a<00:00:56.980> team

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
during the season this might be a team

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.620 
during the season this might be a team
you<00:00:57.370> know<00:00:57.490> like<00:00:57.640> an<00:00:57.730> old<00:00:57.880> Celtics<00:00:58.360> team<00:00:58.480> they

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
you know like an old Celtics team they

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.450 
you know like an old Celtics team they
might<00:00:58.810> pick<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.110> up<00:00:59.260> playoff<00:00:59.980> time<00:01:00.190> I'm<00:01:00.340> not

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
might pick it up playoff time I'm not

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.010 
might pick it up playoff time I'm not
going<00:01:00.610> to<00:01:00.670> count<00:01:01.090> them<00:01:01.240> out<00:01:01.270> playoff<00:01:01.660> time<00:01:01.840> but

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
going to count them out playoff time but

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.780 
going to count them out playoff time but
during<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.590> season<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.160> think<00:01:03.550> you're<00:01:03.670> gonna

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
during the season I think you're gonna

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.149 
during the season I think you're gonna
get<00:01:03.940> some<00:01:04.119> good<00:01:04.360> value<00:01:04.869> I<00:01:05.229> think<00:01:05.710> their<00:01:05.860> number

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
get some good value I think their number

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.679 
get some good value I think their number
is<00:01:06.189> going<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.369> be<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> little<00:01:06.820> bit<00:01:07.000> inflated<00:01:07.390> I

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
is going to be a little bit inflated I

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.050 
is going to be a little bit inflated I
don't<00:01:08.079> see<00:01:08.320> them<00:01:08.799> giving<00:01:09.219> it<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.640> know<00:01:09.759> that

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
don't see them giving it you know that

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.300

was it 61 so boy le play a that's a lot

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.379 
was it 61 so boy le play a that's a lot
of<00:01:26.710> ways<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.579> lot<00:01:27.759> of<00:01:27.819> winners<00:01:28.090> right

it's only 82 games and I think it'd take
a<00:01:29.979> dollar<00:01:30.219> sixty-five<00:01:30.759> right<00:01:31.420> around<00:01:31.600> there

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
a dollar sixty-five right around there

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.660 
a dollar sixty-five right around there
may<00:01:31.960> be<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.079> dollar<00:01:32.259> sixty<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.829> win<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:33.219> NBA<00:01:33.369> so

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
may be a dollar sixty to win the NBA so

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.789 
may be a dollar sixty to win the NBA so
you're<00:01:34.389> obviously<00:01:34.749> some<00:01:35.049> very<00:01:35.289> high<00:01:35.530> hopes

for a team that does have talent and is
the<00:01:38.319> defending<00:01:38.740> champion<00:01:39.069> but<00:01:39.189> a<00:01:39.219> lot<00:01:39.429> of

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.380 
less coached the team and we've seen
that<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:19.960> LA<00:03:20.590> he's<00:03:20.890> not<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.520> coach<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:21.910> wins

half you could take anywhere from about

half you could take anywhere from about
a<00:03:52.540> dollar<00:03:52.900> eighty<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.710> two<00:03:53.890> dollars<00:03:54.340> for<00:03:54.580> them

to<00:03:54.820> win<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.120> NBA<00:03:55.240> not<00:03:56.170> much<00:03:56.530> value<00:03:57.010> there<00:03:57.220> and

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
to win the NBA not much value there and

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.070 
to win the NBA not much value there and
we've<00:03:57.460> got<00:03:57.580> a<00:03:57.610> long<00:03:57.940> way<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.420> go<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.720> have<00:03:59.020> to

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
we've got a long way to go you have to

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.620 
we've got a long way to go you have to
hope<00:03:59.260> knowing<00:03:59.830> no<00:04:00.160> injuries<00:04:00.550> and<00:04:00.820> aging<00:04:01.330> stars

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.770 
hope knowing no injuries and aging stars
I<00:04:01.960> mean<00:04:02.110> between<00:04:02.380> Nash<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:03.100> Kobe<00:04:03.460> both<00:04:04.090> on<00:04:04.390> the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
I mean between Nash and Kobe both on the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.400 
I mean between Nash and Kobe both on the
wrong<00:04:04.960> side<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.440> 35<00:04:06.430> is<00:04:07.060> Kobe<00:04:07.600> 35<00:04:07.990> like

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
wrong side of 35 is Kobe 35 like

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.290 
wrong side of 35 is Kobe 35 like
something<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:09.220> i<00:04:09.340> think<00:04:09.520> opee's<00:04:09.790> kind<00:04:10.210> of

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
something and i think opee's kind of

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.640 
something and i think opee's kind of
been<00:04:10.480> putting<00:04:10.960> the<00:04:11.020> whole<00:04:11.110> team<00:04:11.350> on<00:04:11.500> his<00:04:11.620> back

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
been putting the whole team on his back

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.400 
been putting the whole team on his back
you<00:04:12.310> know<00:04:12.400> i'll<00:04:12.700> send<00:04:13.090> these<00:04:13.240> new<00:04:13.450> guys<00:04:13.630> I<00:04:13.810> you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
you know i'll send these new guys I you

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.690 
you know i'll send these new guys I you
hit<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.680> on<00:04:14.740> the<00:04:14.800> head<00:04:14.890> with<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.130> chemistry<00:04:15.610> I

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
hit it on the head with a chemistry I

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.000 
hit it on the head with a chemistry I
think<00:04:16.150> fading<00:04:16.900> then<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.200> first<00:04:17.500> half<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:17.950> the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
think fading then the first half of the

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.670 
think fading then the first half of the
year<00:04:18.210> you<00:04:19.210> know<00:04:19.330> could<00:04:19.600> be<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.750> good<00:04:20.350> spot<00:04:20.650> here

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
year you know could be a good spot here

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.950 
year you know could be a good spot here
i<00:04:20.859> think<00:04:21.030> till<00:04:22.030> they<00:04:22.150> get<00:04:22.240> adjusted<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:22.810> you

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
i think till they get adjusted and you

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840 
i think till they get adjusted and you
know<00:04:23.260> follow<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.710> games<00:04:23.890> watching<00:04:24.250> will<00:04:24.820> know

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
know follow the games watching will know

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.700 
know follow the games watching will know
when<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.570> looks<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:25.960> they're<00:04:26.110> kicking<00:04:26.440> year

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
when it looks like they're kicking year

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.690 
when it looks like they're kicking year
but<00:04:26.830> i<00:04:26.860> think<00:04:27.130> it's<00:04:27.220> going<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.370> be<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> while

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
but i think it's going to be a while

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.590 
but i think it's going to be a while
before<00:04:27.910> they<00:04:28.180> get<00:04:28.300> things<00:04:28.479> going<00:04:28.780> I'm<00:04:29.110> going

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
before they get things going I'm going

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.390 
before they get things going I'm going
in<00:04:29.720> a<00:04:30.020> little<00:04:30.230> bit<00:04:30.350> further<00:04:30.680> down<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.160> ladder

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
in a little bit further down the ladder

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.800 
in a little bit further down the ladder
but<00:04:31.640> a<00:04:31.670> team<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:31.970> was<00:04:32.210> pretty<00:04:32.480> good<00:04:32.600> last

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
but a team that was pretty good last

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.380 
but a team that was pretty good last
year<00:04:33.470> I'm<00:04:33.680> going<00:04:34.220> with<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.400> Indiana<00:04:35.150> Pacers

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
year I'm going with the Indiana Pacers

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.680 
year I'm going with the Indiana Pacers
their<00:04:36.290> season<00:04:36.680> win<00:04:36.890> total<00:04:37.220> as<00:04:37.340> 51<00:04:38.000> now<00:04:38.510> if<00:04:38.570> you

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
their season win total as 51 now if you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.050 
their season win total as 51 now if you
look<00:04:38.870> at<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.140> team<00:04:39.440> they<00:04:40.160> did<00:04:40.460> nothing<00:04:40.910> in

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
look at that team they did nothing in

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.970 
look at that team they did nothing in
the<00:04:41.090> offseason<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.900> improve<00:04:42.290> themselves<00:04:42.530> I

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
the offseason to improve themselves I

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.740 
the offseason to improve themselves I
think<00:04:43.280> they<00:04:43.430> were<00:04:43.490> an<00:04:43.640> overachieving<00:04:44.390> team

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
think they were an overachieving team

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.660 
think they were an overachieving team
last<00:04:44.990> year<00:04:45.170> okay<00:04:45.890> you<00:04:46.220> know<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.370> give<00:04:46.580> them

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
last year okay you know I give them

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.520 
last year okay you know I give them
credit<00:04:46.850> for<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.330> think<00:04:47.600> that's<00:04:47.750> great<00:04:48.020> but

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080

won in overtime games last year they

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.640 
won in overtime games last year they
played<00:05:04.910> hard<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.510> what<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:05.780> was<00:05:05.930> they<00:05:06.440> played

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
played hard is what it was they played

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.140 
played hard is what it was they played
hard<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:07.010> then<00:05:07.190> they<00:05:07.430> had<00:05:07.640> a<00:05:07.670> couple<00:05:08.000> of

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
hard and then they had a couple of

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.780 
hard and then they had a couple of
streaks<00:05:08.510> are<00:05:08.660> very<00:05:08.960> streaky<00:05:09.410> they<00:05:10.280> had<00:05:10.520> a

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
streaks are very streaky they had a

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.760 
streaks are very streaky they had a
five-game<00:05:11.570> losing<00:05:11.780> streak<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.410> four-game

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
five-game losing streak in a four-game

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.040 
five-game losing streak in a four-game
losing<00:05:13.220> streak<00:05:13.460> that's<00:05:13.820> not<00:05:14.090> outrageous<00:05:14.690> but

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
losing streak that's not outrageous but

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.360 
losing streak that's not outrageous but
if<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.230> look<00:05:15.380> at<00:05:15.530> those<00:05:15.710> streaks<00:05:16.010> it's<00:05:16.220> when

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
if you look at those streaks it's when

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.730 
if you look at those streaks it's when
they<00:05:16.490> went<00:05:16.670> on<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:17.180> road<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:18.080> play<00:05:18.320> tough

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
they went on the road to play tough

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.860 
they went on the road to play tough
opponents<00:05:19.520> so<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:19.940> think<00:05:20.030> that's<00:05:20.270> right<00:05:20.570> there

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
opponents so I think that's right there

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.920 
opponents so I think that's right there
that<00:05:21.430> yeah<00:05:22.430> they<00:05:22.640> hospital<00:05:23.300> a<00:05:23.420> team<00:05:23.720> they're

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
that yeah they hospital a team they're

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.510 
that yeah they hospital a team they're
not<00:05:24.080> an<00:05:24.230> elite<00:05:24.560> team<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.950> I<00:05:24.980> think<00:05:25.190> right<00:05:25.340> now

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
not an elite team and I think right now

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.580 
not an elite team and I think right now
if<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:25.700> look<00:05:25.820> at<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.000> 51<00:05:26.570> win<00:05:26.810> total<00:05:27.230> you're

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
if you look at a 51 win total you're

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.520 
if you look at a 51 win total you're
putting<00:05:27.950> them<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:29.330> know<00:05:29.420> I<00:05:29.600> mean<00:05:29.780> 59<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.470> a

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
putting them you know I mean 59 and a

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.110 
putting them you know I mean 59 and a
half<00:05:30.560> as<00:05:31.040> Oklahoma<00:05:31.460> City<00:05:31.670> and<00:05:31.760> eight<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.000> half

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
half as Oklahoma City and eight and half

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.360 
half as Oklahoma City and eight and half
winds<00:05:32.390> is<00:05:32.510> an<00:05:32.600> awful<00:05:32.870> lot<00:05:32.960> Denver's<00:05:33.680> 51<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.310> a

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
winds is an awful lot Denver's 51 and a

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.710 
winds is an awful lot Denver's 51 and a
half<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:34.580> think<00:05:34.610> Denver's<00:05:35.060> gonna<00:05:35.210> be<00:05:35.270> very<00:05:35.480> good

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
half I think Denver's gonna be very good

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.540 
half I think Denver's gonna be very good
this<00:05:35.900> year<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.560> know<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:36.800> they're<00:05:36.980> right<00:05:37.310> up

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
this year you know so they're right up

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.090 
this year you know so they're right up
there<00:05:37.790> in<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.750> end<00:05:38.930> of<00:05:39.110> certainly<00:05:39.740> on<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.830> top

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
there in the end of certainly on the top

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.890 
there in the end of certainly on the top
half<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.700> the<00:05:40.760> league<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:41.180> top<00:05:41.360> quarter<00:05:41.810> of

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
half of the league the top quarter of

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.450 
half of the league the top quarter of
the<00:05:41.990> league<00:05:42.170> I<00:05:42.380> don't<00:05:43.010> think<00:05:43.250> they're<00:05:43.370> going

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
the league I don't think they're going

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.740 
the league I don't think they're going
to<00:05:43.550> be<00:05:43.640> that<00:05:43.820> good<00:05:44.000> I<00:05:44.060> think<00:05:44.150> they<00:05:44.360> come<00:05:44.600> back

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
to be that good I think they come back

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.660 
to be that good I think they come back
down<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:44.990> earth<00:05:45.110> a<00:05:45.380> little<00:05:45.470> bit<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:45.920> I<00:05:46.490> also

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
down to earth a little bit and I also

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.280 
down to earth a little bit and I also
think<00:05:46.940> that's<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.270> kind<00:05:47.480> of<00:05:47.510> team<00:05:47.720> come

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
think that's the kind of team come

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.020 
think that's the kind of team come
playoff<00:05:48.500> time<00:05:48.650> you<00:05:49.310> really<00:05:49.610> want<00:05:49.790> to<00:05:49.850> bet

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
playoff time you really want to bet

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.760 
playoff time you really want to bet
against<00:05:50.450> because<00:05:50.780> it<00:05:50.960> really<00:05:51.200> does<00:05:51.500> come<00:05:51.710> down

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
against because it really does come down

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.650 
against because it really does come down
the<00:05:52.010> matchups<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.640> playoffs<00:05:53.000> listen<00:05:53.570> you

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
the matchups and the playoffs listen you

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.170 
the matchups and the playoffs listen you
have<00:05:53.750> a<00:05:53.810> seven-game<00:05:54.290> series<00:05:54.560> my<00:05:55.340> guy<00:05:55.640> has<00:05:55.970> to
