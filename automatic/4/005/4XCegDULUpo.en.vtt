00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 this 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.329
 Why 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.539
 74 people were affected that means development concept 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:18.740
 durable 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.380
 in any case for all the services of industrial payments technologies 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.380
 until then used for the individual house 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.259
 the main motivation when building a diplomatic building 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.190
 it is above all for the respect of the environment and then the passion for 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.030
 for the bio construction and reconstruction anyway the song 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.010
 to have 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.470
 the master of craftsmanship 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.160
 who is interested in ecology 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.520
 and so only for his 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.969
 the realization of its industrial building 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.150
 wanted to answer a 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.410
 some curious match procedures 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.630
 and so we used his wills 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.440
 to produce a rather original volumetry of the industrial building 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.299
 created in 1998 with two employees 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.699
 and specialized in the design and prefabrication of installations 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.609
 the company today has two agencies when everything is 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.609
 possible in addition to the head office pass 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.670
 it is with a certain pride that frank makes us visit the new 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.980
 building he describes his performance installations as the 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.640
 geothermal heating 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 where is the dual flow mechanical ventilation the balance sheet the fact that the operation 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.120
 resulted in zero 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.560
 according to 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
 the biggest peculiarity of buildings have stalled in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 more passionate who allows to have a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.290
 solar gains 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.380
 in his grave today remains and it is cold and yet 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.290
 we have a small ray of sun and it does not heat the TV then we have 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.980
 heat pumps if it's going to heat the offices 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.420
 a solar water heater with panels to arms and recovers speaks more 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.230
 teaching fights that go through the journeys 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.010
 we heat the volume that was inside so as the sun is 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.930
 very low in winter it warms 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.810
 in summer much higher for papeete building turns into takes to 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.870
 provide adds a cap 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.440
 it takes about 15 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.960
 I'm going to the die 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.349
 outside do it 15.30 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.319
 it is also for the comfort of employees above all 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.319
 indeed small building the room 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.359
 really his clue remember his team Saturday 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.609
 the end of summer 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.180
 it's nice to know that m five nations of the tube city ims 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:32.089
 so it seems useless when we arrive in the industrial area the first 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.980
 something that we see 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.360
 it's the corner of the building the office that's theirs and that's also 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.109
 home 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.039
 not there reported by a screen and metal that allowed to have a 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:46.629
 semi transparent his homework more or less what was happening in the red the 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:47.239
 rau 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.859
 office building m 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.919
 humans in the sense that we celebrate the master of craftsmanship 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:52.519
 I want everything 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.030
 one day an interaction besides his staff and him and so that it was 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.829
 translated into the architectured by totally open spaces and there 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.099
 games of transparency the visual that allows to see everything that will happen 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.290
 in the building enclosure in this it is very user-friendly so obviously 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.970
 full 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.669
 the people who held me all its aspects 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.219
 quiz and big spaces that can communicate with each other she takes a 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.219
 quietly coffee finally enjoy working 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.949
 the chief said all his debts 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.269
 it gives a little over 6% 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.189
 affected by this recall 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.709
 karin when he said that a year ago everything was done to be in 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.359
 vacation together 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.599
 instead of 6 5% and 6% and 13% at closing 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.649
 all tracks were done by ourselves 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.489
 so that I find a little more than 10% 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.539
 to take over 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.599
 but I did some tests with my team and that was nice 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.029
 we worked very late at night the eighth finals 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.539
 and here it is a notion that makes a lot of exchanges with employees 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.999
 but somewhere everyone has but only his little stone in the building 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:00.589
 this achievement however it is economical 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:02.789
 a difficult environment 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.789
 in diplomatic missions 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.059
 here is one 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.839
 the united states hold
