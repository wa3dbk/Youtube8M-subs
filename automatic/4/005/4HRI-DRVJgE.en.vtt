players<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:41.120> there's<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.390> few<00:02:41.450> things<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.990> I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
players so there's a few things that I

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.210 
players so there's a few things that I
guess<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.410> should<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:42.590> come<00:02:42.770> right<00:02:43.040> out<00:02:43.100> and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
guess I should just come right out and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.550 
guess I should just come right out and
say<00:02:43.400> first<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.090> all<00:02:44.210> Camelot<00:02:44.750> unchained<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
currently working on well it's going to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.070 
currently working on well it's going to
be<00:02:49.580> subscription-based<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.720> guess<00:02:50.930> it's

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
be subscription-based so I guess it's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.420 
be subscription-based so I guess it's
not<00:02:51.200> surprising<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.890> he's<00:02:52.130> sort<00:02:52.370> of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
not surprising that he's sort of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.610 
not surprising that he's sort of
slamming<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.030> free-to-play<00:02:53.450> model<00:02:53.870> although

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
slamming the free-to-play model although

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.930 
slamming the free-to-play model although
I<00:02:54.650> guess<00:02:54.800> he<00:02:55.010> really<00:02:55.160> does<00:02:55.430> make<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.670> lot<00:02:55.790> of

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
I guess he really does make a lot of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.940 
I guess he really does make a lot of
good<00:02:56.150> points<00:02:56.360> besides<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.140> notion<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.770> a

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
lot of these free-to-play games rely on

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.930

another<00:03:04.700> problem<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.240> how<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.690> going<00:03:05.900> to

them<00:03:13.790> are<00:03:13.880> actually<00:03:14.030> going<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.570> survive

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
them are actually going to survive

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.600 
them are actually going to survive
although<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.650> guess<00:03:15.800> on<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.070> flip<00:03:16.340> side<00:03:16.370> of

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
although I guess on the flip side of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.460 
although I guess on the flip side of
that<00:03:16.790> as<00:03:17.180> more<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.510> more<00:03:17.600> free-to-play<00:03:18.200> games

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
that as more and more free-to-play games

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.410 
that as more and more free-to-play games
