kind<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> packaging<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:04.890> your<00:02:05.009> cotton

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
kind of packaging so you put your cotton

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
kind of packaging so you put your cotton
pad<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.700> push<00:02:06.030> down<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.799> dispenses

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
pad and you push down in it dispenses

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.309 
pad and you push down in it dispenses
the<00:02:07.860> product<00:02:08.220> into<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.599> this<00:02:09.599> smells<00:02:09.840> awful

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the product into it this smells awful

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.680 
the product into it this smells awful
and<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.950> really<00:02:11.580> do<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:11.970> how<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.330> feels
