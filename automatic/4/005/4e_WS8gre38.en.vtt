I<00:00:38.700> think<00:00:39.700> obviously<00:00:40.170> England<00:00:41.170> is<00:00:41.320> a<00:00:41.350> bit

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
football crazy I think you can't really

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.510 
football crazy I think you can't really
get<00:00:43.180> away<00:00:43.210> from<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.660> wherever<00:00:43.840> you<00:00:44.020> go<00:00:44.520> so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
get away from it wherever you go so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
obviously as always the first sport that

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.920 
obviously as always the first sport that
you<00:00:47.949> play<00:00:48.129> when<00:00:48.340> your<00:00:48.519> kid<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.690> going

away always football and at school and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.060 
away always football and at school and
things<00:00:52.210> like<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:53.530> it's<00:00:53.769> just<00:00:53.800> part

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
things like that so and it's just part

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.490 
things like that so and it's just part
of<00:00:54.220> culture<00:00:54.400> but<00:00:54.699> I<00:00:55.000> think<00:00:55.420> yeah<00:00:55.570> it's<00:00:55.870> just<00:00:56.199> I

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
of culture but I think yeah it's just I

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.439 
of culture but I think yeah it's just I
think<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.280> think<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:57.730> bubbling<00:00:58.089> from<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.360> my

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
think I think the bubbling from of my

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.090 
think I think the bubbling from of my
family<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:59.110> I<00:00:59.140> think<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.530> was<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.680> different

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
family so I think that was a different

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.250 
family so I think that was a different
magic<00:01:00.460> way<00:01:00.699> and<00:01:00.879> obviously<00:01:01.239> I<00:01:01.390> still<00:01:01.659> still

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
magic way and obviously I still still

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.889 
magic way and obviously I still still
