00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.780
 ah 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.610
 charles and other chavalas how about 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.170
 you are here I bring you a video rather 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.970
 informative you already know that not only upload 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.560
 of this kind of videos but as I watched 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.090
 many people interested in the subject of 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.640
 secondary channel and so on 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.410
 I would like to advise all of you who are 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.330
 in the channel of best friends there is a 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.769
 secondary channel a channel that is wrong 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.449
 called secondary because it really is 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.150
 a personal channel is a channel that only 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.680
 I do alfonso 3 go up will continue 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.449
 doing instead and friends and I will continue 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.309
 doing also time and friends but like 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.900
 there is a lot of material that I would like to upload 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.850
 and in the end I do not do it because instead and 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.100
 friends I do not want to impede the videos of 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.200
 I do not want to bother my 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.149
 own videos is to say if there is a live 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.739
 am and a live does not seem so good 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.570
 as a guide then I do not upload it anymore 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.100
 because I want the guide to be more 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.079
 time in the feed that the guide looks like 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.030
 the guide has a lot more work then 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.829
 for that kind of content that maybe 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.930
 be a little less elaborate but that 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.430
 It is also good to have it because many 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.289
 Sometimes I say interesting things. 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.000
 saying more or less the same thing that I'm going 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.550
 saying the guides I say it also in 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.369
 the likes but rather some theme of 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.740
 which are brushstrokes for example I just 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.049
 upload now a video talking about the n 94 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.170
 silenced in a variant of which not 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.360
 I could talk in the guide why 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.250
 a very difficult variant to analyze in 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.960
 two minutes as much that is two 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.390
 minutes for the same variant in the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.700
 guide is a very long time with which 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.740
 I preferred to analyze it in a live and talk to you 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.890
 well what is it going on and what do you see 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.720
 in situ how does this weapon work 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.100
 silenced and what is your strong point 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.200
 what is your weak point and where do you have to 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.270
 use it with which for this will be the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.220
 secondary channel to bring brushstrokes 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.380
 that increase what all that 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.990
 we know with the subject of guides and so on 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.119
 so to have even more knowledge I hope 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.740
 that are so particular that they do not 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.720
 they deserve a whole video a whole guide 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.369
 and also to bring different games 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.869
 et cetera et cetera etcetera so if 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.580
 you are interested in what I do in 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.659
 say friends go through the channel 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.549
 secondary you have in the description 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.319
 because I basically do the same thing just 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.149
 that a little less elaborated and a 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.560
 little bit more in family talking in life 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.789
 et cetera etcetera so greetings 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.739
 kids see you on my channel 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.209
 secondary and as always when I make a 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.920
 informative video that you know was not going 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.180
 to be monetized and please do not 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.370
 deis a like et cetera etcetera etcetera 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.530
 this video is only to inform you so 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.819
 which is as if it were not and soon 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.890
 I will also erase it, that is, it will be a 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.820
 couple of days so a greeting and we 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.820
 we see on the battlefield
