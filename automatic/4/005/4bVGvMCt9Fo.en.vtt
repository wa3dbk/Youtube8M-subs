of different cuts let's start here at

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.389 
of different cuts let's start here at
the<00:00:43.170> small<00:00:43.440> end<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.770> these<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> quarter

the small end and these are the quarter
inch<00:00:44.550> blades<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> typically<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
inch blades and this is typically the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
inch blades and this is typically the
smallest<00:00:46.710> you're<00:00:46.920> gonna<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.309> your

wide<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> half<00:01:54.899> inch<00:01:55.110> play<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> lets<00:01:55.649> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
wide as a half inch play that lets you

turn
but<00:01:56.299> tighter<00:01:56.539> here<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.590> 3/8<00:01:57.950> plate<00:01:58.219> is<00:01:58.460> a

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
but tighter here so the 3/8 plate is a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.459 
but tighter here so the 3/8 plate is a
nice<00:01:58.729> one<00:01:58.969> for<00:01:59.000> doing<00:01:59.329> smaller<00:01:59.840> Bowl<00:02:00.109> blanks

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
nice one for doing smaller Bowl blanks

if you're doing larger bowls you might

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.510 
if you're doing larger bowls you might
want<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.450> come<00:02:02.570> over<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:02.990> 1/2<00:02:03.170> inch<00:02:03.520> the

want to come over to the 1/2 inch the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.609 
want to come over to the 1/2 inch the

half inch plates drop down a tooth and

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.669 
half inch plates drop down a tooth and
they<00:02:06.710> go<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:07.009> 3<00:02:07.369> toothbrush<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.209> also<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> 14

start doing straight line resign I start
moving<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.870> bigger<00:02:39.049> blades<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:40.099> next

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
moving to bigger blades the next

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.100 
moving to bigger blades the next
selection<00:02:40.610> up<00:02:40.879> gets<00:02:41.209> into<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.569> 3/4<00:02:42.079> inch

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
selection up gets into the 3/4 inch

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.800 
selection up gets into the 3/4 inch
blade<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.590> we've<00:02:42.709> got<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:42.860> 3/4<00:02:43.459> by<00:02:43.849> 3<00:02:44.120> TBI<00:02:44.480> right

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
blade and we've got a 3/4 by 3 TBI right

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.140 
blade and we've got a 3/4 by 3 TBI right
here<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.739> again<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.129> is<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> fast<00:02:46.879> cutting

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
here and again this is a fast cutting

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.420 
here and again this is a fast cutting
blade<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:48.590> also<00:02:48.739> will<00:02:49.040> allow<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.280> do<00:02:49.400> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
blade it also will allow you to do a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.220 
blade it also will allow you to do a
little<00:02:49.670> bit<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.090> circles<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.690> curves<00:02:50.959> a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
little bit of circles and curves a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.080 
little bit of circles and curves a
pretty<00:02:51.709> generous<00:02:52.129> one<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:52.940> going<00:02:53.030> to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
pretty generous one so this is going to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.280 
pretty generous one so this is going to
be<00:02:53.180> strictly<00:02:53.360> for<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> tabletop

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
be strictly for a tabletop

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.039 
be strictly for a tabletop
or<00:02:54.739> something<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.310> large<00:02:55.519> diameter<00:02:55.780> or<00:02:56.780> this

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
or something of a large diameter or this

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.900 
or something of a large diameter or this
will<00:02:57.200> be<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.410> maximum<00:02:57.620> size<00:02:58.099> that<00:02:58.430> some<00:02:58.670> band

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
will be the maximum size that some band

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.090 
will be the maximum size that some band
saws<00:02:59.150> will<00:02:59.390> take<00:02:59.599> some<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.440> small<00:03:00.680> 14

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
saws will take some of the small 14

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.620 
saws will take some of the small 14
smacks<00:03:01.489> out<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.940> three<00:03:02.120> quarter<00:03:02.420> inch<00:03:02.540> and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
smacks out in a three quarter inch and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.059 
smacks out in a three quarter inch and
this<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.049> widest<00:03:03.440> way<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.829> they<00:03:03.920> can

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
this is the widest way that they can

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.890 
this is the widest way that they can
take<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.549> this<00:03:05.209> would<00:03:05.329> be<00:03:05.420> strictly<00:03:05.750> for

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
take and this would be strictly for

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.379 
take and this would be strictly for
doing<00:03:06.079> resaw<00:03:06.410> work<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.859> those<00:03:06.980> band<00:03:07.280> saws<00:03:07.519> the

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
doing resaw work on those band saws the

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.479 
doing resaw work on those band saws the
next<00:03:08.630> step<00:03:08.810> up<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.170> get<00:03:09.290> into<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.709> 1<00:03:10.310> inch

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
next step up and get into the 1 inch

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.460 
next step up and get into the 1 inch
plate<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.510> 1<00:03:11.660> inch<00:03:11.810> plate<00:03:12.019> is<00:03:12.139> a<00:03:12.170> great

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
plate and the 1 inch plate is a great

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.990 
plate and the 1 inch plate is a great
plate<00:03:12.680> for<00:03:12.889> doing<00:03:13.069> resaw<00:03:13.400> work<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:13.790> we've<00:03:13.880> got

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
plate for doing resaw work and we've got

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.220

a couple of different selections here

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.920 
a couple of different selections here
we've<00:03:15.739> got<00:03:15.859> a<00:03:15.920> very<00:03:16.130> coarse<00:03:16.519> one<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:17.389> this<00:03:17.750> one

you'll notice is missing teeth in there
it<00:03:20.359> looks<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.109> about<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.349> 1.3

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
it looks like but this is about a 1.3

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.120 
it looks like but this is about a 1.3
TPI<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:23.049> with<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.170> such<00:03:24.349> a<00:03:24.380> coarse<00:03:24.980> and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
TPI and with it such a coarse and

TPI and with it such a coarse and
aggressive<00:03:25.549> cutting<00:03:25.790> blade<00:03:25.910> this<00:03:26.090> cuts<00:03:26.389> very

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
aggressive cutting blade this cuts very

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.860 
aggressive cutting blade this cuts very
very<00:03:27.079> fast<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.970> not<00:03:29.090> for<00:03:29.419> a<00:03:29.450> smooth<00:03:29.690> finish

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
very fast it's not for a smooth finish

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.150 
very fast it's not for a smooth finish
at<00:03:30.109> all<00:03:30.260> it's<00:03:30.470> something<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.829> want<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.010> use

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
at all it's something you want to use

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.440 
at all it's something you want to use
just<00:03:31.190> for<00:03:31.579> breaking<00:03:32.000> wood<00:03:32.180> down<00:03:32.329> to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
just for breaking wood down to

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.319 
just for breaking wood down to
manageable<00:03:32.750> sizes<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.340> also<00:03:34.519> what<00:03:35.209> we

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
manageable sizes this is also what we

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.569 
manageable sizes this is also what we
call<00:03:35.540> an<00:03:35.630> extra<00:03:36.019> thin<00:03:36.200> blade<00:03:36.470> when<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.370> get

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
call an extra thin blade when you get

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.069 
call an extra thin blade when you get
into<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.910> wider<00:03:38.120> blades<00:03:38.540> typically<00:03:39.019> you

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
into the wider blades typically you

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.120 
into the wider blades typically you
going<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.260> get<00:03:39.380> into<00:03:39.530> thicker<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:39.980> heavier

14 inch bandsaw bills you want to really

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.270 
14 inch bandsaw bills you want to really
go<00:03:49.910> 16<00:03:50.510> or<00:03:51.049> even<00:03:51.109> a<00:03:51.440> little<00:03:51.560> bit<00:03:51.739> too<00:03:51.919> large<00:03:52.130> or

18 and above typically for this blade
the<00:03:55.730> next<00:03:55.970> one<00:03:56.060> we<00:03:56.150> get<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.599> 60<00:03:57.139> P<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.349> and

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
the next one we get is a 60 P I and

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.559 
the next one we get is a 60 P I and
again<00:03:58.040> it's<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.489> little<00:03:58.730> slower<00:03:58.970> cutting<00:03:59.419> a

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
again it's a little slower cutting a

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.020 
again it's a little slower cutting a
little<00:03:59.780> smoother<00:04:00.319> finish<00:04:00.609> now<00:04:01.609> if<00:04:01.669> you<00:04:01.790> really

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
little smoother finish now if you really

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.710 
little smoother finish now if you really
want<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.269> ultimate<00:04:02.690> finish

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
want the ultimate finish

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.000 
want the ultimate finish
over<00:04:03.960> here<00:04:04.080> going<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.290> skip<00:04:04.500> over<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.890> inch

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
over here going to skip over the inch

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.960 
over here going to skip over the inch
and<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.160> quarter<00:04:05.280> blades<00:04:05.580> we're<00:04:05.730> gonna<00:04:05.820> go

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
and a quarter blades we're gonna go

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.210 
and a quarter blades we're gonna go
right<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.360> resawing<00:04:06.720> length<00:04:07.170> let's<00:04:08.010> talk

this<00:04:19.590> one<00:04:19.860> actually<00:04:20.220> uses<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.640> little<00:04:20.880> bit

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
this one actually uses a little bit

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.820 
this one actually uses a little bit
thicker<00:04:21.299> piece<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.690> carbide<00:04:22.140> than<00:04:22.710> the

that gives you a great amount of flex on
the<00:04:29.010> bandsaw<00:04:29.430> on<00:04:29.730> this<00:04:30.540> blade<00:04:30.780> we<00:04:30.930> go<00:04:31.050> one<00:04:31.260> step

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
the bandsaw on this blade we go one step

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.720 
the bandsaw on this blade we go one step
further<00:04:31.620> again<00:04:31.890> we<00:04:31.980> use<00:04:32.100> a<00:04:32.130> nice<00:04:32.310> suite<00:04:32.640> of

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
further again we use a nice suite of

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.000 
further again we use a nice suite of
silicon<00:04:33.060> steel<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.570> then<00:04:34.140> we<00:04:34.290> well<00:04:34.500> on<00:04:34.710> tough

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
silicon steel and then we well on tough

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.980 
silicon steel and then we well on tough
pieces<00:04:35.430> of<00:04:35.580> c8<00:04:35.910> alloy<00:04:36.120> steel<00:04:36.570> on<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:36.840> one

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.080 
pieces of c8 alloy steel on this one
here<00:04:37.200> generically<00:04:38.190> it's<00:04:38.370> called<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.670> carbide

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
here generically it's called the carbide

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.000 
here generically it's called the carbide
and<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.720> allows<00:04:39.990> you<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.170> do<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.410> nice<00:04:40.650> smooth

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
and this allows you to do a nice smooth

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.880 
and this allows you to do a nice smooth
finish<00:04:41.250> resaw<00:04:42.240> cut<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:43.290> other<00:04:43.410> advantage<00:04:43.860> to
