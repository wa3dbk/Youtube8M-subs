00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
route in progress what I like to add as

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.000 
route in progress what I like to add as
a<00:07:11.150> waypoint<00:07:11.360> or<00:07:11.720> create<00:07:11.990> a<00:07:12.020> new<00:07:12.139> route<00:07:12.590> now<00:07:12.919> I'm

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
a waypoint or create a new route now I'm

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.409 
a waypoint or create a new route now I'm
going<00:07:13.130> to<00:07:13.190> add<00:07:13.340> as<00:07:13.460> a<00:07:13.520> waypoint<00:07:13.700> because<00:07:14.330> we

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419 
going to add as a waypoint because we

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.420 
going to add as a waypoint because we
want<00:07:14.600> to<00:07:14.630> go<00:07:14.750> via<00:07:15.020> there<00:07:15.380> and<00:07:15.650> then<00:07:16.190> onto

want to go via there and then onto
teddington<00:07:16.970> and<00:07:17.210> that<00:07:17.780> will<00:07:17.900> now<00:07:17.990> calculate

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
teddington and that will now calculate

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560 
teddington and that will now calculate
the<00:07:18.680> new<00:07:18.860> route<00:07:19.100> based<00:07:19.460> on<00:07:19.700> where<00:07:20.270> we<00:07:20.389> both

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570 
the new route based on where we both

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.590 
the new route based on where we both
need<00:07:20.810> to<00:07:20.960> go<00:07:21.220> there<00:07:22.220> are<00:07:22.430> options<00:07:22.790> you<00:07:23.360> can

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.600 
need to go there are options you can

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.879 
need to go there are options you can
choose<00:07:23.960> to<00:07:25.479> make<00:07:26.479> your<00:07:26.690> way<00:07:26.900> you<00:07:27.260> can<00:07:27.290> choose

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:27.889 
choose to make your way you can choose

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.070 
choose to make your way you can choose
to<00:07:27.919> go<00:07:28.400> the<00:07:28.910> fastest<00:07:29.419> way<00:07:29.450> the<00:07:29.900> most

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
to go the fastest way the most

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.540 
to go the fastest way the most
economical<00:07:30.800> which<00:07:30.979> is<00:07:31.130> something<00:07:31.460> that's

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
economical which is something that's

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.600 
economical which is something that's
very<00:07:31.639> new<00:07:32.000> for<00:07:32.180> us<00:07:32.740> the<00:07:33.740> shortest<00:07:34.250> are<00:07:34.490> the

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610 
very new for us the shortest are the

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.629 
very new for us the shortest are the
easiest<00:07:35.060> so<00:07:35.780> if<00:07:35.840> I<00:07:35.930> pick<00:07:36.110> economical<00:07:36.950> what

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639 
easiest so if I pick economical what

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:39.010 
easiest so if I pick economical what
that<00:07:37.820> will<00:07:38.000> now<00:07:38.150> do<00:07:38.210> is<00:07:38.450> it<00:07:38.540> will<00:07:38.600> recalculate

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020 
that will now do is it will recalculate

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.290 
that will now do is it will recalculate
the<00:07:39.410> route<00:07:39.620> based<00:07:40.460> on<00:07:40.669> the<00:07:40.790> least<00:07:40.970> number<00:07:41.150> of

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300 
the route based on the least number of

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.300 
the route based on the least number of
turns<00:07:41.600> so<00:07:42.169> it<00:07:42.260> means<00:07:42.440> that<00:07:42.560> I'm<00:07:42.770> stopping<00:07:43.070> and

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:43.310 
turns so it means that I'm stopping and

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.969 
turns so it means that I'm stopping and
starting<00:07:43.490> the<00:07:43.789> car<00:07:44.000> much<00:07:44.240> less<00:07:44.270> often<00:07:44.720> and<00:07:45.080> in

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:45.979 
starting the car much less often and in

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:48.190 
starting the car much less often and in
theory<00:07:46.220> i<00:07:46.400> use<00:07:46.640> much<00:07:46.850> less<00:07:46.880> petrol<00:07:47.600> I'll<00:07:47.960> kill

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.200 
theory i use much less petrol I'll kill

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.460 
theory i use much less petrol I'll kill
its<00:07:48.380> way<00:07:48.590> and<00:07:49.010> keep<00:07:49.400> left<00:07:50.110> at<00:07:51.110> the<00:07:51.320> roundabout
