00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.020 
morning but it's still I have curly hair
naturally<00:00:55.620> well<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:55.949> curly<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
naturally well not curly it's kind of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.479 
naturally well not curly it's kind of
that<00:00:57.180> wavy<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.680> sort<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> thing<00:00:59.190> where<00:00:59.399> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that wavy kind of sort of thing where it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
that wavy kind of sort of thing where it
doesn't<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.600> gonna<00:01:00.809> do

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.569 
doesn't really know what it's gonna do
so<00:01:01.440> sometimes<00:01:01.920> I'll<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> ringlet

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579

so sometimes I'll have a ringlet
sometimes<00:01:03.059> I'll<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.329> waves<00:01:03.629> sometimes<00:01:04.080> I'll

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
sometimes I'll have waves sometimes I'll

all<00:01:07.049> three<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> depends<00:01:08.909> on

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
all three it just kind of depends on

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.390 
all three it just kind of depends on
what<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.540> hair<00:01:09.689> wants<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.350> day<00:01:10.500> um<00:01:10.770> but

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
anyway and then the last thing it says

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.700 
anyway and then the last thing it says
is<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.150> 15<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:16.439> 15<00:01:16.920> times<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.430> ceramic<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710

is it's 15 or 15 times more ceramic I
had<00:01:19.710> no<00:01:19.890> idea<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> means<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:20.939> someone

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

the other things that it was like it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.700 
the other things that it was like it
goes<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.240> lowest<00:01:39.900> setting<00:01:40.350> out<00:01:40.590> in

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
goes but it's the lowest setting out in

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.300 
goes but it's the lowest setting out in
here<00:01:42.259> remember<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> lowest<00:01:43.710> setting<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.130> but

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
here remember the lowest setting is but

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.450 
here remember the lowest setting is but
the<00:01:44.490> highest<00:01:44.880> setting<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.210> 450<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.130> then<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the highest setting is 450 and then it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.639 
the highest setting is 450 and then it
also<00:01:47.610> has<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.240> 15<00:01:48.659> second<00:01:49.049> heat<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.439> which

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
also has a 15 second heat up which

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.190 
also has a 15 second heat up which
that's<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.250> big<00:01:50.549> deal<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> me<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.869> kind<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that's a big deal to me can just kind of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.389 
that's a big deal to me can just kind of
I<00:01:53.180> don't<00:01:54.180> know<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:55.079> 15<00:01:55.680> seconds<00:01:56.100> but

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
I don't know what I do in 15 seconds but

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.550 
I don't know what I do in 15 seconds but
I<00:01:56.610> usually

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
I usually

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.940 
I usually
have<00:01:57.649> something<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:58.159> do<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.640> um<00:01:59.590> then<00:02:00.590> just<00:02:00.860> to

um just to have a couple different

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.840 
um just to have a couple different
curling<00:02:32.150> methods<00:02:33.130> where<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.160> didn't<00:02:34.670> have<00:02:34.730> to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
curling methods where I didn't have to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.340 
curling methods where I didn't have to
do<00:02:35.060> anything<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.660> morning<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:36.019> my<00:02:36.140> hair

but I mean this it heats up really

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.320 
but I mean this it heats up really
quickly<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.730> don't<00:02:40.940> have<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.120> worry<00:02:41.269> about

quickly so I don't have to worry about
it<00:02:41.630> um<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:43.700> there<00:02:43.910> anything<00:02:44.150> else<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.599> can<00:02:44.660> tell

or anything like that but right here
they<00:03:19.370> have<00:03:19.579> like<00:03:20.000> an<00:03:20.209> LCD<00:03:20.600> display<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:22.640> it<00:03:22.700> kind

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
they have like an LCD display so it kind

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.849 
they have like an LCD display so it kind
of<00:03:22.940> looks<00:03:23.090> like<00:03:23.120> an<00:03:23.329> alarm<00:03:23.569> clock<00:03:23.780> but<00:03:24.410> it's

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
of looks like an alarm clock but it's

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.199 
of looks like an alarm clock but it's
blue<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:27.440> tells<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.829> like<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
blue and it tells you like the

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.150 
blue and it tells you like the
temperature<00:03:29.540> it's<00:03:29.720> at<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.709> can<00:03:30.859> lock<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
temperature it's at and you can lock the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.979 
temperature it's at and you can lock the
temperature<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.880> tells<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.359> and<00:03:33.670> um

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
temperature so it tells you that and um

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.390 
temperature so it tells you that and um
it<00:03:35.989> also<00:03:36.109> tells<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:36.530> what<00:03:36.680> level<00:03:37.010> you're<00:03:37.370> at

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
it also tells you what level you're at

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.110 
it also tells you what level you're at
which<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.910> thought<00:03:38.269> was<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:38.750> cool<00:03:39.049> um<00:03:40.120> because

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
which I thought was so cool um because

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.470 
which I thought was so cool um because
like<00:03:41.450> people<00:03:42.319> have<00:03:42.470> different<00:03:42.859> hair<00:03:43.760> textures

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
like people have different hair textures

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.009 
like people have different hair textures
so<00:03:45.019> some<00:03:45.889> person<00:03:46.239> or<00:03:47.239> one<00:03:47.540> person<00:03:47.870> would<00:03:47.930> have

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
so some person or one person would have

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.720 
so some person or one person would have
really<00:03:48.410> thin<00:03:48.650> hair<00:03:48.950> one<00:03:49.160> person<00:03:49.579> would<00:03:49.670> have

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
really thin hair one person would have

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.120 
really thin hair one person would have
kind<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.180> medium<00:03:50.690> thickness<00:03:51.440> hair<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.010> then

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
kind of medium thickness hair and then

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.870 
kind of medium thickness hair and then
some<00:03:52.370> person<00:03:52.670> would<00:03:52.819> have<00:03:52.850> thick<00:03:53.299> um<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:55.639> then

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
some person would have thick um and then

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.170 
some person would have thick um and then
on<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:57.290> little<00:03:57.530> screen<00:03:58.459> here<00:03:58.489> they<00:03:58.880> have

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
on the little screen here they have

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
on the little screen here they have
little<00:04:00.040> bars<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.519> kind<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.850> tell<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.269> how

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
little bars that kind of tell you how

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.979 
little bars that kind of tell you how
thick<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.280> setting<00:04:04.609> you're<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:04.940> which<00:04:05.629> I

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
thick of a setting you're on which I

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.289 
thick of a setting you're on which I
thought

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
thought
