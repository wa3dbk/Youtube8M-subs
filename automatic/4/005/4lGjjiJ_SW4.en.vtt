00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.559
 You can see the colors below 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.950
 they cover very well and it is sufficient to apply 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:32.020
 Two layers to get a good result 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.600
 on the limada nail we apply a layer 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 Thin gel color flower pink and the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.760
 we dry two minutes in the lamp v 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.800
 then we apply the second layer and 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.800
 we also dry it for two minutes 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.870
 as you can see the premium color gel 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.880
 does not create excess layer during the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.800
 hardening in the lamp remains 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.130
 totally dry so it is not 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.690
 necessary to clean with the clean air 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.480
 also with these gels we can draw 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.430
 the French manicure comfortably since 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.030
 practically do not move during the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.469
 you can also blur two colors 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.659

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.329
 Premium color pitch and network ride 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.909

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.990
 pitch leaving a small line of 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.990
 separation between both colors 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.520
 with the clean brush we blur the two 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.270
 colors and we dry two minutes in the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.270
