 on 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.779
 open is what damage medicine dream came true 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.480
 the Copenhageners in Hartz IV 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.720
 always guaranteed 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.169
 Now she rides over the chalk cliffs 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.169
 their new home 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.580
 Here she has discovered a whole new passion for herself 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.160
 Early in the morning someone did him the find 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 The two want to go immediately and made the dispute 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.220
 On many routes, security forces feel safe from the parade 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.860
 drive 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.970
 She has lived here for five years 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.680
 the old farm a comparison to the real estate prices in the capital 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 Cheap 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.140
 initially they are still commuted to work in Copenhagen 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.360
 the water has now built up a professional existence on the island 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.829
 Wiesbaden 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.829
 that does not mean much with that 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.670
 Finch 1105 at 11 here there is a dramatic fall and soft sandstone everything can 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.690
 one day Leuthards experience the romantic corners but also a kind 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.220
 Paths just because roof and so more tourists than fantastic increase 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.180
 Dr in the medium term wants 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.850
 the sea is always quite wrong from the chalk now playing with out 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.670
 No seriously, that's halftime 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.670
 she seeks to understand her 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.650
 January 2007 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.650
 it has one of the biggest crashes here for a long time 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.120
 the chalk cliffs 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.920
 though the way to the well-known is the graced many paintings 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.859
 and Pascal 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:12.269
 even months later his remains are still a paradise for 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.269
 Fossil collectors the researchers 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:17.580
 therefore may 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.970
 the rounds you get into a meditative last on 1 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.760
 one seeks 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.180
 and it all depends on the outer wall it has to sound weird but solid 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.180
 Prices that 's worth it for Dr 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.000
 At first it was just a new hobby 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.499
 but meanwhile she has a guard 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.499
 expert 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.169
 even the geologists from 4 us cent 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.289
 foster's has 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.099
 with guides she earns the money 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.219
 this leads 4 2 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.739
 Georg Klein at 4 It is an old country which a little one too that he in the morning 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.700
 has been 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.370
 namely by a caterpillar snail the MZ does not agree or 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.269
 I could get one 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.969
 11 euros no 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.049
 Mayor cities had a specificity but a kind 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.469
 Drill 4 with her hand during her birth on the seabed 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.519
 century 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.540
 we have this evening in Austria alive interests and values 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.649
 to explain 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:23.649
 since he then yes would also the explanation 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.810
 That's 70 million years ago 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.700
 but with their little hammer of Foster the stone such stories still today 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.339
 elicit 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.489
 Lehmann the Swiss team 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.550
 who looked at larger a walking encyclopedia on the beach at the subject 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.260
 ask 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 usually she knows the request 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.429
 Today, maths lessons are quickly becoming more demanding 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:49.099
 to drive the permission for the European Championship 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.819
 but at that time she did not have to have any of her deceased passion 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.819
 Each time the two new stones bring in March they have a small one 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.609
 Workshop will have to look for hidden forms that is for Sascha the 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.359
 Goods constant 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.139
 at the and does not involve a problem it is more difficult the current one 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.669
 Chalk thinks to work out that's all tiptop bigger I had 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.669
 just broken but something is relatively common 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.330
 if you are correct then you can work out wonderful things 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.240
 not everyone probably presumed that in Pristina UN is so 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.370
 Percent go harmless 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.150
 the flats of the two corpses in a museum, what do you mean? 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.240
 you are 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.240
 Euro 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.180
 We sing the story of a young woman 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.960
 who moved from the city to the countryside 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.770
 Altenstein drove 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 and her horse can become said Pinkwart 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:01.990
 and when it gets evenings 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.620
 In March the chalk cliffs on RÃ¼gen appear 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.319
 again, all to yourself
