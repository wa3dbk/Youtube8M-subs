open<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.170> fingers<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:58.679> bit<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
open up your fingers a little bit and

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.919 
open up your fingers a little bit and
you<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.399> less<00:01:59.610> drag<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.119> your<00:02:00.149> shoulders<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
you get less drag on your shoulders and

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.200 
you get less drag on your shoulders and
just<00:02:01.590> try<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> vary<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.549> stroke<00:02:02.850> sometimes

just try to vary your stroke sometimes
you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> stroke<00:02:05.069> right<00:02:05.220> near<00:02:05.580> you

sometimes<00:02:06.209> just<00:02:06.420> push<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:07.170> bit

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470

as<00:02:12.989> well<00:02:13.019> in<00:02:13.500> all<00:02:13.680> my<00:02:13.709> training<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.819> little

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
as well in all my training the little

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000 
as well in all my training the little
training<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.630> did<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.019> breathe<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.500> both<00:02:16.680> sides

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
training I did I breathe to both sides

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.009 
training I did I breathe to both sides
that<00:02:17.549> I<00:02:17.730> soon<00:02:18.000> found<00:02:18.180> out<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.810> waves

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
that I soon found out that all the waves

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.809 
that I soon found out that all the waves
were<00:02:19.230> coming<00:02:19.349> in<00:02:19.590> from<00:02:19.739> my<00:02:19.860> left<00:02:20.040> all<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
were coming in from my left all the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.460 
were coming in from my left all the
westerly<00:02:21.180> winds<00:02:21.569> pushing<00:02:21.810> them<00:02:22.019> onto<00:02:22.200> me<00:02:22.440> so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
westerly winds pushing them onto me so

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.110 
westerly winds pushing them onto me so
when<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.160> did<00:02:23.340> breathe<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.670> my<00:02:23.760> left<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.090> just

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
when I did breathe to my left I just

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.660 
when I did breathe to my left I just
drank<00:02:24.569> loads<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.989> water<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.069> had<00:02:26.489> just

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
drank loads of water so I had just

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.580 
drank loads of water so I had just
breathe<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.120> my<00:02:27.209> right<00:02:27.450> only<00:02:27.840> pretty<00:02:28.200> much<00:02:28.380> for

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
breathe to my right only pretty much for

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.110 
breathe to my right only pretty much for
the<00:02:28.680> whole<00:02:28.799> trip<00:02:29.130> there's<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:30.000> things

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the whole trip there's little things

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 
the whole trip there's little things
like<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.599> should<00:02:31.079> I<00:02:31.410> was<00:02:31.950> learning

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
like that that should I was learning

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.910 
like that that should I was learning
along<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.640> way

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.470 

nutrition<00:02:39.920> was<00:02:40.100> really<00:02:40.550> important<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.180> turn

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
nutrition was really important in turn

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.450 
nutrition was really important in turn
the<00:02:41.840> crews<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.200> call<00:02:42.470> me<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.710> child<00:02:42.980> because<00:02:43.400> I

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
the crews to call me the child because I

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.120 
the crews to call me the child because I
have<00:02:43.640> my<00:02:43.730> blended<00:02:44.540> meals<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.740> a<00:02:45.890> shaker

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
have my blended meals and a in a shaker

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.300 
have my blended meals and a in a shaker
I<00:02:46.520> then<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.030> my<00:02:47.240> protein<00:02:47.480> shakes<00:02:48.440> at<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.190> end

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
I then have my protein shakes at the end

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.530 
I then have my protein shakes at the end
of<00:02:49.400> each<00:02:49.490> session<00:02:49.760> because<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.150> needed<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.450> have

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
of each session because I needed to have

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.330 
of each session because I needed to have
about<00:02:50.750> 130<00:02:51.380> grams<00:02:51.920> of<00:02:52.400> protein<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> day<00:02:53.270> roughly

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
about 130 grams of protein a day roughly

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.340 
about 130 grams of protein a day roughly
just<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.460> help<00:02:55.610> me<00:02:55.760> rebuild<00:02:55.970> my<00:02:56.210> muscles<00:02:59.350> there

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
just to help me rebuild my muscles there

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.860 
just to help me rebuild my muscles there
was<00:03:00.470> never<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.250> same<00:03:01.490> start<00:03:01.940> time<00:03:02.480> as<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
was never the same start time as the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.200 
was never the same start time as the
tides<00:03:03.140> shift<00:03:03.530> by<00:03:03.740> an<00:03:03.860> hour<00:03:03.980> each<00:03:04.250> day<00:03:04.280> so

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
tides shift by an hour each day so

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.120 
tides shift by an hour each day so
sometimes<00:03:05.750> I'd<00:03:05.960> be<00:03:05.990> getting<00:03:06.350> up<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.620> 10<00:03:06.830> a.m.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
sometimes I'd be getting up in 10 a.m.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.980 
sometimes I'd be getting up in 10 a.m.
for<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.460> session<00:03:07.880> sometimes<00:03:08.180> at<00:03:08.630> 3:00<00:03:08.870> in<00:03:08.960> the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
for a session sometimes at 3:00 in the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.650 
for a session sometimes at 3:00 in the
morning<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:11.770> usually<00:03:12.770> do<00:03:13.430> an<00:03:13.970> hour<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.480> half

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
morning I usually do an hour and a half

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.690 
morning I usually do an hour and a half
90<00:03:15.230> minutes<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.740> then<00:03:15.920> have<00:03:16.250> some<00:03:16.460> food

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
90 minutes and then have some food

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.050 
90 minutes and then have some food
probably<00:03:17.240> spend<00:03:17.510> 15<00:03:17.870> minutes<00:03:17.930> warming<00:03:18.560> up

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
probably spend 15 minutes warming up

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.000 
probably spend 15 minutes warming up
rehydrating<00:03:20.410> jumping<00:03:21.410> back<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:21.920> do

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
rehydrating jumping back in and do

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.670 
rehydrating jumping back in and do
another<00:03:22.040> 90<00:03:22.580> minute<00:03:22.790> session<00:03:23.210> and<00:03:23.470> then<00:03:24.470> eat

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
another 90 minute session and then eat

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.410 
another 90 minute session and then eat
again<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.220> then<00:03:25.340> do<00:03:25.490> a<00:03:25.520> third<00:03:25.790> 90<00:03:26.210> minute

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
again and then do a third 90 minute

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.090 
again and then do a third 90 minute
session<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:26.900> try<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.140> do<00:03:27.260> three<00:03:27.530> 90-minute

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
session so I try and do three 90-minute

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.480 
session so I try and do three 90-minute
sessions<00:03:29.650> wasn't<00:03:30.650> possible<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:31.070> do<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
sessions wasn't possible to do the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.100 
sessions wasn't possible to do the
mileage<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.150> needed<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.570> do<00:03:32.690> each<00:03:32.840> day

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
mileage that I needed to do each day

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.110 
mileage that I needed to do each day
without<00:03:33.290> having<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:33.890> swim<00:03:34.100> in<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.280> dark<00:03:34.490> we

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
without having to swim in the dark we

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.490 
without having to swim in the dark we
just<00:03:35.330> had<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.600> make<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.870> most<00:03:36.020> of<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.290> tide

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
just had to make the most of the tide

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.950 
just had to make the most of the tide
and<00:03:36.740> if<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.950> tides<00:03:37.190> at<00:03:37.820> 3:00<00:03:38.150> a.m.<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.660> go<00:03:38.810> it

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
and if the tides at 3:00 a.m. we go it

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.990 
and if the tides at 3:00 a.m. we go it
through<00:03:39.140> him<00:03:41.800> what<00:03:42.800> I<00:03:42.830> didn't<00:03:43.220> want<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.730> swim

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
through him what I didn't want the swim

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.880 
through him what I didn't want the swim
to<00:03:44.180> become<00:03:44.540> was<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:44.960> big<00:03:45.230> monster<00:03:45.710> that<00:03:45.860> just
