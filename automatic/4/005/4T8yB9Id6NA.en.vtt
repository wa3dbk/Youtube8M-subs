bumper this looks very sporty because it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.890 
bumper this looks very sporty because it
is<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.960> 135<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.610> this<00:01:30.790> is<00:01:30.910> a<00:01:30.940> very<00:01:31.690> very

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
is this is a 135 so this is a very very

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.590 
is this is a 135 so this is a very very
powerful<00:01:32.140> engine<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.070> that<00:01:33.700> engine<00:01:34.090> needs<00:01:34.300> a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
powerful engine and that engine needs a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.110 
powerful engine and that engine needs a
lot<00:01:34.930> of<00:01:35.050> air<00:01:35.260> so<00:01:36.190> that's<00:01:36.310> why<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.550> see<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.850> very

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
lot of air so that's why you see a very

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.950 
lot of air so that's why you see a very
big<00:01:37.300> opening<00:01:38.050> there<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:39.100> see<00:01:39.340> some<00:01:40.150> wide

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
big opening there and you see some wide

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.740 
big opening there and you see some wide
air<00:01:41.290> intakes<00:01:41.710> on<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.010> side<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.730> that<00:01:43.510> take

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
air intakes on the side and that take

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.140 
air intakes on the side and that take
air<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:44.409> brake<00:01:44.830> ducts<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:45.850> what<00:01:46.030> we

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
air to the brake ducts and so what we

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.690 
air to the brake ducts and so what we
have<00:01:46.300> done<00:01:46.510> here<00:01:46.900> is<00:01:47.290> we've<00:01:47.560> taken<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
have done here is we've taken the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.180 
have done here is we've taken the
aerodynamic<00:01:49.360> package<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:50.110> put<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.680> standard

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
aerodynamic package and put it standard

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.840 
aerodynamic package and put it standard
on<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.550> 135<00:01:52.330> I<00:01:52.830> what<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.920> also<00:01:54.070> has<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.670> these

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
on the 135 I what it also has is these

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.120 
on the 135 I what it also has is these
little<00:01:55.150> flaps<00:01:55.390> here<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:56.440> create<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.770> bit<00:01:57.040> of

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
little flaps here that create a bit of

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.340 
little flaps here that create a bit of
downforce<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.210> front<00:01:58.420> axle<00:01:58.870> so<00:01:59.050> it's<00:01:59.200> all

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
downforce on the front axle so it's all

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.950 
downforce on the front axle so it's all
functional<00:01:59.950> as<00:02:00.400> well<00:02:00.729> as<00:02:00.940> an<00:02:01.240> indication<00:02:01.690> of

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
towards the centre of the car

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.990 
towards the centre of the car
gives<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.440> car<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.709> sense<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.280> direction<00:02:12.430> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
gives the car a sense of direction and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.690 
gives the car a sense of direction and
then<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.390> course<00:02:14.110> what<00:02:14.319> we<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.620> here<00:02:14.799> too<00:02:15.010> is

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
then of course what we have here too is

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.750 
then of course what we have here too is
I<00:02:15.760> believe<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.269> very<00:02:16.450> decent<00:02:16.840> sized<00:02:17.260> wheel<00:02:17.760> this

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
I believe a very decent sized wheel this

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.149 
I believe a very decent sized wheel this
is<00:02:18.879> an<00:02:19.000> 18-inch<00:02:19.510> wheel<00:02:19.780> which<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.260> think<00:02:20.530> suits

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
is an 18-inch wheel which I think suits

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.320 
is an 18-inch wheel which I think suits
this<00:02:21.340> car<00:02:21.640> very<00:02:21.850> well

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
this car very well

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.030 
this car very well
when<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.750> look<00:02:23.900> at<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.110> car<00:02:24.350> from<00:02:24.830> this

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
when you look at the car from this

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.010 
when you look at the car from this
viewpoint<00:02:25.610> what<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.390> see<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.780> front

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
viewpoint what you see is the front

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.930 
viewpoint what you see is the front
wheel<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.560> then<00:02:27.860> all<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.250> lines<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.730> come

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
wheel and then all the lines that come

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.510 
wheel and then all the lines that come
off<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.120> front<00:02:29.540> wheel<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.170> move<00:02:30.800> up<00:02:31.070> towards

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
off the front wheel and move up towards

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.820 
off the front wheel and move up towards
the<00:02:31.730> rear<00:02:31.940> now<00:02:32.330> what<00:02:32.570> we<00:02:32.690> call<00:02:32.870> wet<00:02:33.140> shape<00:02:33.500> and

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
the rear now what we call wet shape and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.950 
the rear now what we call wet shape and
that<00:02:33.980> also<00:02:34.250> gives<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.850> this<00:02:34.970> sense<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.450> forward

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
that also gives it this sense of forward

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.950 
that also gives it this sense of forward
motion<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:37.340> also<00:02:37.550> see<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.270> line<00:02:38.540> and

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
motion you also see that this line and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.840 
motion you also see that this line and
this<00:02:39.200> feature<00:02:39.440> line<00:02:39.800> runs<00:02:40.250> over<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.700> whole

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
this feature line runs over the whole

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.360 
this feature line runs over the whole
length<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.390> car<00:02:41.600> gives<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.560> bit<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.250> a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
length of the car gives it a bit of a

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.180 
length of the car gives it a bit of a
sense<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.760> elegance<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:45.260> line<00:02:45.470> then<00:02:45.710> is

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
sense of elegance and this line then is

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.670 
sense of elegance and this line then is
curved<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.670> much<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.300> in<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.510> rear<00:02:47.810> it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
curved so much that in the rear it

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.980 
curved so much that in the rear it
starts<00:02:49.040> curving<00:02:49.310> down<00:02:49.490> again<00:02:50.000> over<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.570> tail

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
starts curving down again over the tail

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.500 
starts curving down again over the tail
lamp<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.530> then<00:02:52.100> inside<00:02:52.490> of<00:02:52.670> course<00:02:52.880> like<00:02:53.330> on

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
lamp and then inside of course like on

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.300 
lamp and then inside of course like on
the<00:02:53.600> front<00:02:53.870> we<00:02:54.050> have<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.320> latest<00:02:54.500> technology

we have these light bars in here that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.620 
we have these light bars in here that
are<00:02:59.960> fed<00:03:00.230> by<00:03:00.470> LEDs<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.850> then<00:03:02.090> at<00:03:02.240> night<00:03:02.420> you

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
are fed by LEDs and then at night you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.190 
are fed by LEDs and then at night you
will<00:03:02.810> get<00:03:03.020> these<00:03:03.230> three<00:03:03.820> horizontal<00:03:04.820> stripes
