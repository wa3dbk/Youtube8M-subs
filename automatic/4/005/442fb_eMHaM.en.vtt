the more that you you know completed
those<00:04:27.020> so<00:04:28.020> right<00:04:28.170> now<00:04:28.200> we're<00:04:28.470> grouping<00:04:28.710> up<00:04:29.010> our

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
those so right now we're grouping up our

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.240 
those so right now we're grouping up our
little<00:04:30.050> posse<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.320> we're<00:04:31.740> going<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.890> go<00:04:32.070> in

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
little posse and we're going to go in

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.020 
little posse and we're going to go in
there<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.490> try<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:32.970> drop<00:04:33.780> off<00:04:33.990> the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
there and try and drop off the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.810 
there and try and drop off the
explosives<00:04:36.030> or<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:37.820> don't<00:04:38.820> know<00:04:38.940> components

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
explosives or I don't know components

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.119 
explosives or I don't know components
that<00:04:41.820> computer<00:04:42.360> components<00:04:42.900> I<00:04:42.960> guess<00:04:43.169> but

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
that computer components I guess but

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.889 
that computer components I guess but
we<00:04:45.639> kind<00:04:45.849> of<00:04:45.879> get<00:04:45.999> bottleneck<00:04:46.539> right<00:04:46.569> here

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:46.899 
we kind of get bottleneck right here

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:49.409 
we kind of get bottleneck right here
trying<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.169> come<00:04:47.379> in<00:04:47.589> and<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:48.550> try<00:04:49.059> and<00:04:49.179> go<00:04:49.270> in

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
there just pick up the components and

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.949 
there just pick up the components and
put<00:04:51.279> them<00:04:51.369> in<00:04:51.489> there<00:04:51.639> but<00:04:51.999> I<00:04:52.270> start<00:04:52.869> getting
