so guys here got the su-35 in the
process<00:00:12.610> of<00:00:12.820> getting<00:00:13.240> everything<00:00:13.450> together

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
process of getting everything together

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.310 
process of getting everything together
I<00:00:14.010> also<00:00:14.760> finished<00:00:17.270> most<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.930> still<00:00:19.170> need

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
I also finished most of the I still need

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.950 
I also finished most of the I still need
to<00:00:19.410> make<00:00:19.560> extensions<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.910> ESC<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to make extensions for the ESC to the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.159 
to make extensions for the ESC to the
motor<00:00:22.310> but<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.790> waiting<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.450> parts<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.960> come

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
motor but I'm waiting for parts to come

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.460 
motor but I'm waiting for parts to come
in<00:00:25.290> from<00:00:25.590> hobbyking<00:00:26.130> right<00:00:26.790> now<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.470> what

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
in from hobbyking right now but what

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.779 
in from hobbyking right now but what
we're<00:00:28.590> gonna<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.950> is<00:00:29.070> we're<00:00:29.189> gonna<00:00:29.250> test<00:00:29.669> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
we're gonna do is we're gonna test the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.670 
we're gonna do is we're gonna test the
system<00:00:30.149> to<00:00:30.300> make<00:00:30.419> sure<00:00:30.450> it<00:00:30.720> works<00:00:30.960> properly<00:00:31.079> as

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
system to make sure it works properly as

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.160 
system to make sure it works properly as
you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.790> my<00:00:32.910> previous<00:00:33.210> video<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.930> have

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you can see in my previous video I have

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.889 
you can see in my previous video I have
programmed<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.040> ESC<00:00:35.850> s<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.239> run<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> same

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
programmed the ESC s to run on the same

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.370 
programmed the ESC s to run on the same
timing<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:38.300> plugged<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.480> everything<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:40.140> I

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
timing I plugged in everything here I

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.540 
timing I plugged in everything here I
got<00:00:40.559> my<00:00:40.739> 10<00:00:41.040> MPC<00:00:41.880> I<00:00:42.170> plugged<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.399> what

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
got my 10 MPC I plugged in here so what

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
got my 10 MPC I plugged in here so what
we're<00:00:44.670> gonna<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.149> we're<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.960> plug<00:00:46.350> in

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we're gonna do is we're going to plug in

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.069 
we're gonna do is we're going to plug in
the<00:00:46.590> system<00:00:47.300> ok<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.720> gonna

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the system ok and then I'm just gonna

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.660 
the system ok and then I'm just gonna
hold<00:00:55.290> this<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:55.650> hand<00:00:55.740> I<00:00:56.220> don't<00:00:56.280> recommend

and while I'm making the connections for
the<00:02:37.989> ESC<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> motors<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.250> well<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.060> we're

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
the ESC to the motors as well so we're

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.910 
the ESC to the motors as well so we're
gonna<00:02:40.750> power<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.049> up<00:02:41.170> one<00:02:41.349> more<00:02:41.470> time<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:41.860> you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
gonna power it up one more time for you

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.289 
gonna power it up one more time for you
guys<00:02:42.069> just<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.430> guys<00:02:42.610> could<00:02:42.790> hear<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.150> and

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
guys just so you guys could hear it and

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.309 
guys just so you guys could hear it and
then<00:02:45.329> then<00:02:46.329> we'll<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:46.870> ahead<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.019> cut<00:02:47.200> the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
then then we'll go ahead and cut the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:03:04.060 
then then we'll go ahead and cut the
video

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.010 

okay<00:03:05.070> just<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.030> real<00:03:06.210> quick<00:03:06.360> video<00:03:06.570> this<00:03:06.960> is

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
okay just a real quick video this is

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.560 
okay just a real quick video this is
what<00:03:07.140> I'm<00:03:07.380> going<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.740> using<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.940> secure

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
what I'm going to be using to secure

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.560 
what I'm going to be using to secure
down<00:03:09.900> my<00:03:11.600> extreme<00:03:12.600> on<00:03:12.750> seeing<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.200> PDF<00:03:13.590> units

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
down my extreme on seeing the PDF units

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.240 
down my extreme on seeing the PDF units
they<00:03:15.570> don't<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:16.140> any<00:03:16.350> brackets<00:03:16.560> as<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.100> can

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
they don't have any brackets as you can

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
they don't have any brackets as you can
see<00:03:17.460> so<00:03:18.230> instead<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.290> using<00:03:19.590> regular<00:03:20.340> epoxy<00:03:21.090> or

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
see so instead of using regular epoxy or

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.810 
see so instead of using regular epoxy or
CA<00:03:21.510> glue<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> set<00:03:22.290> them<00:03:22.380> down<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.830> wanted<00:03:23.490> to<00:03:23.610> use

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
CA glue to set them down I wanted to use

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.440 
CA glue to set them down I wanted to use
this<00:03:24.800> liquid<00:03:25.800> nails<00:03:26.040> adhesive<00:03:26.670> silicon<00:03:27.180> and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
this liquid nails adhesive silicon and

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.530 
this liquid nails adhesive silicon and
what<00:03:27.990> this<00:03:28.170> say<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.650> think<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:30.000> theory<00:03:30.270> I<00:03:30.360> think

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
what this say I think the theory I think

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.670 
what this say I think the theory I think
of<00:03:30.750> what<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.470> will<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.880> will<00:03:33.120> reduce<00:03:34.110> I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
of what it will do is it will reduce I

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.030 
of what it will do is it will reduce I
mean<00:03:34.860> these<00:03:35.070> should<00:03:35.280> already<00:03:35.580> be<00:03:37.040> extremely

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
mean these should already be extremely

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.280 
mean these should already be extremely
balanced<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.880> there<00:03:39.090> shouldn't<00:03:39.270> be<00:03:39.390> very<00:03:40.080> many

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
balanced so there shouldn't be very many

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.470 
balanced so there shouldn't be very many
vibrations<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.370> in<00:03:41.610> case<00:03:41.910> there<00:03:42.239> are<00:03:42.450> any

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
vibrations but in case there are any

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.100 
vibrations but in case there are any
vibrations<00:03:43.790> what<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.940> silicone<00:03:45.420> adhesive<00:03:45.989> is

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
vibrations what the silicone adhesive is

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.610 
vibrations what the silicone adhesive is
gonna<00:03:46.290> do<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:46.770> going<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.670> dampen<00:03:48.090> those

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
gonna do is it's going to dampen those

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.660 
gonna do is it's going to dampen those
vibrations<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.040> don't<00:03:50.250> hear<00:03:50.520> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
vibrations so you don't hear the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.610 
vibrations so you don't hear the
vibrations<00:03:51.180> resonating<00:03:52.080> throughout<00:03:52.380> them

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
vibrations resonating throughout them

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.920 
vibrations resonating throughout them
the<00:03:53.040> body<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.520> frame<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:54.720> what<00:03:54.870> I'm

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
the body of the frame so that's what I'm

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.520 
the body of the frame so that's what I'm
going<00:03:55.080> for

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
going for

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.050 
going for
I'm<00:03:55.590> going<00:03:56.150> for<00:03:57.150> silent<00:03:58.080> silent<00:03:58.739> motor<00:03:59.280> but

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
I'm going for silent silent motor but

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.940 
I'm going for silent silent motor but
you're<00:04:00.810> gonna<00:04:00.930> be<00:04:01.110> able<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.350> hear<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.739> whoosh

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
you're gonna be able to hear the whoosh

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.850 
you're gonna be able to hear the whoosh
sound<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:03.060> basically<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.140> whitewash<00:04:04.530> sound

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
sound the basically the whitewash sound

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.130 
sound the basically the whitewash sound
coming<00:04:05.160> out<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.850> out<00:04:06.270> of<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.540> nozzles<00:04:06.930> and

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
coming out of the out of the nozzles and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.090 
coming out of the out of the nozzles and
that's<00:04:07.290> what<00:04:07.440> I'm<00:04:07.500> going<00:04:07.739> for

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
that's what I'm going for

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.949 
that's what I'm going for
and<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.640> last<00:04:08.790> vibrations<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.630> hear

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
and the last vibrations that you hear

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.890 
and the last vibrations that you hear
coming<00:04:10.290> through<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.590> plane<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
coming through the plane the the the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.210 
coming through the plane the the the
better<00:04:13.080> you'll<00:04:13.350> be<00:04:13.380> able<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.739> hear<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:14.070> so

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
better you'll be able to hear that so

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.500 
better you'll be able to hear that so
that's<00:04:14.400> what<00:04:14.519> I'm<00:04:14.610> going<00:04:14.820> for<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.209> that's<00:04:15.330> what

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
that's what I'm going for so that's what

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.990 
that's what I'm going for so that's what
I'm<00:04:15.570> going<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.720> use<00:04:15.780> for<00:04:16.260> setting<00:04:17.070> down<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.580> es

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
I'm going to use for setting down the es

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.060 
I'm going to use for setting down the es
es<00:04:18.239> I'm<00:04:18.479> going<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.720> start<00:04:19.200> getting<00:04:19.380> them<00:04:19.709> I

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
es I'm going to start getting them I

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.070 
es I'm going to start getting them I
need<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.180> extend<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.940> end<00:04:23.940> cap<00:04:24.270> wires<00:04:24.540> over

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
need to extend the end cap wires over

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.830 
need to extend the end cap wires over
here<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.530> need<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.770> solder<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.520> couple<00:04:26.940> couple<00:04:27.720> of

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
here I need to solder a couple couple of

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.830 
here I need to solder a couple couple of
wires<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.470> extend<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:30.660> leads<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.840> the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
wires to extend the leads to so that the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.440 
wires to extend the leads to so that the
es<00:04:34.260> es<00:04:34.470> are<00:04:34.620> supposed<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.979> rest<00:04:35.550> in<00:04:35.760> here<00:04:36.180> and

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
es es are supposed to rest in here and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
then the wires are supposed to reach

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.330 
then the wires are supposed to reach
from<00:04:38.550> here<00:04:39.000> over<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.050> motor<00:04:40.290> which<00:04:41.160> is

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
from here over to the motor which is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.370 
from here over to the motor which is
over<00:04:41.640> here<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.180> need<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:42.630> need<00:04:42.780> quite<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.290> bit

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
over here so I need I need quite a bit

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.640 
over here so I need I need quite a bit
