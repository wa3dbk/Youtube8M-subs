 m 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:21.470
 although the human body is buried in the function a sensual breathing 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.460
 which allows the oxygen contained in the ambient air 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.839
 to enter our body 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.250
 oxygen and essential fuel 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
 operation 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 at the moment of expiration the hay change of so young in gaseous form 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.679
 enters the nose and mouth 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.009
 route the trachea and bronchi to enter the alveoli 

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.009
 lung 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.300
 the alveoli 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.910
 we can compare to small balloons 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.330
 allowed the oxygen to cross the very thin wall so that they attach themselves 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.760
 on red blood cells 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 carried by the blood vessels 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.300
 at the same time the carbon dioxide produced by the activity of our body 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.000
 he is carried by the blood vessels that brings him back to 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.050
 alveoli to reject it in the ambient air at the time of expiration 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.630
 so how does one play a role of filter the gas changer between the outside and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.630
 inside our body 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.530
 when I breathe I get oxygen into my blood 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 as I explain I accumulated reserves 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.189
 the blood bring oxygen to all the cells of our body 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.300
 for that 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.370
 a very powerful bomb called the heart 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.370
 and circulate the blood in the blood vessels 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.340
 these blood vessels are on the one hand the arteries that the surest judge 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.280
 which carries the proxy spell hindered on the other hand the colored veins here in 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 blue that recovers carbon dioxide 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.399
 our cells used oxygen to feed themselves and receives carbon dioxide 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.040
 who is one of the evacuated sherpas 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.190
 and if the brain is called 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.889
 the rhÃ´ne like all other cells 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.889
 she receives a small I loved the releases of carbon dioxide 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.849
 the choir makes it possible to circulate these essential products to the lives of 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.849
 new 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.349
 because the group esso feel good that allow this circulation 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.699
 carotid arteries red dogs eden jugular 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.479
 here in blue 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.029
 if this traffic is disrupted the sales offices very quickly 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 suffer and some will be destroyed 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.029
 breathing is essential to life preventing its proper functioning its 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:02.989
 seriously masters the body in danger 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.700
 this is how the strangulation smothering practices 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.400
 wrongly calls games can dramatically affected the good 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.029
 mechanism of our main organs and especially our brain extremely 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.469
 sensitive to the lack of oxygen from the increase in carbon dioxide 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.659
 if you hold your breath as much as possible until you lose consciousness 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.679
 as for the game of the tomato or the Indian dream 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.019
 we block oxygen entry into the body and exit crates like 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.019
 unique 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.639
 the amount of oxygen in the blood see gradually decrease 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.479
 while the amount of carbon dioxide 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.579
 it is therefore the blow the pressure is exerted on the carotid arteries 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.109
 jugular vein 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.369
 prevents oxygen blood and feed the human brain and carbon dioxide 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.369
 you are the vanquished 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:11.250
 these manipulations the taught had made this wonderful automatic

 kibaki immediately slowed down with their little girl very serious the situation 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.219
 the brain and all the very important organs like the kidneys 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.839
 the heart the liver then finds itself very quickly in great suffering 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.310
 in all cases thousands of neurons the cells in our brain 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.340
 are said sad 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340
 and if they can be very serious 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.210
 paralysis of limbs 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.699

 admirable seat repetition risks after-effects 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:00.130
 but it only takes one time to stay disabled 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.360
 What is it 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.060
 our body is a wonderful machine but play with his breath for 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.530
 to prevent the circulation in the provinces of the couple is to expose oneself to 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.550
 the drift is totally with dramatic consequences 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.139
 our body to these rules one must know 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.939
 you have to know how to say no so far
