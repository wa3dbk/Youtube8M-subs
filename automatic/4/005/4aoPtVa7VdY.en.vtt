that and then a couple of teaspoons of
honey<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.549> thought<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.670> well<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.390> let<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
honey I thought as well so just let it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
honey I thought as well so just let it
drizzle<00:01:10.320> through<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.100> well

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
drizzle through with that as well

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.920 
drizzle through with that as well
ideally<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> clear<00:01:12.420> honey<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.869> just

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
ideally you want it clear honey it just

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.749 
ideally you want it clear honey it just
means<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.500> works<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.310> works<00:01:14.340> together

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
means that it works it works together

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.490 
means that it works it works together
with<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.299> soil<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.229> doesn't

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
with the soil more and it doesn't

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.789 
with the soil more and it doesn't
separate<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.130> much<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.229> just<00:01:19.229> move<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
separate out as much and just move it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
separate out as much and just move it
all<00:01:19.920> together<00:01:20.100> stir<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.000> until<00:01:21.930> you

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
all together stir it all up until you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.359 
all together stir it all up until you

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
oil on says well the reason we're adding

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.300 
oil on says well the reason we're adding
olive<00:03:20.700> oil<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.780> we're<00:03:21.930> not<00:03:22.040> adding<00:03:23.040> any

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
olive oil is that we're not adding any

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.400 
olive oil is that we're not adding any
olive<00:03:23.640> oil<00:03:23.790> onto<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.209> pan<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:25.049> parent

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
olive oil onto the pan your parent

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
olive oil onto the pan your parent
should<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.530> been<00:03:25.680> on<00:03:25.769> for<00:03:25.980> about<00:03:26.010> five

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
should have been on for about five

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.949 
should have been on for about five
minutes<00:03:26.760> when<00:03:27.269> you're<00:03:27.390> doing<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:27.660> as<00:03:27.810> well

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
minutes when you're doing this as well

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.420 
minutes when you're doing this as well
so<00:03:28.200> basically<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.920> parent<00:03:29.220> should<00:03:29.310> be

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
so basically the parent should be

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.580 
so basically the parent should be
absolutely<00:03:30.150> screaming<00:03:30.750> hot<00:03:30.959> with<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.350> as<00:03:31.440> well

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
absolutely screaming hot with it as well

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.770 
absolutely screaming hot with it as well
so<00:03:32.310> as<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.519> said<00:03:32.790> now<00:03:33.030> we've<00:03:33.180> got<00:03:33.330> them<00:03:33.450> together

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
so as I said now we've got them together

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.690 
so as I said now we've got them together
we're<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.620> going<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.860> add<00:03:35.010> them<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.609> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
we're just going to add them in to the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.360 
we're just going to add them in to the
pan<00:03:35.940> ideally<00:03:36.690> put<00:03:37.109> them<00:03:37.230> across<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.769> way<00:03:37.890> like

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
pan ideally put them across the way like

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.650 
pan ideally put them across the way like
so<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.660> squeeze<00:03:39.989> them<00:03:40.049> all<00:03:40.350> in<00:03:41.660> like

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
so so we can squeeze them all in like

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.560 
so so we can squeeze them all in like
that<00:03:43.370> with<00:03:44.370> these<00:03:44.549> really<00:03:44.730> looking<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.420> leave

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
that with these really looking to leave

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.180 
that with these really looking to leave
them<00:03:45.720> for<00:03:45.840> about<00:03:45.959> eight<00:03:46.620> minutes<00:03:46.859> altogether

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
them for about eight minutes altogether

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.789 
them for about eight minutes altogether
I'm<00:03:47.609> kind<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.180> turn<00:03:48.420> them<00:03:48.600> every<00:03:48.989> two<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.560> you

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
I'm kind of turn them every two so you

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.530 
I'm kind of turn them every two so you
get<00:03:50.130> caught<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.549> on<00:03:50.640> every<00:03:50.910> side<00:03:51.090> with<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.269> as

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
get caught it on every side with that as

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:02.130 
get caught it on every side with that as
well

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.240 

okay<00:04:03.140> what<00:04:03.290> would<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.500> do<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.830> we're<00:04:04.040> going<00:04:04.160> to

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
okay what would you do is we're going to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.070 
okay what would you do is we're going to
need<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.430> turn<00:04:04.670> these<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.360> every<00:04:05.780> couple<00:04:05.960> of

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
need to turn these so every couple of

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.660 
need to turn these so every couple of
minutes<00:04:06.200> just<00:04:06.500> keep<00:04:06.710> them<00:04:06.860> on<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.100> move<00:04:07.280> until
