was<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.050> Vitamix<00:02:45.820> blender<00:02:46.820> but<00:02:47.090> I'm<00:02:47.600> not

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
was it Vitamix blender but I'm not

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.310 
was it Vitamix blender but I'm not
paying<00:02:48.050> $500<00:02:48.800> for<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.040> blender<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:51.110> was

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
paying $500 for a blender so this was

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.260 
paying $500 for a blender so this was
great<00:02:51.590> because<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.980> single<00:02:52.220> serve<00:02:52.610> is<00:02:53.060> only

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
great because the single serve is only

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.480

$100 it comes with a lot of pieces and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.660 
$100 it comes with a lot of pieces and
it<00:02:55.880> gets<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.180> job<00:02:56.390> done<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.430> tall

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
it gets the job done so this is the tall

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:07.150 
it gets the job done so this is the tall
