00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the map what is yours or for that not

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.420

the<00:02:09.420> map<00:02:09.600> for<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.170> call<00:02:11.040> of<00:02:11.100> duty<00:02:11.280> ghost

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the map for the call of duty ghost

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.910 
the map for the call of duty ghost
campaign<00:02:11.970> what<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.600> prediction<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.230> think
