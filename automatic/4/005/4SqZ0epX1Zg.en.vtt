what we just did right there is

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.600 
what we just did right there is
something<00:00:29.530> called<00:00:29.860> the<00:00:29.980> process<00:00:30.490> of

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
something called the process of

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.700 
something called the process of
elimination<00:00:31.090> see<00:00:31.870> you<00:00:32.169> look<00:00:32.320> at<00:00:32.529> it<00:00:32.619> though

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
elimination see you look at it though

elimination see you look at it though
the<00:00:32.769> right<00:00:33.039> answer<00:00:33.460> first<00:00:33.730> we<00:00:34.589> try<00:00:35.589> to<00:00:35.649> figure

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
and once you know which dancers are

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:41.910 
and once you know which dancers are
wrong<00:00:40.329> you'll<00:00:40.839> have<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.019> much<00:00:41.109> better<00:00:41.620> chance

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
wrong you'll have a much better chance

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.160

that<00:00:44.350> process<00:00:45.219> of<00:00:45.370> elimination<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.269> its

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
that process of elimination and its
