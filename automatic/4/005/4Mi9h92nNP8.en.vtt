teach you how to make the star of david'
with<00:00:02.490> small<00:00:03.060> beads<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.750> could<00:00:03.899> use<00:00:04.110> seed

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
with small beads you could use seed

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.980 
with small beads you could use seed
beads<00:00:04.740> or<00:00:05.069> little<00:00:05.339> round<00:00:05.549> beads<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.420> what<00:00:06.960> I

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
beads or little round beads and what I

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.740 
beads or little round beads and what I
did<00:00:07.259> was<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.649> cut<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.919> piece<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.250> wire<00:00:08.750> that's

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
did was I cut a piece of wire that's

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.290 
did was I cut a piece of wire that's
about<00:00:10.080> six<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.830> eight<00:00:10.860> inches<00:00:11.040> long<00:00:11.700> depending

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
about six to eight inches long depending

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.600 
about six to eight inches long depending
on<00:00:12.480> how<00:00:13.049> many<00:00:13.110> or<00:00:13.740> what<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> size<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.490> your

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
on how many or what the size of your

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.599 
on how many or what the size of your
beads<00:00:14.820> are<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.199> use<00:00:16.350> as<00:00:16.500> many<00:00:16.710> number<00:00:17.580> of

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
beads are you can use as many number of

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.220 
beads are you can use as many number of
beads<00:00:17.850> as<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.090> want<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.600> long<00:00:18.660> as<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
beads as you want as long as it's a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.040 
beads as you want as long as it's a
multiple<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.980> three<00:00:20.550> because<00:00:21.539> your<00:00:21.720> star<00:00:22.020> is

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
multiple of three because your star is

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.560 
multiple of three because your star is
going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> be<00:00:22.590> divided<00:00:23.369> into<00:00:23.550> each<00:00:23.880> side<00:00:24.210> three

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
going to be divided into each side three

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.000 
going to be divided into each side three
sections<00:00:25.140> you're<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> little

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
sections you're going to do a little

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.150 
sections you're going to do a little
bend<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.640> wire<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.359> about<00:00:28.109> two<00:00:28.710> inches

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
bend on the wire at about two inches

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.120 
bend on the wire at about two inches
like<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.170> make<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.529> faster

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
like that and then to make it faster

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.479 
like that and then to make it faster
I've<00:00:32.430> already<00:00:32.850> put<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.120> beads<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.200> wire

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
I've already put the beads on the wire

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.280 
I've already put the beads on the wire
so<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.520> put<00:00:36.050> I'm<00:00:37.050> using<00:00:37.370> nine<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.670> each<00:00:38.850> side<00:00:39.290> so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
so I put I'm using nine on each side so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.560 
so I put I'm using nine on each side so
we've<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.739> nine<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.360> there's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we've got nine here and then there's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240 
we've got nine here and then there's
actually<00:00:42.960> eighteen<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
actually eighteen here so I'm going to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.650 
actually eighteen here so I'm going to
just<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:45.360> three<00:00:45.870> six<00:00:46.379> nine<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.570> I'm

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
just do three six nine and then I'm

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.160 
just do three six nine and then I'm
going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> fold<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.700> just<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.940> three<00:00:51.449> six

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
going to fold it just like three six

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.060 
going to fold it just like three six
nine<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.860> there<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.550> make<00:00:53.730> sure<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.270> it's

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
nine right there to make sure that it's

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.619 
nine right there to make sure that it's
three<00:00:56.070> even<00:00:56.489> sides<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
three even sides and I'm going to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.439 
three even sides and I'm going to
actually<00:00:57.989> use<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.649> pliers<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> little

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
actually use my pliers and do a little

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.709 
actually use my pliers and do a little
bit<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.920> bend<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.180> there's<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> bit<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
bit of a bend there so there's a bit of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.740 
bit of a bend there so there's a bit of
slack<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> wire<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.270> then<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.450> want<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
slack in the wire and then you want to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.390 
slack in the wire and then you want to
twist<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.310> top<00:01:08.780> together<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> you've<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
twist the top together so you've got it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.060 
twist the top together so you've got it
like<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.390> actually<00:01:12.860> twist<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
like that and you can actually twist it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.230 
like that and you can actually twist it
around<00:01:14.600> okay<00:01:15.890> like<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:18.090> we're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
around okay like that and then we're

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.810 
around okay like that and then we're
gonna<00:01:18.390> cut<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.460> round

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
gonna cut that and and with your round

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.910 
gonna cut that and and with your round
pliers<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.659> want<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.960> actually<00:01:25.110> make<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.560> loop

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
pliers you want to actually make a loop

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.240 
pliers you want to actually make a loop
at<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> top<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> we're<00:01:28.619> gonna<00:01:28.740> make<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> little

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
at the top so we're gonna make a little

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.660 
at the top so we're gonna make a little
loop<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.850> our<00:01:30.030> round<00:01:30.270> pliers<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:31.549> twist<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
loop with our round pliers just twist it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.580 
loop with our round pliers just twist it
around<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:34.880> okay<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.750> we've<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
around like that okay so we've got the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.370 
around like that okay so we've got the
loop<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.509> end<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.780> having<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
loop so what you end up having is a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.569 
loop so what you end up having is a
triangle<00:01:41.509> with<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:42.869> loop<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.259> top

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
triangle with a little loop at the top

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.600 
triangle with a little loop at the top
like<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.930> okay<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:47.070> what<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> want<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
like that okay so then what you want to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.819 
like that okay so then what you want to
do<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.060> take<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.630> second<00:01:49.140> wire<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
do is take your second wire which is

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.910 
do is take your second wire which is
about<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.490> same<00:01:50.700> size<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.770> you're<00:01:52.770> gonna

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
about the same size and you're gonna

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.880 
about the same size and you're gonna
count<00:01:53.250> down<00:01:53.340> three<00:01:54.030> beads<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
count down three beads like that and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.209 
count down three beads like that and
you're<00:01:56.579> gonna<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:57.060> fold<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.630> end<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.110> that

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
you're gonna just fold the end like that

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.100 
you're gonna just fold the end like that
we<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.399> clip<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.759> after<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.360> you're<00:02:00.990> gonna

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
we can clip it after and you're gonna

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.150 
we can clip it after and you're gonna
put<00:02:01.469> three<00:02:02.250> beads<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> wire<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
put three beads on the wire so this is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.830 
put three beads on the wire so this is
the<00:02:08.310> part<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.729> takes<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.209> little<00:02:09.390> bit<00:02:09.539> more

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the part that takes a little bit more

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.650 
the part that takes a little bit more
time<00:02:10.140> because<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.679> want<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
time because you want it to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.170 
time because you want it to
be<00:02:13.660> even<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.220> would<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.610> put<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.880> beads

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
be even so I would have put the beads

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.790 
be even so I would have put the beads
all<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.600> at<00:02:16.750> once<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:17.200> they<00:02:17.380> would<00:02:17.530> fall<00:02:17.770> off

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
all on at once but they would fall off

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.140 
all on at once but they would fall off
in<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.430> process<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.810> twisting<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.920> wire

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
in the process of of twisting the wire

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.320 
in the process of of twisting the wire
around<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.900> we're<00:02:23.080> gonna<00:02:23.200> do<00:02:23.470> three<00:02:23.800> beads

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
around so we're gonna do three beads

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.650 
around so we're gonna do three beads
okay<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.310> find<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.910> little<00:02:31.150> wire<00:02:31.330> on

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
okay and if you find the little wire on

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.650 
okay and if you find the little wire on
the<00:02:31.810> back<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.860> little<00:02:33.160> long<00:02:33.430> what<00:02:34.390> I'm<00:02:34.510> gonna

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the back is a little long what I'm gonna

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.080 
the back is a little long what I'm gonna
do<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.990> actually<00:02:35.260> now<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.710> I'm<00:02:36.430> gonna<00:02:36.700> twist

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
do it actually now that I'm gonna twist

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.200 
do it actually now that I'm gonna twist
this<00:02:37.510> wire<00:02:37.870> around<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.590> secure<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.490> we're

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
this wire around to secure it so we're

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.430 
this wire around to secure it so we're
gonna<00:02:40.270> take<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.780> wire<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.320> twist<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.980> around

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
gonna take this wire and twist it around

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.870 
gonna take this wire and twist it around
I'll<00:02:44.440> show<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.710> up<00:02:44.950> close<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.460> can<00:02:45.580> see

how it's gonna look so what you've
actually<00:02:48.460> done<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:51.030> twisted<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.150> there<00:02:52.420> put

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
actually done is twisted it there put

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.510 
actually done is twisted it there put
your<00:02:53.050> three<00:02:53.320> beads<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.830> twist<00:02:54.100> at<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.310> other

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
your three beads and twist at the other

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.600 
your three beads and twist at the other
side<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.600> at<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.840> point<00:02:56.170> we<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.740> clip<00:02:57.400> that

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
side so at this point we can clip that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.940 
side so at this point we can clip that
little<00:02:58.000> first<00:02:58.270> end<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.530> get<00:03:02.530> rid<00:03:02.710> of<00:03:02.770> that

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
little first end just to get rid of that

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.720 
little first end just to get rid of that
extra<00:03:03.400> wire<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.140> can<00:03:05.320> always<00:03:05.470> pinch<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
extra wire and you can always pinch the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.230 
extra wire and you can always pinch the
end<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.560> with<00:03:08.560> your<00:03:08.740> flat<00:03:09.010> pliers<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
end in with your flat pliers so it

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.750 
end in with your flat pliers so it
doesn't<00:03:10.860> stick<00:03:11.860> out<00:03:12.040> okay

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
doesn't stick out okay

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.450 
doesn't stick out okay
so<00:03:12.970> now<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.240> fun<00:03:13.600> part<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.950> you've<00:03:15.100> got<00:03:15.310> your

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
so now the fun part so you've got your

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.180 
so now the fun part so you've got your
first<00:03:15.820> three<00:03:16.390> across<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.080> top<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:17.800> now

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
first three across the top and now

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.500 
first three across the top and now
you're<00:03:18.400> gonna<00:03:18.550> add<00:03:18.760> three<00:03:19.180> more<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:21.300> if<00:03:22.300> you

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
you're gonna add three more and if you

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.990 
you're gonna add three more and if you
could<00:03:22.720> do<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:22.900> twelve<00:03:23.800> beads<00:03:24.100> across<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:24.850> then

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
could do it twelve beads across so then

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.740 
could do it twelve beads across so then
you<00:03:25.120> would<00:03:25.300> do<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:25.540> four<00:03:26.320> for<00:03:26.709> whatever

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
you would do for four for whatever

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.180 
you would do for four for whatever
multiple<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.870> three<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.320> you<00:03:29.470> want<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.770> do<00:03:29.950> is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
multiple of three that you want to do is

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.970 
multiple of three that you want to do is
gonna<00:03:30.340> work<00:03:31.050> okay<00:03:32.050> so<00:03:32.080> we've<00:03:32.410> got<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.830> next

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
gonna work okay so we've got the next

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.729 
gonna work okay so we've got the next
three<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:34.570> this<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:34.870> continuing<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.590> line

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
three so this is continuing the line

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.850 
three so this is continuing the line
that's<00:03:36.250> gonna<00:03:36.400> go<00:03:36.640> across<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.480> now<00:03:38.350> you're

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
that's gonna go across and now you're

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.110 
that's gonna go across and now you're
gonna<00:03:38.980> bend<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.430> down<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:41.320> bend<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.860> down<00:03:42.130> so

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
gonna bend it down and bend it down so

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.120 
gonna bend it down and bend it down so
it's<00:03:43.300> starting<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.260> little<00:03:44.410> bit<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.800> look<00:03:44.950> like

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
it's starting a little bit to look like

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.460 
it's starting a little bit to look like
the<00:03:45.280> Star<00:03:45.550> of<00:03:45.640> David<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.720> now<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.930> want<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.290> put

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
the Star of David so now you want to put

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.430 
the Star of David so now you want to put
three<00:03:47.800> beads<00:03:48.070> there<00:03:48.840> okay<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:49.870> I'm<00:03:50.200> going<00:03:50.350> to

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
three beads there okay and I'm going to

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.130 
three beads there okay and I'm going to
show<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.590> how<00:03:50.830> that's<00:03:51.010> going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.459> look

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
show you how that's going to look

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.690 
show you how that's going to look
so<00:03:53.140> we'll<00:03:53.290> put<00:03:53.500> three<00:03:54.220> more<00:03:54.250> beads<00:03:58.380> mm-hmm<00:03:59.440> and

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
so we'll put three more beads mm-hmm and

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.140 
so we'll put three more beads mm-hmm and
so<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.900> put<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.260> in<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.500> right<00:04:02.680> position

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
so and to put it in the right position

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.740 
so and to put it in the right position
you<00:04:04.150> want<00:04:04.390> it<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.720> be<00:04:05.220> three<00:04:06.220> beads<00:04:06.459> than<00:04:07.450> that

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
you want it to be three beads than that

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.900 
you want it to be three beads than that
and<00:04:08.080> then<00:04:08.320> another<00:04:08.440> three<00:04:08.920> beads<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.489> then

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
and then another three beads and then

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.150 
and then another three beads and then
you're<00:04:10.060> going<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.269> attach<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.540> here<00:04:10.980> loop<00:04:11.980> it

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
you're going to attach it here loop it

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.910 
you're going to attach it here loop it
around<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:12.910> did<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:14.290> first<00:04:14.590> time

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
around like you did the the first time

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.759 
around like you did the the first time
so<00:04:15.820> I'm<00:04:15.880> gonna<00:04:16.000> loop<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.330> around<00:04:16.419> there<00:04:16.870> okay

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
so I'm gonna loop it around there okay

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.039 
so I'm gonna loop it around there okay
and<00:04:18.010> then<00:04:18.640> you'll<00:04:19.120> see<00:04:19.390> there<00:04:19.570> should<00:04:19.810> still

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
and then you'll see there should still

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.070 
and then you'll see there should still
be<00:04:20.109> three<00:04:20.440> beads<00:04:20.710> at<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.100> end<00:04:21.720> twist<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.900> right

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
be three beads at the end twist it right

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.620 
be three beads at the end twist it right
around<00:04:23.940> then<00:04:24.940> as<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.270> go<00:04:25.419> you
