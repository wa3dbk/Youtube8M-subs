00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.360 
the cap for the newel post we're going
to<00:00:05.580> route<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:06.330> edge<00:00:06.810> onto<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.919> piece<00:00:08.160> of

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
to route this edge onto this piece of

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.780 
to route this edge onto this piece of
oak

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
oak

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.330 
oak
now<00:00:08.880> I've<00:00:09.000> got<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> piece<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.660> oak<00:00:10.160> clamped<00:00:11.160> to

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
now I've got the piece of oak clamped to

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.850 
now I've got the piece of oak clamped to
our<00:00:11.400> workbench<00:00:11.940> using<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> large<00:00:12.860> bench

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
our workbench using the large bench

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.620 
our workbench using the large bench
clamp<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.610> I've<00:00:14.730> got<00:00:14.940> one<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> wider

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
clamp and I've got one of the wider

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.660 
clamp and I've got one of the wider
opening<00:00:16.230> face<00:00:16.500> frame<00:00:16.800> clamps<00:00:17.220> down<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.430> that

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
opening face frame clamps down on that

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.880 
opening face frame clamps down on that
end<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:18.480> because<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.109> really<00:00:19.650> large

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
end now because this is a really large

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.970 
end now because this is a really large
router<00:00:20.550> profile<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.840> important<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
router profile it's important that I

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.300 
router profile it's important that I
make<00:00:23.279> two<00:00:23.880> passes<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:25.380> get<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.680> cleanest<00:00:26.070> cut

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
make two passes to get the cleanest cut

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
make two passes to get the cleanest cut
and<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> little<00:00:27.810> bit

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and also it's going to be a little bit

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.230 
and also it's going to be a little bit
safer<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.429> pass<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.939> we're<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
safer the first pass that we're going to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.030 
safer the first pass that we're going to
make<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.570> called<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.900> climb<00:00:31.170> cut<00:00:31.500> pass<00:00:31.740> now<00:00:31.980> I'm

I'm<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.730> take<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> cut<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I'm just going to go take a cut and

traditional left to right to get the
final<00:00:48.989> cut<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> smooth<00:00:50.460> cut

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.150 

these<00:01:00.000> pieces<00:01:00.359> need<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.140> mitered<00:01:01.710> together

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
these pieces need to be mitered together

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.910 
these pieces need to be mitered together
to<00:01:02.910> form<00:01:03.210> part<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> cap<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> noodle

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
to form part of the cap of the noodle

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.730 
to form part of the cap of the noodle
post<00:01:05.659> we<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:07.020> those<00:01:07.140> joints<00:01:07.590> together

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
post we can put those joints together

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.560 
post we can put those joints together
using<00:01:08.189> pocket<00:01:08.340> screws<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.450> really

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
using pocket screws and it's really

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
using pocket screws and it's really
important<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> durable<00:01:10.890> joint

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
important that that be a durable joint

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
important that that be a durable joint
because<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.810> right<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.020> top<00:01:13.380> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
because it's going to be right on top of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.359 
because it's going to be right on top of
the<00:01:13.619> newel<00:01:13.890> post<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.509> getting<00:01:15.780> ready<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
the newel post so we're getting ready to

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.100 
the newel post so we're getting ready to
cut<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> pocket<00:01:17.909> hole<00:01:18.090> screws<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> bottom

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
cut the pocket hole screws in the bottom

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.649 
cut the pocket hole screws in the bottom
of<00:01:19.439> each<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> these<00:01:19.830> pieces<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.610> again<00:01:21.299> with

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
of each of these pieces but again with

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.920 
of each of these pieces but again with
pocket<00:01:22.080> screws<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:23.130> only<00:01:23.310> put<00:01:23.790> holes<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.630> one

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
pocket screws we only put holes in one

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:43.920 
pocket screws we only put holes in one
side<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> joint

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.779 

if<00:01:44.930> I<00:01:45.110> was<00:01:45.259> using<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.680> dowel<00:01:45.979> I'd<00:01:46.340> have<00:01:46.549> to<00:01:46.670> be

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
if I was using a dowel I'd have to be

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.880 
if I was using a dowel I'd have to be
incredibly<00:01:47.270> accurate<00:01:47.780> where<00:01:48.320> I<00:01:48.350> was<00:01:48.590> putting

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
incredibly accurate where I was putting

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.670 
incredibly accurate where I was putting
the<00:01:48.979> holes<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:50.000> with<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.270> pocket<00:01:50.479> screws<00:01:50.990> as

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
the holes but with the pocket screws as

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.200 
the holes but with the pocket screws as
long<00:01:51.950> as<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.250> make<00:01:52.490> sure<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.030> hole

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
long as I make sure that the hole

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.050 
long as I make sure that the hole
doesn't<00:01:53.659> run<00:01:53.810> out<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:55.009> inside<00:01:55.549> edge<00:01:55.789> where

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
doesn't run out on the inside edge where

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.460 
doesn't run out on the inside edge where
we've<00:01:56.210> routed<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:56.810> can<00:01:56.990> put<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.229> holes<00:01:57.380> just

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
we've routed it I can put the holes just

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:12.660 
we've routed it I can put the holes just
about<00:01:57.799> any<00:01:58.009> place<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:58.340> want<00:02:09.910> okay

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670

now the most important thing is going to
make<00:02:14.870> sure<00:02:14.989> be<00:02:15.410> making<00:02:15.830> sure<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.250> we<00:02:16.370> get<00:02:16.519> all

that<00:04:27.310> joint<00:04:27.699> spun<00:04:27.970> just<00:04:28.210> about<00:04:28.389> disappeared

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.499 

okay<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:48.220> second<00:04:48.699> piece<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:48.880> our<00:04:49.090> cap<00:04:49.330> is

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
going to fit over this so really all

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.629 
going to fit over this so really all
we're<00:04:50.979> gonna<00:04:51.160> see<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.490> about<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.940> outside

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
we're gonna see is about the outside

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.029 
we're gonna see is about the outside
inch<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.940> half<00:04:54.970> or<00:04:55.389> so<00:04:55.630> we'll<00:04:56.530> go<00:04:56.680> ahead<00:04:56.710> and

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
inch and a half or so we'll go ahead and

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:09.969 
inch and a half or so we'll go ahead and
work<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.580> little<00:04:57.970> bit<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.210> glue<00:04:58.449> into<00:04:59.380> all<00:04:59.800> these

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.769 

those<00:05:10.979> joints<00:05:11.520> should<00:05:11.699> stay<00:05:11.999> together<00:05:12.180> pretty

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
those joints should stay together pretty

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.480 
those joints should stay together pretty
tightly<00:05:13.110> since<00:05:13.619> we've<00:05:13.770> got<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.069> pocket

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
tightly since we've got the pocket

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.540 
tightly since we've got the pocket
screws<00:05:14.789> in<00:05:14.999> there<00:05:15.919> these<00:05:16.919> are<00:05:17.099> wide<00:05:17.339> enough

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
screws in there these are wide enough

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.679 
screws in there these are wide enough
boards<00:05:18.029> person<00:05:18.659> might<00:05:19.020> want<00:05:19.409> to<00:05:19.499> think<00:05:19.800> about

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
boards person might want to think about

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.439 
boards person might want to think about
sealing<00:05:21.689> the<00:05:21.839> back<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.349> them<00:05:22.529> a<00:05:22.589> little<00:05:22.740> bit

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
sealing the back of them a little bit

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.480 
sealing the back of them a little bit
especially<00:05:24.449> any<00:05:24.990> piece<00:05:25.229> of<00:05:25.259> solid<00:05:26.069> wood<00:05:26.249> that

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
especially any piece of solid wood that

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.159 
especially any piece of solid wood that
you<00:05:26.610> use<00:05:26.819> on<00:05:27.059> something<00:05:27.389> like<00:05:27.479> a<00:05:27.509> newel<00:05:27.899> post

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
you use on something like a newel post

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.709 
you use on something like a newel post
that's<00:05:28.860> going<00:05:29.129> to<00:05:29.189> be<00:05:29.309> wider<00:05:29.580> than<00:05:29.849> 5<00:05:30.300> inches

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
that's going to be wider than 5 inches

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.469 
that's going to be wider than 5 inches
these<00:05:30.869> are<00:05:31.050> 5<00:05:31.229> inches<00:05:31.529> it's<00:05:32.490> a<00:05:32.639> good<00:05:32.849> idea<00:05:32.999> to

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
these are 5 inches it's a good idea to

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.629 
these are 5 inches it's a good idea to
seal<00:05:33.779> the<00:05:33.960> back<00:05:34.169> up<00:05:34.409> because<00:05:34.710> what<00:05:34.889> happens<00:05:35.339> is

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
seal the back up because what happens is

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.809 
seal the back up because what happens is
you<00:05:36.180> get<00:05:36.330> one<00:05:36.599> face<00:05:36.990> of<00:05:37.259> the<00:05:37.289> wood<00:05:37.559> sealed<00:05:38.039> the

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
you get one face of the wood sealed the

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.029 
you get one face of the wood sealed the
other<00:05:38.999> side<00:05:39.270> isn't<00:05:39.509> sealed<00:05:39.899> so<00:05:40.289> as<00:05:40.469> this<00:05:40.649> tries

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
other side isn't sealed so as this tries

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.790 
other side isn't sealed so as this tries
to<00:05:41.369> dry<00:05:41.669> out<00:05:41.969> and<00:05:42.389> the<00:05:42.930> front<00:05:43.169> side<00:05:43.409> doesn't

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
to dry out and the front side doesn't

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.070 
to dry out and the front side doesn't
dry<00:05:43.979> out<00:05:44.009> as<00:05:44.399> quickly<00:05:44.669> or<00:05:44.819> take<00:05:45.300> on<00:05:45.569> moisture

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
dry out as quickly or take on moisture

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.350 
dry out as quickly or take on moisture
if<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.229> humidity<00:05:46.770> is<00:05:46.830> up<00:05:47.069> then<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.939> piece<00:05:48.149> can

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
if the humidity is up then the piece can

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.189 
if the humidity is up then the piece can
either<00:05:48.569> cup<00:05:48.959> or<00:05:49.259> bow<00:05:50.539> but<00:05:51.539> we're<00:05:51.839> just<00:05:51.869> about

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
either cup or bow but we're just about

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.959 
either cup or bow but we're just about
ready<00:05:52.499> to<00:05:52.559> add<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:52.800> square<00:05:53.249> block<00:05:53.520> here<00:05:53.849> we're

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
ready to add a square block here we're

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.639 
ready to add a square block here we're
going<00:05:54.059> to<00:05:54.119> run<00:05:54.209> a<00:05:54.300> panel<00:05:54.629> mold<00:05:54.959> around<00:05:55.319> it<00:05:55.499> and

going to run a panel mold around it and

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:58.639 
going to run a panel mold around it and
the<00:05:55.770> cap<00:05:56.009> will<00:05:56.249> be<00:05:56.279> done
