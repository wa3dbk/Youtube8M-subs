rock dust this is going to help put in
some<00:01:25.650> more<00:01:25.770> nutrients<00:01:26.869> potatoes<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.020> pretty

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
some more nutrients potatoes are pretty

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.640 
some more nutrients potatoes are pretty
likely<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.829> anyway<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.600> I'm<00:01:30.600> amending<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.490 
likely there anyway but I'm amending the
soil<00:01:31.829> every<00:01:32.400> time<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.909> plant<00:01:33.659> because<00:01:34.259> I'm

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
soil every time I plant because I'm

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.429 
soil every time I plant because I'm
trying<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:37.049> really

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439

really<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:38.750> very<00:01:39.750> very<00:01:39.930> quality<00:01:40.650> soil<00:01:40.939> this

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
really have very very quality soil this

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.460 
really have very very quality soil this
is<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.360> getting<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.290> this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
is actually getting there because this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.359 
is actually getting there because this
started<00:01:43.920> out<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> raised<00:01:44.880> bed<00:01:44.909> obviously<00:01:46.369> so

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
started out as a raised bed obviously so

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.359 
started out as a raised bed obviously so
I<00:01:47.399> planted<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> kale<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.390> grew<00:01:49.320> them<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.890> three

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I planted the kale I grew them in three

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.260 
I planted the kale I grew them in three
weeks<00:01:50.579> ago<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.060> put<00:01:51.390> them<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.720> pots<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.320> this

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
weeks ago I put them in pots like this

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.219 
weeks ago I put them in pots like this
neither<00:01:54.270> actually

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
neither actually

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.520 
neither actually
grabbed<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.740> over<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:57.079> these<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.200> actually

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
grabbed one over here these are actually

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.330 
grabbed one over here these are actually
the<00:01:58.680> ones<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.070> was

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
the ones I was

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.830 
the ones I was
and<00:02:01.340> recycled<00:02:01.850> these<00:02:02.000> obviously<00:02:02.480> these<00:02:02.660> were

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
and recycled these obviously these were

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.890 
and recycled these obviously these were
actually<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.590> think<00:02:03.800> somebody<00:02:04.100> gave<00:02:04.340> me<00:02:04.580> these

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
actually I think somebody gave me these

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.490 
actually I think somebody gave me these
made<00:02:05.900> my<00:02:06.020> own<00:02:06.050> potting<00:02:06.590> soil<00:02:06.890> use<00:02:07.850> vermiculite

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
made my own potting soil use vermiculite

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.650 
made my own potting soil use vermiculite
coir<00:02:09.500> fiber<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.960> which<00:02:11.960> is<00:02:12.080> coconut<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
coir fiber and which is coconut and

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.110 
coir fiber and which is coconut and
compost<00:02:14.660> high<00:02:14.960> quality<00:02:15.380> compost<00:02:16.090> about<00:02:17.090> a

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
compost high quality compost about a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.040 
compost high quality compost about a
third<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.630> each<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:19.040> gives<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.310> really<00:02:19.550> good

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
third of each it gives a really good

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.380 
third of each it gives a really good
medium<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.370> growing<00:02:22.840> plants<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.430> use

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
medium for growing plants and so I use

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.440 
medium for growing plants and so I use
it<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:28.310> actually<00:02:28.430> use<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.820> lot<00:02:29.030> lot<00:02:29.210> in<00:02:29.360> my

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
it you actually use a lot lot in my

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.910 
it you actually use a lot lot in my
raised<00:02:29.630> beds<00:02:29.930> as<00:02:30.110> well<00:02:30.290> although<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.710> go<00:02:30.890> a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
raised beds as well although I go a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.700 
raised beds as well although I go a
little<00:02:31.160> heavier<00:02:31.490> on<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.670> compost<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:33.470> anyway

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
little heavier on the compost but anyway

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.800 
little heavier on the compost but anyway
I've<00:02:33.830> just<00:02:34.010> planted<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.460> and<00:02:34.850> should<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.780> a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
I've just planted this and should have a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.680 
I've just planted this and should have a
really<00:02:36.020> good<00:02:36.200> crop<00:02:36.500> from<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:37.209> about<00:02:38.209> six

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
really good crop from this about six

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.020 
really good crop from this about six
inches<00:02:38.990> apart<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:40.280> don't<00:02:40.430> want<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.610> grow<00:02:40.730> too

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
inches apart you don't want to grow too

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.750 
inches apart you don't want to grow too
close<00:02:41.300> I'm<00:02:41.690> probably<00:02:42.440> pushing<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.100> envelope

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
close I'm probably pushing the envelope

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.000 
close I'm probably pushing the envelope
a<00:02:44.270> little<00:02:44.300> bit<00:02:44.540> because<00:02:45.080> probably<00:02:45.770> eight

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
a little bit because probably eight
