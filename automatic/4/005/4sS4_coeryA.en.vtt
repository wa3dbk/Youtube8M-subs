00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.140
 roselyne his mother the limit shelton 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.380
 similar plans but our plans 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.989
 salam aleikoum moubarak is us 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.720
 reach the 17th day of this blessed month 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.480
 wall woman from there and we went 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.070
 through several elements we 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.610
 always follow the prophet had everything 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.260
 this and on this day there is one thing that 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.659
 is who I am not really our 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.760
 chronology and at the same time a thing 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.710
 which is particularly important that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.260
 go live the prophet to that you know it 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.019
 he carries the message he brings it to his 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.870
 community and he's going to live but so 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.019
 very deep in a very perverse way 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.289
 he will live adversity he will live 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.810
 adversity and he's going to live the rejection is going 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.490
 to live the persecution will see his 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.440
 companions those who are most 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.030
 vulnerable among his companions not the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.050
 richer and you see as sometimes 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.950
 the persecution is doubly unfair 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.750
 because she does not necessarily 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.580
 touch the people who are most 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.289
 directly related to the prophet in sanaa but 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.759
 those of his spiritual community who 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:32.349
 are the weakest we will see bilel 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.599
 for example being persecuted by 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:37.989
 stones and attached he will not stop saying 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:41.700
 to mafias casually this is the 

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:46.440
 same way that is going to be that is going to be 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.430
 persecuted and whose sister first 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.250
 one of the women will be sleeping this 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.980
 point of view persecute her until the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.410
 dead and so as he moves on to 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.850
 side he sees them being persecuted the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.920
 prophet in the room does not have the means 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.710
 to intervene he does not have the means to 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:11.070
 able to get them out of two where the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.590
 protected from these persecutions and he 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.390
 will restore patience to the families of jass 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 our appointment is the paradise 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.620
 to say that it is necessary from this point of 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.720
 view there when one wears at once 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.670
 prepared to prepare in the light of 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.310
 message sometimes to the dark sides of 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.250
 men as much the message is bright 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.890
 by god so much the message will find in 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.770
 face of him men whose character 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.610
 sometimes dark sometimes the character the 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.640
 darker 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.860
 immorality in the rejection in the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.420
 will power and ben will attack 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.300
 they will attack to the point of wanting 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.280
 kill the prophet alone then again 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.330
 once we have already talked about it there is 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.430
 some days 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.560
 we come back here to something that 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.360
 that we have to understand from a point of 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.070
 Muslim view that we have to understand 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.540
 mom we are fasting then some 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.880
 of you young people in africa others 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.239
 of you young people in europe or young people 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.550
 in the united states to young people in asia and ben 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.530
 in these young people in this young they 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.900
 will find themselves in front of them about who 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.420
 are words where the image of Islam 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.880
 is negative or where we really are 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.720
 in the rejection we are in the in the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.760
 criticism well 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.130
 from this point of view nothing new in 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.170
 all this is as old as all 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.260
 these revelations the and this adversity 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.800
 she requires like family and a 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.530
 circle 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.660
 she will require the conviction 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.550
 personal confidence in 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.970
 self confidence in his values ​​trust 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.200
 not to be subject to the judgment of 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.150
 others but first in the trust 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.800
 intimate and personal and all that comes 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.140
 of all that I could say otherwise 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.870
 the knowledge of lelas the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.910
 recognition of the torrid the quran the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.230
 pray 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.550
 the meaning of life all that is 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.880
 important this is what we already have 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.240
 seen 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.840
 and on the other hand of course compared 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.640
 to this adversity there in Persia 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 event the trust to his big 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.080
 message is perseverance does it 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.120
 to resist you see the professional 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.130
 in non-violence in the fact of not 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.370
 not react to given moments of 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.290
 refuse to react and react only 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.419
 against that's why we 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.890
 have to remember to this day it's the 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.480
 seventeenth day twigs launched the 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.330
 day when the battle takes place to beat the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.250
 later in the life of the prophet asada 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.040
 it was a battle that was the victory 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.840
 that was imposed on Muslims and they 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.060
 won it in the resistance by saying 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.790
 are not violent in the resistance 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.740
 all the time always as much as we 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.340
 can but if some want us 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.220
 eliminate 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.960
 we will have to choose our weapons for 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.590
 to be able to survive that's what they have 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.480
 does bad 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.680
 that's what made them win us 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.200
 let's celebrate this battle 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.690
 on this day of the 17th day of Ramadan as 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.390
 to tell us a deep faith and a 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.460
 resistance determined by the means that 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.919
 are still in non-violence there have 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.370
 little but if those who attack want 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.430
 kill 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.750
 we will resist to stay alive and 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.090
 Charles God help us 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.620

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.300
