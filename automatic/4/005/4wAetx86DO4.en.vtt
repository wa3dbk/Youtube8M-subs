00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.270
 epic gameplay of gta5 galera 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.430

 Well, people I'll show you. 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.710
 to teach 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.140
 How does that flying saucer there that he 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.129
 the spaceship that finally appears at 3 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.850
 morning hours 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.589
 It's really not explaining to unravel 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.629
 this mystery for you now in the video 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.879
 today we are going to choose our 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.920
 gun snipper here right? 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.570
 the team is showing one thing well 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.150
 interesting that a lot of people go through 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.360
 here I have not seen the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.729
 It's up to you guys, you see me there. 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.100
 I have written in English which is the strip 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.270
 to come back when the cell phone when 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.370
 is complete 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.390
 I'm going back here when it's complete. 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.240
 Something like that 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.260
 guys then the next one down too 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.969
 of being of this wooden platform has 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.070
 an alien symbol there is so short 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.590
 I did not finish the game yet 100% is 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.500
 100% does not end the campaign 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.880
 game and some say is almost sure 99.9 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.549
 Do you have to end the campaign? 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.979
 do not 100% complete campaign 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.210
 then you come back here this mountain he 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.009
 and the right 3am 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.859
 about 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.399
 You'll see this flying saucer right there. 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:53.020
 so what happens if you are 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.850
 because many people speak the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.210
 speculation that the assembly that is this 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.749
 that then it is the following date 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.759
 campaign is you close the normal campaign 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.229
 and seeing this place at three o'clock 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.570
 you probably will see that 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.240
 the flying saucer all lit up pretty cool 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.680
 It's one more easter egg , I hope to bring it. 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.170
 this video will soon leave end of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.910
 Certainly for you in this social area. 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.430

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.990

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.430

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.040

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.400
