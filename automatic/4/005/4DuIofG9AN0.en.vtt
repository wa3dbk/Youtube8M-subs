00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
intake and exhaust valves so we start by

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.090 
intake and exhaust valves so we start by
putting<00:00:18.119> spring<00:00:18.600> seats<00:00:20.480> back<00:00:21.480> actually<00:00:22.470> using

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
putting spring seats back actually using

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.450 
putting spring seats back actually using
the<00:00:23.189> spring<00:00:23.490> seats<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> springs<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.160> have

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the spring seats and the springs I have

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.810 
the spring seats and the springs I have
replaced<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.390> retainers<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:29.010> valves<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
replaced the retainers the valves and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.780 
replaced the retainers the valves and
the<00:00:30.029> keepers<00:00:30.980> but<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.009> am<00:00:32.160> degree<00:00:32.399> using<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the keepers but I am degree using the

lubed the stem and I'm installing valve
-<00:00:46.100> I<00:00:52.960> think<00:00:53.960> for<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.290> purposes<00:00:54.739> of

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
- I think for the purposes of

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.490 
- I think for the purposes of

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
illustration I'm gonna leave one out at

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:10.740 
illustration I'm gonna leave one out at
the<00:00:57.620> moment<00:00:59.110> there's<00:01:00.110> about<00:01:00.260> two<00:01:01.809> spring<00:01:06.820> seat

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.230 

grab<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:13.899> spring<00:01:14.899> valve<00:01:15.830> spring<00:01:16.100> compressor

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
grab the spring valve spring compressor

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.090 
grab the spring valve spring compressor
used<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:17.990> large<00:01:18.759> spreader<00:01:19.759> type<00:01:20.119> the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
used in the large spreader type the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:29.279 
used in the large spreader type the
smaller<00:01:24.009> type<00:01:25.009> doesn't<00:01:25.429> work<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:25.940> this<00:01:26.830> head

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
smaller type doesn't work on this head

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.930 
smaller type doesn't work on this head
can't<00:01:30.289> get<00:01:30.470> enough<00:01:30.679> Springs<00:01:31.009> compressed<00:01:31.520> so

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
can't get enough Springs compressed so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.480 
can't get enough Springs compressed so
I'm<00:01:32.030> going<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.240> use<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.570> larger<00:01:32.990> spanner<00:01:33.320> type

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.740 

and<00:01:37.490> it's<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.820> sin<00:01:38.060> just<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:41.259> depressed<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:44.300> set

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
and it's a sin just so depressed and set

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.690 
and it's a sin just so depressed and set
and<00:01:45.709> it<00:01:46.099> holds<00:01:46.310> itself<00:01:48.789> grabbing<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:51.700> two

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
and it holds itself grabbing the two

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.719 
and it holds itself grabbing the two
halves<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:57.050> keepers<00:01:57.800> you<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.489> see<00:01:59.619> the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
halves of the keepers you can see the

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.499 
halves of the keepers you can see the
grooved<00:02:01.729> head<00:02:02.479> on<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.899> valve<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.759> this

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
grooved head on the valve and this

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.320 
grooved head on the valve and this
keeper<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.880> can<00:02:08.030> get<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.300> into<00:02:08.479> frame<00:02:08.989> here

fingers are going to be in the frame a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.790 
fingers are going to be in the frame a
little<00:02:31.160> bit<00:02:33.760> excuse

if<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.599> will<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.760> I'm<00:03:33.910> gonna<00:03:34.060> use<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.480> same

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
if you will and I'm gonna use the same

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.360 
if you will and I'm gonna use the same
position<00:03:35.260> notice<00:03:35.500> I've<00:03:35.620> rotated<00:03:35.859> that<00:03:36.099> around

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
position notice I've rotated that around

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.750 
position notice I've rotated that around
to<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.640> back<00:03:36.849> and<00:03:38.910> I'm<00:03:39.910> gonna<00:03:40.060> install<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
to the back and I'm gonna install the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.520 
to the back and I'm gonna install the
same<00:03:42.760> position<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.450> first<00:03:43.660> one<00:03:43.930> started

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.640 

coming<00:03:47.530> in<00:03:47.680> at<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.889> second<00:03:49.440> first<00:03:50.440> with<00:03:50.620> a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
coming in at the second first with a

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.240 
coming in at the second first with a
couple<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.069> fingers<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:52.510> tool<00:03:56.099> just<00:03:57.099> to

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
couple of fingers and the tool just to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.740 
couple of fingers and the tool just to
put<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.579> in<00:03:57.700> place<00:03:57.940> without<00:03:58.180> bumping<00:03:58.480> the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
put it in place without bumping the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.530 
put it in place without bumping the
first<00:03:58.959> one<00:03:59.169> on<00:03:59.319> got<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.310> again<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.329> takes<00:04:01.419> a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
first one on got it again it takes a

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.580 
first one on got it again it takes a
little<00:04:01.630> practice<00:04:02.019> but<00:04:02.049> once<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.349> get<00:04:02.500> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
little practice but once you get the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.349 
little practice but once you get the
hang<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.130> goes<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.579> pretty<00:04:03.790> easily<00:04:04.000> so

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
hang of it it goes in pretty easily so

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.849 
hang of it it goes in pretty easily so
I've<00:04:04.959> got<00:04:05.139> both<00:04:06.299> semicircle<00:04:07.560> grooved<00:04:08.560> halves

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
I've got both semicircle grooved halves

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.349 
I've got both semicircle grooved halves
mated<00:04:09.549> with<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:11.319> stem<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.769> valve<00:04:12.359> now

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
mated with the stem of the valve now

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.089 
mated with the stem of the valve now
I've<00:04:13.540> got<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.750> release<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.319> spring<00:04:14.590> compressor

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
I've got a release the spring compressor

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.930 
I've got a release the spring compressor
centered<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.769> slowly<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:18.669> capture<00:04:19.209> those<00:04:19.510> two

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
centered and slowly to capture those two

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.980 
centered and slowly to capture those two
halves<00:04:21.940> in<00:04:22.450> place<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:24.550> if<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.330> watch<00:04:25.570> the

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
halves in place and if you watch the

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.600 
halves in place and if you watch the
spring<00:04:26.320> compressor<00:04:26.650> ups<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.979> little<00:04:27.250> bit<00:04:27.370> quick

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
spring compressor ups a little bit quick

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.270 
spring compressor ups a little bit quick
but<00:04:27.970> as<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.690> came<00:04:28.840> up<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.560> captured<00:04:30.039> them<00:04:30.160> in

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
but as it came up it captured them in

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.129 
but as it came up it captured them in
place<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.169> they<00:04:32.169> are<00:04:32.470> going<00:04:32.710> nowhere<00:04:34.139> that's

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
place and they are going nowhere that's

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.019 
place and they are going nowhere that's
the<00:04:35.380> first<00:04:35.650> one

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:39.029 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.539 

the<00:04:39.269> same<00:04:39.629> exercise<00:04:39.809> I've<00:04:40.379> already<00:04:40.679> placed

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:41.549 
the same exercise I've already placed

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:45.379 
the same exercise I've already placed
the<00:04:41.819> spring<00:04:42.089> seat<00:04:42.419> in<00:04:43.489> so<00:04:44.489> now<00:04:44.819> here's<00:04:45.209> the

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
the spring seat in so now here's the

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:54.399 
the spring seat in so now here's the
spring<00:04:45.839> all<00:04:46.319> these<00:04:46.529> parts<00:04:47.069> are<00:04:47.629> lubricated

this<00:04:55.409> is<00:04:55.559> Etan<00:04:58.099> and<00:04:59.099> it<00:04:59.279> would<00:04:59.369> have<00:04:59.459> been

00:04:59.539 --> 00:04:59.549 
this is Etan and it would have been

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.299 
this is Etan and it would have been
easier<00:04:59.879> to<00:04:59.909> see<00:05:00.179> what<00:05:00.299> I'm<00:05:00.389> doing<00:05:00.689> them

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:01.309 
easier to see what I'm doing them

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:05.809

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:26.809 
it spun down sliding into groove one

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:34.020 
it spun down sliding into groove one
more<00:06:27.809> I<00:06:28.729> missed

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:41.040 

I<00:06:34.140> could<00:06:35.140> pick<00:06:35.350> up<00:06:35.530> right<00:06:35.830> in<00:06:35.950> place<00:06:40.050> the

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
I could pick up right in place the

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.690 
I could pick up right in place the
direction<00:06:41.530> of<00:06:41.620> the<00:06:41.710> tone<00:06:41.920> matters<00:06:42.340> it<00:06:42.520> needs

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
direction of the tone matters it needs

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.530 
direction of the tone matters it needs
to<00:06:42.880> be<00:06:43.000> conical<00:06:43.660> down<00:06:44.430> the<00:06:45.430> wider<00:06:45.670> diameter<00:06:45.940> up

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
to be conical down the wider diameter up

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.950 
to be conical down the wider diameter up
smaller<00:06:47.350> diameter<00:06:47.830> down<00:06:48.070> and<00:06:48.480> they've<00:06:49.480> got<00:06:49.810> it

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
smaller diameter down and they've got it

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.170 
smaller diameter down and they've got it
it's<00:06:50.500> in<00:06:50.620> place<00:06:50.920> now<00:06:51.430> I'm<00:06:51.520> gonna<00:06:51.670> rotate<00:06:51.880> it

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
it's in place now I'm gonna rotate it

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.730 
it's in place now I'm gonna rotate it

around to the back just like I did the
other<00:06:54.330> there<00:06:55.330> so<00:06:55.720> that<00:06:55.900> first<00:06:56.170> half<00:06:56.380> is<00:06:56.560> on<00:06:58.650> and

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
other there so that first half is on and

first<00:07:01.210> few<00:07:01.450> will<00:07:01.570> be<00:07:01.690> a<00:07:01.720> real<00:07:01.990> pain<00:07:02.410> in<00:07:02.440> the

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
first few will be a real pain in the

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.070 
first few will be a real pain in the
you-know-what<00:07:03.270> once<00:07:04.270> you<00:07:04.420> get<00:07:04.570> the<00:07:04.690> hang<00:07:04.720> of

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
second one in place so I'm working from

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.810

my finger from the other and that works
the<00:07:23.650> best<00:07:25.860> get<00:07:26.860> down<00:07:27.520> into<00:07:27.790> position<00:07:28.740> and

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
the best get down into position and

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.620 
the best get down into position and
that's<00:07:30.130> gonna<00:07:30.460> pop<00:07:30.700> in<00:07:30.940> there<00:07:31.090> on<00:07:31.210> the<00:07:31.330> first

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
that's gonna pop in there on the first

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:37.980 
that's gonna pop in there on the first
try<00:07:31.960> look<00:07:32.200> at<00:07:32.320> there<00:07:32.530> there<00:07:33.040> we<00:07:33.160> go<00:07:36.810> and<00:07:37.810> then

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
try look at there there we go and then

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.030 
try look at there there we go and then
I'm<00:07:38.110> gonna<00:07:38.290> release<00:07:38.620> this<00:07:38.920> one<00:07:39.160> slowly<00:07:41.040> wasn't

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:42.040 
I'm gonna release this one slowly wasn't

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.590 
I'm gonna release this one slowly wasn't
so<00:07:42.220> careful<00:07:42.400> about<00:07:42.670> that<00:07:42.940> with<00:07:43.060> the<00:07:43.120> last<00:07:43.330> one

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.600 
so careful about that with the last one

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.570 
so careful about that with the last one
but<00:07:43.720> I<00:07:43.780> was<00:07:43.960> centered<00:07:44.470> so<00:07:44.800> just<00:07:45.070> make<00:07:45.340> sure<00:07:45.460> I'm

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:45.580 
but I was centered so just make sure I'm

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.070 
but I was centered so just make sure I'm
centered<00:07:46.030> in<00:07:46.150> case<00:07:46.330> and<00:07:46.540> let's<00:07:46.690> go<00:07:46.840> quickly

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 
centered in case and let's go quickly

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.380 
centered in case and let's go quickly
but<00:07:47.320> it<00:07:47.470> won't<00:07:47.680> I've<00:07:47.860> got<00:07:48.070> it<00:07:48.250> going<00:07:48.970> slow

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.390 
but it won't I've got it going slow

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:56.160 
but it won't I've got it going slow
going<00:07:50.290> slow<00:07:51.300> going<00:07:52.300> slow<00:07:52.690> and<00:07:53.070> in<00:07:54.480> place<00:07:55.480> and

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.170 
going slow going slow and in place and

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:02.600 
going slow going slow and in place and
that's<00:07:56.920> it<00:07:59.400> 24<00:08:00.400> hours

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:02.610 
that's it 24 hours

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.600 
that's it 24 hours
