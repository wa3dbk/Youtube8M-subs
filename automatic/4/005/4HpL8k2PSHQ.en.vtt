unfortunately each one of these tracks
individually<00:01:03.000> cost<00:01:03.239> 499<00:01:03.840> which<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> bit

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
individually cost 499 which is a bit

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.530 
individually cost 499 which is a bit
ridiculous<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.880> me<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.150> they're<00:01:06.270> trying<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
ridiculous to me that they're trying to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.170 
ridiculous to me that they're trying to
charge<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:07.170> much<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:08.040> an<00:01:08.130> individual<00:01:08.820> track

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
charge this much for an individual track

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.960 
charge this much for an individual track
in<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.630> family<00:01:10.170> kart<00:01:10.470> racing<00:01:10.890> game<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.729> i<00:01:11.760> guess

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
in a family kart racing game but i guess

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.910 
in a family kart racing game but i guess
this<00:01:12.119> harkens<00:01:12.600> back<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> my<00:01:13.200> initial<00:01:13.680> judgment

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this harkens back to my initial judgment

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950 
this harkens back to my initial judgment
of<00:01:14.250> f1<00:01:14.549> race<00:01:14.760> stars<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
of f1 race stars and that was that the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.719 
of f1 race stars and that was that the
game<00:01:16.140> cost<00:01:16.470> way<00:01:16.710> too<00:01:16.740> much<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.520> pretty

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
game cost way too much it's a pretty

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.030 
game cost way too much it's a pretty
basic<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> somewhat<00:01:19.140> mildly<00:01:19.470> entertaining

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
basic and somewhat mildly entertaining

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.730 
basic and somewhat mildly entertaining
game<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.090> very<00:01:21.270> simplistic<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
game but it's very simplistic and the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
game but it's very simplistic and the
initial<00:01:22.920> cost<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> game<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:24.060> around

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
initial cost of the game was around

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
initial cost of the game was around
fifty<00:01:24.659> or<00:01:24.780> sixty<00:01:24.960> dollars<00:01:25.500> which<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.890> way<00:01:26.070> too

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
fifty or sixty dollars which was way too

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
fifty or sixty dollars which was way too
much<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.640> far<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.210> concerned<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
much as far as I was concerned and the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.780 
much as far as I was concerned and the
fact<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.590> they're<00:01:28.770> trying<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> charge<00:01:29.130> five

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

dollars<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:30.600> individual<00:01:31.170> track<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.740> think

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
dollars for an individual track I think

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.850 
dollars for an individual track I think
that's<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:33.240> bit<00:01:33.450> ridiculous<00:01:33.860> we

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
that's also a little bit ridiculous we

actually never ended up doing a video on
war<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> roses<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> did<00:01:48.360> enjoy<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
war of the roses but I did enjoy the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.260 
war of the roses but I did enjoy the
game<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.560> much<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.130> enjoyed<00:01:50.520> chivalry

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

the<00:01:51.479> comparable<00:01:52.079> medieval<00:01:52.530> combat<00:01:52.829> game<00:01:53.340> but

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the comparable medieval combat game but

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
the comparable medieval combat game but
I<00:01:53.970> still<00:01:54.210> think<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> bad<00:01:55.079> title<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
I still think it's not a bad title and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.840 
I still think it's not a bad title and
I'm<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:56.009> happy<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.610> they're

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
I'm really happy to see that they're

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.179 
I'm really happy to see that they're
continuing<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.390> support<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.079> game<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.619> think

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
continuing to support this game I think

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.590 
continuing to support this game I think
with<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.579> few<00:01:59.729> weeks<00:01:59.909> ago<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.360> came<00:02:00.540> out

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
with just a few weeks ago they came out

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.870 
with just a few weeks ago they came out
with<00:02:00.719> some<00:02:00.869> winter<00:02:01.320> DLC<00:02:01.829> adding<00:02:02.189> new<00:02:02.340> maps<00:02:02.579> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
with some winter DLC adding new maps and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.310 
with some winter DLC adding new maps and
now<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> they're<00:02:03.210> adding<00:02:03.450> new<00:02:03.540> armor<00:02:03.899> sets<00:02:04.140> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
now that they're adding new armor sets I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.050 
now that they're adding new armor sets I
mean<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.950> good<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.430> support<00:02:05.909> from

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
mean it's good to see that support from

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.670 
mean it's good to see that support from
developers<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.930> if<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.140> play<00:02:07.320> war<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
developers so if you play war of the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.410 
developers so if you play war of the
roses<00:02:07.799> definitely<00:02:08.399> give<00:02:08.489> those<00:02:08.610> armor<00:02:08.970> sets<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
a first 40 video covering this game I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.120 
a first 40 video covering this game I
couldn't<00:02:21.960> make<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.140> all<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.380> way<00:02:22.530> through<00:02:22.890> I

couldn't make it all the way through I
just<00:02:23.520> thought<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:23.820> absolutely<00:02:24.000> terrible

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660

the biggest problem that I had with this

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.000 
the biggest problem that I had with this
game<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.570> combat<00:02:28.020> was<00:02:28.050> super

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
game is that the combat was super

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460 
game is that the combat was super
repetitive<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.730> very<00:02:30.120> very<00:02:30.420> boring<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.290> not

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
repetitive and very very boring just not

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.190

the end of the world but boring
repetitive<00:02:35.940> combat<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:37.410> was<00:02:37.500> pretty<00:02:37.710> much

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
force feed that will be picking back up
