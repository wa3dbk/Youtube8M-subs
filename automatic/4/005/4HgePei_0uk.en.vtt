00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.300
 thank you that's kind indeed a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.150
 little a little guy who was coming to 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.170
 early break and then then why 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.369
 I have an extraordinary woman who 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 lets sleep at night so I arrive 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.539
 finally rest we did not take any 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.949
 holidays but we are still when 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.210
 same fresh and ready for the second 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.140
 part of the season but what's his name 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.369
 this little wonder 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.390
 sacha sacha grosjean this is exactly 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.949
 world champion what he wants there 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 it's because it's actually a joke 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.870
 from a friend who told me is fine he is 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.820
 born the same day as fernando alonso 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.170
 finally so he will be champion of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.480
 world of what he wants and I found 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.770
 that pretty pretty nice me an atmosphere 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.600
 very special so we will see a lot 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.390
 of red in the stands with the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 tifosi ferrari supporters 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.550
 for sure we are in check here we are 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.809
 on their aunt may but after that's true 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.489
 it's always a nice moment 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.880
 circuit is set in the middle of a park 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.920
 natural is beautiful 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.690
 we still have the old one at our speed 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.040
 middle of the circuit which is pretty 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.720
 monstrous and above all we have this 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.610
 famous monza and its outlines 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.140
 straight from the baffles and the parabolic 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.130
 the hotels if in general we are in the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.310
 same but after it's true it's a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.720
 sport in celebration where we are we are traveling 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.510
 often very low, that is to say we have 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.610
 his physio and a trip with my 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.590
 physio most of the time and and that 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.410
 stop there is not really any wit 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.420
 equipped or working groups 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.620
 who travel or work together in 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.810
 out of when we're on the paddocks 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.160
 and after that we really find ourselves in the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 paddock but still there we have schedules 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
 all very different so it's true that 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.840
 it's a pretty individualistic sport 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.560
 that is to say that on a weekend of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.390
 great price 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.770
 you did not especially more 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.790
 changes with kimi than with another 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.100
 pilot of another stable 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.350
 not especially more after we will 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.690
 see especially the briefings here but 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.090
 there will not necessarily be any exchange 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.650
 vocal more than with another yeah that's 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.600
 actually in any case the trip the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.670
 more painful of the season since we have 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.990
 Once in Seoul, we still have 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.820
 four hours by car if everything is 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.420
 well no, it's true it's far 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.220
 now 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.260
 good it's a circuit that is rather 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.430
 nice with a race where you there it is 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.020
 beautiful so it's ok but it's true 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.850
 does not necessarily have the most 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.840
 animations on this great price we have 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.970
 the opportunity to spend a little more 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.550
 time with friends it's crazy 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.130
 but in the good sense of the word it's up to 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.050
 to say that we are already on Thursday on the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.380
 track complained there is the world of 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.910
 everywhere they have they all 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.990
 trinkets possible and imaginable we 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.630
 to sign things that we 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.220
 did not even know and then they are there 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.180
 they are there from morning to evening once 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.600
 the grand prize is over there 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.460
 watch the replays during 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.900
 three hours and come back on Monday for 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.790
 to celebrate is really a 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.760
 something quite special this 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.650
 great price but the fans are everywhere and 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.780
 really it's a very atmospheric 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.650
 final electrical nothing changed game 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.240
 we continue on the relationship we have 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.400
 with is neither good nor bad she is 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.890
 rather it is rather neutral so 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.780
 it's going well I'm still watching 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.090
 a little bit what does it because it's 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.090
 always interesting to learn a 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.530
 world champion there are a lot of he has 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.640
 a lot of experience so all that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.380
 is all that is taken is no longer to 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.310
 take and then I try to prepare myself 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.320
 for the future 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.770
 his weak points the French not 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.910
 terrible to our choices that it's a very 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.350
 very beautiful world champion it's a 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.670
 young man who is gestures 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.370
 russian a step who like formula 1 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.040
 who does a very good job with his 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.780
 team now we have all we have 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.450
 all at times little ones 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.970
 weak points and we will do everything to 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.840
 if he shows this exploit 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.670
 small opportunities 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.870
 for sure there is a big 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.070
 change for the team now on 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.990
 Finnish changea for a Finnish 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.100
 so 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.390
 here we stay we feel the same 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.620
 nationality to a little surprised but good I 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.930
 think the countries who was the best 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.610
 the best choice for the team for 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.320
 we try to score the points I 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.510
 will do everything to help him and they 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.680
 feel comfortable it's not easy 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.720
 to arrive like this at the end of the year in 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.000
 a team but we do not want to leave 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.050
 ferrari get off so well we'll 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.540
 try to steal their third 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.610
 place in the constructors' championship and 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.760
 radio is making these beautiful 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.900
 historic 13 old-fashioned on TV on 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.020
 looks like it does not stop me from being a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.940
 little bit in bresse is really at a 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.130
 Russian mountain there is really big 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.400
 elevations have made that weather that can 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.140
 always be a little bit olé olé but 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.090
 in a general way that I like 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.260
 a lot with with a first goal in lna 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.450
 strong descent and then the league 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.450
 rock going back up it's really a wall
