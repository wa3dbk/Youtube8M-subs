very amusing stuff and I've only got a
little<00:00:50.730> bit<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.059> stuff<00:00:51.180> left<00:00:51.480> because

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's the very last day and and I've been

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
it's the very last day and and I've been
really<00:00:55.559> trying<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.100> make<00:00:56.250> sure<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.059> have

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
really trying to make sure that I have

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.049 
really trying to make sure that I have
enough<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.230> every<00:00:58.440> single<00:00:58.770> day<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.820> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
enough for every single day so this is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.760 
enough for every single day so this is
something<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.870> brought<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.260> me<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> that's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
something I brought with me and that's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.429 
something I brought with me and that's
almond<00:01:02.460> butter<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:03.239> Slovakia<00:01:03.960> there's<00:01:04.229> no

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
almond butter when Slovakia there's no

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.200 
almond butter when Slovakia there's no
way<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.129> knew<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.549> won't<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.820> any<00:01:05.970> way<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
way and I knew there won't be any way to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.690 
way and I knew there won't be any way to
find<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.869> around<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
find it around here so you do have to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000 
find it around here so you do have to
come<00:01:08.909> prepared<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.450> well<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.930> when<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> are

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
come prepared as well and when you are

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.920 
come prepared as well and when you are
prepared<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.580> know<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.450> makes<00:01:12.689> your

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
prepared you know it's just makes your

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
prepared you know it's just makes your

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
whole desk so much better there's only a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.609 
whole desk so much better there's only a
few<00:01:14.880> things<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.479> need<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> bring<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
few things that you need to bring and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.070 
few things that you need to bring and
the<00:01:17.189> protein<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.090> something<00:01:18.780> that's

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the protein and something that's

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.850 
the protein and something that's
literally<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.220> most<00:01:20.369> amazing<00:01:21.360> thing

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
literally the most amazing thing

literally the most amazing thing
once<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.009> discover<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.790> won't<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.150> able

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
once you discover it you won't be able

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690 
once you discover it you won't be able
it<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.770> way<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.009> makes<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.400> feel<00:01:26.549> is

it just the way it makes you feel is
unbelievable<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.960> e<00:01:28.439> Pollan

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
unbelievable so this is e Pollan

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.399 
unbelievable so this is e Pollan
something<00:01:30.030> very<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.420> interesting<00:01:30.900> about<00:01:31.110> be

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
something very very interesting about be

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.090 
something very very interesting about be
Pollan<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.400> actually<00:01:32.610> 40%<00:01:33.600> protein

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
Pollan is it's actually 40% protein

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.039 
Pollan is it's actually 40% protein
there<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.280> absolutely<00:01:36.030> nothing<00:01:36.360> higher<00:01:36.780> not

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
there is absolutely nothing higher not

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.350 
there is absolutely nothing higher not
even<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> animal<00:01:37.920> world

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
even in the animal world

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.450 
even in the animal world
that's<00:01:39.360> aspect<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.380> protein<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.920> bee<00:01:41.070> pollen

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that's aspect and protein as bee pollen

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
that's aspect and protein as bee pollen
you're<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.909> even<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.479> any<00:01:42.720> beef

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you're not even going to get any beef

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.639 
you're not even going to get any beef
any<00:01:43.470> eggs<00:01:43.829> or<00:01:44.159> cheese<00:01:44.490> higher<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.930> protein

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
any eggs or cheese higher in protein

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.940 
any eggs or cheese higher in protein
than<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.130> stuff<00:01:47.430> by<00:01:48.299> weight<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.619> contains

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950

all honey it contains hydrogen peroxide
and<00:03:18.260> hydrogen<00:03:19.190> peroxide<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.850> what<00:03:20.060> gives<00:03:20.360> her

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
and hydrogen peroxide is what gives her

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.120 
and hydrogen peroxide is what gives her
these<00:03:21.460> antibiotic<00:03:22.460> properties<00:03:23.380> but<00:03:24.380> if<00:03:24.590> you
