and<00:01:10.380> pretty<00:01:11.280> much<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.700> leagues<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.090> my

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and pretty much all leagues in my

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940 
and pretty much all leagues in my
opinion<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.869> until<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.770> one

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
opinion just until we see how this one

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
opinion just until we see how this one
shakes<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> ball<00:01:14.909> wasn't<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.540> great

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
shakes out and ball wasn't that great

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330 
shakes out and ball wasn't that great
when<00:01:16.049> he<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.350> starting<00:01:16.799> early<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> year

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
when he was starting early in the year

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
when he was starting early in the year
but<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> could<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.299> great<00:01:18.720> opportunity

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
but this could be a great opportunity

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.219 
but this could be a great opportunity
for<00:01:19.470> ball<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:21.030> take<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.450> starting<00:01:21.810> job<00:01:21.990> back

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
for ball to take that starting job back

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.999 
for ball to take that starting job back

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.180
