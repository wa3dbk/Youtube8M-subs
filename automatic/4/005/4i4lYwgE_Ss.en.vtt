 it is very simple once the gta is installed 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.510
 5 we are going to go to the folder of 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.850
 documents and here we are going to look for the 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.949
 rockstar games folder here inside 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.240

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.240
 to any section where we 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.920
 we have any song wins 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.870

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.580

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.230
 let's put here inside this 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.970

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.710

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.510

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.760
 songs and now in the game we have 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.310
 to do a very simple thing we 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.410
 let's go to the skateboard or water list menu 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.640
 and we are when counting we are not going to 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.130
 go to settings section 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.350
 we 're going to go to the sound section and 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.510
 right now I have the volume of the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.010
 music completely lowered so that I do not 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.780
 jump without any song on the radio 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 etcetera but I can upload it and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 simply in this option that puts 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.940
 time and the option below also for that

 Put everything in white and everything will be ok and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.690
 as you see now, just when I get on 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.310

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.410
