00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:10.170
 [music] 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello dear viewers come 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.630
 November 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.849
 which means that everything in the garden already 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.550
 completed many believe that in this 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.010
 time to do nothing here but it's not 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.039
 November is the most suitable month for 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.380
 underground sowing of various cultures 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.070
 beet spinach carrots and onions and garlic 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.140
 and under the winter sowing carrots set 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.780
 benefits first can get 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.300
 fresh good harvest for 2-3 weeks 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.790
 earlier usually that is already in early summer 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 secondly the seeds are sown before winter 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.520
 undergoes excellent hardening which means 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 root crops turn out sweeter and 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.980
 large 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.309
 they are not afraid of disease or pest 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.489
 and thirdly released at the beginning in 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.340
 summer garden bed can be reused 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.770
 sow there seeds of radish parsley 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.609
 lettuce peas and either green beans 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.129
 but there are downsides 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.480
 carrots sown before winter do not fit 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.049
 for long term storage 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.760
 so you should not sow it all over the bed 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.159
 usually when under the winter pool is good 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.780
 yield is ripe mid-season 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.330
 cold-resistant carrot varieties 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.060
 When buying carrot seeds, choose 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.350
 only approved manufacturer 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.830
 bag of seeds and should not be 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.150
 damaged or weedy good 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 seeds with a long shelf life remember 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.579
 that in the fall the seeds need to be sown on 20-25 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.610
 percent more than spring is about 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.350
 1 gram per square meter 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.170
 no seed needed before sowing 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.140
 specially treated when sowing 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.850
 carrots for the winter is very important to choose 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.100
 right time after all if sow 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.950
 too early too warm the soil by 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.140
 carrots will go down and frost will damage the whole 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.149
 future harvest 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.299
 if you sow carrots frozen soil 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.469
 until the seeds freeze and do not sprout 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.740
 optimum temperature for landing 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.710
 about 24 degrees of heat before sowing 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.630
 the bed needs to be dug up to clear from all 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.660
 vegetable 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.950
 residues and make the necessary fertilizer 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.890
 The site on which this year made 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.390
 dung for planting carrots is not his 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.510
 can only be used on 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.360
 second or third year I already have grades 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.830
 dug over i cleaned it off her all 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.959
 weeds and now I will contribute 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.209
 mineral fertilizers for that to me 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.230
 20 25 grams of superphosphate and 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.230
 10-15 grams of potassium chloride 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.870
 [music] 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.940
 however and on my site sour therefore 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.040
 I have already made dolomite flour in it 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.150
 [music] 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:55.520
 now i'm making super superphosphate 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.520
 [music] 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.010
 after that harris picatel 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.300
 [music] 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.590
 Now you only need to dig bed 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.590
 [music] 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.089
 [music] 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.880
 now i'm flattening the surface of the garden 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.880
 [music] 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.810
 if you come across syrnichki it is better than them 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.810
 get out 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.760
 now when the bed is lit dug over and 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.989
 All necessary fertilizers can be applied. 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.209
 cut grooves 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.540
 they must be deeper than those that you 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.330
 make spring grooves in the spring 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.709
 about 45 centimeters 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.709
 [music] 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.170
 the distance between the grooves 20 25 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:29.529
 centimeters 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:29.529
 [music] 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.889
 try to sow seeds as much as possible 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.270
 less so that it does not have to be thinned out later 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.620
 the outcomes now I will show you how it is 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.250
 to make 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:51.250
 [music] 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:06.490
 pour out a small amount of seeds and 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:29.430
 try to sow them as little as possible 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:31.440
 [music] 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.600
 sow carrots in the grooves can be immediately 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.210
 you can wait for the first small 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.650
 frost in the second case is land 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.890
 which you will fill the grooves 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.890
 need to keep warm so the seeds from me 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.110
 sown and so they do not freeze out in winter 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.000
 You can grind a bed of spruce 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.990
 spruce or sawdust but before I 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.990
 I will fill the grooves 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:13.950
 [music] 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.010
 and now i'm starting to fall asleep grooves 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:26.790
 sawdust 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:26.790
 [music] 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:47.379
 [music] 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.869
 [music] 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.130
 spring will also need to take care of 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.140
 sown under the winter carrots when it comes down 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.660
 snow substitute above the bed of the arc and 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.350
 cover the crop regularly 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.990
 water 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.120
 when will the first shoots of carrots 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.960
 need to feed here 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.300
 that's all 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.300
 I wish you a good harvest!
