00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
based on assessing okay so now the first

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.630 
based on assessing okay so now the first
thing<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.710> summarize<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> sentence<00:01:08.430> what

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
thing is to summarize in a sentence what

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.219 
thing is to summarize in a sentence what
we<00:01:08.729> talked<00:01:08.970> about<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.240> paragraph<00:01:09.630> 1<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> what

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
we talked about in paragraph 2 so we

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.520 
we talked about in paragraph 2 so we
probably<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> say<00:01:12.840> something<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
sentence is a restatement of our thesis

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.569 
sentence is a restatement of our thesis
so<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.509> come<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.780> back<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.200> our

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
so if we come up back to our

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
so if we come up back to our
introduction<00:01:41.579> paragraph<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> look

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
introduction paragraph and take a look

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.160 
introduction paragraph and take a look
at<00:01:43.200> our<00:01:43.350> thesis<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.479> prefer<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> food

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
at our thesis I prefer to go to food

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.569 
at our thesis I prefer to go to food
stands<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.710> restaurants<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.189> opposed<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
stands or restaurants as opposed to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.670 
stands or restaurants as opposed to
preparing<00:01:47.970> food<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.270> home<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.500> want

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
preparing food at home now we just want

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.149 
preparing food at home now we just want
to<00:01:49.799> state<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.520> again<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.350> different<00:01:52.350> words

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
to state this again in different words

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.039 
to state this again in different words
so<00:01:54.590> perhaps<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.979> could<00:01:56.130> say<00:01:56.369> something<00:01:56.399> like

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
so perhaps we could say something like

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:05.209 
so perhaps we could say something like
thus<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:59.270> choose<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:01.049> eat<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:02.310> majority<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:04.219> my

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
thus I choose to eat the majority of my

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:13.460 
thus I choose to eat the majority of my
meals<00:02:06.530> outside<00:02:07.640> my<00:02:08.640> home<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:11.450> strongly

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
meals outside my home and strongly

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.200 
meals outside my home and strongly
refer<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.610> cooking<00:02:15.210> for<00:02:16.080> myself<00:02:20.210> so

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
refer this to cooking for myself so

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.680 
refer this to cooking for myself so
that's<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.600> Restatement<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.230> thesis<00:02:23.510> we<00:02:24.510> can

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
that's the Restatement of thesis we can

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.180 
that's the Restatement of thesis we can
choose<00:02:24.930> between<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:25.320> prediction<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.100> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
choose between a prediction and a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.060 
choose between a prediction and a
recommendation<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.960> think<00:02:28.200> based<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.950> this

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
recommendation and I think based on this

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.460 
recommendation and I think based on this
essay<00:02:29.430> we'd<00:02:29.580> probably<00:02:29.790> choose<00:02:30.470> prediction

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
essay we'd probably choose prediction

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.680 
essay we'd probably choose prediction
and<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.920> prediction<00:02:32.190> would<00:02:32.460> be<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.690> our

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and that prediction would be that our

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.650 
and that prediction would be that our
this<00:02:34.260> choice<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.160> lifestyle<00:02:35.610> or<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.000> choice

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
this choice of lifestyle or this choice

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.400 
this choice of lifestyle or this choice
to<00:02:36.840> eat<00:02:36.960> outside

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
to eat outside

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.600 
to eat outside
is<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:38.130> going<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.460> change<00:02:38.490> anytime<00:02:39.000> soon<00:02:39.440> so

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:53.480 

so<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.640> believe<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:46.310> will<00:02:47.310> continue<00:02:52.490> this

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
so I believe I will continue this

we were at at all times so let's take

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:49.860 
we were at at all times so let's take
out<00:03:38.489> these

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.020 

okay<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.110> if<00:03:51.230> we<00:03:51.379> read<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.860> entire<00:03:52.670> essay

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
from start to finish together we can see

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.960 
from start to finish together we can see
how<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.689> all<00:03:56.780> connects<00:03:57.489> opinions<00:03:58.489> on<00:03:58.670> food

tastier option and is therefore another

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
preparing them at home in conclusion

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.950
