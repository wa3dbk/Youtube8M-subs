when the tape comes off it'll be perfect
lines<00:04:45.590> so<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.340> recommend<00:04:46.760> taking<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.540> tape<00:04:47.690> off

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
lines so I recommend taking the tape off

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.050 
lines so I recommend taking the tape off
one<00:04:48.110> nail<00:04:48.650> polish<00:04:48.920> is<00:04:49.040> still<00:04:49.280> wet<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.730> as<00:04:49.940> you

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
can just clean up on the edge if it gets

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.840 
can just clean up on the edge if it gets
like<00:04:54.290> that<00:04:54.440> like<00:04:54.680> mine<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.370> if<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.580> don't<00:04:55.700> have

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850
