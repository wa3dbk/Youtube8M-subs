the<00:00:00.329> moon<00:00:00.510> hoax<00:00:00.780> we<00:00:01.290> have<00:00:01.469> people<00:00:01.770> out<00:00:01.860> there

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
the moon hoax we have people out there

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.210 
the moon hoax we have people out there
who<00:00:02.429> say<00:00:02.939> we<00:00:03.149> never<00:00:03.360> went<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.319> moon<00:00:04.589> first

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
who say we never went to the moon first

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.390 
who say we never went to the moon first
of<00:00:05.460> all<00:00:05.580> first<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.750> all<00:00:06.899> we<00:00:07.799> should<00:00:07.859> be<00:00:08.840> proud

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
of all first of all we should be proud

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.430 
of all first of all we should be proud
that<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.580> live<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:12.000> culture<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.660> has

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
that we live in a culture that has

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.099 
that we live in a culture that has
technology's<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.580> advanced<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.719> some

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
technology's so advanced that some

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.099 
technology's so advanced that some
members<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.340> same<00:00:17.640> culture<00:00:18.060> are<00:00:18.240> in

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
members of that same culture are in

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.320 
members of that same culture are in
denial<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.800> that's<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.670> statement<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.210> how

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
denial of it that's a statement of how

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.439 
denial of it that's a statement of how
advanced<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.640> should<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> little

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
advanced we are so we should be a little

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.670 
advanced we are so we should be a little
more<00:00:24.600> sensitive<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:26.640> their<00:00:26.789> disbelief

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
more sensitive to their disbelief

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.169 
more sensitive to their disbelief
because<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.890> astonished<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.970> do

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
because it's astonished it's just we do

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600 
because it's astonished it's just we do
astonishing<00:00:30.750> things<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.380> some<00:00:32.279> people<00:00:32.309> are

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
astonishing things and some people are

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.010 
astonishing things and some people are
so<00:00:32.730> astonishing<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.630> can't<00:00:33.870> believe

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
so astonishing they just can't believe

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.459 
so astonishing they just can't believe
it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.750 
it
so<00:00:35.130> here's<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:36.800> this<00:00:37.800> ladies<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
so here's what you do this ladies and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.869 
so here's what you do this ladies and
gentlemen<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.570> Saturn<00:00:39.899> five<00:00:40.200> rocket

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
gentlemen is the Saturn five rocket

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.790 
gentlemen is the Saturn five rocket
launching<00:00:41.879> once<00:00:42.030> again<00:00:42.300> sending<00:00:42.899> gas<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.590> one

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
launching once again sending gas out one

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.940 
launching once again sending gas out one
side<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.760> recoil<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.660> other<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
side and the recoil up the other just to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.569 
side and the recoil up the other just to
remind<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.989> how<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.200> works<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:50.100> sorry<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
remind you how this works I'm sorry I

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.310 
remind you how this works I'm sorry I
can't<00:00:50.760> point<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.660> moment<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
can't point to two at one moment at the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.060 
can't point to two at one moment at the
same<00:00:52.500> time<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:52.910> all<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:55.699> is<00:00:56.699> fuel<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
same time but all of this is fuel and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.880 
same time but all of this is fuel and
the<00:00:59.070> astronauts<00:00:59.699> are<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.719> okay<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the astronauts are right there okay and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
the astronauts are right there okay and
that<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.879> bitty<00:01:03.059> capsule<00:01:03.539> right<00:01:03.570> there

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
that little bitty capsule right there

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.440 
that little bitty capsule right there
that's<00:01:04.739> where<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> astronauts<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.820> they're

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that's where the astronauts are they're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.950 
that's where the astronauts are they're
sitting<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.340> controlled<00:01:08.340> bomb<00:01:08.780> all<00:01:09.780> right

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
sitting on a controlled bomb all right

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.649 
sitting on a controlled bomb all right
so<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.549> calculate<00:01:11.820> how

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so all you have to do is calculate how

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.289 
so all you have to do is calculate how
much<00:01:12.840> fuel<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.650> invoking<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.880> rocket

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
much fuel is there invoking the rocket

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
much fuel is there invoking the rocket
equation<00:01:15.500> because<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.860> invoke<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
equation because when you invoke the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.670 
equation because when you invoke the
rocket<00:01:17.549> equation<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.180> learn<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:19.080> most<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
rocket equation you learn that most of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.190 
rocket equation you learn that most of
the<00:01:19.740> fuel<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.189> burning<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the fuel you're burning now is just to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.039 
the fuel you're burning now is just to
launch<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> higher<00:01:23.580> point<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.509> feel<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
launch to a higher point to feel you you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.010 
launch to a higher point to feel you you
have<00:01:25.229> yet<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.500> burn<00:01:26.299> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.479> how<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.659> works

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
have yet to burn this is how that works

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.859 
have yet to burn this is how that works
so<00:01:28.430> for<00:01:29.430> every<00:01:29.670> increment<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.329> distance<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so for every increment of distance you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.469 
so for every increment of distance you
have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.380> you've<00:01:32.369> got<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.850> much

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
have to go you've got to have that much

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.969 
have to go you've got to have that much
bigger<00:01:33.900> spaceship<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:36.119> enable<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.710> carry

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
bigger spaceship to enable it to carry

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.210 
bigger spaceship to enable it to carry
the<00:01:38.250> fuel<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:38.909> yet<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.329> burn<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the fuel you have yet to burn and so you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.550 
the fuel you have yet to burn and so you
do<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.670> calculation<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> show<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
do this calculation and you show that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.310 
do this calculation and you show that
this<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.070> enough<00:01:44.430> fuel<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.060> carry<00:01:45.600> these<00:01:46.020> three

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
this is enough fuel to carry these three

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.980 
this is enough fuel to carry these three
astronauts<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.009> their<00:01:47.250> Rover<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.810> low

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
astronauts and their Rover out of low

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.330 
astronauts and their Rover out of low
Earth<00:01:49.020> orbit<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.130> moon<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.909> back<00:01:52.100> all<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
Earth orbit to the moon and back all the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.870 
Earth orbit to the moon and back all the
fuel<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:55.040> where<00:01:56.040> else<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> think

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
fuel is there where else do you think

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.870 
fuel is there where else do you think
this<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.840> okay<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.399> A&amp;P

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this was going okay to like the A&amp;P

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
this was going okay to like the A&amp;P
grocery<00:02:00.570> store<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.229> where<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.740> this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
grocery store but where is this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.800 
grocery store but where is this
but<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> think<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.390> thing<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
but what do you think this thing is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.340 
but what do you think this thing is
doing<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.400> moon<00:02:05.610> hoaxers<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.630> challenge

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
doing so the moon hoaxers just challenge

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740 
doing so the moon hoaxers just challenge
them<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.830> learn<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.700> rocket<00:02:09.090> equation<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
them to learn the rocket equation and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.380 
them to learn the rocket equation and
apply<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.319> math<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.520> do<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.880> math<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.300> then

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
apply the math to do the math and then

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.660 
apply the math to do the math and then
they<00:02:12.569> go<00:02:12.750> away<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.200> they<00:02:13.530> never<00:02:13.709> come<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.040> by

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
they go away and they never come back by

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.070 
they go away and they never come back by
the<00:02:14.730> way<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.209> show<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.480> how<00:02:15.540> big<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.020> is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the way to show you how big this is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.620 
the way to show you how big this is
that's<00:02:16.920> huge

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
that's huge

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.300 
that's huge
okay<00:02:18.630> these<00:02:18.959> are<00:02:19.170> people<00:02:19.530> right<00:02:20.069> here

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
okay these are people right here

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.809 
okay these are people right here
standing<00:02:21.020> approaching<00:02:22.020> one<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.459> rocket

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
standing approaching one of the rocket

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.059 
standing approaching one of the rocket
nozzles<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.630> five<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.410> base<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
nozzles of the five at the base of the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.699 
nozzles of the five at the base of the
Saturn<00:02:26.400> five<00:02:26.580> rocket<00:02:26.810> okay<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.200> thing<00:02:28.470> is

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
Saturn five rocket okay this thing is

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.220 
Saturn five rocket okay this thing is
huge<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.600> fuel<00:02:30.830> all<00:02:31.830> fuel
