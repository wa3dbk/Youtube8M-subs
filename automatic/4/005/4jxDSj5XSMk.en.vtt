00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
eye concealer I've had this for a while

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830 
eye concealer I've had this for a while
and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.410> use<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.649> quite<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.700> bit<00:00:38.820> that's<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and I use it quite a bit that's what it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
and I use it quite a bit that's what it
looks<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.200> that's<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.590> medium<00:00:41.040> shade<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.430> as

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
looks like that's the medium shade so as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790 
looks like that's the medium shade so as
you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.390> light<00:00:43.110> medium

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you can see it's a really light medium

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.150 
you can see it's a really light medium
as<00:00:44.129> far<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.489> mediums<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.649> but<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> concealer

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
as far as mediums go but the concealer

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
as far as mediums go but the concealer
that<00:00:47.190> comes<00:00:47.460> with<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.969> almost<00:00:48.270> four<00:00:48.719> times

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that comes with it is almost four times

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.740 
that comes with it is almost four times
the<00:00:49.289> size<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.489> normal<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the size as the normal one so if you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.810 
the size as the normal one so if you
were<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> buy<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.289> anyway<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
were going to buy this anyway then you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
were going to buy this anyway then you
might<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.000> well<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.570> set<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.739> four

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
might as well get the set and get four

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.619 
might as well get the set and get four
times<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> amount<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.879> concealer<00:00:57.360> plus

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
times the amount of concealer plus

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
times the amount of concealer plus
everything<00:00:58.050> else<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.710> sense<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.399> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
everything else in that sense it is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.000 
everything else in that sense it is
probably<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> pretty<00:01:00.270> good<00:01:00.510> deal<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.770> you

didn't<00:04:31.540> blend<00:04:32.139> all<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.830> easily<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.400> when

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
didn't blend all that easily like when

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.850 
didn't blend all that easily like when
they<00:04:33.700> show<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.030> girls<00:04:34.150> on<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:35.440> demos

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
applying it and they use this brush and

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.770 
applying it and they use this brush and
they<00:04:39.130> put<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.460> on<00:04:39.550> see<00:04:40.120> it's<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.419> lighting

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
they put it on see it's the lighting

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.330 
they put it on see it's the lighting
because<00:04:41.050> on<00:04:41.440> TV<00:04:41.830> it<00:04:42.010> looks<00:04:42.040> really<00:04:42.490> smooth<00:04:42.940> and

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
because on TV it looks really smooth and

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.219 
because on TV it looks really smooth and
nice<00:04:45.340> like<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.000> just<00:04:46.180> blended<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.780> but<00:04:47.050> if<00:04:47.139> you

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.190 
grabbing I don't know it just doesn't go
on<00:04:53.560> as<00:04:53.950> smooth<00:04:54.340> as<00:04:54.729> I<00:04:55.270> would<00:04:55.450> like<00:04:55.630> it<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.080> I

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
on as smooth as I would like it and I

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.620 
on as smooth as I would like it and I
feel<00:04:56.889> like<00:04:56.919> it's<00:04:57.639> one<00:04:57.910> of<00:04:58.030> those<00:04:58.090> products

that would just get lost in my
collection<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.850> probably<00:05:01.470> wouldn't<00:05:02.470> reach

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
collection and I probably wouldn't reach

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.469 
collection and I probably wouldn't reach
for<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.580> whole<00:05:03.790> lot<00:05:04.350> yeah<00:05:05.350> see<00:05:05.650> in<00:05:06.060> my<00:05:07.060> screen

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
here on my iPad it looks decent it looks

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.090 
here on my iPad it looks decent it looks
like<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:09.970> worked<00:05:10.240> pretty<00:05:10.450> well<00:05:10.720> but<00:05:11.680> then<00:05:11.889> when

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
like it worked pretty well but then when

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.750 
like it worked pretty well but then when
I<00:05:12.130> look<00:05:12.400> here<00:05:12.880> like<00:05:13.210> there's<00:05:13.450> blotches<00:05:14.290> of<00:05:14.320> it

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
I look here like there's blotches of it

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.340 
I look here like there's blotches of it
right<00:05:15.760> here<00:05:15.790> that<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.330> can't<00:05:16.570> really<00:05:16.720> see<00:05:16.840> in

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
right here that you can't really see in

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.629 
right here that you can't really see in
this<00:05:19.800> camera<00:05:20.800> I<00:05:21.010> don't<00:05:21.490> know<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.820> think<00:05:22.510> this

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
this camera I don't know I think this

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.279 
this camera I don't know I think this
was<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.850> main<00:05:25.000> reason<00:05:25.060> i<00:05:25.600> ordered<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.110> kit

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
was the main reason i ordered the kit

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.290 
was the main reason i ordered the kit
and<00:05:26.530> probably<00:05:26.950> kind<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.639> a<00:05:27.729> disappointment

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
and probably kind of a disappointment

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.020 
and probably kind of a disappointment
it's<00:05:28.660> not<00:05:29.139> terrible<00:05:29.710> if<00:05:29.979> you<00:05:30.370> really<00:05:30.820> need<00:05:31.000> a

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
it's not terrible if you really need a

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.659 
it's not terrible if you really need a
cream<00:05:31.419> highlighter<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:32.320> think<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.370> can<00:05:33.520> make

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
cream highlighter I think you can make

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.430 
cream highlighter I think you can make
it<00:05:33.700> work<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.300> just<00:05:34.600> don't<00:05:34.810> really<00:05:34.930> want<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.289> have

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
it work I just don't really want to have

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.320 
it work I just don't really want to have
to<00:05:35.590> blend<00:05:35.800> it<00:05:36.010> quite<00:05:36.280> that<00:05:36.310> much<00:05:36.669> I<00:05:36.970> don't<00:05:37.240> know

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
to blend it quite that much I don't know

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.560 
to blend it quite that much I don't know
