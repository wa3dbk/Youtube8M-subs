the last rocket I experimented with in
2009<00:04:10.790> used<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.780> wind<00:04:12.020> up<00:04:12.170> timer<00:04:12.470> that

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
2009 used the wind up timer that

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.710 
2009 used the wind up timer that
released<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.430> spring<00:04:13.760> that<00:04:14.210> pushed<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.690> nose

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
released a spring that pushed the nose

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.040 
released a spring that pushed the nose
off<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.890> string<00:04:16.220> attached<00:04:16.730> to<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:16.970> pin<00:04:17.330> pulled

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
off the string attached to a pin pulled

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.020 
off the string attached to a pin pulled
the<00:04:18.170> pin<00:04:18.380> through<00:04:18.709> an<00:04:18.800> eyelet<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.760> loop

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
the pin through an eyelet and a loop

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.450 
the pin through an eyelet and a loop
attached<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.690> one<00:04:20.870> side<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.170> a<00:04:21.620> hinge<00:04:21.950> that

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
attached to one side of a hinge that

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.090 
attached to one side of a hinge that
held<00:04:22.730> down<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:22.970> spring<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:24.230> rod<00:04:24.500> is<00:04:24.740> also

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
held down a spring the rod is also

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100 
held down a spring the rod is also
attached<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.760> hinge<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.300> pushed<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
attached to the hinge and pushed the

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.590 
attached to the hinge and pushed the
nose<00:04:27.140> off<00:04:27.590> her<00:04:28.340> braided<00:04:28.640> wire<00:04:28.760> went<00:04:29.390> through<00:04:29.570> a

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
nose off her braided wire went through a

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.020 
nose off her braided wire went through a
hole<00:04:29.870> in<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.230> serval<00:04:30.650> arm<00:04:30.890> and<00:04:31.160> released<00:04:31.850> the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
hole in a serval arm and released the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.360 
hole in a serval arm and released the
timer<00:04:32.300> as<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.840> rocket<00:04:33.230> launched<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:34.160> worked

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
timer as the rocket launched it worked

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.370 
timer as the rocket launched it worked
perfect<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.120> first<00:04:35.150> launch<00:04:35.660> but<00:04:36.200> more

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
perfect the first launch but more

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.200 
perfect the first launch but more
launches<00:04:36.920> are<00:04:37.070> needed<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.580> prove<00:04:37.790> that<00:04:38.030> this

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
launches are needed to prove that this

launches are needed to prove that this
