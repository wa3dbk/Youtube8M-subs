here but I guess we just have to roll

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.850 
here but I guess we just have to roll
with<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.179> how<00:02:04.990> we<00:02:05.050> don't<00:02:05.350> have<00:02:05.440> much<00:02:05.649> of<00:02:05.679> a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
you have three fire modes you can track

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.640 
you have three fire modes you can track
targets<00:02:16.030> by<00:02:16.540> just<00:02:16.870> scoping<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.560> your

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.559 
targets by just scoping in on your
target<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.430> missile<00:02:18.760> will<00:02:18.940> hit<00:02:18.970> wherever

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
target and a missile will hit wherever

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.020 
target and a missile will hit wherever
you're<00:02:19.900> pointing<00:02:20.500> at<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.220> second<00:02:21.640> fire<00:02:21.790> mode

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
you're pointing at the second fire mode

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.699 
you're pointing at the second fire mode
is<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.390> course<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.690> dump<00:02:22.930> fire<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:23.560> you're

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
is of course a dump fire so if you're

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.680 
is of course a dump fire so if you're
firing<00:02:23.980> from<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.370> hip<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.940> missile<00:02:25.540> will

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
firing from the hip the missile will

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.540 
firing from the hip the missile will
just<00:02:25.990> travel<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.620> straight<00:02:26.680> line<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.490> I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
just travel in a straight line and I

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.880 
just travel in a straight line and I
have<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:28.090> say<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:29.350> one<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.740> most

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
have to say it is one of the most

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.820 
have to say it is one of the most
accurate<00:02:30.180> launchers<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.330> hip<00:02:31.480> fire<00:02:31.830> compared

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
accurate launchers to hip fire compared

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.230 
accurate launchers to hip fire compared
to<00:02:32.920> some<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.220> other<00:02:33.250> ones<00:02:33.610> even<00:02:33.910> if<00:02:34.090> you're

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
to some of the other ones even if you're

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.510 
to some of the other ones even if you're
you're<00:02:34.660> moving<00:02:35.080> while<00:02:35.319> firing<00:02:35.680> your<00:02:36.010> missile

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
you're moving while firing your missile

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.120 
you're moving while firing your missile
will<00:02:36.849> still<00:02:37.180> fly<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.900> straight<00:02:37.959> line<00:02:38.380> which

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
will still fly in a straight line which

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.440 
will still fly in a straight line which
is<00:02:39.310> not<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.640> case<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:40.030> some<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.330> other

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
is not the case of some of the other

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.660 
is not the case of some of the other
launchers<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.990> have<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.470> say<00:02:41.740> and<00:02:41.980> then<00:02:42.550> of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
launchers I have to say and then of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.790 
launchers I have to say and then of
course<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:43.090> third<00:02:43.360> mode<00:02:43.570> is<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> lock<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.470> fire

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
course the third mode is a lock on fire

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.070 
course the third mode is a lock on fire
so<00:02:45.190> whenever<00:02:45.790> someone<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.240> laser<00:02:46.510> designating

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
so whenever someone is laser designating

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.900 
so whenever someone is laser designating
a<00:02:47.140> target<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.620> can<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:47.950> lock<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.580> it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
a target you can just lock on to it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
a target you can just lock on to it
are<00:02:48.970> your<00:02:49.180> missile<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.780> will

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
are your missile and it will

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.220 
are your missile and it will
automatically<00:02:50.560> hit<00:02:51.300> wonderful<00:02:52.300> is<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.450> and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
automatically hit wonderful is that and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.780 
automatically hit wonderful is that and
it<00:02:53.350> would<00:02:53.440> also<00:02:53.560> deal<00:02:53.890> more<00:02:54.070> damage<00:02:54.130> when<00:02:54.700> you

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
it would also deal more damage when you

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.360 
it would also deal more damage when you
lock<00:02:55.000> on<00:02:55.240> that's<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.080> pretty<00:02:56.410> interesting<00:02:56.770> /

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
lock on that's a pretty interesting /

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.000 
lock on that's a pretty interesting /
helpful<00:02:57.850> thing<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.090> know<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:59.200> my<00:02:59.470> opinion<00:02:59.710> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
helpful thing to know in my opinion the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.370 
helpful thing to know in my opinion the
S<00:03:00.190> raw<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.000> absolute<00:03:01.540> best<00:03:01.810> launcher<00:03:02.230> to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
S raw is the absolute best launcher to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.650 
S raw is the absolute best launcher to
have<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.950> battlefield<00:03:03.430> 4<00:03:03.510> especially<00:03:04.510> for

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
have in battlefield 4 especially for

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.600 
have in battlefield 4 especially for
ground<00:03:04.960> targets<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.740> of<00:03:05.830> course<00:03:06.040> for<00:03:06.190> taking

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
ground targets and of course for taking

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.190 
ground targets and of course for taking
down<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:07.000> occasional<00:03:07.450> chopper<00:03:07.840> as<00:03:07.930> well

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
down the occasional chopper as well

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.490 
down the occasional chopper as well
which<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.410> surprisingly<00:03:09.040> easy<00:03:09.180> actually<00:03:10.500> but

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
which is surprisingly easy actually but

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.110 
which is surprisingly easy actually but
why<00:03:11.620> do<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.890> actually<00:03:12.070> think<00:03:12.490> this<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.850> a<00:03:12.880> best

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
why do I actually think this is a best

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.600 
why do I actually think this is a best
launcher<00:03:13.680> because<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.950> know<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.130> can<00:03:15.400> you

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
launcher because you know you can you

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.760 
launcher because you know you can you
can<00:03:15.760> engage<00:03:16.300> any<00:03:16.570> armor<00:03:17.020> from<00:03:17.200> any<00:03:17.500> distance

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
can engage any armor from any distance

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.070 
can engage any armor from any distance
you<00:03:18.130> want<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.700> your<00:03:18.820> missile<00:03:19.300> will<00:03:19.630> hit<00:03:19.660> your

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
you want and your missile will hit your

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.380 
you want and your missile will hit your
target<00:03:20.560> as<00:03:20.680> long<00:03:20.890> as<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.160> just<00:03:21.460> keep<00:03:22.030> scoping

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
target as long as you just keep scoping

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.540 
target as long as you just keep scoping
in<00:03:22.660> on<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.990> which<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> lot<00:03:23.800> harder<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.340> do

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
in on it which is a lot harder to do

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.790 
in on it which is a lot harder to do
with<00:03:24.970> something<00:03:25.360> like<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.660> RPG<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.350> example

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
with something like the RPG for example

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.010 
with something like the RPG for example
because<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.310> massive<00:03:27.550> drop<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.330> has<00:03:28.510> once

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
because of that massive drop it has once

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.740 
because of that massive drop it has once
you<00:03:29.230> fire<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.430> second<00:03:30.790> reason<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.240> reload

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
you fire it the second reason is reload

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.200 
you fire it the second reason is reload
time<00:03:32.050> other<00:03:32.680> launchers<00:03:33.040> with<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.730> exception

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
time other launchers with the exception

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.690 
time other launchers with the exception
of<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.660> very<00:03:34.840> first<00:03:35.110> one<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:36.010> unlock<00:03:36.430> which

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
of the very first one you unlock which

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.880 
of the very first one you unlock which
is<00:03:36.880> just<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.480> shitty<00:03:37.960> by<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.320> way<00:03:38.530> it's<00:03:38.830> just

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
is just so shitty by the way it's just

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.130 
is just so shitty by the way it's just
so<00:03:39.190> shitty<00:03:39.490> they<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.330> have<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.540> very<00:03:40.780> long

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
so shitty they all have a very long

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.140 
so shitty they all have a very long
reload<00:03:41.590> time<00:03:41.860> which<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.160> not<00:03:42.310> something<00:03:42.820> you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
reload time which is not something you

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.850 
reload time which is not something you
want<00:03:43.450> after<00:03:44.020> you've<00:03:44.170> just<00:03:44.470> given<00:03:44.620> your

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
want after you've just given your

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.040 
want after you've just given your
position<00:03:45.070> away<00:03:45.580> when<00:03:46.270> you<00:03:46.360> fire<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:46.660> off<00:03:46.840> that

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
position away when you fire it off that

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.590 
position away when you fire it off that
first<00:03:47.290> missile<00:03:47.830> at<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.070> enemy<00:03:48.610> tank<00:03:48.910> or<00:03:49.150> lav

or whatever you're engaging you know you

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.490 
or whatever you're engaging you know you

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
want to be taking them out as fast as

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.520

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
second shot and that dear friends means

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.600 
second shot and that dear friends means
that<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.020> have<00:04:44.200> just<00:04:44.380> given<00:04:44.590> him<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:45.040> serious

that you have just given him a serious
case<00:04:45.880> of<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.570> battle<00:04:46.960> panics<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.650> an<00:04:48.490> even

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
case of the battle panics and an even

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.909 
case of the battle panics and an even
more<00:04:48.850> effective<00:04:49.120> technique<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:49.919> alternate

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
more effective technique is to alternate

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.100 
more effective technique is to alternate
positions<00:04:51.460> from<00:04:51.610> what<00:04:51.790> your<00:04:51.940> fire<00:04:52.180> for

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
positions from what your fire for

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.630 
positions from what your fire for
example<00:04:53.500> if<00:04:53.620> you're<00:04:53.770> behind<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:54.130> container<00:04:54.520> and

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640

example if you're behind a container and
you<00:04:54.850> shoot<00:04:55.060> your<00:04:55.150> first<00:04:55.450> rocket<00:04:55.840> from<00:04:56.020> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
you shoot your first rocket from the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.920 
you shoot your first rocket from the
right<00:04:56.410> side<00:04:56.740> just<00:04:57.400> get<00:04:57.550> back<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.760> cover<00:04:58.150> reload

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930

that<00:04:59.110> rocket<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.680> fire<00:04:59.919> your<00:04:59.950> second<00:05:00.520> rocket

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
that rocket and fire your second rocket

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.470 
that rocket and fire your second rocket
from<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.180> other<00:05:01.360> sites<00:05:01.780> from<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.140> left
