for every application file on the disk I
just<00:03:30.090> highly<00:03:30.510> recommend<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.200> because<00:03:31.230> you're

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
just highly recommend it because you're

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.640 
just highly recommend it because you're
never<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:33.000> never<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.390> hundred<00:03:33.720> percent<00:03:33.840> as

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
never it's never a hundred percent as

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:43.539 
never it's never a hundred percent as
far<00:03:34.890> as<00:03:35.040> what<00:03:36.350> what<00:03:37.350> programs<00:03:37.799> are<00:03:37.980> wire<00:03:38.280> it

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.280 

hopefully<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.730> isn't<00:03:44.940> too<00:03:45.090> complicated

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
hopefully this isn't too complicated

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.550 
hopefully this isn't too complicated
this<00:03:46.799> um<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.340> compatibility<00:03:48.090> mode<00:03:48.510> seems<00:03:49.260> to

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
this um this compatibility mode seems to

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.770 
this um this compatibility mode seems to
be<00:03:49.680> at<00:03:49.799> first<00:03:50.100> but<00:03:50.400> all<00:03:50.850> we're<00:03:51.150> doing<00:03:51.450> is

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
be at first but all we're doing is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.900 
be at first but all we're doing is
telling<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.320> run<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:53.130> an<00:03:53.280> earlier<00:03:53.640> version

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
telling it to run in an earlier version

of Windows nothing there and then under

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.289
