00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.619
 what would happen 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:19.839
 Mon 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.730
 in ours and Tuna a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.359
 speak openly about it 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.539
 and as they now do, for example, we have schools right now 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.920
 there is a life after death there is NATO tends to give us that 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.040
 already prove 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.620
 what if we could all talk about it honestly 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.870
 would take 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.550
 what he would change we would become responsible person 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.610
 perhaps 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 I think so 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.220
 is the person who takes these things seriously a greater responsibility 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.880
 willing to accept why 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.030
 Year to every birth affects quite simply if not expected that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.970
 One hundred or two hundred years 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.970
 to enter this heritage again 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.340
 for certain reasons 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.940
 As you can get used to the habits I would kind of like to step on the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.420
 you like to live 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.610
 and that, for example, has logical consequences for Coco today 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.050
 End of an era of the world according to the motto after me the deluge 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.220
 to be destroyed by us 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.210
 Andy is not nice 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.280
 and so desirable to re-enter 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.340
 like an era which then possibly under the thought 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.720
 the rebirth and the possible consequences blossomed is one perhaps 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.820
 went one step further 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.829
 to those responsible to others also he with regard to each other 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.790
 to take care of each other and to experience that for ladies in the nature 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.630
 is very important 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.890
 when you see the will to live 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.480
 and Daniel 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.800
 s he drives what you do everything 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.760
 at the right place 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.170
 not succeeded and then on the thought with 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.670
 bring in 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.369
 because it is always reported that were the result you other people 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.210
 has made 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.600
 he experiences and also the misfortune that one made the way of oneself 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.679
 somehow to one 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.629
 our unimaginable ways experience value 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.749
 then I think that I will then take responsibility and that one 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:19.709
 his life 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.119
 More reflected than without these thoughts «My opinion when we question marks 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:27.129
 into the heads 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.759
 that is very much 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.930
 At the moment they have an exclamation mark without any commitment 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.769
 they just told me my pharmacy lives Neeson 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.769
 One percent happens that a movie runs out of an inner one 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.680
 their experience always does that so that belongs to the system MES states 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.279
 is 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:52.559
 that is very difficult to answer or forest numbers there often help little 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.209
 Many people have been clinically dead 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.329
 without reporting it from a near-death experience 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.650
 Maybe you knew maybe you have them 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.499
 just not 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.409
 Some people we need and have to deal with it internally Geis 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.379
 to get along 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.129
 and have less contact from yes very little that is also the problem 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.389
 That's what makes kids often say, "They do not have a contact for 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.309
 certain 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.139
 ask 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.859
 Sadness 9 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.219
 who they have and who then if they have something about nature experiences 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:26.059
 would 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.059
 then dissolves 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.609
 Get problem 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.179
 at sad 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.919
 he should know what they are talking about because they see 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.359
 He takes as she is against AIDS teacher 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.390
 in schools and talking to children and adolescents about the quake died 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.130
 Nachrodt and his vision can serve as a basis for Sion 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.879
 if they say then that I have something in the suspension 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.329
 Banks may be learning personal examples 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.340
 Signs mounted wanted a comprehensive school 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.220
 and there came a young boy and girl years old towards me 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.159
 and Elia is at an age where you can 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.589
 the definitive us is Berben life 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:14.989
 Since middle of life called heir serves began to conceive 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.549
 Under there I have a dog legal entity over nature experiences 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.039
 performed and there can this little boy to multiply 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.409
 cried almost »anticipation Eckert my hand squeezed the on his body 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:28.999
 such a duly 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.099
 and said thanks, thank you 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.800
 what happened to you Hamas had fallen in the youth what we 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.909
 have heard 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.169
 I now know that we have to leave all these 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.669
 and l 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.340
 since I got so hot I was up at night 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.270
 and then always very very doll wine 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.270
 and I do not have a person to talk to about it 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.669
 and since then I have 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.009
 what you have told us 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.779
 understood 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.539
 I do not mean at night anymore 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.960
 I'm so happy about that
