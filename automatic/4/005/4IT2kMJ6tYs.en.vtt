 priming that will be I would say half a fine to the fish because not 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.040
 % with the other half a kiprÃ© primer active ramos showers or 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.840
 attractive from home gets out of it do you want to dead his seed base that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.260

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.650
 which will allow once the thread of their trade welder at the bottom of the water 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.420
 to death was working very quickly 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.950

 these are the topsides generously hours for the sake of love 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.130
 with depreciation 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.020
