this<00:00:00.390> weekend<00:00:00.750> I<00:00:00.810> decided<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:01.350> build<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.650> f-35

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
this weekend I decided to build the f-35

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.300 
this weekend I decided to build the f-35
from<00:00:02.520> RC<00:00:02.820> powers<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.140> f-35<00:00:04.830> version

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
from RC powers this is the f-35 version

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.579 
from RC powers this is the f-35 version
to<00:00:05.549> easy<00:00:05.879> build<00:00:06.330> I've<00:00:06.540> got<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.049> say<00:00:07.170> it's<00:00:07.410> an

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
to easy build I've got to say it's an

plane<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.769> I've<00:00:10.860> ever<00:00:11.040> put<00:00:11.309> together<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
plane that I've ever put together the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.870 
plane that I've ever put together the
f-22<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.780> pretty<00:00:13.139> easy<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.650> 117<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.670> pretty

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
f-22 is pretty easy the 117 is pretty

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.380 
f-22 is pretty easy the 117 is pretty
easy<00:00:15.179> but<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.529> went<00:00:17.430> together<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.940> quick<00:00:18.210> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
easy but this went together so quick and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.630 
easy but this went together so quick and
it<00:00:18.930> feels<00:00:19.140> very<00:00:19.289> very<00:00:19.650> strong<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
it feels very very strong to the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.550 
it feels very very strong to the
structure<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.480> very<00:00:21.660> good<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:22.260> using

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
structure of it is very good I'm using

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.259 
structure of it is very good I'm using
blue<00:00:22.920> core<00:00:23.189> which<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> lot<00:00:23.760> more<00:00:23.970> flimsy

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
blue core which is a lot more flimsy

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.019 
blue core which is a lot more flimsy
than<00:00:24.630> depron<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.800> other<00:00:26.279> than<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> standard

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
than depron and other than the standard

than depron and other than the standard
reinforcements<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:28.199> I've<00:00:28.380> got<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> two

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
reinforcements here I've got the two

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.400 
reinforcements here I've got the two
rods<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> wing<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> one

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
rods here in the wing one here and one

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
rods here in the wing one here and one
here<00:00:31.460> I've<00:00:32.460> got<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> little<00:00:32.969> bit<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
here I've got a little bit of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.180 
here I've got a little bit of
reinforcement<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.110> behind<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.620> prop<00:00:34.860> slot

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
reinforcement here behind the prop slot

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.510 
reinforcement here behind the prop slot
so<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> blue<00:00:36.270> core<00:00:36.540> doesn't<00:00:36.750> flap<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
so the blue core doesn't flap with the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.810 
so the blue core doesn't flap with the
propwash<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> elements<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
propwash and in the elements here the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.240 
propwash and in the elements here the
standard<00:00:42.079> reinforcements<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.290> also<00:00:43.920> did

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
standard reinforcements I also did

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
standard reinforcements I also did
pre-stress<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.360> elements<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
pre-stress the elements and the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.529 
pre-stress the elements and the
stabilizers<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> packing<00:00:47.670> tape<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
stabilizers with the packing tape and it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
stabilizers with the packing tape and it
feels<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:48.840> sturdy<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:49.980> very

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
feels very sturdy I was very very

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.209 
feels very sturdy I was very very
surprised<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> 25<00:00:51.660> ounce<00:00:51.899> plane<00:00:52.289> with

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
surprised this is a 25 ounce plane with

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.970 
surprised this is a 25 ounce plane with
the<00:00:53.340> super<00:00:53.699> mega<00:00:53.879> jet<00:00:54.210> version<00:00:54.660> too<00:00:54.899> I'll<00:00:55.800> be

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

it<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.640> speeds<00:01:48.000> we're<00:01:48.210> flying<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.860> it's<00:01:49.860> not

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it the speeds we're flying at it's not

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.910 
it the speeds we're flying at it's not
necessary<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.140> my<00:01:52.350> flying<00:01:52.649> has

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
necessary I think that my flying has

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.910 
necessary I think that my flying has
gotten<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.460> much<00:01:53.640> smoother<00:01:54.740> especially<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
gotten so much smoother especially the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.270 
gotten so much smoother especially the
slow<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.820> low<00:01:57.240> stuff<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.960> slow<00:01:58.320> speed<00:01:58.680> high

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
slow and low stuff the slow speed high

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.090 
slow and low stuff the slow speed high
maneuverability<00:01:59.570> stuff<00:02:00.590> feels<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.890> much

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
maneuverability stuff feels so much

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.789 
maneuverability stuff feels so much
smoother<00:02:02.640> since<00:02:02.880> I've<00:02:03.060> started<00:02:03.390> rounding<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
smoother since I've started rounding the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.609 
smoother since I've started rounding the
edges<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.969> do<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> bevel<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
edges and what I do is I bevel with a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.380 
edges and what I do is I bevel with a
knife<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> utility<00:02:08.459> knife<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.879> get<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
knife with a utility knife to get the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.309 
knife with a utility knife to get the
angles<00:02:10.229> roughly<00:02:10.709> cut<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.660> also<00:02:12.660> take<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
angles roughly cut I also take the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.030 
angles roughly cut I also take the
utility<00:02:13.770> knife

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
utility knife

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.490 
utility knife
and<00:02:14.129> shave<00:02:14.430> off<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.180> edges<00:02:15.599> on<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.200> seams

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and shave off all the edges on the seams

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.330 
and shave off all the edges on the seams
here<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:20.689> then<00:02:21.689> I<00:02:21.719> take<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.049> power<00:02:22.500> sander<00:02:22.920> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
here and then I take a power sander and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.380 
here and then I take a power sander and
sand<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.239> 80<00:02:24.719> grit<00:02:25.019> paper<00:02:25.370> into<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> almost

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
sand with 80 grit paper into a almost

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.660 
sand with 80 grit paper into a almost
the<00:02:27.599> final<00:02:28.019> sanding<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.010> right<00:02:29.189> angles

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
the final sanding in the right angles

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.770 
the final sanding in the right angles
and<00:02:29.879> right<00:02:30.030> smoothness

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.270 

and<00:02:38.780> then<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.140> take<00:02:39.379> a<00:02:39.409> piece<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.769> hand

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and then I take a piece of hand

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.020 
and then I take a piece of hand
sandpaper<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.659> a<00:02:42.349> 120<00:02:43.040> grit<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:43.700> finish

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
sandpaper and a 120 grit and just finish

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:53.350 
sandpaper and a 120 grit and just finish
it<00:02:44.209> off<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:51.080> then<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.230> use<00:02:51.470> 3m<00:02:51.890> extreme<00:02:52.489> tape<00:02:52.819> to

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
it off and then I use 3m extreme tape to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.500 
it off and then I use 3m extreme tape to
seal<00:02:53.569> off<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.959> edges<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:55.430> plane<00:02:56.299> has<00:02:56.480> been

seal off the edges this plane has been
criticized<00:02:57.170> for<00:02:57.379> its<00:02:57.530> angular<00:02:57.980> look<00:02:58.459> with<00:02:58.849> all

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
criticized for its angular look with all

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.789 
criticized for its angular look with all
the<00:02:59.060> angles<00:02:59.480> on<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.780> but<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.319> think<00:03:00.379> after

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
the angles on it but I think after

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.410 
the angles on it but I think after
sanding<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.459> here<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.730> looks<00:03:01.879> pretty<00:03:01.970> smooth

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
sanding it here it looks pretty smooth

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.619 
sanding it here it looks pretty smooth
nice<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:02.840> curvy<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:04.220> anyway<00:03:04.519> let's<00:03:05.420> see<00:03:05.540> how

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
nice and curvy so anyway let's see how

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:14.030 
nice and curvy so anyway let's see how
it<00:03:05.780> does

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.680 

well<00:03:36.200> it's<00:03:36.440> certainly<00:03:36.650> smooth<00:03:37.300> not<00:03:38.300> much<00:03:38.540> I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
well it's certainly smooth not much I

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.320 
well it's certainly smooth not much I
can<00:03:38.900> say<00:03:39.140> other<00:03:39.319> than<00:03:39.610> its<00:03:40.610> handling<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.150> wind

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
can say other than its handling the wind

00:03:41.330 --> 00:04:07.420 
can say other than its handling the wind
very<00:03:41.569> well<00:03:41.810> with<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.110> kf4

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:20.590 
handles the wind great vertical I'm
sorry<00:04:11.400> inverted

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.350 

I've<00:04:21.600> got<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.870> 1600<00:04:22.380> battery<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:23.310> here<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:24.300> I

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
I've got a 1600 battery in here and I

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.790 
I've got a 1600 battery in here and I
was<00:04:24.480> concerned<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.350> center<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.680> gravity

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
was concerned that the center of gravity

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.170 
was concerned that the center of gravity
would<00:04:26.460> not<00:04:26.669> be<00:04:27.710> right<00:04:28.710> with<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.370> small<00:04:29.910> battery

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
would not be right with a small battery

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.240 
would not be right with a small battery
like<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:30.510> but<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.080> even<00:04:31.860> with<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.100> super

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
like that but it is even with the super

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.980 
like that but it is even with the super
mega<00:04:32.580> jet<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.060> center<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.419> gravity<00:04:33.510> looks

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
mega jet the center of gravity looks

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.379 
mega jet the center of gravity looks
perfect<00:04:34.530> I've<00:04:35.040> got<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.460> back<00:04:35.669> about<00:04:35.940> an<00:04:36.210> inch

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
perfect I've got it back about an inch

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.750 
perfect I've got it back about an inch
from<00:04:36.480> plan<00:04:37.020> because<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.889> smaller<00:04:38.190> battery

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
from plan because of the smaller battery

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:46.010 
from plan because of the smaller battery
and<00:04:39.410> it's<00:04:40.410> good<00:04:42.770> I've<00:04:43.940> got<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.150> lot<00:04:45.330> of<00:04:45.360> control

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
and it's good I've got a lot of control

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:57.630 
and it's good I've got a lot of control
with<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.100> tailwind<00:04:47.669> which<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.120> nice

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.770 

here<00:04:58.640> I'm<00:04:58.730> just<00:04:58.760> tooling<00:04:59.300> around<00:04:59.420> with

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
here I'm just tooling around with

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.600 
here I'm just tooling around with
practically<00:05:00.440> no<00:05:00.620> throttle<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.430> wing

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
practically no throttle and the wing

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.330 
practically no throttle and the wing
loading<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.150> like<00:05:03.080> Scott<00:05:03.410> says<00:05:03.710> very<00:05:04.100> light

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
loading is like Scott says very light

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.690 
loading is like Scott says very light
wing<00:05:04.580> loading<00:05:04.910> so<00:05:05.830> stays<00:05:06.830> airborne<00:05:07.520> with

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
wing loading so stays airborne with

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.400 
wing loading so stays airborne with
minimal<00:05:08.120> throttle<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.720> this<00:05:08.870> kind<00:05:09.110> of<00:05:09.200> wind

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
minimal throttle and this kind of wind

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:16.270 
minimal throttle and this kind of wind
it<00:05:13.210> is<00:05:14.210> more<00:05:14.450> direct<00:05:14.840> than<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.170> f-22<00:05:16.040> I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
it is more direct than the f-22 I

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.980 
it is more direct than the f-22 I
noticed<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.910> f-22<00:05:19.210> feels<00:05:20.210> like<00:05:20.420> it<00:05:20.600> slides

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
noticed the f-22 feels like it slides

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
that I'm very impressed by the way it

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.040 
that I'm very impressed by the way it
went<00:05:39.350> together<00:05:39.770> very<00:05:40.130> quick<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.820> easy<00:05:41.050> very

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
went together very quick and easy very

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.220 
went together very quick and easy very
strong<00:05:42.470> build<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:44.120> finished<00:05:44.480> off<00:05:44.660> very<00:05:44.690> nicely

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
strong build it finished off very nicely

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.260 
strong build it finished off very nicely
with<00:05:45.590> all<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.890> sanding<00:05:46.310> and<00:05:46.490> beveling<00:05:46.850> I<00:05:47.030> did

with all the sanding and beveling I did

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.700 
with all the sanding and beveling I did
it'll<00:05:47.630> actually<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:48.020> think<00:05:48.350> it<00:05:48.410> looks<00:05:48.590> pretty

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
it'll actually I think it looks pretty

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.200 
it'll actually I think it looks pretty
good<00:05:48.890> like<00:05:49.250> this<00:05:49.490> and<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:51.020> controls<00:05:52.210> linked

is great I love the link setup with the

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.840 
is great I love the link setup with the
ailerons<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:56.510> elements<00:05:57.110> and<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:58.520> rudders

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
ailerons and elements and the rudders

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.820 
ailerons and elements and the rudders
the<00:05:59.120> rudders<00:05:59.420> are<00:05:59.570> working<00:05:59.930> very<00:06:00.170> well<00:06:00.320> very

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830

the rudders are working very well very
touch<00:06:01.130> I<00:06:01.310> can<00:06:01.340> actually<00:06:01.790> probably<00:06:01.970> turn<00:06:02.300> down

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
touch I can actually probably turn down

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.030

the<00:06:02.630> throws<00:06:02.870> on<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.200> rudders<00:06:03.500> and<00:06:03.530> still<00:06:03.860> had

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
the throws on the rudders and still had

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.240 
the throws on the rudders and still had
some<00:06:04.220> good<00:06:04.370> reaction<00:06:04.910> from<00:06:05.090> them<00:06:06.040> so<00:06:07.040> what<00:06:07.220> a
