00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.700
 I'll show you two of mine 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:13.500
 with products and that my mistakes 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.089
 This is the first phase of liquid 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.439
 or thin middle course and that 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.270
 building guild quiz cost yes in the one 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.580
 live gel the one say that is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.859
 thin the others say that means that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.240
 everyone just as he already holds the products 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.270
 who had known I wear it as 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.600
 so it's pretty much right there right 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:42.989
 with in the dose I wear it as a reason 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.200
 your shift is as liable to me 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.539
 I really like it so I do too 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.320
 sometimes the construction with it depending on 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:58.530
 how much construction I need that one can 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.969
 It does not even make bubbles 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.739
 You can easily do the trick you can 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.949
 to brush 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.949
 you wear very thin on the nail 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.440
 It cures very fast so I have 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.200
 now anyway lamps ccfl lamps 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:37.740
 I have them very fast anyway 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:41.220
 I usually do that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.040
 then clean and sometimes work alien 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.010
 and then I'll start building now 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.240
 Today, I like not now directly to 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.790
 build up and show you one more later 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.110
 color of minute difference of construction go 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.000
 the viscous so you can already see the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.410
 brush 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.950
 You should not go back and forth too often 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:06.930
 turn but just swipe stands 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.130
 good as it is also a bit tough 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.130
 but it is okay 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:28.880
 I pull the construction I need it here 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.880
 not too much 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.810
 floating with the brush so it 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.640
 does not run into the grooves you can do it 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.510
 where you want it there you go 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.510
 just go there 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.800
 Yes 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.620
 I would not be thicker now 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.620
 apply 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.280
 everything is difficult with my model 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.280
 here 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:38.360
 then I'll show you the color only 80 and 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.130
 I can also give you the color number 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.709
 40 show I think they are both great 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.850
 I do not yet 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.770
 I do not have so here 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.920
 possibility no freedom no here 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.880
 to fall with with my ipad here 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.220
 so can be super fallen but 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.560
 It's not that not so hard 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.560
 not so firm that is a flexible go 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:33.520
 Great, I'm completely clean 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:44.400
 sufficient from the construction as the number 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:44.400
 80 very nice colors with brushes 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.300
 you can apply very thin 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.190
 always wear two layers 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:22.120
 next to it shows you the number 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.120
 40 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.310
 I love the color 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:05.110
 Once again, it works here too 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:12.340
 quickly cures quickly everything has been fine 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:22.870
 By then met a second layer 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:25.950
 I cover it with it 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.950
 do not know so well wiped 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.410
 to 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.010
 finished 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.940
 climbs very nicely 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.360
 I hope you get it right 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.360
 Well
