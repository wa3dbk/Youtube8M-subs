00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
are about 10 to 15 dollars cheaper than

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.320 
are about 10 to 15 dollars cheaper than

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.360 
stripper sitting on it you can see it's
really<00:02:13.930> really<00:02:14.930> bubbling<00:02:15.380> up<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:16.040> started

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
really really bubbling up and I started

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.089 
really really bubbling up and I started
peeling<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.790> little<00:02:16.940> bit<00:02:17.030> off<00:02:17.120> yeah

peeling a little bit off yeah

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.479 
peeling a little bit off yeah
seems<00:02:18.849> to<00:02:18.939> be<00:02:19.060> coming<00:02:19.299> off<00:02:19.420> pretty<00:02:20.049> decently

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489

so I'll strip the paint later these are
the<00:03:03.879> two<00:03:04.090> we<00:03:04.870> just<00:03:04.900> did<00:03:05.349> right<00:03:05.650> here<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.069> this

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
the two we just did right here and this

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.990 
the two we just did right here and this
is<00:03:07.090> an<00:03:07.239> original<00:03:07.329> 100%<00:03:08.260> cleaned<00:03:08.799> off<00:03:09.000> factory

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
is an original 100% cleaned off factory

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.190 
is an original 100% cleaned off factory
bakelite<00:03:10.420> mag<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:12.069> they'd<00:03:12.280> turn<00:03:12.549> out<00:03:12.700> too<00:03:12.879> bad

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
bakelite mag so they'd turn out too bad

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.660 
bakelite mag so they'd turn out too bad
only<00:03:14.200> thing<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.560> would<00:03:14.709> say<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:15.099> if<00:03:15.549> you're

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
only thing I would say is if you're

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.099 
only thing I would say is if you're
doing<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:15.970> take<00:03:16.269> off<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.599> floor<00:03:16.810> plates

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
doing this take off the floor plates

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.289 
doing this take off the floor plates
because<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.250> stripper<00:03:18.609> will<00:03:18.760> obviously<00:03:19.000> eat

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
because the stripper will obviously eat

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.149 
because the stripper will obviously eat
the<00:03:19.690> paint<00:03:19.930> off<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.049> floor<00:03:20.379> plate<00:03:20.620> as<00:03:21.099> you

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
the paint off the floor plate as you

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.949 
the paint off the floor plate as you
guys<00:03:21.400> saw<00:03:21.609> in<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.760> video<00:03:22.000> they<00:03:22.269> hardly<00:03:22.720> looked

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959
