was right one solution might have been

was right one solution might have been
to<00:04:44.190> pound<00:04:44.550> food<00:04:44.970> especially<00:04:45.300> meat<00:04:45.659> like<00:04:46.259> this

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530

steak if our ancestors have used stones

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:56.210

to<00:04:51.210> mash<00:04:52.759> the<00:04:53.759> meat<00:04:53.970> like<00:04:54.240> this<00:04:54.509> then<00:04:55.409> it<00:04:56.009> would

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
to mash the meat like this then it would

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.249 
to mash the meat like this then it would
have<00:04:56.310> reduced<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:57.060> difficulty<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:58.050> they

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
have reduced the difficulty that they

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
would have had in digesting it are you

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.080 
would have had in digesting it are you
gonna<00:05:00.900> try<00:05:01.169> it<00:05:01.199> or<00:05:01.440> have<00:05:01.620> at<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.909> that's

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
gonna try it or have at it and that's

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.209 
gonna try it or have at it and that's
quite<00:05:03.300> easy<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.569> -<00:05:03.810> it's<00:05:04.289> not<00:05:04.379> bad<00:05:04.500> at<00:05:04.650> all<00:05:04.770> but

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
quite easy to - it's not bad at all but

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:11.089 
quite easy to - it's not bad at all but
not<00:05:05.400> as<00:05:05.550> good<00:05:05.759> as<00:05:05.909> cooking<00:05:06.719> that<00:05:07.139> steak<00:05:10.099> that's

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
not as good as cooking that steak that's

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.279 
not as good as cooking that steak that's
what<00:05:11.430> Wrangham<00:05:11.819> says<00:05:12.060> was<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.360> really<00:05:13.020> big

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289

right<00:06:28.020> ok<00:06:29.900> Wrangham<00:06:30.900> like<00:06:31.050> to<00:06:31.199> think<00:06:31.409> that

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
right ok Wrangham like to think that

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.589 
right ok Wrangham like to think that
cooking<00:06:31.889> also<00:06:32.310> led<00:06:32.729> to<00:06:32.969> some<00:06:33.180> of<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.330> finer

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
cooking also led to some of the finer

ultimately<00:06:47.620> of<00:06:47.830> course<00:06:47.860> what<00:06:48.280> makes<00:06:48.520> us

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
ultimately of course what makes us

ultimately of course what makes us
intellectually<00:06:49.780> human<00:06:50.139> is<00:06:50.620> our<00:06:50.889> brain<00:06:51.129> and<00:06:51.400> I

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699 
intellectually human is our brain and I

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.570 
intellectually human is our brain and I
think<00:06:51.940> that<00:06:52.090> comes<00:06:52.360> from<00:06:52.659> having<00:06:53.280> the<00:06:54.280> highest

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
think that comes from having the highest

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.820 
think that comes from having the highest
quality<00:06:55.090> of<00:06:55.449> food<00:06:55.840> in<00:06:56.139> the<00:06:56.500> animal<00:06:56.800> kingdom

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
quality of food in the animal kingdom

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.559 
quality of food in the animal kingdom
and<00:06:57.400> that's<00:06:57.610> because<00:06:57.970> we<00:06:58.150> cook

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
and that's because we cook

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.809 
and that's because we cook
so<00:06:58.870> as<00:06:59.110> the<00:06:59.560> Neanderthals<00:07:00.190> like<00:07:00.430> to<00:07:00.580> say

so as the Neanderthals like to say
