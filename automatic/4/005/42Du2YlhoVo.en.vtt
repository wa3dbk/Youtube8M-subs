00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.950
 Good afternoon, this shows the algorithm of work 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:11.440
 basically 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.440
 work quiet and turn signal 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.810
 for a start, look at the reflection like this 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.020
 looks then go out because 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 it is not convenient for one to walk a hundred times 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.880
 normal mode for anyone when the machine 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:36.110
 started celebrating brass food 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.270
 went out put inclusive 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.820
 turned yes really battery up 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.820
 Ignition the same thing turns on 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:59.359
 neighbor but in principle usually like this 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:01:01.940
 we start up and the seats will be 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:08.020
 work breathing 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.020
 grieves the extra such went out and was treated 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.340
 let's say if you need to turn on the left 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:21.340
 turn signal dashing out 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.729
 tula size 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080
 emergency gang 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.159
 that's why the owl reiki only she doesn't 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.159
 simultaneously coming out 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.700
 fog like a dance iris 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:56.180
 and added a few LEDs to those lamps 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.180
 which were a little bit brighter 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:03.090
 just if a lot of LEDs on 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.889
 corn lamp hang it will not fit 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.989
 headlights 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:11.659
 but now it is clear that the intensity of light 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.659
 approximately equal to who you collar 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.400
 get god 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.209
 it is clear that there is a brighter 15 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.209
 which just succeeds 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.650
 additional LEDs 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.989
 Bystrinsky all the scheme is presented on 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.459
 drive2 site 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:06.459
 my blog is interesting to follow 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.459
 to ask
