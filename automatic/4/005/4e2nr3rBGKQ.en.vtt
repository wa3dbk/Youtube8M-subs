different<00:01:37.929> links<00:01:38.079> now<00:01:38.349> I<00:01:38.409> could<00:01:38.649> make<00:01:38.829> one

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
different links now I could make one

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.629 
different links now I could make one
even<00:01:39.310> shorter<00:01:39.759> like<00:01:39.969> that<00:01:40.779> and<00:01:41.130> longer<00:01:42.130> but

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:42.639 
even shorter like that and longer but

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:44.219 
even shorter like that and longer but
the<00:01:42.729> benefit<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.149> doing<00:01:43.359> it<00:01:43.630> like<00:01:43.779> this<00:01:44.020> by

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
the benefit of doing it like this by

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.449 
the benefit of doing it like this by
connecting<00:01:44.709> it<00:01:44.770> in<00:01:44.889> between<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.189> disc

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
connecting it in between the disc

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.190 
connecting it in between the disc
instead<00:01:45.849> of<00:01:45.909> wrap<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.179> around<00:01:46.450> your<00:01:46.810> neck<00:01:46.840> if

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
instead of wrap it around your neck if

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.349 
instead of wrap it around your neck if
wind<00:01:48.130> chain<00:01:48.399> isn't<00:01:48.549> always<00:01:48.789> gonna<00:01:49.029> be<00:01:49.119> choking

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
wind chain isn't always gonna be choking

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.639 
wind chain isn't always gonna be choking
you<00:01:49.599> while<00:01:49.779> the<00:01:49.899> other<00:01:50.020> one<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:50.349> too<00:01:50.619> long

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
you while the other one is too long

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.739 
you while the other one is too long
because<00:01:51.249> we<00:01:51.520> run<00:01:51.759> into<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:52.090> problem<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.569> lot

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
because we run into that problem a lot

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.359 
because we run into that problem a lot
when<00:01:52.929> we<00:01:53.020> try<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.229> double<00:01:53.619> up<00:01:53.709> our<00:01:53.859> necklaces
