00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.699
 Rome 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.709
 I am chairman 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.329
 learn dorsey formerly indicate sentiment 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.749
 antisemite 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.739
 and so the leeches 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.279
 war hits and refer to an Islamic tradition 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.890
 about Jews descendants of anp 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.170
 and pigs he does this even with today also for the destruction 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.360
 of all Jews he states that youth 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.160
 must be staged with her 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.960
 Jews emotion is an anti-Semite 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.750
 but also the current president of egypt and member of the muslim brotherhood 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.550
 I would like to hear from this minister whether he also recognized the Egyptian president 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.600
 morsin is antisemite 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.690
 furthermore under constitution mr moorsele it was adopted consistently 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.610
 refers 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.840
 but the Islamic law is the sharia 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.960
 the Muslim Brotherhood have the organization by this president at feyenoord 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.059
 about them never made a secret from islamic 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.009

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.390
 and that you go it is our way 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.460
 female suppression harassment 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.830
 violence against non-Muslims and the curtailment 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.560
 freedom of expression 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.890
 to make Islam criticism possible we are the result 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.960
 that is the Egypt of today 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.240
 that is the so-called arabic spring she is the revolution loss of 100,000 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 Christians land because of the threat 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.820
 and government violence barely against acting Egypt led the rap 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.760
 pace 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.960
 Islamic dictatorship and what does the crew do 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.200
 who also promises this Islam about cystic regime with billions of euros as well as gifts 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.410
 as loans 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.980
 and the Netherlands contributes 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.070
 with the 5 billion ecb now on the south island 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.860
 egypt but it does not stop there netherlands gives also closed with money 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.610
 to egypt via direct 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.590
 development aid almost this year 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.090
 4 million but also through the world bank makers from monies and the subsidized 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.560
 auxiliary clubs such as cooks from NOVEC 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.649
 millions go 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.040
 big thing egypt 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.880
 the pvv would like to hear that the cabinet inspires to put money into the regime 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.490
 led by an anti-Semite that leaves Christian fate 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.300
 Wiping out women's rights and that is not becoming democracy 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.549
 agree 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.519
 the pvv also wants to know what the government is going to do to get all of it as soon as possible 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.979
 to stop aid to Egypt as long as this government does nothing 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.729
 to stop the oath now the support to dexia ryan landscape and even immediately 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.189
 continue to transfer Dutch tax money 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.499
 and the government the Muslim brothers 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.639
 motion late with the Dutch taxpayer 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.259
 also Chris to abandon women and not Muslims in Egypt 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:49.079
 The Netherlands contributes to the construction of an Islamic dictatorship as stated 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.709
 Egypt does not get a cent as far as the PVV is concerned, not just no big loans and 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.369
 gifts 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:58.240
 but also no small loans and gifts and not only not for the time being 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.269
 but never at all 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.509
 Dil this Cabinet really do what that would up to the tires 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.189
 break up a barbaric regime as soon as possible with this 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.739
 then I give the floor to times 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.739
 for the Christian Union 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.870
 i have read books 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.310
 2 my passport and its surroundings as he is the word to their complaining 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.310
 bvdl 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:43.190
 chairman 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.329
 we don't participate in the hysterical screeching 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.479
 about this the new president if they have something again 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.040
 annoying is said 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.899
 about Jews according to the vvd 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:58.679
 this chairman downplaying this shocking by the vvd of the call 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:59.220
 until 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.439
 happiness violence 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.439
 against yodeling by Muslims by the motion 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.939
 shocking really shocking and indicative of naivety 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.219
 from the former liberal by way of mister ten broeke far I thought that 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.799
 only this minister had difficulty listening, but also a colleague seems to be 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.650
 not yet fully master this skill 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.220
 The loans grants gifts spaceship to come in total 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.159
 5 billion is on the role that it still says that's what he said 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.370
 and that they are right 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.469
 still 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.399
 and whether that is in vases or once made or the direct gifts 

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:36.509
 or loans 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.830
 that will be a source of concern for all of us 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.460
 that does not happen and that the vvd now believes in the feasibility of the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.620
 society in the netherlands we already knew that but now she also believes that she is 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.520
 Egypt can bring democracy and freedom probably inherent in the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.110
 new left course but that is also noticeable at the bed with even though doing and sp 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.159
 colleague 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.039
 that she argues for more development aid 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.649
 President Islam he is dominant and this is not only evident from the fact that 

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:06.550
 have a Muslim brother at the helm in a plaster 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.379
 but also because 90 percent of the population wants Islam to be dominant 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:11.510
 in the politics 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.850
 82 percent of the Egyptian population think that adulterous should be stoned 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.320
 84 percent believe that waste behind the death penalty deserves 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.260
 according to research from the cultural center 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.260
 there is no paradise spring in in egypt even 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.680
 the Egyptian union of human rights organizations are discussing 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680
 is a new home kit that comes across the country we don't believe 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.150
 flow into the wish and hence we submit the next motion to the Chamber after hearing 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.039
 consulting the deliberation 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.539
 that the president of egypt and virulent is anti-Semite 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.719
 that the Egyptian president is a member of the who is going 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:47.620
 preach to the Muslim brotherhood 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.930
 note that under this president 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.130
 a constitution has been adopted that consistently refers to the sharia concertant 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.070
 that since the revolution in egypt there are more than 800 thousand Christians in the country 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.340
 escaped due to violence and threats whereas providing assistance to 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.050
 such a brutal regime is more than reprehensible, the government requests the 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.919
 to break ties with Egypt and move on to the order of day to day and 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.279
 this motion is co-signed the fire of my colleague 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.279
 what do you think of this motion by the council of state 6 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.169
 he is not yet the man what makes this motion a moderate match then 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.270
 that is the case made
