00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.889
 The wall is a colossal fortress 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.590
 300 miles along the northern border 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.680
 Of the seven kingdoms certainly strictly the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.220
 defense of the empire 's survival 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.009
 want 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.460
 the wall is reported to be more 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.939
 than 700 feet high and made of massive 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.580
 ice is supposed to have been with both 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.870
 magic and built with worldly means 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.540
 in front of 84 thousands in the aftermath of the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.840
 long night the rich against the white 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.570
 hikers apparently in the far north 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.640
 defend living even if it is now 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.080
 as myths is dismissed by most 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.440
 Welcome to another 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.520
 world report today is about a map 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.580
 from game of thrones I'll show you today 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.710
 so that the hotspots of this map and a 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.409
 the biggest hotspots was the same 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.210
 hearing first minute is like 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.370
 unbelievably huge wall 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.590
 if he introduces again look 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.940
 above that looks easy and what was 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.920
 beautiful from further is also the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.930
 City not of bad parents 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 I have many buildings in the city 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.650
 visited and received in many houses 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.640
 and I must say to the city 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.440
 very nice 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.240
 the only thing that bothers me is what you get 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.580
 here settled advised 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.440
 this picture is that the device 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.000
 in part this is very sporadic, the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.070
 If you are still there a bit 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.080
 invest would in time for a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.580
 half or half for your survival games 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.490
 for whatever you like this map then 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.200
 I think I could use later 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.520
 which is a pretty horny web I will 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.010
 I've never seen anything like that before 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.040
 and they think the first time I yes 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.180
 I could even look like yes I have 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.230
 I've never looked it I have to be honest 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.300
 admit 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.550
 well we come to the web contorts her 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.990
 conclusion is that the map itself is not 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.510
 really extensive that is one 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.000
 wall and that is stopped that is 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.590
 Of course, not everything I am, of course 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.840
 say it bad no that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.430
 but I can not find the one 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.050
 extent of the map a bit low me 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.940
 maybe I would have second set of game 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.590
 of thrones oso still desired what you 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.550
 could have made the courage was from 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.400
 Development probably not so 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.050
 thought so very nice anyway 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.380
 they could use for movies you 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.560
 could use it for survival game 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.730
 apps and you could do it above all else 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.880
 worked out using film that is one 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.040
 really good movies actually otherwise 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.750
 pvp maps, too, and I could 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.180
 data sd card battle on it 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.340
 imagine writing the comments 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.000
 what you use the web or you 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.000
 you like it at all
