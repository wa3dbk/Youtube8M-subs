00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 the commission i am this company that loves 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.930
 the good old people we go as sad as you like you know it 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.740
 the nasa for them 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.540
 and they started at an important step that if they want to have tdt without a house they have to 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.449
 consider 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.530
 basic care and for the welfare of these animals 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.380
 the most important thing is that the right social habitat 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.710
 and for that we leave with that company lara here gives us a series of tips 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 - 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.050
 everyone can have a watercolor works you have to know how to take care of it 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.170
 it is very important the maintenance is not is not to be very pending 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.590
 but of that indispensable a small maintenance 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.429
 my life is not worth anything 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.070
 Food cleaning is very important 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.060
 we can start training only in this world because now what has been 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.940
 out of fashion is this the marine fish mario marin is true the nemo and the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.900
 film in the north and that in addition to a little important 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.300
 saltwater napoli we tell you everything is alive all all everything if you think 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.380
 from the sand is special live coral 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 the rambla 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.430
 this gives brought from the pacific 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 these two locations 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.329
 and all the corals are imposed on their own candidate of the PD has 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.280
 we bring a little bit of the sea 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.360
 to home 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.170
 but the vital element of the fish is the water the temperature of the water to see if 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.970
 we get it hot 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.550
 is that really told us the cyclist to Spain between 26 and 28 degrees 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.960
 in the marina 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.109
 the temperature really in the sea is usually between 22 and 24 degrees 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.090
 that is why we need water how we take care of ourselves to see here still 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.270
 we are far from the sea 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.720
 it was sanguine for us is worth xisco ass well of the tap 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.500
 will deal with a series of events and two specials in the surrounding area 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.540
 biological activators and then pass to the salary ficial vale 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.590
 that we have to throw it out when we start the aquarium to desalinate the water 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.600
 designation 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.630
 and then for their maintenance from 3 better give them less food than most 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.229
 this is certainly very important is worth a thousand species one hundred percent of 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.619
 their cabin they eat every day and 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.790
 and three or four times a day it is true that in this case they do not remember 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.680
 they have eaten 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.650
 tapes go back to eat quoting times a day what milk you say those 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.629
 fish that we are going to achieve that a different peculiarity because 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.829
 was that is your best state endorsement 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.090
 hot water fish but they are cyclical are missing lanús 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.959
 in lakes of africa voice of america is not well known in spain for example 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.439
 the santafesino and territorial here we have aquariums of water you already had 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.999
 which are that they are more of all life is a daily routine now 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.249
 we have fresh water 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.219
 hot water and cold water 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.499
 bad is a little bit the division has that there is this is easier 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.399
 to keep because they really are small and there's nothing 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.739
 the master xavi were going to shoot him 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.109
 and sometimes a little easier what happens it's good that people also 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.749
 we need 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.449
 classic of all life 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.209
 this plot lara as you see there is no weight 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.359
 it is simply for plants we have to plant ourselves we try to bring species 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.029
 new after the week for example those little balls you want 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:14.169
 in the background 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.509
 but special rooms is called ball declared out 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:18.349
 that ball 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.389
 per hundred and naturally controls the water levels the law prevents the 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.819
 three levels add up your buttock 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.379
 that controls the mythical aquarium and now we are seeing the image of something 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.030
 that we're not used to seeing what seahorses like that is is weird 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.919
 to see is a pretty curious animal 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.419
 people are not used to seeing it 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.140
 It is a very calm animal 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.140
 Starfish also get a lot of attention if they are 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.130
 a depleting invertebrate done it is 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.979
 there are many colors to the dam and white ones that clean the bottom 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.509
 the blue one that is a bit the biggest attack we have now 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.619
 and in those specialized centers in aquariums but not only in that because 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:56.589
 you have 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.540
 many things we try to have 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.499
 the side of the maximum possible animal seven point puppies 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:04.789
 patadón 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.289
 ambassadors 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.289
 the extractive rodent are well worth everything 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.839
 always remembering that every pet needed some essential care 

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.089
 He said that you have to treat them with responsibility and affection 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.289
 many good counselors of Lara 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.580
 morning 194 professor of our regional management non-proud area painter 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.760
 the experimental deer field in albacete 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.720
 Over the years, it has become a world reference for 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.570
 study and research this subject so be prepared to leave 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.710
 Thousands of miles away with Tomás Landete our compañero nick
