00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.799
 reliable and economical 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.809
 the best you can find at the moment 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.420
 on the market 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:19.050
 wesley sneijder wesley sneijder lo 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.529
 I repeat is wesley sneijder player 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.189
 paid 150 thousand credits but boys there 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.939
 I can assure you that it is the best coc 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.510
 that I've ever tried in any case of 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.940
 then play then then wesley 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 Dutch sneijder that thanks to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 hat-trick against the bursaspor with 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.760
 obviously the galatasaray managed to 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.920
 have this card second computer 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.719
 a delight we start talking about the con 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 daily pros and cons 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.190
 then the first promo that jumps us 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.399
 obviously the eye is the control 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.399
 ball this player to 86 of dribbling 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.059
 shown on the card is a 91 of 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 ball control 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.570
 obviously the second one of course I have it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.610
 repeated his course twice 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 show must necessarily take a moment 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.040
 ball control he has it and conceals 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.590
 excellent the ball has always attached to it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:25.290
 at the foot and the first touch is excellent 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.369
 second, however, shooting throw shooting shooting shot 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.619
 kilo of coca 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.140
 no the sneijder shot is the most ap 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.850
 most overpowered of the game I never have 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:43.920
 I never say and I just never tried a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.310
 so-so shot then we read the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.509
 statistics 86 on the shooting card 99 a 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.430
 round 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.610
 eh already 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:02:00.860
 what should I say 99 about soccer from 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:06.370
 production ok 98 of long shot shooting 99 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:09.350
 and shooting power and 91 shooting range 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.450
 What I have to say 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.820
 what I have to say are perfect 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 look at the clips I have to talk I have to 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.530
 I speak 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.440
 look at the clips does not need to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.390
 reviews this player is very strong 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.440
 it is very strong to tell you that hallucinating 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.200
 the sneijder shot 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.350
 what can I tell you what I can tell you 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.900
 then long shot is an absurd stuff because 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.190
 thanks to his god power and the 5 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.709
 weak foot stars 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.050
 what can I do what I can do what 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.800
 I can do ask the green goose carlo 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.709
 that while magna than while I was in up 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.780
 skype with their instinct feel me that 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.709
 cry to this player's pearls from 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.190
 that is absurd and nothing therefore the 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.590
 shooting between the programs understood the third pro 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.459
 is the passage to the hour I pass 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.130
 I contain a moment 90 of passage 92 of 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.989
 short passage and is hallucinating because 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.549
 however the short passages are not there 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:23.209
 never ever ever perfect and wrong 90 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.430
 division between excellent and 94 passing 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.440
 long but even here nothing to say 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.120
 I do not tell you, however, that it is perfect because 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.810
 sometimes it happened to me 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.459
 you missed some long passage 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.079
 simple enough for one that anyway 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.790
 both at 90 of passage 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:43.560
 very good to say 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:48.170
 8 to 9 this statistic is good then it is 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.170
 good is superlative but let us contain ourselves 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.810
 other pro instead of the weak priest stars 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.609
 I've already told you ok then the pros are 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.890
 very general as you well understood 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.620
 now start talking against 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.590
 so why is it perfect? 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.670
 this player lacks 80's of agility 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.310
 agility no no because in any case it is a 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.780
 player not so fast 74 of 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.209
 speed and eighty of agility agility 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.549
 sin sins is not very agile and neither 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.710
 fast is not very fast ie in 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.990
 acceleration is good because some 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.680
 clip by a few clicks from some clips yes 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.210
 note for it has the agility indeed sin the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.410
 his dribbling isn't really fast 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.440
 but whatever it is and 8 sets is enough 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.030
 good dribbling of Sneijder 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.099
 taking, of course, check the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.440
 speed instead I would like to put the note 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.770
 also I am put in or against 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.840
 speed is good especially 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.820
 acceleration is not really right 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.110
 great thing obviously lacks agility 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.940
 I repeat for the thousandth time and nothing 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.340
 another against the three-star foot 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.750
 lousy unfortunately unfortunately because if 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.180
 had these write I would not be 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:08.250
 really absurd then here and there strength 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.229
 sorry for the strength anyway 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.580
 a player who goes well 67 of stan is not 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.639
 just the shit 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.949
 but it's a and 70 in 170 you can have 99 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.409
 strength but if you are other in 50 do not 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.599
 counts a dick in my opinion and then 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.270
 this is another against that I want 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:27.620
 to say that in any case it is playing and half 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.460
 unfortunately he will have to clash with the various 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:35.099
 cdc of the madonna as toure tiote e 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.340
 blood counters and so on 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.139
 and in any case 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.860
 I don't like it very much though 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.240
 it was just 4 stars tall weak foot 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.319
 you could the screen really would 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.240
 absurd though I ask too much 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.889
 and nothing then meet and the other 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.090
 against instead positioning because 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.780
 this player 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.759
 yes it's not that you never show up though 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.250
 flaw under that point of view maybe 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.050
 we are on the band we don't find that 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.979
 comes to ask for the ball but 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.780
 maybe it's in the center, I do n't understand 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.610
 we always find this indeed is one of the 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.250
 against that I give him and 70 knots 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.650
 positioning is not exactly the best 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.110
 ok the review on this monster is 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.300
 over I think I have done to you 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.780
 understand that veil straconsigliate beautiful 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.449
 note and as you can see I'll put it anyway 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.810
 active passage and control ball 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.849
 pro generalizzo everything while we against 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.289
 even if they are more but sneijder is the 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.900
 perfect player 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:42.900
 this is perfect, I greet you and you 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:45.090
