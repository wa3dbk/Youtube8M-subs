00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
thought like classy right and this is a

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.810 
thought like classy right and this is a
college<00:01:40.820> world<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.479> it's<00:01:41.630> one<00:01:41.840> subject<00:01:42.200> and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
college world and it's one subject and

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.219 
college world and it's one subject and
then<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.060> thought<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.450> same<00:01:44.659> thing<00:01:44.690> in

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229
