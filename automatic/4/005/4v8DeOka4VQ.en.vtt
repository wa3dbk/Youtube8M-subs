00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.910
 I never showed my composition 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.220
 look at the statistics of 76 strike 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.910
 turn I have complete domination you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.170
 look at my diagram 4231 how are you 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.430
 already on in noticed it constantly 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:54.919
 okay let's use it so more 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.720
 upward upward still upstairs and blow up 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:59.519
 21 guys at the time opened very 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.400
 nice by the way opened in the center this 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.290
 was ramir mustache pass right on the verge 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.180
 offside fernandinho oh oh oh oh damn not 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.790
 lucky to Kurtua again I 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.530
 I come across this goalkeeper him 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.519
 against him to play well and all that 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.310
 anything. 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.470
 but this time he turned on while on 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.319
 it is on the version is not as good as 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.049
 then you know it the entire game is yet to come and 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.889
 Lampard with a ball can make such a block 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.209
 shot pretty all import can beat 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.069
 rival seems to me swam 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.169
 play but principle i'm afraid too 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.720
 lose all the same at stake 200 thousand 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.150
 coins or is there more than that 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.569
 for a pause so pause is a comedian I 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.269
 still let's see 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.469
 Oscar let's get an Oscar and release a place 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.069
 lampard 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:53.230
 I am sure that I will be able to pass 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:59.000
 final come on kagawa 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:02.629
 lampard pawnshop who is faster than sanchez 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.409
 Of course, Santis on the canopy turned out 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:15.139
 worthless yes oh dangerous it was who it is 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:17.570
 rs or who is this sanchez sanchez 5 walked 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.410
 the ear of the hour and I am Ashley Cole again does not give 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:27.020
 hang a normal train just gives 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:32.539
 tanks and then Oscar Oscar more on 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.729
 Oscar come on Oscar I hope you I 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.910
 I do not know I hope for you as a di caprio 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.340
 hope for you too it was a joke for 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.349
 300 but you understood no I feel here 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.900
 maybe a voice and he do the transfer 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.610
 up more precisely yes this transfer is 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.680
 check on the spot and we can score on 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.659
 last but no such transfer frame 1 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.889
 pramy times cool position oh what 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.990
 filigree transfer is going on 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.419
 kurtois gate you kurtua just catches 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.669
 ball and one minute extra 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:07.729
 please communication no judge oh no oh no 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.470

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.970

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.370
 extra time waiting for us guys and me 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.050
 I think damn it will be it tough I 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.169
 missed on some fucking 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.889
 counterattacks although it seems to me judging by 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.870
 match statistics I dominated I don't want 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.330
 penalty because penalty is a lottery 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.449
 I think the lottery penalty so I want 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.240
 right now score a goal and not 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.330

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.150
 wheels bad goes upstairs but still 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.729
 blow passed 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.590
 finishing moves may have been what aguero does 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.750
 would put such a cool such a turn 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.470
 crawled up the mountain but now is not about this chapter 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:59.340
 and personally 32 just great handsome 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.560
 or maybe another goal to score 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.300
 finally sure to be sure 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.220

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.110
 oh what a cool transfer from 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.920
 fernandinho bite overtakes him but 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:14.220
 Curtois comes out a twist yes guys 1 extra 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.920

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.880

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.380
 almost equal their late late gave 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.830
 this gear is late but the sword has been 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.740
 the gate and as they say the most famous 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.150
 the most famous football this subject with 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.690
 have been at the gate 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:42.960
 then it will be goals believes in omens I know 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.919

 Oscar just doesn't want dicaprio okay 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.400
 this is not about us now 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:15.210
 I hurt an unnecessary replacement in fact 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.979
 because your overhang is exactly canopy louis 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.250

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:23.700
