full-range speaker with a P they unit in
it<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.290> course<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.590> tried<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.980> little

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
it and of course I tried a little

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.200 
it and of course I tried a little
prototype<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.840> picked<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.160> nice<00:00:41.850> pair

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
prototype and I picked out a nice pair

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.690

essential<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.420> do<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:00.989> you're<00:03:01.140> making

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
essential to do that if you're making

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.080 
essential to do that if you're making
your<00:03:01.650> own<00:03:01.709> speakers<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.609> you<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:02.849> make

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
your own speakers because you can make

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.599 
your own speakers because you can make
the<00:03:03.269> base<00:03:03.480> sound<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.319> much<00:03:04.590> better<00:03:04.620> by<00:03:05.579> doing

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
the base sound so much better by doing

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.839 
the base sound so much better by doing
that<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.019> not<00:03:07.319> fun<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:08.549> just

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
that it's just not fun it's just

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.640

and<00:04:29.940> that's<00:04:30.300> what's<00:04:30.480> good<00:04:30.690> about<00:04:30.720> these<00:04:31.170> you

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
and that's what's good about these you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.500 
and that's what's good about these you
can<00:04:31.560> change<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.280> then<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.270> you<00:04:33.330> got<00:04:33.480> a

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
can change it and then so you got a

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.650 
can change it and then so you got a
slight<00:04:33.870> through<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.290> sound<00:04:34.670> really<00:04:35.670> low<00:04:35.850> a

slight through the sound really low a

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.950 
slight through the sound really low a

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
fairly high resistance as a base of Sam

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.010 
fairly high resistance as a base of Sam
that<00:04:40.320> doesn't<00:04:40.710> sort<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.150> have<00:04:42.150> any<00:04:42.330> gaps<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.900> it

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
that doesn't sort of have any gaps in it

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.840 
that doesn't sort of have any gaps in it
there's<00:04:43.230> no<00:04:43.380> gaps<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.040> you're<00:04:44.160> getting<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.520> nice

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
there's no gaps so you're getting a nice

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.810 
there's no gaps so you're getting a nice
fluence<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.780> then<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.410> add<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.980> that<00:04:47.010> by

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
fluence and then you add to that by

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.080 
fluence and then you add to that by
saying<00:04:47.850> not<00:04:48.510> by<00:04:48.690> survey<00:04:49.380> i<00:04:49.410> SS<00:04:50.010> B<00:04:50.220> is<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.820> and

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.230 
saying not by survey i SS B is a and
talking<00:04:51.540> about<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.650> add<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:52.920> that<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.970> add

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
talking about and you add to that it add

capacitor<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.950> comes<00:04:59.160> right<00:04:59.310> through

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
capacitor and it comes right through

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.670 
capacitor and it comes right through
that<00:05:00.120> they<00:05:00.540> might<00:05:00.780> be<00:05:01.020> held<00:05:01.200> back<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.440> little

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
that they might be held back a little

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.740 
that they might be held back a little
bit<00:05:01.860> by<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.160> small<00:05:02.580> amount<00:05:02.760> but<00:05:03.120> not<00:05:03.300> much<00:05:03.540> just

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
bit by a small amount but not much just

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.200 
bit by a small amount but not much just
just<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.620> tweak<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:05.160> get<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.580> right<00:05:05.610> amount<00:05:05.940> of

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
just to tweak it get the right amount of

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.810 
just to tweak it get the right amount of
T's<00:05:06.450> and<00:05:07.320> say<00:05:07.530> really<00:05:07.800> kiss<00:05:08.100> it<00:05:08.250> up<00:05:08.400> then<00:05:08.760> you

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
T's and say really kiss it up then you

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.940 
T's and say really kiss it up then you
got<00:05:09.000> your<00:05:09.150> warming<00:05:09.780> joke<00:05:10.170> now<00:05:10.620> what<00:05:10.800> the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
got your warming joke now what the

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.610 
got your warming joke now what the
warming<00:05:11.430> jug<00:05:11.820> does<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.300> warms<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:12.960> sound<00:05:13.350> up

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
warming jug does it warms the sound up

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.530 
warming jug does it warms the sound up
and<00:05:13.830> lets<00:05:13.980> a<00:05:14.100> bit<00:05:14.250> of<00:05:14.370> more<00:05:14.580> bass<00:05:14.910> mid-range

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
and lets a bit of more bass mid-range

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.490 
and lets a bit of more bass mid-range
and<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:15.870> doesn't<00:05:16.230> let<00:05:16.440> treble<00:05:17.690> at<00:05:18.690> all<00:05:18.900> or<00:05:19.260> mid

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
and it doesn't let treble at all or mid

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.880 
and it doesn't let treble at all or mid
range<00:05:19.530> by<00:05:20.070> lower<00:05:20.880> mid<00:05:21.150> range<00:05:21.390> and<00:05:21.570> only<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.260> so

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
range by lower mid range and only and so

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.820 
range by lower mid range and only and so
you<00:05:22.950> get<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.490> warm<00:05:23.790> zone<00:05:23.940> in<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.420> voice<00:05:24.630> it<00:05:25.350> but

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
you get a warm zone in the voice it but

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.250 
you get a warm zone in the voice it but
it'll<00:05:26.010> sound<00:05:26.400> boxed<00:05:26.880> in<00:05:27.090> if<00:05:27.300> it's<00:05:27.810> too<00:05:27.990> warm

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
it'll sound boxed in if it's too warm

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.980 
it'll sound boxed in if it's too warm
and<00:05:28.650> if<00:05:28.980> it's<00:05:29.160> not<00:05:29.310> warm<00:05:29.610> enough<00:05:29.760> it'll<00:05:30.660> sound

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
and if it's not warm enough it'll sound

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.010 
and if it's not warm enough it'll sound
eerie<00:05:31.320> but<00:05:31.920> then<00:05:32.130> we'll<00:05:32.310> be<00:05:32.340> also<00:05:32.810> nasal<00:05:33.810> and

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
eerie but then we'll be also nasal and

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.650 
eerie but then we'll be also nasal and
so<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.920> control<00:05:35.370> it<00:05:35.730> with<00:05:35.760> this<00:05:36.150> by<00:05:36.480> letting

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
so you control it with this by letting

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.810 
so you control it with this by letting
in<00:05:36.900> just<00:05:36.930> them<00:05:37.350> right<00:05:37.710> amount<00:05:38.070> of<00:05:38.160> boom<00:05:38.370> in<00:05:38.640> the

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
in just them right amount of boom in the

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.680 
in just them right amount of boom in the
voice<00:05:39.030> you<00:05:39.510> know<00:05:40.250> beautiful<00:05:41.250> there's<00:05:41.640> done<00:05:42.450> by

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
voice you know beautiful there's done by

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.450 
voice you know beautiful there's done by
the<00:05:42.750> combine<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:43.830> course<00:05:44.070> there's<00:05:44.310> the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
the combine of course there's the

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.360 
the combine of course there's the
resistor<00:05:45.180> which<00:05:45.900> holds<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:46.410> back<00:05:46.890> you<00:05:47.220> know

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
resistor which holds that back you know

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.990 
resistor which holds that back you know
this<00:05:47.580> in<00:05:47.760> parallel<00:05:48.330> with<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.200> other<00:05:50.000> main

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870

it and that added to it and you get the

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.840 
it and that added to it and you get the
sound<00:05:59.850> just<00:06:00.090> how<00:06:00.360> you<00:06:00.420> want<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.870> beautiful<00:06:01.850> now

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
sound just how you want it beautiful now

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.160 
sound just how you want it beautiful now
you<00:06:03.840> also<00:06:04.320> have<00:06:04.790> the<00:06:05.790> pisar<00:06:06.270> unit<00:06:06.690> and<00:06:07.050> they

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
you also have the pisar unit and they

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.050 
you also have the pisar unit and they
help<00:06:07.410> back<00:06:07.650> a<00:06:07.680> little<00:06:07.980> bit<00:06:08.160> because<00:06:08.430> they<00:06:08.760> do

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
help back a little bit because they do

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.850 
help back a little bit because they do
have<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.330> lot<00:06:09.540> of<00:06:09.570> output<00:06:10.020> on<00:06:10.200> the<00:06:10.320> really<00:06:10.650> top

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
have a lot of output on the really top

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.760 
have a lot of output on the really top
end<00:06:11.130> I<00:06:11.340> do<00:06:11.730> sound<00:06:12.120> scratchy<00:06:12.600> than<00:06:13.200> that<00:06:13.320> reason

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
end I do sound scratchy than that reason

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.550 
end I do sound scratchy than that reason
but<00:06:14.250> also<00:06:14.400> I<00:06:14.880> put<00:06:15.240> a<00:06:15.270> little<00:06:15.450> choke<00:06:15.810> on<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.200> to

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
but also I put a little choke on it to

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.610 
but also I put a little choke on it to
also<00:06:16.940> make<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:18.120> roll<00:06:18.480> off<00:06:18.510> just<00:06:19.320> the<00:06:19.440> right

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
also make it roll off just the right

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.980 
also make it roll off just the right
amounts<00:06:20.070> that<00:06:20.190> sounds<00:06:20.580> more<00:06:20.850> like<00:06:20.910> a<00:06:21.150> coiled

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
amounts that sounds more like a coiled

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.680 
amounts that sounds more like a coiled
tweeter<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.160> you<00:06:23.700> don't<00:06:23.910> get<00:06:24.060> that<00:06:24.120> scratchy

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
tweeter and you don't get that scratchy

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.630 
tweeter and you don't get that scratchy
sound<00:06:25.080> because<00:06:25.380> it<00:06:25.440> doesn't<00:06:25.710> go<00:06:25.800> high<00:06:26.070> up<00:06:26.100> so

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
sound because it doesn't go high up so

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.370 
sound because it doesn't go high up so
so<00:06:27.210> ridiculously

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
so ridiculously

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.240 
so ridiculously
staticky<00:06:29.190> high<00:06:29.430> so<00:06:29.940> listen<00:06:30.240> you<00:06:30.390> get<00:06:30.570> a<00:06:30.630> shins

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
staticky high so listen you get a shins

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.780 
staticky high so listen you get a shins
machine<00:06:32.250> Sam<00:06:32.640> SH<00:06:33.150> ing<00:06:33.980> shins<00:06:34.980> and<00:06:35.340> instead<00:06:35.730> of

machine Sam SH ing shins and instead of

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
a static hiss out

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.070 
a static hiss out
but<00:06:38.129> makes<00:06:38.339> all<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.909> difference<00:06:39.080> abilities

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
but makes all the difference abilities

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.070 
but makes all the difference abilities
it's<00:06:40.499> just<00:06:41.159> got<00:06:41.339> to<00:06:41.430> roll<00:06:41.610> off<00:06:41.969> the<00:06:42.240> rock<00:06:42.509> right

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
it's just got to roll off the rock right

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.079 
it's just got to roll off the rock right
amount<00:06:43.589> you<00:06:43.830> know<00:06:43.979> not<00:06:44.189> roll<00:06:44.490> off<00:06:44.520> too<00:06:44.879> much

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
amount you know not roll off too much

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.809 
amount you know not roll off too much
otherwise<00:06:45.479> it's<00:06:45.809> monthly<00:06:46.409> but<00:06:47.249> he<00:06:47.430> hit<00:06:47.639> the

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
that we could find the experiment was a

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.579 
that we could find the experiment was a
few<00:06:56.819> more<00:06:56.999> a<00:06:57.059> few<00:06:57.210> less<00:06:57.629> I'm<00:06:57.839> not<00:06:58.020> sure<00:06:58.229> when<00:06:58.469> an
