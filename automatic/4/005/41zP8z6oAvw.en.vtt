00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.080
 or today's tourist here alone 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.670
 commenting on a new minecraft video and 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.440
 well here you see we are on a map 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.000
 different from normal and mono I'm going to 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.519
 explain a little what has happened 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.500
 agreement then you will see I do not know why the 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.730
 map of the tropics not the typical one of 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.200
 this our house and all this in 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.810
 our tutorial things like 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.430
 always does not work or is thanks and that 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.960
 pass when I put it you will see then 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.610
 end of the video I will put it for example no 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.259
 good for you to see that I put it 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.000
 to load and stays like that for half an hour and 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.370
 final I shit on the bitch so good 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.480
 In conclusion, I have to do good 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.769
 have to use another map that already 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.960
 I had prepared for tests of 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.909
 driver's tutorials a few prototypes 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.800
 so to speak but well then this one 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.510
 will be let's say the map the tutorials and 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.010
 I will try to make the house again and now 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 build after this tutorial there 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.420
 but good first will come to be I'm going to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.069
 teach them what I had in mind today 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.989
 it would be how to make pistons and 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.969
 guys teach 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.289
 the uses of things that you can do 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.329
 sure that many already know it 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.859
 but there are others that forget those good 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.040
 there are many who will see it tonight 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:09.070
 he will have forgotten the pistons not how 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.390
 make them sticky not things like that 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.220
 but well here I am here to 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 teach you not how to do it so nothing 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.210
 I see them 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.740
 and good guys here you see that the room 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.120
 materials not in the bar that I have there 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.220
 down well, those will be the ones 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.790
 I will use jce to make these crystals 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.080
 and well let's show a little what 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.240
 I see how you have to put our 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.310
 materials to make the piston and ignores 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 of these pieces of good meat in the first 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.590
 good place before sound actually 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.010
 catch more more more of these when you put 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.900
 four wooden cups two wooden and one 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.250
 of each of these I want to remember then 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.250
 It was well done 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.310
 I'm missing one of wood in cachi cachi 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.800
 cachi the three of wood forgiveness 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 four of rock the sides the rector of in 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.240
 the middle and an iron ingot 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.240
 so perfect 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.429
 Here we have a clue and how you will see 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.679
 that it works we will need to have 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.849
 rest not and something that turns it on and good 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.099
 already speaking a little bit of interest to 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.620
 little things, not because many people 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.050
 has asked to make all more complicated 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.050
 Well then I'm going to fool good 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.480
 that I'm going to get into this world 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.890
 of the complicated things of banking does 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.420
 that is to say the rest while tacos that 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.690
 I will have to put to work but 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.150
 good as you will see you have to make a 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.010
 gesture and the circuit does not put something a 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.970
 button or a lever to turn it on but 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.390
 well, it does not have to be that far 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.569
 can not be here as well 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.810
 there he does not care 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.810
 like and comment because it is very 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.040
 important to me and that's how it is 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.900
 they do the pistons and now I'm going to 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.069
 teach how to do and they are sticky 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.770
 I feel a bit like a piston 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.750
 any not and seen blissfully it 's lines 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.850
 who are jumping around like they're 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.350
 nothing was going to happen but they are waiting for us 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.160
 that goes up to give them by the rear 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:10.050
 so let's go for this kid here 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.200
 good friend of mine we go with our people 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.200
 size 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.840
 smaller now smaller now 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.400
 smaller ones and not good is that here 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.620
 There are some lines that are not good but 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.360
 if it was survival you will find it 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.159
 difficult to find is the embolism that 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.650
 it is in unusual depths 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.879
 so that's costing a bit with a 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.670
 little luck you will find them but 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.010
 good to see and you will see that it is not easy 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.750
 I'm going to have these is line balls no 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.489
 let's use them to make the rag 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.930
 sticky and we just have to do 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.790
 this 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.349
 well here you do not see that I can not no 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.790
 I can manufacture things with the way that 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.799
 the creative mode so I'm going to go bad 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.540
 disenchanted charms my mother 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.480
 what a mess the table I work forgiving them 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.730
 we put the piston here and then the law 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.230
 you put it up and says we have 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.590
 in the piston sticky and good the piston 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.140
 sticky the basic use is for since 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.480
 has the word sticky in front 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.030
 as is logical that something stick 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.519
 forward obviously it's good we're going to 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.680
 turn it on again with a lever and 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.739
 you will see that it does the same thing as the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.349
 another but it simply has the other as 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.019
 adhered to it and how is the lever 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.350
 she is happy 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.880
 here to say that I'm from 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.760
 then we put it here in any 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.740
 Instead away and put whatever is 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.750
 pasted we can paste anything like 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.750
 this we can paste up another piston 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.169
 there you see that by doing this they open 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.470
 many opportunities not things like that we go 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.200
 Let's see 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.000
 this is very interesting testing physical 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.090
 with his for that is that here so that 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.950
 hit would have to do something else 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.880
 come on let's make super circuits 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.800
 professionals I am bad but good I think 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.180
 that this one is wrong if it's wrong, sorry 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.510
 sorry for the matter 'to see should be 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:03.420
 A) Yes 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:05.160
 to take things and learn a little more 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.570
 professional with this kind of thing from 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.860
 rest but good that what has 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.360
 liked to like if you want more 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.130
 record tour as said or from another 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.900
 style and things that you want to learn 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.220
 say in the comments as always and 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.220
 good nothing sees you the next aunts
