process of you know trying to nurse her
back<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> health<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> tried

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to get her adopted at first because I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.039 
to get her adopted at first because I
didn't<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.150> any<00:01:06.299> money<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> time<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
didn't have any money at the time I

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.300 
didn't have any money at the time I
didn't<00:01:07.409> think<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.680> would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.890> able<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> take

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
didn't think I would be able to take

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.880 
didn't think I would be able to take
care<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> dog<00:01:08.900> but<00:01:09.900> she<00:01:10.140> ended<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.619> guess

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
care of a dog but she ended up I guess

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.130 
care of a dog but she ended up I guess
having<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.640> bad<00:01:11.820> trauma<00:01:12.330> from<00:01:12.659> when<00:01:12.840> she<00:01:12.869> was

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
having some bad trauma from when she was

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
having some bad trauma from when she was
on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> street<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.490> she<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.909> attacked

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
on the street and so she like attacked

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
on the street and so she like attacked
the<00:01:15.720> person<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> adopt<00:01:17.310> her

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the person that was going to adopt her

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.340 
the person that was going to adopt her
and<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.299> ended<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.570> being<00:01:18.750> stuck<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.049> this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
