00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.420
 [Music] 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.420
 [Applause] 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 we have in this turk step time 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 test euro premium 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 the first premium this year and then not 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 just a premium but by optiview 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.380
 implementation that means we use economical type 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.750
 to be precise we have to deal with 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 with a premium 460 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.510
 19 tons I 5 optiview 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.870
 that is, they have a number 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.269
 have taken saving measures 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.059
 soft a soft cruise control started 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.620
 That means something permanently full 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.120
 gas on the mountain goes by that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.250
 change beliefs 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.549
 we are mountains where you still have one below 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.549
 walk 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.200
 pavement garden 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.420
 the euro premium is perhaps one 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.550
 bit undergone when the runes 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 actually not that much anymore 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.680
 so a perfectly capable of sitting position 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.480
 send is for long driver maybe 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.340
 what on the tight side 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.930
 so all code group live this 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.850
 vehicle actually has everything from it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.780
 renault booklet and then means in it 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 case for enough 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.030
 I have a lot of buttons on the steering wheel 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.770
 I here the cruise control radio 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.180
 automatic gearbox 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.280
 of course the usual things like 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.230
 the wipers what all first one 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.220
 lots of clocks 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.220
 [Music] 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.149
 this renault actually has how 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.159
 is from an all that goes on say 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.710
 here is actually just the football and 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.179
 shift gearboxes but plan for it 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.329
 one about the operation is just still 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.789
 we found this stem better than with it 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.090
 what you are the drive or in the 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.789
 neutral but from the drive set with 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.200
 This click in the reverse as you according to 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.750
 drive him backwards so you want 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.360
 forward then a blow is enough to 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.700
 switch back to the windscreen 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.380
 even though that roll is still backwards 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.390
 so a lot more convenient than using the 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.380
 neutral fashion more to the reverse 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.819
 must 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.160
 as I said a compliment before we walk 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.940
 this simple operation of their 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.940
 automatic way 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.690
