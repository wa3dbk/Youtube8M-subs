 tabled their report and that any term 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.460
 no I think there is a group that has 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.690
 not yet deposited who are in the process of 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.340
 finalize I think it's the first 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.410
 governance group no but say 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.800
 they are going to introduce that 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.140
 today 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.670
 it might give me the world of my 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.400
 presence here as an artist but 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.479
 lucien of the economics finance theme 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.670
 productive sectors is explained by the fact that 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.710
 that I am also vice president of the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.680
 socoda that the Congolese society of 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.940
 copyright and neighboring rights and 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.770
 charge of the administration of finances 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.240
 and training 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.070
 I wanted to also make 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.360
 concrete proposals and which ones I 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.190
 made the inventory of facts by 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.740
 consequence was what we understood that 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.960
 the culture sailing by sight 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.369
 so we had to have it now 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.110
 give recommendations 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.610
 a good cultural policy to see 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.840
 all these policies have come together 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.030
 your in there you do not have 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.039
 the usual maybe how you have 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.950
 witnessed some contradictions between 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.570
 them for me personally 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.250
 this is the first time to attend 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.900
 sitting like it was every day in 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.600
 tie me who am really not 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.190
 used but I took a liking and here we go 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.910
 when it says they've been a little 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.650
 surprised at my intervention good I 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.870
 practically defended the cause of 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.880
 artists in all disciplines and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.739
 I brought recommendations from the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.480
 civil society virtually because 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.630
 we are close and the population and 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.390
 I believe that leaps before consultation 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.370
 would not be the same after that do not you 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
 not give a little bit more 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.900
 of ambition the ambitions god only knows 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.740
 in my performance in the introduction 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.860

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.120

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.670
 thematic governance democracy 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.950
 institutional reforms need 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.200
 believe that here too the little details 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.770
 who divides and opposition and majority have 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.720
