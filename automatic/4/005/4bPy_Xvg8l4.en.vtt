00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:20.900
 simon ammann is put with soaps on the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.579
 hiv and the images remind to write 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.930
 to be asked all and all well 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.829
 so what am I going to do in this 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.989
 video is that I'm just going 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.460
 give advice to people who 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.000
 have just begun with the 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.279
 makeup 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.110
 so it's rather stuck in everything 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.489
 case I 'm going to say that me anyway 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.039
 I wish I had 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.230
 before I can start to 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.820
 make up or even before that's before 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.810
 I can start to wear makeup so 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.610
 that's when her laces for the 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.710
 people who are newbies in the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.899
 makeup is not something that 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.700
 I'm not really obsessed with 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.079
 people who are already working in the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.640
 makeup for example makeup artists 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.320
 frimas who want to get into the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.239
 freelance makeup that's really 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.220
 for people who have just come 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.030
 to start applying makeup 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.590
 this the guides then storage the first 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.570
 things that I recommend when 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.700
 someone wants to start putting some 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.119
 makeup is firstly to buy 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.290
 a makeup base and buy a 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.939
 makeup remover for me that's it 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.630
 really the two things that are very 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.459
 important 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.020
 so firstly actually the basis of 

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:19.819
 makeup is very important because 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.560
 that it will help to give you a 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.689
 finished that is much more perfect 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.729
 a lot more 10 is also okay 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.100
 to prevent the makeup of 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.029
 penetrate below the skin so 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.770
 it's true that there are certain people 

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:33.259
 who live makeup without 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.939
 as much put a base maybe that 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.560
 you do not see the difference but in 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.689
 five years in ten years you do not know 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.920
 how will your skin react to that so 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.319
 for me it's really very important 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.340
 to really have a base is actually 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.810
 which is good also with bases 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.490
 as I said is that you can 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.200
 have bases that are for all 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.630
 skin types so already session little 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.279
 no matter what your skin type 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.380
 you will find a base that 

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.639
 fits your skin I give you a 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.270
 example reason for people who 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.919
 have oily skin 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.310
 you are going to have bases that are 

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:02.929
 matifying bases that will minimize 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.700
 ports for people who is 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.139
 we will say a term 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.300
 we will have a battery and light 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.979
 for people who find that 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.650
 do not have a tennis court or are going to have 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.170
 slippery foundations for people who 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.520
 have father pigments problems 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.530
 you can have bases that are 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.150
 correctives of which you can really 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.010
 as I said to have less than just one 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.840
 base that will match your type of 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.239
 skin but also bases that can 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.880
 match the problems you have 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.500
 so that's for the basics and the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.970
 dematic secondly I spent a 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.709
 dowser so most of the time when 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.660
 we start making make-ups in 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.709
 hard to draw eyebrows in me 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.270
 what I would advise you was 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.150
 just started drawing your 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.380
 eyebrows with a pencil for eyebrows or 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.910
 even sometimes there are people who 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.349
 use pencils that are made 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.910
 for lips or that are made for 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.709
 eyes and draw their eyebrows 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.120
 so with me too at the beginning I want 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.299
 say but man and now times he 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.739
 is always developing to associate with the 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.269
 pencils too many students or with your 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.980
 pencils for the eyes or even sometimes 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.430
 with eyebrows it depends on my 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.290
 mood 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.720
 but now I would advise 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.530
 to use a pencil instead of using 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.049
 we're going to say an eyebrow gel or a 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.950
 cream associated with the pencil in my opinion 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.250
 I think we still have a lot 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.049
 more control over the coop the quantity 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.090
 in fact of products that in May and also 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.730
 we still tend to better 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.769
 master made the route when coming 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.910
 to just start makeup or 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.989
 of things you can do to 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.060
 to draw your eyebrows that's all 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.769
 simply use an eyeshadow 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.880
 and when you go to use makeup 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.840
 eyelids most of the time for 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.670
 draw your eyebrows 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.260
 it's a lot easier and that too 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.260
 will give you an effect that is a lot 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.820
 more natural for my taste so a lot 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.130
 used an eye shadow and at the level 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.989
 colours 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.470
 I advise you not to draw or 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.239
 on site with a colored pencil james 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.070
 blake ie intense black 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.530
 if you really want to give an effect 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.530
 natural confesses his style there is nobody 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.330
 who is coming 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.240
 with colored eyebrows john blake 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.950
 ie black black margin the black 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.630
 like looking but how then no 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.370
 used to be dumars finally for the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.240
 people of color be brown 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.340
 dark brown or light brown 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.400
 dark brown for people who are 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.380
 no color or light brown but 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.030
 really avoid the colors blake james 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.560
 for your eyebrows for pots of 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.970
 looks in any case natural or if it's 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.040
 not really you who want that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.470
 really eccentric because 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.190
 it's going to make a killer and so and others 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.720
 things too that I could you 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.610
 advise if you ever have trouble 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.440
 keep your eyebrows in place now 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.730
 what is good is that many 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.140
 companies that are supposed to have 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.840
 eyebrow genes in young people to 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.580
 eyebrows it's just 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.620
 young transparent most of the time 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.870
 where it can be fun too and it's going 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.120
 simply help you keep your 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.340
 eyebrows in place so at mcs already has the 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.500
 source he and they also have a stick 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.180
 circus is made for the eyebrows and 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.979
 if you do not want to invest I 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.660
 mean in something that is going 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.169
 cost as much as mac you can everything 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.820
 it just actually used gemey 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.830
 maybelline with transparent mascaras 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.360
 after that with regard to the eyes the 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.550
 advice i can give you cd 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.020
 firstly have a base of makeup to 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.250
 eyelids so most of the time I 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.870
 do not know if you noticed we can 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.310
 apply an eyeshadow and then 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.419
 then one hour two hours later we have 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.979
 the impression that they left them themselves 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.690
 at the end of the day it feels like 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.160
 that the color has changed enormously 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.210
 when in fact the eyeshadow 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.950
 will not only allow you to 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.530
 keep the bauxite color and keep 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.000
 the eyeshadow on your eyes during the 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.320
 months on your mobile eyelid during 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.310
 hear it so the first of things 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.930
 it's having a base 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.039
 and the other thing too that I could 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.530
 to pass me in relation to the eyes 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.000
 to have a transition color so 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.039
 a transition color blush to 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.419
 eyelids actually these are colors 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.070
 most of the time like is in the 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.570
 hollow of the eye and it's colors 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.490
 that makes the transition between 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.229
 the color that is applied on the 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.240
 eyelid and the color 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.289
 apply soo blood from the eyebrow sometimes 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.820
 I do not know if you noticed 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.560
 we can make makeup looks 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.970
 here is another color in the middle 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.160
 it's another is also another 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.810
 manna just feels that not everything 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.070
 not go together there is something that 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.820
 will actually talk about the colors of 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.830
 transition 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.410
 really come precisely to help 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.010
 given a mix that is much more vague 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:07.990
 stays a lot much more perfect on 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.680
 will say so that's for the eyes 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.180
 the other thing that I could you 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.280
 advise in relation to the eyes it is 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.560
 of course to have an eyeliner and a 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.020
 mascara to be able to emphasize again 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.610
 the more wolves you will do with 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.680
 the eyes and as for the makeup 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.090
 eyelids of which there are several brands 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.550
 who make eyeshadow that are 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.290
 of very good quality and me what I 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.820
 would advise you to parameter ratio of 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.590
 start with the farc or we'll go 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.450
 say and with 2 makou from other companies 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.280
 it's investing in pallets like 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.840
 this one so most of the time it's 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.790
 companies such as viège pass 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.710
 mellick i like to be the links down and 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.960
 where you can simply find 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.880
 color palettes like that which 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.320
 are pigments that are quite pigmented 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.720
 to do some work or makeup 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.060
 and are a very good value for money 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.070
 and most of the time and in colors 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.920
 which are color is in colors of 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.990
 colors that are colorful 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.170
 there are colors that are bright 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.400
 yes that's it or neutral colors and 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.300
 colors that you can use a 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.950
 your eyebrows 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.140
 so most of the time you can 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.600
 find it's not lexical like I said to 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.340
 very good price and I think there are some 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.170
 still many more than 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.220
 sites that book in France enormously 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.480
 so that's what I tell you 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.650
 would advise regarding blushes to 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.510
 eyelids palettes 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.340
 if you do not know if you do not master 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.760
 not really yet the theory of 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.320
 colors 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.060
 ie what color goes with 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.440
 some colors it's really 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.590
 to invest in that because you can 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.510
 practice and also consume choose a 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.190
 led by a stone what I recommend 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.780
 even if watching videos on 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.750
 youtube so that is keeping 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.730
 people who have acquired we will say 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.160
 even founded us that you would like to do 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.770
 or who simply in the same 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.349
 training that concerns you 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.050
 and know what will you be able to go 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:48.910
 so not only go and that's it 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.620
 eyeshadow you will buy yourself 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.180
 go buy some products that you 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.770
 do not know how to use 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.289
 So here it is, it really happened to me 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.639
 at the beginning of the year to buy a lot of 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:59.560
 products do not have a lot of products 

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:01.150
 but to buy some products that I 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.919
 did not know at all where you used 

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.590
 so take the time to inform yourself 

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:07.000
 on some products that you 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.229
 interest before going to buy them 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.479
 to find out how are you 

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:21.300
 go use them so that's what 

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:21.300
 accounts
