00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.430
 Hello, today I want to show 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.769
 photo album 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.769
 wedding handicrafts that made 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.340
 custom made for white blue wedding here 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.670
 album on rings 1 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.490
 218 by 20 centimeters album includes 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.150
 yourself 48 photos format 9 to 13 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.110
 centimeters inside 5 sheets can be seen and 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.939
 cover on bookends that also have 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.410
 place for photography so now 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.540
 let's see a little more of it inside 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.850
 first spread in the whole album I 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.559
 used a variety of decorative 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.080
 details here and cutting and chipboard and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.510
 polymer clay figurines and even 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.090
 stamps and prints be on whose board is 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.300
 further spread and here's the lace there still 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.730
 it was seen in general very different 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.110
 Jewelry tried to use in 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.270
 as photo holders 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.670
 used as an anchor and yourself 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.199
 directly entry holders so 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.300
 and different fixture here 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.710
 for example, here is such a way 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.080
 holds a clamshell with photos 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.899
 either I have this waxed cord 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.740
 Now let's see more here waxed 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:24.209
 the cord is here too, so the form of the anchor is made 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.810
 so further spread 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:34.270
 here we have anchors as expected 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.670
 these are plastic figures here 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.560
 waxed cord 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.759
 the anchors here from stamping are also manual 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.000
 work chipboard you 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:52.410
 details for swans clay figurines 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.770
 and the last turn 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:00.390
 here, too, the same decorations instead 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.720
 an anchor that's so wooden than the port 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.860
 I got such an album 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.709
 ring construction suggests 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.260
 I will say some instability 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.110
 album but this is such a feature 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.830
 albums on rings in general they 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.950
 Looks pretty nice to me. 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.960
