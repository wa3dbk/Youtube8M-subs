 I care and today we are going to do tuto 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:12.440
 Indian of 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.820
 re basket 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.530
 if it's something that I just invented 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.040
 Y 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.670
 will be about things to do with network 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.130
 this applies 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.320
 so 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.429
 because I think I have it too high 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.429
 I do not know does not fix me 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.810
 I have not appeared here just is , 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.810
 where I do not want 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.800
 good is needed 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.190
 any gossip or block 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.149
 any you want 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.149
 needed 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.600
 redstone torch rather the button 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.400
 sorry button 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 pressure plates 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.560
 grows this clearly what 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.420
 an iron door clearly 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.830
 sand and tnt that is that my friend 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.180
 and what we will do and you may ask 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.040
 This looks like a knife 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.040
 let's go to this like this 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.730
 to see has to be a good square a 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.260
 square a rectangle like this 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.260
 that is and long what you want 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.800
 and it's good we'll decorate it like that 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.750
 I have done something for someone well 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.410
 now the iron gate is put here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.410
 and now 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.640
 fuck 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.569
 and now if it gets that way 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.569
 and now I know 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.580
 giant funny 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:31.690
 with giant 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.690
 this will take me quite a while 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.410
 OK 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.410
 It has to be a huge hole 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.450
 because if you do not do it big the tnt 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.450
 destroyed 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.470
 and if you want to do it in your way 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.540
 creative it will be better than you have 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.510
 bought 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.120
 and if you do not do it in a creative way, 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.640
 with syriana 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.909
 cover the entire wall with obsidian and 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.909
 it has been given 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.200
 Now what we're going to do is going to be 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.200
 this 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.989
 ok let's do this 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.150
 you have it here 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.430
 having to dance 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.800
 I put it 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.860
 to make a joke on someone is 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.350
 all right 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.980
 and now 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.980
 A) Yes 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.290
 so that no 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.060
 so he does not do anything weird or for 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.470
 I do not suspect it is better that you put 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.420
 All the sand is the best 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.720
 but if it does not become possible all of 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.720
 sand 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.740
 we'll cover this but let's go I do 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.740
 over here why 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.620
 that is the best way to explain yourself to 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.980
 see we are going to put networks this 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.980
 here 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.110
 now we put a pressure plate here 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.979
 what will make this easy 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.630
 I do not know why we will see if it works itself 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.630
 do not 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.570
 but you say a plate to paradise look 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.570
 how nice 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:02.930
 and there's a great cut to go to 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.820
 paradise look is this teach the door 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.820
 so this will fall 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.820
 and good 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.390
 let's do one thing I'm going to stop the 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.490
 video here and I show you the next thing 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.120
 I'm going to do van 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:27.680
 hello guys we're back here 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:30.380
 and look, I was wrong it did not work 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.550
 I think what I'm going to do, I think the 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.550
 best way to do this 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.410
 well this like this and this way below this 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.410
 is latent 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.460
 I think that's going to be fine 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.360
 I have not checked this is going to be the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.360
 first time we do 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.800
 and well let's try it 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:13.050
 I like this mist I do not know why I 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.050

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.380
