00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.319 

and<00:01:41.860> for<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.950> last<00:01:43.159> technique<00:01:43.579> we<00:01:43.909> have<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.149> B

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
and for the last technique we have the B

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.300 
and for the last technique we have the B
reversal<00:01:44.869> think<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:45.740> as<00:01:45.890> kind<00:01:46.070> of<00:01:46.189> an

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
reversal think of it as kind of an

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.460 
reversal think of it as kind of an
aerial<00:01:46.729> pivot<00:01:47.060> when<00:01:47.930> you're<00:01:48.079> in<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.289> air

perform<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.070> neutral<00:01:49.460> B<00:01:49.610> attack<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:50.119> at<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
perform a neutral B attack and at the
