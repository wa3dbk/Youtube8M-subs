you'll<00:01:48.479> still<00:01:48.660> have<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> lot<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.050> fun<00:01:49.289> playing

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
you'll still have a lot of fun playing

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.199 
you'll still have a lot of fun playing
through<00:01:49.800> this<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.220> magica<00:01:50.640> itself<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
through this because magica itself is

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.389 
through this because magica itself is
still<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.630> hell<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.020> game<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.800> five<00:01:53.099> bucks

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
still one hell of a game but five bucks

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.370 
still one hell of a game but five bucks
for<00:01:53.610> 20<00:01:53.910> to<00:01:54.000> 30<00:01:54.149> minutes<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.630> content<00:01:54.810> really

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
for 20 to 30 minutes of content really

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
for 20 to 30 minutes of content really
seems<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.679> overkill<00:01:56.119> considering<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.209> full

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
seems like overkill considering the full

seems like overkill considering the full
game<00:01:57.599> itself<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:58.110> only<00:01:58.349> ten<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:59.580> have

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
game itself was only ten I would have

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.160 
game itself was only ten I would have
preferred<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.239> scenario<00:02:00.690> challenge<00:02:01.050> p

a<00:02:01.200> series<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> missions<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.340> mini

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
a series of missions like a mini

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.059 
a series of missions like a mini
campaign<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> idea<00:02:04.289> of<00:02:04.470> mixing<00:02:04.649> time

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
campaign I like the idea of mixing time

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.620 
campaign I like the idea of mixing time
periods<00:02:05.459> and<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.670> worked<00:02:05.819> out<00:02:05.970> really<00:02:06.030> well<00:02:06.300> as

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
periods and it worked out really well as

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.240 
periods and it worked out really well as
much<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.020> content<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.530> pretty<00:02:07.770> funny<00:02:08.009> but

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
much of the content is pretty funny but

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.070 
much of the content is pretty funny but
for<00:02:08.849> half<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.179> price<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.660> original<00:02:10.050> game

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

I<00:02:10.380> was<00:02:10.530> expecting<00:02:10.830> something<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.489> bit<00:02:11.700> beefier

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
I was expecting something a bit beefier

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.180 
I was expecting something a bit beefier
I<00:02:12.450> think<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.260> would<00:02:13.410> have<00:02:13.470> rather<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.950> played

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
I think I would have rather just played

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.440 
I think I would have rather just played
through<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> original<00:02:14.819> campaign<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.330> gain
