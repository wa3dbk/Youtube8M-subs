00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.529
 good're all here as they are believe 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.149
 and we will bring the good details 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.080
 on the rim of the carnevale 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:16.630
 and is that you already know this champion that 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.110
 you will have not seen it is worth it because 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.579
 chosen or less and that is that you have 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.830
 a lot takes off the excess right now 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.980
 between the season everything was very very 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.769
 Decent pretty expensive or did not die not 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.320
 he was dying not to back but good now 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.239
 same this a little bit lost and that 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.150
 changed the bathrooms is meat one of his 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.809
 biggest drawback was that he smoked mana 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.540
 in note he made tobacco and put them together 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.580
 with sisters and he smoked it 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.290
 they will change what you put down the cost 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.750
 of all the skills more or 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.420
 least of all sailing that was horrible 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.600
 I did not put it as planned 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.390
 streaming that me more alone w then the one of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.650
 maceo the forgiveness then wy the people 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.650
 I did not touch this that they force me 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.630
 so that thing week reduced then 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.630
 think 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 put the passive will remain the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.190
 same as basic attacks reduce the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.510
 anything's cool that ability 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.710
 I like it a lot again what it's going to 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.320
 do is 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.490
 High-speed attack is worth 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.770
 who speaks three times 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.440
 I do not know how much speed attacks were but 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.410
 good 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.120
 and in oral in chalk slows down something else 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.870
 that we will see now later 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.040
 and well the w is going to give speed of 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.040
 additional movement 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.610
 basically dra w we have some 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.650
 extra details and is that the w 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.180
 see reduced its cooling from 18 to 14 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.370
 seconds 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.980
 and the speed of movement is going to be 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:07.550
 increased from 15 to 23 and now that 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.550
 will have 30 to 50 forgiveness 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 also the w goes with a larger shield 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.920
 since it 's meat now it's not going to heal 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.920
 hitting as before 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.319
 the spleen how it works is worth the w 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.870
 you use and for three seconds goes 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.990
 increasing your movement speed and 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.840
 then for three seconds he keeps that 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.010
 maximum speed of movement is worth 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.220
 as a sprint 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.069
 the thirst is meat now is going to have a 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.069
 slowdown from 40 to 60 percent 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:48.109
 for three seconds 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.109
 and good has an effect similar to the 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.209
 grass and good what's going to continue is going 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.920
 leave a mark and the next hit 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.130
 slowed down 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.670
 then the last t 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.240
 they will give as an opportunity to you 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.800
 escape that they mean but I do not know or 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.190
 be I think the ultimate was fine 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.860
 because you have to risk a 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.860
 approach the carriage to whoever is enemy 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.450
 so I do not know how they'll leave it but good 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.580
 in order to see how he leaves the thing to which 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.960
 know more things because I'll say it I hope 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.930
 that you liked there is no favorite 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.320
 then little things help a lot so 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.510
 nothing that I have a numerous grain so 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.060
 we look good then what things I am 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.550
 tweet years above that mention crane 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.550
 come see you now
