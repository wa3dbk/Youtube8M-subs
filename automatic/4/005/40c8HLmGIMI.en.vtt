00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.350 
the water to the material and as you can
see<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.570> water<00:02:15.780> does<00:02:16.200> not<00:02:16.440> penetrate<00:02:17.360> so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
see the water does not penetrate so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.080 
see the water does not penetrate so
therefore<00:02:18.600> we're<00:02:19.560> using<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.730> weatherproof

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
therefore we're using the weatherproof

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.110 
therefore we're using the weatherproof
to<00:02:22.020> make<00:02:22.230> sure<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.520> product<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.030> you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
to make sure that the product that you

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460 
to make sure that the product that you
put<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.720> hair<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.260> beautiful

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
put on the hair and that beautiful

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.220 
put on the hair and that beautiful
design<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.700> you've<00:02:26.910> created<00:02:27.230> maintains

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
design that you've created maintains

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.040 
design that you've created maintains
that<00:02:28.470> beautiful<00:02:28.950> volume<00:02:29.130> all<00:02:29.580> day<00:02:29.850> long<00:02:30.060> it's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
that beautiful volume all day long it's

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.820 
that beautiful volume all day long it's
still<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:32.550> actual<00:02:33.090> product<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.290> as<00:02:34.650> you

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
still on the actual product and as you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.100 
still on the actual product and as you
can<00:02:35.010> see<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.790> very<00:02:35.880> resistant<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.930> will

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
can see it is very resistant it will

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.160 
can see it is very resistant it will
roll<00:02:37.350> right<00:02:37.620> off<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.280> product<00:02:39.170> so

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
roll right off of the product so

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.870 
roll right off of the product so
therefore<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.010> client<00:02:41.460> is<00:02:41.580> going<00:02:41.760> to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
therefore the client is going to

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.750 
therefore the client is going to
maintain<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.840> design<00:02:43.260> all<00:02:43.620> day<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> next

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
maintain that design all day so the next

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.370

and use weatherproof all over the design

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.490 
and use weatherproof all over the design
