00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.530
 made myself more stone tools 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.980

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.980

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.400
 right away 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.519

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.519
 flour 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.990
 all works of action works a little 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.670
 to 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.180

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.360
 that you cannot provide it though you 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.360
 fall off then 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.349
 this way we will go to the mine to mine 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.930
 coal or iron and stone and everything 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.090

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.900
 mine actually yes it happens that everything is usually 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.900
 for a moment 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.500
 So 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.470
 where all gather 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.910
 flying plane

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:25.370
 saplings will attack here 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.370
 we are together here 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.640

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.290
 pick up seedlings 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.890

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.310

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.110

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.440
 So 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 ooo 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.370

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.160
 okay guy it even with go just 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:42.280
 down due not be a good deed 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.280
 which is called go down 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.640
 and look for tropical tree seedlings 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:54.370
 class classes in Poland class classes 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.470
 part none my friends are not but not 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.720
 I'll talk later now it's the most important thing 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:04.060
 does it deliver our cover well as a cover 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:15.300
 I am not by knowledge and I will know the roof 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:15.300
 just generally such here you think. 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:24.920
 that green is still useful in any way 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:27.590
 the land we will have on the tree will be 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.130
 it has grown we polyubas 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.130
 will come in handy 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.540
 So 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.540
 but so what we do 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.030
 and more 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:51.250
 because well here's a hole to do though 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.250
 could this same hole 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.090
 i'm bad 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:21.969
 we do not need and now I will undress 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.969
 only or not 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.510
 I do not think yet I will not do 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:38.409
 why do steps in there do 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.409
 really what to go through 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.319
 let it seem deadlocked 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.520
 but Cuban 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:43.400
 well, I won't finish it 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.330
 did the steps it seems it is quite 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.360
 everything is normal so long as all of el me 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.310
 camino 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.630
 network if so put likes to 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:58.460
 more passing 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:08:04.620
 so that our 7 tell friends faster 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:08.300
 and of course realize 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.300
 and ourselves will recommend all the luck 

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.100
