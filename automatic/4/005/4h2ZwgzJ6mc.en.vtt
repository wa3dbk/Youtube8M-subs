00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.900
 I have tried to translate a message from 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160
 future and that we want to work for 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.180
 save the season 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.410
 let's talk about the present and we're going to 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.029
 saving the present we can have 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.090
 future if we are not able to work 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.680
 in the present certainly difficult 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.570
 we will have the future then what there is 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.880
 What to do is work at the moment 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.720
 the present go step by step there is a margin 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.910
 of tranquility but that's how they're going to go 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.420
 speaking all the parties involved the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.039
 directive 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.589
 Antonio Hidalgo and then the 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.000
 administrators each will explain the 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.559
 part that corresponds feelings 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.969
 Positive, of course, thanks to 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.000
 the family of the mayor 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.839
 Well, the truth is that it has been 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.670
 positive 100% 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.339
 I believe that Salamanca deserved it and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.520
 Well, everything has been positive 100% 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.230
 of orio 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.730
 that we can say we 're going to start 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.740
 talk about football let's start now 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.540
 stop talking about money directives 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.260
 and tobacco to start and see the future of 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.550
 Salamanca and I will think about who plays 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.950
 who does not play coach what is it 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.400
 important and makes the hobby enjoy 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.440
 what do you need to forget about 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.000
 great comments and things of these that 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.760
 we are I think that negative for all 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.890
 good are terms that we have put of 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.050
 that now we are going to think about the moment 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.760
 this year and how he has done very well to be 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.100
 mayor is very important that the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.930
 quiet arrive and good the deadlines 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.759
 go see little by little and leave 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.860
 assuming let's think on Sunday 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.800
 we started winning in transmitted 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.280
 illusion people as effectively they 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.930
 has given us a certain important 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.430
 certainty that this is how it will be 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.140
 logically we are going to wait 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.290
 although there are still things to be done that 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.840
 logically in these successive days then 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.610
 will be specified and will be ensured so that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.619
 really this is so therefore in 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.149
 principle of course the sports union 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.990
 Salamanca is not going to liquidate and 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.009
 let's hope as it has already been said before 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.970
 endure all season that surely 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.830
 yes and good 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.990
 place that a project can be proposed 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.960
 of the future through an agreement in its 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.310
 day and really become viable to what 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.140
 long time good now 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.090
 we are already in a phase there will be ten 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.140
 technical meetings and that you can talk 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.180
 as my partner said 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.130
 the skill of this season but that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.260
 we have to focus all that there is 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.000
 to get to June 30 without any 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.570
 problem if that as well has said the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.760
 mayor gets to talk about the future 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.500
 would already be against security well the endorsement 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.180
 it does not leave me parked it has already been 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.860
 parked I think it's a subject that does not 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.080
 let's talk more about the city council not 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.750
 can take care of washing by the 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.370
 circumstances that is unfeasible and for 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.230
 so studying is spoken and what 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.319
 we leave there so we will not leave 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.560
 parked the word no more carbon 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.019
 I think we're going to help save the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.150
 season we're going to be there we're going to 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.650
 ensure that the season knows not to 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.139
 our help only because we understand 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.629
 well he has told the mayor that they have 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.819
 that involve companies and that they have to 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.799
 get involved in a lot more people and that 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.109
 also make more partners for the good of the 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.939
 union and for the future of the union 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.560
 really the main ones the important thing 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.750
 is to save this season if this 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.639
 season we save it I repeat to the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.950
 principle there are many possibilities of 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.659
 that we arrive that we 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.000
 we are there that we who have the 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.549
 club well as you always know with the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.650
 help from Jorge Mendez who would be involved 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.040
 with the city of Cali with the help of 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.159
 ronaldo and with someone else I repeat we have 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.489
 to convey that you have to support between 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:39.010
 all until 30 June and if that does not 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.719
 we are able to get it from 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.120
 that moment we would speak in other languages 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.530
 in the next season I think that 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.329
 until June 30 will not contribute 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.889
 nothing will not do anything until 30 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.019
 June is going to be something that is going to 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.579
 standby there to see what we do and 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.949
 what we think and how is the present 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.610
 that does not mean that from 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.890
 now 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.380
 I'm a little too aware of 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.080
 How you are taking the club if 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.090
 They need the best in December 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 can bring a couple of players to 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.700
 support the team that is achieved and that 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.080
 come that I think it's a job too 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.950
 in positive so that everything goes well 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.950
 until July 30
