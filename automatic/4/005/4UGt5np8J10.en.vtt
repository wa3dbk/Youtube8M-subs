00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.189
 so we also play the suite of 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.469
 lucas adventures at second school 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.670
 day at school so that started on 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.250
 morning by a moment I have not the watch 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.100
 so I have a stomach ache for me 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.500
 means that the case is experiencing something 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 unpleasant comes message that his body 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.670
 sends him something that happens 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.630
 not good for him so I empty mans but 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.550
 what happens what is what 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 happened yesterday why are you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.699
 not feel good now why did you 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 stomach ache is the idea of ​​going to 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.320
 the school finally I ask him without this 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.030
 is an interrogation anyway I 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.620
 shows him my interest in his 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.940
 belly and I wish I could help him 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 so he explains to me in fact who has a 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.329
 little girl who was next to him in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.660
 class and that did not stop the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.210
 pushing and crying a lot and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.680
 that's it and it's very unpleasant for 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.030
 him that he even had tears 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.770
 to the eyes 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 I explain and finally I ask him then 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.300
 but what happens why 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.450
 this little girl she pushes you but 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.850
 I do not know that's the dirty thing 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.039
 bothering a lot of the casal m he was 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.740
 a little pushed back in his entrenchments 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.779
 dance we felt a little overgrown in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 his space not respected in his 

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:19.380
 limits that 's what about the harm to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.479
 belly in any case think about the level of 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.549
 intestines navel height that makes it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.939
 wrong it's a matter of managing 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.389
 limitations 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.009
 a question I also knew emotions 

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:30.659
 and so the emotion this little girl her 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.749
 crying it affects me enormously 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.049
 that he does not like and gold he had me 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.399
 already said he did not like an agreement or 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.079
 his children cry there I would have done 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.450
 a little parenthesis with respect to these 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.039
 difficulties that some children or 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.950
 maybe all I do not go anyway 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.650
 some certainly to part with 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.570
 their parents 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.220
 moment when their dad then I lived 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.610
 this difficulty of separation with the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.040
 case when he went on a first day 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.270
 internship at circus school 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.410
 the first day it was the drama I 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.190
 would say that he did not want to let me go 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.380
 yelled the auction and finally ben I 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.260
 entrusts them to the host who sees there 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:24.190
 I felt a caring person and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.930
 I left to fall in tears 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.860
 behind the door 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.959
 so what I understood at that moment 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.730
 I knew interactively but I did 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.690
 including 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.320
 emotionally it's actually lucas 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.709
 felt bad difficulty separating me from 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.740
 him 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:49.040
 in fact what he showed me was my 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.250
 hardly to me he was the reflection of his and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.019
 so he feels that for his parent whose 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.670
 the child feels that for his parent it is 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:01.489
 difficult the separation is so there is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.670
 something that goes on the order of 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.180
 there is a problem it's not normal it's okay 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.180
 not behave well 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.790
 finally I feel abandoned if even if 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.520
 the parent has himself experienced a difficulty 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.670
 in terms of abandoning separation from this 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.620
 found ourselves isolated from the island will 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.690
 reproduce that with his child and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.340
 the child will feel it and so that's it 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.959
 who express it the child is actually 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.450
 not his difficulty separating 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.489
 but the difficulty of adults to get 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.010
 then separate the advice that we give 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.349
 often parents was the shortest 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.090
 possible the first day at school I 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.850
 understand that in a way but 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.340
 on the other hand I invite parents who 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.810
 live this kind of situation to go 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.709
 see how it affects them 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.330
 what it awakens in them a 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.980
 difficulty getting separated there all from 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.870
 after me it reminds me of neurons 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.810
 mirrors that were discovered in 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.269
 obsessed by some giacomo rizzo 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.400
 the ati that actually explains we have 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.620
 neurons that make that when 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.549
 someone finally lives does something 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.470
 or an emotion 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:11.299
 we feel it we feel it is the 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.310
 neurons of empathy let's say and 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.789
 so low and do not render are in full 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.229
 action has it so what I have him 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.150
 asked but why do you think the 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.510
 little girl what she is what she has 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.450
 afraid then they had free because 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.160
 his dad and his mom are not there ah yes 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.590
 okay and so she's having trouble bah 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.720
 yes and so I asked but what is it 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.900
 that you could do 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.039
 Well, I do not know what's difficult 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.350
 what I tried to do with him 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.500
 scene make him understand to us 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.090
 explain that if the little girl she 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.200
 cries and she thumbs because 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.789
 it's because she does not feel well 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.560
 it's because she herself has a 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.970
 emotion something she she 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.770
 lives badly and so she does not 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.100
 against him that she does not do it on purpose 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.780
 she does not want to annoy him so 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.020
 I will propose rather low what is this 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.050
 that you think to propose to him your friendship 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.000
 to be take near her and if that's 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.080
 not possible for you but at this moment 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.300
 there you may be able to ask 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.590
 the teacher to change places or 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.550
 td 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.130
 So when it happens you see it here 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.550
 looked reassured with that and the pain of 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.860
 belly 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.650
 actually disappeared in the minute that has 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.400
 followed then we went to school 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.840
 and it went well his daddy went 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.860
 pick it up in the afternoon 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.810
 and well everything went very well 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.660
 the teacher had a lot of lodges 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.510
 1000 km I 'll talk about it again at a 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.510
 next little one who has goodbye soon
