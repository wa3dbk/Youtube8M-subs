00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.160
Hi, my name is Enric Rovira I'm a chocolatier and my work consists in making things out of chocolate

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.840
from small candy to big chocolate pieces.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.589
I started in 1993,

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.999
my father was a pastry chef, actually I started at my dad´s bakery in Barcelona

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.839
we elaborate many types of chocolates, trying to look for...

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.650
to bring some novelty to the world of chocolate, ever since we started

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.149
we started by making innovative Turrons, with different shapes,

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.669
wanting to break the conventions that existed at the time

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.769
Later we also made products very emblematic of Barcelona

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.690
we make tablets inspired by the tiles that pave the city

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.170
designed by Gaudí, Puig i Cadafalch

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.450
other elements also like the "trancadís" that one can see in the modernist areas

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.130
designed by Gaudí and other architects of that time

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.330
And maybe the element that distinguishes us more is the concept,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.550
to add the element of concept to the world of chocolates

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.229
There are products like for instance the planetarium that many people know

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.830
It´s a box of chocolates in which every single chocolate is a planet of the solar system

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.400
Another product is the Palindrome. It´s an elongated chocolate box

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.650
containing chocolates of different colors

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.850
with the ones from both extremities being white and being gradually darker until the dark one in the middle.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.220
Another example of those products could be

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.009
"Around the globe in chocolates"

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.000
Around the world in chocolates is a series of five small chocolate boxes

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.410
with each box being made with an ingredient coming specifically from one continent

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.800
Coffee for Africa, Rice for Asia,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.300
almonds for Europe, sunflower seeds for America

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.710
and Macadamia nuts for Oceania

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.060
Another product we developped was virtual chocolates

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.170
which may be our bolder example

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.000
that we don't produce anymore, and they were chocolates that were only meant to be smelled

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.960
They were some shapes, some metallic capsules shaped as chocolates,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.540
through which we wanted people to enjoy chocolate

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.490
 exclusively via their sense of smell.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.909
This was something temporary

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.960
that at the time was hard to understand

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.840
but I'm very glad we did this, this is one of those things that mark

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.960
the history of our company, and also, I believe, the history of chocolate

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.770
Another product which we can talk about, which is very well known to the public

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.690
is the gastronomic series, those are chocolates that come in small

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.200
colorful boxes which are like the flavor palette of Enric Rovira

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.269
Ranging from classical products like almonds, hazelnuts, or coffee

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.450
to more evolved products like corn

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.309
with a pinch of salt, ginger, and even bacon, with a

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.140
crunchy fried pork skin

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.699
coated with chocolate, this was also one of

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.120
the very original products we made

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.569
apart from all of those standard products

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.979
we also make seasonal products

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.510
as I mentioned before, like christmas turrons

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.939
and every year, we look for new ways to make easter eggs

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:01.939
One of the last things we did was barretina eggs, like the tip of a barretina hat.
This is the egg we designed this year.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.489
For me it is, obviously a great honour to be part of the team that does this online course

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.599
of Science and Cooking in Harvard

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.170
I'm very interested in going in depth with what we do every day

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.879
We can only improve the quality of our products, the texture of chocolate truffles or the crispiness of a chocolate

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.339
if we know

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:23.659
why they occur and what can go wrong

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.069
then we could manage to improve our quality

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.719
Our company, Enric Rovira

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.979
is located in Castellbell i el Vilar

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.689
We started in 1993

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:35.809
we have now about

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:38.499
twenty people working here over an area

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:39.780
of about

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.019
9000 square feet.

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.359
Castellbell i el Vilar is about 30 miles away from Barcelona, very close to Montserrat

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.919
When crafting a new product, we have some very marked guidelines about the design

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.879
the concept...

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.959
the flavors we want to experiment with

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.229
but in general, the conceptual ideas often occur

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.930
while having fun

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.129
By watching a movie you like

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.339
taking inspiration in the movie, or reading a book

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.289
or listening to a song...

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.409
Actually, we've made a product

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.749
inspired in the song "Imagine" by John Lennon

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:18.879
we've made a chocolate box ispired by the movie "2001, a space odyssey" by Stanley Kubrik

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:24.020
Therefore, having fun, eating a dish we really like, we sometimes get ideas

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.900
of flavors we want to transpose to the world of chocolate

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.280
and that is the creative process that we're using.
