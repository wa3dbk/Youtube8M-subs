00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
the grow tube is a physicist actually

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.460 
the grow tube is a physicist actually
designed<00:00:58.760> this<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.210> what<00:00:59.659> we<00:00:59.780> have<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.199> no

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
designed this and what we have is no

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.890 
designed this and what we have is no
light<00:01:00.830> dissipation<00:01:01.729> in<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:02.299> corners<00:01:02.690> of

light dissipation in the corners of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.990 
light dissipation in the corners of
course<00:01:03.170> because<00:01:03.440> there<00:01:03.650> are<00:01:03.799> no<00:01:04.010> corners<00:01:04.339> so

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
course because there are no corners so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.670 
course because there are no corners so
as<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.360> light<00:01:05.570> comes<00:01:05.600> off<00:01:06.080> your<00:01:06.320> lighting

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
as the light comes off your lighting

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.890 
as the light comes off your lighting
system<00:01:07.100> goes<00:01:07.340> perfectly<00:01:07.939> around<00:01:08.299> all<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.780> your

tent in this case the grow tube we're
going<00:01:14.120> to<00:01:14.180> talk<00:01:14.360> about<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.840> construction<00:01:15.200> of

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
going to talk about the construction of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.880 
going to talk about the construction of
the<00:01:16.130> internal<00:01:16.700> skeleton<00:01:17.390> it's<00:01:17.900> all<00:01:18.200> aluminum

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
the internal skeleton it's all aluminum

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.220 
the internal skeleton it's all aluminum
construction<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:20.120> we<00:01:20.210> have<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.360> very<00:01:20.660> special

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
construction and we have a very special

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.290 
construction and we have a very special
connection<00:01:21.260> system<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.370> actual<00:01:22.520> connect<00:01:23.120> in

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
connection system the actual connect in

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.600 
connection system the actual connect in
tight<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.870> they<00:01:24.350> have<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.610> spring-loaded

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
tight and they have a spring-loaded

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.700 
tight and they have a spring-loaded
holder<00:01:26.330> which<00:01:26.510> holds<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.020> tubes<00:01:27.260> together

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
holder which holds the tubes together

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.310 
holder which holds the tubes together
it's<00:01:28.340> all<00:01:28.580> basically<00:01:29.570> medical<00:01:30.140> grade

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
it's all basically medical grade

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.530 
it's all basically medical grade
aluminum<00:01:30.920> but<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.490> beauty<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.390> it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
aluminum but the beauty of this is it

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.960 
aluminum but the beauty of this is it
has<00:01:32.570> this<00:01:32.960> inner<00:01:33.260> ring<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:34.070> now<00:01:34.370> why<00:01:34.610> does<00:01:34.820> it

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
has this inner ring and now why does it

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.180 
has this inner ring and now why does it
have<00:01:35.120> that<00:01:35.300> inner<00:01:35.540> ring<00:01:35.780> because<00:01:36.409> our<00:01:36.590> systems

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
have that inner ring because our systems

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.030 
have that inner ring because our systems
are<00:01:37.400> designed<00:01:37.790> with<00:01:37.940> great<00:01:38.680> airflow<00:01:39.680> and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
are designed with great airflow and

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.220 
are designed with great airflow and
negative<00:01:40.520> airflow<00:01:40.909> that<00:01:41.090> means<00:01:41.330> less<00:01:41.960> air

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
negative airflow that means less air

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.380 
negative airflow that means less air
comes<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:42.980> is<00:01:43.130> pulled<00:01:43.430> out<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.030> what<00:01:44.210> that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
comes in that is pulled out so what that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.210 
comes in that is pulled out so what that
would<00:01:44.510> normally<00:01:44.690> do<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.230> cause<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.770> tent<00:01:46.040> to

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
would normally do is cause the tent to

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.610 
would normally do is cause the tent to
suck<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.060> metal<00:01:47.390> ring<00:01:47.600> around<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.140> center

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
suck in the metal ring around the center

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.060 
suck in the metal ring around the center
of<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.070> grow<00:01:49.250> tube<00:01:49.550> holds<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.600> tent<00:01:50.900> in<00:01:51.140> shape

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
of the grow tube holds the tent in shape

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.340 
of the grow tube holds the tent in shape
so<00:01:52.400> they<00:01:52.580> won't<00:01:52.820> suck<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:53.420> from<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.870> negative

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
so they won't suck in from the negative

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.469 
so they won't suck in from the negative
air<00:01:54.590> pressure<00:01:54.620> with<00:01:55.250> regards<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:55.880> grow<00:01:56.210> tube

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
air pressure with regards to grow tube

wires out for in this case the air pump
for<00:03:21.320> your<00:03:21.470> hydro<00:03:21.830> tub<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.489> cinch<00:03:22.820> that<00:03:22.880> tight

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
for your hydro tub you cinch that tight

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.289 
for your hydro tub you cinch that tight
so<00:03:23.600> no<00:03:23.750> light<00:03:23.989> comes<00:03:24.290> in<00:03:24.530> or<00:03:24.800> goes<00:03:24.860> out<00:03:25.400> on<00:03:25.640> the

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
so no light comes in or goes out on the

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.110 
so no light comes in or goes out on the
bottom<00:03:27.049> left<00:03:27.410> here<00:03:27.860> is<00:03:28.070> your<00:03:28.310> intake<00:03:28.790> fan

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
bottom left here is your intake fan

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.830 
bottom left here is your intake fan

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
which is a 120 CFM intake fan and that

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.320 
which is a 120 CFM intake fan and that
is<00:03:32.959> married<00:03:33.380> together<00:03:33.769> with<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.070> 190<00:03:34.910> exhaust

is married together with a 190 exhaust

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.479 
is married together with a 190 exhaust
so<00:03:36.019> what<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.320> does<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.860> we<00:03:37.010> call<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:37.430> the

molecule<00:06:10.129> of<00:06:10.610> air<00:06:10.819> that<00:06:10.999> goes<00:06:11.180> in<00:06:11.449> to<00:06:11.719> the<00:06:11.870> grow

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
molecule of air that goes in to the grow

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.249 
molecule of air that goes in to the grow
tube<00:06:12.319> will<00:06:12.620> go<00:06:12.830> out<00:06:13.039> through<00:06:13.819> this<00:06:14.120> at<00:06:14.599> raptor

tube will go out through this at raptor

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:16.989 
tube will go out through this at raptor
odor<00:06:15.439> control<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:16.009> the<00:06:16.099> reason<00:06:16.399> is<00:06:16.550> is<00:06:16.789> this

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:16.999 
odor control and the reason is is this

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:21.670 
odor control and the reason is is this
is<00:06:17.180> sucking<00:06:17.629> air<00:06:17.839> out<00:06:17.870> at<00:06:19.029> 196<00:06:20.029> CFM<00:06:20.749> when<00:06:21.499> you

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
is sucking air out at 196 CFM when you

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.860 
is sucking air out at 196 CFM when you
have<00:06:21.949> the<00:06:22.249> grow<00:06:22.550> tube<00:06:22.819> completely<00:06:23.300> closed

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
have the grow tube completely closed

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.549 
have the grow tube completely closed
there's<00:06:24.139> only<00:06:24.490> 120<00:06:25.490> CFM<00:06:26.089> of<00:06:26.300> air<00:06:26.870> going<00:06:27.199> in<00:06:27.349> so

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:27.559 
there's only 120 CFM of air going in so

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:30.189 
there's only 120 CFM of air going in so
that<00:06:27.680> is<00:06:27.889> perfect<00:06:28.430> negative<00:06:29.059> pressure<00:06:29.599> so

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
that is perfect negative pressure so

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.019 
that is perfect negative pressure so
that<00:06:30.229> means<00:06:30.589> all<00:06:30.889> of<00:06:30.919> the<00:06:31.129> volume<00:06:31.610> of<00:06:31.759> the<00:06:31.879> air

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
that means all of the volume of the air

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:33.820 
that means all of the volume of the air
that<00:06:32.209> goes<00:06:32.270> anywhere<00:06:32.809> near<00:06:33.139> the<00:06:33.409> grow<00:06:33.589> tube

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
that goes anywhere near the grow tube

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.589 
that goes anywhere near the grow tube
whether<00:06:34.069> it<00:06:34.219> goes<00:06:34.370> in<00:06:34.550> through<00:06:34.759> the<00:06:34.879> fan<00:06:35.120> or

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
whether it goes in through the fan or

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.239 
whether it goes in through the fan or
one<00:06:35.839> of<00:06:35.959> the<00:06:36.050> vents<00:06:36.379> which<00:06:36.529> are<00:06:36.709> closed<00:06:37.009> at

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:37.249 
one of the vents which are closed at

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:39.070 
one of the vents which are closed at
this<00:06:37.430> time<00:06:37.699> it<00:06:38.089> will<00:06:38.240> all<00:06:38.419> come<00:06:38.449> out<00:06:38.809> through

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
this time it will all come out through

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.499 
this time it will all come out through
the<00:06:39.229> filter<00:06:39.620> basically<00:06:40.159> creating<00:06:40.999> an<00:06:41.180> odor

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
the filter basically creating an odor
