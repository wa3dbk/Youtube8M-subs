00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello to you channel gta fan club 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.470
 online and and it will be the same glich 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.240
 for money only in the updated version 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.889
 many did not understand him in the comments 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.910
 most don't read them and that's why i 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.980
 easier to lay out again and this glitch them 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 write in Komi in the comments in general 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.640
 coils in the docks 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 this is not a required task 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 choose any race even somewhere on 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.130
 30 people no matter after which we still 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.590
 found the same less glitch which 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 help you how do you know that when you 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.170
 bet on 8 people 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.370
 the task is the bet only plays on 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.180
 60,000 but let's talk about this a bit later 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.489
 so for that you need at least 21,000 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.469
 pockets not in the bank account exactly 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.079
 on pockets so how can you not then 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.239
 bet after what you bet 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.399
 10 thousand on themselves and 10,000 on 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.329
 certain person to whom 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 select it and so does each 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.190
 a man from your team that is to put 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.830
 on ourselves and here now let's say in our 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.790
 case it will be the sea 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.740
 after which I said that 60,000 is 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.520
 maximum amount that can 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.130
 to put 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200
 but we found this mini if ​​this bug 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.570
 how do we get around this ie five people 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.610
 can be set to 50,000 was generally in 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.720
 any time that is he constantly himself and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.960
 immediately put the top ten on the winner 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.360
 the rest should take at the same time 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.610
 agree to deliver 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.860
 at the same time again at this man and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.360
 then if you succeed in rebuilding 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.409
 play as you see in our case on 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.479
 80,000 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.930
 if it doesn't work at all 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.240
 scary scary just clean 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.799
 bet again clean bet bet 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.200
 and while there you have a certain 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.450
 time i think you make it up for it 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.159
 time and if you succeed you 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.799
 put 80,000 and thereby earn 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.469
 and do not know the maximum amount of money 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.390
 for this race just for eight people 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.219
 limb you will be there more then already 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 there will be a completely different amount but we 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.060
 Now we are considering an option from eight 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.940
 people so the scheme too 1 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.030
 invigorating from left to right the first row then 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.250
 second row then third and so on 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 you can fight in any wall even to the left 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.110
 even to the right even from a motorcycle 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.880
 not important just to stand and freeze 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.340
 do nothing this is also not necessary 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.750
 there can be twisted is poshlifovat 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.560
 also no matter what you remember 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.080
 on my video we got a man 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:45.230
 -20 because of what is happening to you now 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.390
 explain he did so he fell from 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.910
 motorcycle without driving the rest 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.819
 participants, he thus did not break out on 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.010
 first position you definitely need 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.620
 break out initially to first position a 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.170
 only then he fall there in this 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.709
 case the video did not do it and got those 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.989
 the most minus 20 thousand winner is another 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.849
 here is this updated chip that here 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.220
 the winner is not necessarily impaled 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.590
 put all this money is not necessary 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.180
 that he should come first this 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.940
 absolutely no difference 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.820
 even better know how to use it 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.320
 also works like pumping exactly 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.500
 on victory if you need to pump 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.690
 engines 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.390
 there are different transmissions here this 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.220
 chrome color just 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.819
 agree which one of you will win 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.620
 who needs it those opening parts he 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.230
 will win and thereby earn 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.359
 victories and there in my opinion how many 50 victories 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.019
 or some 40 already do not remember what 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:48.709
 this is a long time ago , and thus you 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:53.340
 You can also open these parts and 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:56.549
 total we have 120 thousand for a fall plus 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.019
 minus 20 thousand headband and that 100 thousand 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.489
 clean turned out you liked 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.569
